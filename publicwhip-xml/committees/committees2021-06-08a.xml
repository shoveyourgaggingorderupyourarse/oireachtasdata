Deputy Emer Higgins will substitute for him.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice not to comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contributions to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p>We have convened to resume consideration of Committee Stage of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.  I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  If Committee Stage proceedings have not concluded by 12.30 p.m., it is proposed that the meeting will adjourn at that time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Before beginning, I will address a letter sent to the committee that was reported on in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>relating to the proposed construction of a liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility.  I would like to clarify a number of points.  Deputy Whitmore's amendments were ruled out of order last week as they were outside the scope of the Bill.  I have never sought to hide the fact I worked for Arup and it is clearly stated on my LinkedIn profile.  Arup has somewhere in the region of 1,000 employees in Ireland and I never had anything to do with Arup's work on the proposed LNG plant.  I did not even become aware that Arup was working on this project until after I left the company.  Any suggestion of a conflict of interest on my part is, frankly, ridiculous.  The Green Party, including me, has campaigned vigorously against the import of fracked gas and LNG.  The Government recently published a clear and unambiguous statement on fracked gas and LNG, and it has also committed to working on an outright ban at EU level.</p><p>On the ruling of certain amendments out of order, in making these rulings I was acting on the advice of the Oireachtas officials and this advice is strictly in compliance with Standing Orders.  These are the only criteria used in ruling amendments out of order.</p></speech>

The equation we have is lopsided at the minute.  It considers emissions but is not yet sophisticated enough to account for the carbon sinks and the sequestration.  I am referring particularly to agriculture and other areas that have been doing this work for years and decades.  People are frustrated that it is not adequately taken into account at this point in time.  The fear is that decisions will be made that are not well informed and that do not account for the level of positive work happening in that sector and other sectors as well.  There is also a point there about the degree to which we are in a position at this point in time to appropriately and adequately assess emissions and the level of sequestration.</p></speech>

The national climate objective provides in section 3(1), that emissions will be "...balanced or exceeded by [their] removal".  The climate action plan is a mechanism to achieve the national climate objective.  Section 4(2)(a) sets out that the plan will be consistent with the carbon budget programme.  We must absolutely include sequestration and plan for that but that has been done successfully in the Bill so I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

In creating a climate action plan each year, the Minister will have to set out proposals for how it will support them.</p><p> Unfortunately, the amendment has been neutered, given that our amendment on just transition principles, which is referred to in the amendment before us, was rejected last week.  Nevertheless, I am happy to press the amendment and hear why the Minister does not want to include this one either.  We believe this amendment will strengthen the Bill.  It is not pie in the sky stuff but pragmatic.  It is reasonable and has been included in Bills in other jurisdictions.  It is a practical way to start implementing the just transition, rather than just paying lip service to it.  If there is a legal requirement to include the impact a decision will have on communities, an impact assessment will have to be undertaken in advance, and this can inform mitigation measures that can be included.  At the previous meeting, the issue of just transition was the one we brought to a vote and that was for a reason.  I firmly believe there are really strong political reasons to include this and even stronger environmental, moral and ethical reasons to do so.  It should be supported and I am interested in hearing the Minister's response.</p></speech>

We have agreed on section 4(8)(k), which sets out a requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy that endeavours, as far as practicable, to maximise employment opportunities and support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.  I think that is the appropriate place to put that requirement.  As an indication of that commitment, work is starting in the midlands and three reports have to date been prepared by Kieran Mulvey.  It is the start of a much wider application of our delivery on that legislative commitment, as I said in our previous discussions, to look at how we can broaden that.  I refer also to the work being done by the National Economic and Social Council's secretariat and the extended period of social dialogue we will need in order to meet this objective.</p> <p>  The legislative requirement is clear.  It is contained in the Bill and, therefore, I will not support the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that the principles of a just transition are contained in the Bill but they are absolutely not.  A just transition is referred to once in the entire Bill, and there is no definition of it or guidance as to what it means.  This is a golden opportunity to incorporate it fully into the Bill and ensure we will meet our targets in a fair manner.  I do not agree with the Minister that it has been incorporated.  One reference is not sufficient.</p> <p>  Moreover, the thing about a just transition is that we have to be proactive with it.  It cannot come after the actions and targets are in place.  A proactive, targeted and focused approach needs to be taken, and it cannot happen after the fact because it will not happen properly.  A reactive transition is not a good transition and it will not happen organically.  In order to ensure the transition is done in a fair and just manner, we need to plan for it, and this amendment sets out how that can happen.  If something cannot be measured, it cannot be addressed.  The first step that needs to be taken is there needs to be an active analysis of which sectors and communities will be impacted and how they will be impacted, with plans set out to ensure that their needs will be met and that the direction of every Government policy will not undermine the right of those communities and those workers to access a just transition.</p> <p>  This is a really important initiative.  The Minister has been referring frequently during this debate to the just transition commissioner in the midlands.  The work he is doing is valuable but it has to be broader than that.  Not just one specific area will be impacted but everyone will be.  I have just read in my local newspaper in Wicklow that one of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues is quoted as stating that the Bill should not impact on and undermine farmers in Wicklow.  The way to ensure that is to ensure a just transition because a just transition does not relate just to Bord na M&oacute;na workers but to the majority of our communities, and to farming communities as well.  For the farming community, analysis needs to be carried out on how the obligations that will arise out of us meeting our targets could impact on them and how we can ensure they are not negatively impacted.</p> <p>  The amendment is really important.   Despite the continuing references to them, two words in the Bill is not sufficient.  The Bill will fall foul of the Government not incorporating and taking into account all communities in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#C00400"><p>I favour the Minister's approach over the alternative here.  The amendment gives the impression that much of this change is avoidable and that we can start to assess in an academic way the impacts on different sectors.  It suggests that if we think they are too great, there is some way in which we can prevent them or insulate against them.  We have to have a dialogue of the sort the Minister has set out in the section.  We are talking about creating a vision of a different, albeit prosperous, future for many of these sectors, and we are in a position where there is an imperative to change.</p> <p>  The concept of a just transition goes through the Government's entire approach.  Under the heading, Mission: A Green New Deal, in the programme for Government, a just transition is set out in several sections, including a commitment to publishing a just transition plan and establishing a permanent commission for a just transition.  There is a recognition that a just transition will go to the core of the work here.  The section before us sets out that one of the conditions to which the Government and the Minister must have regard is the requirement for a just transition to a climate-neutral economy to maximise employment opportunities and to support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.</p> <p>  It goes to the heart of the Bill to create an environment where we deliver change that, unfortunately, we do not have the choice of considering whether we will or will not deliver.  We have to make change but, more important, we have to create the vision of an alternative future that is prosperous for farmers.  If we wait and allow an environment to develop whereby people feel we can put off change until another day, we will do a disservice to those very sectors and communities we are trying to support.  The key is the dialogue the Minister underpins in the section, with the creation of a better and more prosperous sector if it is climate resilient and sustainable in its use of resources and has anticipated the negative impacts, and that that is supported by the just transition strategy set out in section 4(8)(k).  While I can sympathise with people feeling they are threatened, the process we are in has to be about divining that new future, not analysing where we are now and hoping we can in some way prevent change happening, or wholly compensate people for everything that might change in that environment.</p> <p>  This transition is unavoidable.  The tone of the alternative being offered, compared with what the Minister has set out, is too static.</p><p>It pretends we can stay where we are, take the time to reflect on many sectoral impacts and then decide whether to make change.  We are past that period.  The challenge is to work with communities to find this alternative future, which I am convinced is there.  The sooner we start to create it, the sooner we will be on a path to sustainable prosperity.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton said just transition appears throughout the programme for Government.  That is great but it led to an expectation that when foundational legislation such as this, which we all agree is important, was introduced, we would see what was in the programme for Government reflected therein.  We do not see it reflected to the extent we are comfortable or confident it will make a big difference.  That is where we are coming form.  Nobody wants to delay this Bill; we just want to improve it.</p> <p>  After last week, the fact these amendments will not be accepted has taken much of the air out of this committee process.  Much of the dialogue I had over the weekend with stakeholders reflected that.  It is disappointing that neither the amendments nor variations thereof will be accepted.  Nobody is protective of the exact wording.  We just want to see progress on this.  The programme for Government will remain an aspirational document until it is reflected in legislation and other actions by Government and we do not see that in this, as currently presented and debated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#D00300"><p>I am disappointed the amendment is not being accepted.  We need to be reasonable and sensible, weigh up everything and make sure there is thorough assessment and evaluation.  There have been several mentions of just transmission but I can tell the committee from one of the counties most affected, namely Offaly, that it is far from just.  County Offaly will bear the brunt of the greatest job losses, with 53% of all job losses in the midlands occurring in that county.  Not one job has been created.  It is all very well to speak when one is detached from something but I am on the ground speaking to workers and communities day in, day out.</p> <p>  The just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, has been mentioned.  He does not even have the sole responsibility or focus of the transition in the midlands.  He has now been given a role to examine public pay disputes, I believe.  That says it all about the lack of respect for a county that will be seriously damaged, as well as the midlands region, by a transition that is not just.  We were told we had until 2030 to transition.  I am dealing with very upset workers and families who do not know how long they have in their job or what the future holds and have not been presented with alternatives.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, they are the facts.  I wish it was more positive but it is not.  These people have bills and mortgages to pay.  It is unacceptable and shows how detached some politicians are from the real life struggles of people, families and workers.  The decent and right thing to do would be to ensure an assessment is done.  It will be too late when the fallout happens.  Unfortunately, I believe that will happen because politicians, including the Minister, are just not listening.  It is unacceptable that the just transition commissioner has been pulled and given another responsibility.  That needs to be known and exposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#D00400"><p>I have listened to contributors on what is in the legislation.  It is all well and good to talk about just transition but we have to look at the practical realities.  The form in this regard is not good.  One only has to look at the series of reports produced by the just transition commissioner.  He has made quite a number of policy recommendations that are being ignored by Government at the moment.</p><p>We talk about working with communities and then we leave communities to their own devices.  In terms of the grant aid given to date, which is welcome, communities have to come up with matching funding.  How will they come up with matching funding for a large proportion of funding when they have no ability to fundraise at the moment?  In theory, we are working with communities; in practice, it is not happening on the ground.</p><p>Let us reflect on the record in respect of seasonal workers in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It was evident from the December before last that we would have a serious situation regarding those workers.  They still do not know what is going on, 18 months later.  How can there be a just transition when a key part of the workforce in Bord na M&oacute;na still does not know what is going on or what role it will play in this?  That is the litmus test.  </p><p>I accept the legislation sets out in section 4(8)(k):</p> <blockquote> 	the requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy which endeavours, in so far as is practicable, to&mdash;<br /><br />(i) maximise employment opportunities, and<br /><br />(ii) support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition; </blockquote> <p>I accept that principle is set out in the legislation.  However, section 4(8) states: &quot;For the purposes of performing their respective functions under this section, the Minister and the Government shall have regard to...&quot;.  Once the Minister and Government of the day has regard to a just transition and ticks that particular box, then they comply with this legislation.  We have a perverse situation in this legislation where there is no recourse to the D&aacute;il one it is enacted.  The Government of the day, once it ticks the box regarding just transition, can do whatever it likes.  That is not right.</p><p>The difficulty is as we have seen relates to rural-proofing.  Every memorandum that goes to Cabinet must be rural-proofed but that is a box-ticking exercise that takes place after the memo has been drafted.  When it goes to the Department of the Taoiseach, then and only then is it rural-proofed.  It is rural-proofed in name only, rather than in practice.  A litany of policy programmes have come forward since rural-proofing of all Cabinet memorandums came into place, which have had a devastating impact on rural communities.  Yet, such policies were rural-proofed.  The same applies to what is presented here.  Once the box-ticking exercise relating to just transition is complied with, the D&aacute;il has no role or function in this whatsoever.  It is wrong.  We will come to the D&aacute;il's function later and it should have a function and role in monitoring the enactment and implementation of this legislation.  As currently drafted, that is not there and I hope the Minister will make that small concession.  Biogenic methane should be treated as something very distinct and the broader issue tabled by this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.</p></speech>

It is also in regard to the sectoral plan, to respond to Deputy Whitmore and 6C(10) specifies the same requirements in terms of the sectoral plan.  Similarly, right across the legislation in setting a climate strategy, we also have to have regard to European regulations which require us to show the socioeconomic strategy behind that climate strategy.  At every stage in the process, we must check to see if it meets our social as well as our environmental and economic objectives.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Nolan, I absolutely accept that we must be effective on the ground in delivering.  We have committed significant resources.  If I add it up, I think over &euro;150 million is targeted at the midlands to ensure that we do not leave people behind, that we do create new employment opportunities in retrofitting in Bord na M&oacute;na itself, in rewetting bogs and using some of the skills in the many projects that have been supported coming out of those reports.  It has taken time to get the European state aid approval in some of those but that is done now and I expect a huge number of community projects to be up and running very quickly to help make the transition happen.  It will continue to evolve.  Further European funding will become available to support a just transition.  Offaly County Council, particularly, will work on disbursing those funds.  Critically, the next phase of the just transition process will engage with the likes of the National Economic and Social Council as to how we spread this approach, not only in the midlands but in other parts of the country.  That is central to the work the Government is doing.  The legislation recognises that, and to my mind, defines the requirement in the right way.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

He referred to 6C(10).  The problem is that it says "shall have regard to".  There is no legal compliance on the Government of the day once it has regard to.  That is how rural proofing is being done at the moment which is being implemented in principle, all right, but not in practice.  The difficulty with this legislation is that there is no recourse to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann once it is enacted.  I wanted to reiterate that point again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#E00300"><p>There is still reference to the programme for Government in how we deal with this stuff.  It was an issue for us during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  The programme for Government is policy for the current Government.  Once this Government falls, that policy will be gone.  I honestly believe the Minister wants to see this Bill through and wants to achieve what is necessary but we need to make sure that this Bill is strong and that no matter who the next Minister is or his or her views, this Bill will still get us to our targets.  I have major reservations about the continual reference to the programme for Government and how it will set the direction.  It is a policy document, it is fluid and has no requirements.  Only by placing things in the legislative framework will we achieve what we need to achieve.</p></speech>

This is not a non-statutory promise of the sort Deputy Whitmore describes, it is an institutional arrangement that will be at the heart of planning.  I can understand Deputy Naughten saying that phrases such as "have regard to" would appear to offer Ministers the potential to disregard those were they not of a mood but that is clearly not the case when one puts into permanent statutory form a just transition commissioner, when one has a plan that sets it out and when one complements that with this Bill.  There is undoubtedly an obligation on any Minister that occupies the current Minister's position, to take a view of the same kind that we must endeavour, insofar as is practicable.  That is the highest bar that one ever sees in legislation, one never sees deliver because obviously there are restraints which Ministers must apply to so that they do everything that they could within their power.  That is what "insofar as practicable" means in legislative terms.  The combination of this Bill and the other Bill that is coming up the tracks provides the belt and braces that Deputies are looking for here.  One cannot put everything into this Bill.  Deputies have to acknowledge that there is a second Bill that will be dealing in a much more comprehensive way with the institutions and there will be a subsequent just transition plan that will create a broader framework.  Against that background, the Minister's approach is very reasonable.</p></speech>

It is a wish list of the current three Government partners.  We need to ensure that it happens and we can do that by including it in this legislation.</p> <p>  The legislation can set the bar high and say that something must be achieved and delivered.  The Minister has amended this Bill to say that they will achieve carbon neutrality so it can and does happen.</p></speech>

It is that wording that ensures that this entire Bill is justiciable and has real strength to meet its provisions.  There will be an ongoing, continuing Oireachtas involvement as the delivery on the climate plan is reviewed and, I expect, analysed by this committee more than any other, as we prepare budgets and so on.  The Oireachtas will be involved at every stage.  That has been a strength of our process in recent years.  Again, I cannot accept the amendment.  I believe we are committed in the legislation as well as in the programme for Government.  Deputy Whitmore is right that it is a separate political document but the legislation is equally strong in the commitment to the just transition.</p></speech>

Obviously, they are supported by a number of Deputies of different persuasions.</p> <p>  It is about tightening up and trying to address the get-out clauses, for want of a better term, of the current Bill.  The phrase, "in the Minister's opinion" is wide-ranging and vague.  It is not entirely clear how accountability will be achieved.  Also, it will vary, by definition, depending on the Minister holding office.  </p> <p>  I presume the other Deputies who submitted the amendment are coming from the same position.  From my perspective, it is about tightening up the language in order that there is a clearer line of accountability and that the legislation can be used as a tool for accountability and provide clarity in terms of decision-making and accountability.</p></speech>

One of the issues that emerged from the pre-legislative scrutiny was the looseness of the language and the flexibility within it.  The more flexibility within legislation, the more problematic it is.  Therefore, it is important that we tighten up on that language, as Deputy O'Rourke stated, and ensure that there is accountability.  We are tight for time so I will not continue.</p></speech>

Actually, accountability does reside with the Minister.  If we did not use that wording in the relevant sections, accountability with lie with the administrative side.  In my mind, that would weaken the legislation.  We have to recognise that there is political accountability in the end, and that responsibility to prepare and present the relevant plans lies with whosoever is Minister.  I stand up for political accountability.  It resides in the political system and not in the administrative system.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

The same arguments that were made before apply in respect of this provision.  To echo the points made after the previous discussion, it is not good enough for the Minister to come here to discuss amendments and point to the programme for Government or other policy statements and commitments outside of it.  We are arguing for these amendments to be made to this legislation for a reason, that is, that they will strengthen the Bill and it is the right place for them to be included.  The suggestion that the amendments are motivated by an element of deflection and distraction, or not recognising the climate challenge and that we all have a level of lifting to do, is simply untrue.  I certainly can say that in respect of the amendments we have submitted and I see the same in terms of proposals brought forward by a number of colleagues.</p><p>The principles in regard to just transition are largely lifted from legislation elsewhere, where others in the same position as the Minister and the Government have viewed the arguments very differently.  Specifically, they have viewed them from the perspective of the need to show very clearly that the conversations and decisions around where the burden and the opportunity will fall, and the process for having those conversations, will sit within a frame that is clear, robust and acknowledges that just transition must be a primary focus and concern.  Without saying much more, this amendment stands on its merit, as did our previous amendments.  I ask the Minister to accept it or, at the very least, take on board everything he is hearing at these sessions in terms of how much more needs to be done to improve the just transition element of the Bill, for the reasons set out by me and others.</p></speech>

The Bill will be coming back to this committee for extensive work in terms of its delivery.</p> <p>  I want to give more detail on a point to which I referred earlier.  Section 4(6)(b) of the 2015 Act, as amended by section 6 of this Bill, specifies that in preparing the long-term climate action strategy, we must take into account Article 15 of EU Regulation No. 1999/2018.  The legislative context in everything we do on climate is that it is underpinned by European regulations, which give our provisions legislative strength.  In the annexe setting out how we will deliver on Article 15, it is clear that we must, in setting out our strategies for European legislation, outline the socioeconomic impacts and the sectoral plans in real detail.  The strategy we draft will be backed up not just by Irish legislation but by European legislation.  Those sectoral and socioeconomic impacts, and the requirement to present them, give us the other structures for just transition, as well as the exceptions I referred to in this Bill.  We will be looking at this as a social transition as well as an environmental one.</p> <p>  I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  However, the Deputy, his party and others will be involved in ensuring that European as well as national legislation is implemented.</p></speech>

It comes back to the fundamental issue that once this legislation is enacted, while the committee will have a role in terms of consultation and consideration, it will have no role in setting down and approving whatever targets are set across the different sectors.  The Minister and Government of the day will, in effect, make those decision without their having to be approved or ratified by the D&aacute;il.  It is frustrating that we are enacting legislation on the basis of what the Minister is saying, that is, that once it is enacted, the European Commission will have a role in considering and approving our targets, including our sectoral targets, and the impact of those targets, whereas D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will have no role in it.  Although the committee will be consulted and its considerations taken into account, the Government of the day will ultimately make the decision and that decision will not have to be ratified by the D&aacute;il.  This is an issue we will discuss again later.  At the very minimum, the Minister should accept Deputy O'Rourke's amendment.</p></speech>

The essence of all our amendments is trying to frame exactly what is meant by just transition.  It is not only in the midlands but all over the country that good, well-paid jobs are needed.  Just transition affects every aspect of what we are doing.  We are going through a complete change from the old way to a new way.  It is like a patient facing a heart transplant.  He or she will survive and thrive if the apparatus can support him or her in moving from the old system to the new.</p><p>Without a just transition as that apparatus, we are not going to bring the people with us.  The Minister should reconsider the amendment.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, we will push it to a vote.</p></speech>

This is an opportunity for the Government to show leadership in regard to how we are going to meet our climate targets, and a just transition is a key component of that.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the amendment because this has been a key ask of civil society groups, the committee and all the experts who appeared before the committee to give evidence.  There is a cross-party Opposition consensus that we need to include it.  We do not want the Government to be dragged kicking and screaming into this arena.  We want leadership and the Government to be proactive with it, take the concerns of communities on board and ensure that a just transition is a key component in how we meet our climate obligations.</p></speech>

We politicians have a role in delivering a just transition.  As Deputy Nolan said, we often have a connection to and understanding of what is happening on the ground.  We have a role in balancing the public interest in regard to the socioeconomic effects of legislative and other measures.  I am sure we will come to this later when we debate other amendments but in the context of the provisions for climate reporting, it is clear that Ministers will have to present and set out on a sectoral basis how we are complying with the targets.  Where we are failing to comply, we will have to set out measures through which we will address that.  That is the crux of the legislation.  If the targets are not being delivered, the Oireachtas has the ability to check and change.</p> <p>  The European legislation does not undermine the national Legislature but just backs it up or enhances the point I am making.  The annexe to Article 15 that we have included in this legislation provides that we will have to examine the likes of rural development effects, agricultural policies and the socioeconomic impact.  That is all provided for and that is the scientific basis on which we can make judgment calls regarding the delivery of a just transition.  That legislation supports rather than undermines the Oireachtas's role.  Accordingly, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister has said that just transition has been incorporated but I am interested to know under what definition the Minister intends the Bill to operate.

Will he give it any formalisation in the document other than noting it?</p><p>I will not press the amendment because, to be honest, I know it will not be accepted and it is academic.

What we want to do is maximise employment opportunities but it is not just about employment.  It is also about recognising that some persons and communities will be negatively affected by the transition and the requirement to recognise this and support those communities.  I do not think is possible to specifically define what the supports will be or how we will do this because there is such variety and such different circumstances.  It is about supporting communities that may be negatively affected.  This is the core of the just transition.</p></speech>

Even under the Minister's own admission this is within the remit of the Bill.  I am still confused and I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to get the rationale on why these amendments have been ruled out of order because of a money message or being out of scope of the Bill.  I would like the Minister's view on this.  A few minutes ago, he said the social element is a key factor in this.  I do not know how this can be ruled out of order.</p></speech>

While I fully accept the overall thrust behind the legislation and the need for it, in some ways I am envious of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, being able to get a Bill such as this through.  It is imperative, for all of the arguments that have been made by committee members during the previous two sessions and this morning, that there is recourse to the national Parliament on all of these targets and their implementation.</p><p>Deputies Whitmore, O'Rourke and Nolan spoke earlier about the need for a just transition.  That needs to be reflected in the implementation of this legislation.  However, there is no mechanism for the D&aacute;il to review its implementation on an ongoing basis.  There is a reporting mechanism back to the committee and provision for consideration and consultation with the committee but there is no formal ratification process once this legislation is enacted in terms of the five-year targets and, more importantly, with respect to the sectoral implementation plans.</p><p> The Chairman and his colleagues published a report last week on how we could reach a 51% reduction in transport emissions between now and 2030 and he is to be commended on that.  If, however, what the Government is saying and has consistently said in terms of agriculture is accurate, the 51% reduction in emissions within the transport sector falls far short of what will be required.  I do not know what the sectoral targets will be.  We should have that level of clarity before we enact this legislation but at a minimum, that should come back before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification.  That is a specific provision in my later amendments, which we will consider when we reach them.  However, this amendment proposes that the climate plan would have to be formally adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This climate plan must take into account, as set out in the legislation, both the national planning framework and the national spatial strategy, both of which must be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, yet the climate plan does not have to be formally approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> We can talk about all the big bold measures we like but, realistically, we must bring the public and our citizens with us along that road if we are to turn around the challenge we face of global warming.  That is the one aspect of this debate that sadly has been lacking for a long time.  Legislating the National Parliament out of the approval and ratification process will further alienate the public, cause them to disengage and lead to reactions to measures, rather than people acting in solidarity to achieve the overall objective.  I ask the Minister and colleagues to support this amendment.</p></speech>

We have to set an objective.  The advisory council sets out budgets as to how we will achieve that.  We will keep assessing them and reviewing it.  We set out a strategy to deliver on those budgets and a plan.  It is not only at the plan review stage the Oireachtas will have a critical role.  It will also have a role, as provided in section 6B(7) which states: "Where a carbon budget is approved by the Government ... the Minister shall cause a copy of the carbon budget to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which shall consider the carbon budget as soon as may be, and the carbon budget shall have effect from a date on which a motion approving the carbon budget has been passed by the second such House."  The section also states where the motion is not approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas under subsection (7), the Minister shall have to have a period of two months to go back on an iterative process of reviewing it.  One could consider any one element and say such and such is not provided for in the Bill but one must consider the entire process.  It is an integrated process in which the Oireachtas has a key role.  If we were to remove the role of the Government to approve the plan, I note there is a later amendment proposing that the Government needs to have more involvement.  This is a complicated structure but that structure is set out.  It involves a role for the advisory council, the Government and, critically, the Oireachtas not only in reviewing the annual report but in approving the carbon budget.  That is the appropriate place to give the Oireachtas the key intervention.  Therefore, I do not support the amendment.</p></speech>

I fully accept this is a very complex structure.  I also fully accept and do not dispute there are various elements of consultation involved in it with the Climate Change Advisory Council, the committee, the public and so forth.  However, the only ratification role D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has is in approving the 2025 carbon budget.  It has no role in the 2030 carbon budget and the draft of the 2035 carbon budget.  In a perverse drafting of this legislation, if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the 2025 budget, the Minister can bring in whatever budget he or she likes after that within 60 days.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the carbon budget, it has no function or role regarding it.  It has no say whatsoever regarding the 2030 carbon budget, which is set in stone once this legislation is enacted, and it has the potential to amend the 2035 carbon budget.  However, at this stage we do not have the evidence to allow for us to amend that particular carbon budget, and that is the only role the D&aacute;il has.  If we reject it, we hand that power back to the Minister of the day regardless of what our objections are.  The Minister by presenting an alternative budget or the same budget again to Cabinet, will result in that budget automatically becoming law.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has no role whatsoever in ratifying the sectoral plans.  The Minister has given assurances regarding a just transition and I accept the sincerity with which they were given.  I full accept where he is coming from and I know his heart is in the right place in that regard, but the difficulty is that in five or ten years' time he may not be the Minister.  The Minister of the day may have a very different perspective.  We could have a Minister in office at that stage who is a climate change denier.  Such a Minister could effectively implement whatever he or she so wishes.  If the D&aacute;il rejects it, the Minister can bring in whatever he or she likes within 60 days and it automatically becomes law.  That is wrong.  The National Parliament must be involved in the approval of this.  Last week many colleagues engaged in heated debate on legislation on the health provision regarding Covid.  People argued the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing it.  We cannot argue that the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing those restrictions when in this legislation we are effectively giving a blank cheque to the Minister of the day to do whatever he or she wants - to divide up this carbon budget in whichever way he or she wants.  It is imperative there is a ratification process which must be either accepted or rejected by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann without any caveats that if we reject it, we have no further say in it.  I would plead with the Minister to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I appreciate them joining us from abroad.   We are in totally different time zones and I hope we did not get them out of bed too early.   </p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Dr. Downes to make an opening statement, followed by Professor Hymel, and finally Professor Cefai.   The statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.   Each member has a specific slot in which they can ask a question and the witnesses can reply.  Witnesses are probably aware that the committee will publish their opening statements on its website following this meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect of they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity as a witness who is physically present does.   Witnesses have already been advised of this issue.  I remind everybody of the long-standing practice.  </p> <p>  I call on Dr. Downes to make his opening statement, followed by the other witnesses, as I have outlined.  Dr. Downes has been locked out of the meeting, so we shall now start with Professor Hymel.  </p></speech>

Yet research conducted in countries around the world has consistently documented the negative impact of school bullying, especially on victims.  It can get under the skin and affect neuro-biological functioning.   Victims are at risk for depression, anxiety, and poor self-worth, challenges that often continue into adulthood.   They are more likely to consider suicide.  Far too many have found suicide to be their only option.   They at risk for later aggression, conduct problems and self-harm.  Understandably, victims are more disengaged from school and are more likely to be absent.   Academic performance suffers, and they are more likely to drop out of school early.   Children who bully others are also at risk for many of the same problems, but especially for aggressive and antisocial behaviour and delinquency, substance use, depression and anxiety.  Bullying can also become a generalised pattern of behaviour, with demonstrated links to later dating violence and criminality.   Even children who witness bullying are at risk, with evidence of feelings of helplessness, mental health difficulties, and suicidal ideation.   Given such evidence, it is critical that we address school bullying and I applaud the committee's efforts to do so but how can it be done?</p> <p>  Bullying is developmental.   It increases over the primary years, reaching a peak around grades eight to ten, and declines somewhat thereafter but never goes away.   As such, schools are an ideal place to address the problem, where we can reach the majority of our children early on and repeatedly.   Bullying is also context dependent.  The overall climate and social atmosphere of the school can either encourage or discourage bullying.   Indeed, certain subgroups are far more likely to be bullied, including racial and sexual minorities, immigrant youth and those with disabilities.  Bullying emerges within very complex social networks, with social status being a key motivating factor.   Educators need training to understand the group dynamics that underlie bullying and how they can best support vulnerable students.   Until recently, teacher education programmes have not provided such training, focusing primarily on academics.  </p> <p>  To date, several school-based programmes have been created that show some success in reducing bullying.  Although they share common elements, the diversity of approaches is important, each addressing particular contributing factors.  Still, there is no single programme that has been shown to stop school bullying.  Overall, research shows that school efforts to reduce bullying only does so by about 20%, with little evidence of effectiveness at the secondary level.  We can do better.  </p> <p>  Universal programmes aimed at all children are critical to develop pro-social behaviours and positive school cultures but they are not enough.  Given the documented consequences of bullying, we also need more targeted one-on-one interventions for those students who are most seriously impacted.  Indeed, the most effective programmes have been shown to be whole-school efforts with multiple foci, including both universal and targeted interventions.  My recommendation is that anti-bullying efforts be viewed as part of a larger mandate for schools and that schools promote social and emotional competencies, as well as academic skills.  In North America, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the positive, long-term impact of such programmes.  They teach basic pro-social skills, foster empathy, and promote acceptance and respect for others, thereby creating tolerant and inclusive classrooms.  These programmes not only reduce peer aggression and victimisation but help to create positive school climates that will not exacerbate the difficulties victimised students face.</p> <p>  Importantly, there are multiple ways through which educators can do this, allowing for flexibility and repetition with variation across the school years.</p><p>To address bullying effectively, we need to provide educators with the training they need.  Expanded training for counsellors is also needed for them to undertake targeted interventions and also to create better links to community-based mental health agencies.  Finally, ongoing assessment and evaluation are imperative to be sure that one's efforts are actually working. </p></speech>

Let us be clear, bullying is an issue that can cause anxiety, depression and self-harm and can impact on physical health.  It is also an adverse childhood experience.  It requires serious, sustained emotional counselling and therapeutic supports in schools, which we do not have in Ireland.  We need those supports at both primary and post-primary levels.  International research also highlights the point that victims of bullying tend to engage in cycles of self-blame, self-hate and a sense of hopelessness and fatalism.  We need to stop these cycles of despair early, with early intervention, through these emotional counselling and therapeutic supports.<br/><br/>On the issue of family dimensions, which is neglected in many policy aspects, I draw the members' attention to a systematic review undertaken by Lereya <i>et al.</i>of over 70 studies that indicate that negative parenting practices, destructive communication practices and violence in the home have an impact on bullying engagement.  Therefore we need to look at the family support services that I mentioned in respect of bullying.  International research also points to the significant importance of having interventions which are not only whole-school in their approach but also involve parents.  For example, Professor Donna Cross's work in Australia has highlighted the additional benefit of working with parents and not only taking a whole-school approach.  <br/><br/>On the issue of peer defenders or challengers, our report for the European Commission highlights a range of legal and psychological concerns with the active bystander approach, which encourages bystanders to actively stand up to the bully.  It is concerning from a legal perspective because it is reasonably foreseeable that the bully may retaliate against that peer defender or challenger, which puts them at risk of being bullied, with all the various long-term impacts associated with that.  Our report therefore highlights that it would be negligent to put schools in a position where they would be actively encouraging students to intervene as peer defenders.  That is not to undermine all of the excellent work on peer supports and student voices regarding bullying.  However, on that aspect, our report criticises the psychological focus.  There are many motivations that can explain why somebody may be a bullying perpetrator.  We cannot just assume that the esteem of the group is the only dimension to that.  There may also be long-term trauma and adverse child experiences for the perpetrator.  As Sourander's longitudinal study emphasised, an entrenched bullying perpetrator is a red flag that something is wrong.  Again that is an argument in favour of early intervention and the provision of emotional counselling and therapeutic support for the perpetrator.<br/><br/>Our report to the Commission emphasises the importance of the establishment of a national co-ordinating committee to drive these issues at a national level.  At a school level, a driving committee that is led by a champion is required.  It is notable that our own research of 2017 found that more than half of primary and secondary schools did not have a teacher designated as a champion to lead a whole-school bullying initiative, even though they were requested to do so by the bullying procedures.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#B00500"><p>There is growing recognition of social and emotional education as an aggression and bullying prevention strategy, contributing to a positive school culture where bullying is neither acceptable nor rewarding in any way.  The term "social and emotional education" refers to what we sometimes call life skills or soft skills.  In Ireland, I believe that it is referred to as social, personal and health education, SPHE.  It includes competences such as developing a positive healthy identity, managing emotions and achieving goals, solving problems effectively, feeling and showing empathy for others, establishing and maintaining healthy relationships, working with others as part of a team, resolving conflicts constructively and making responsible and ethical decisions.</p> <p>  There is strong international evidence that these competences learned at school, when supported by contextual processes, are key for personal development to challenge a culture of violence and bullying in schools.  We have research evidence, including a report which we produced for the European Commission, which shows that social and emotional education leads to decreased antisocial behaviours such as aggression, bullying, delinquency; decreased emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation; enhanced positive mental health and resilience; increased positive attitudes towards self and others; prosocial behaviour, such as sharing and collaboration; and improved academic achievement.</p> <p>  Together with my colleague, Dr. Paul Downes, and two other colleagues, we have developed a European framework on the basis of international literature on how social and emotional education may be effectively integrated in schools to promote positive development and mental health.  The whole-school systemic framework that we proposed underlines various processes which need to be in place for social and emotional education to have an impact on positive student outcomes.</p> <p>  In the limited time I have, I will briefly describe and make recommendations on two aspects of this framework.  First, there must be a curricular focus on social and emotional education, which includes direct instruction of social and emotional competences as a core content area on the timetable.  Of course, that resonates with, and relates to, SPHE in Ireland.  It also includes a transversal approach in which the social and emotional competences are embedded into the academic subjects, such as art, PE, science and language.  This focus mobilises the students&rsquo; psychological resources to challenge a culture of violence and bullying in school, with children less likely to be engaged or involved in bullying.  The curriculum needs to be in place from the early years up to high school level, adapted according to the local context, with an explicit focus on bullying intervention.</p> <p>  My first recommendation is that we need to bring social and emotional education to the fore of educational systems.  Often it finds itself in the background.  It needs to be brought in across all year groups, with sufficient time allocated to it on the timetable.  It is necessary to review whether, across the whole range of year groups, we need to increase the time dedicated to social and emotional education.</p> <p>  My second recommendation concerns the positive school climate, to which I previously referred.  This climate gives students the opportunity to observe social and emotional competences being practised  by adults and peers and to apply these skills themselves in the classroom in their learning and behaviour.  In such a climate, students feel safe and secure, they have a sense of belonging, understand and respect each other, empathise with the thoughts and feelings of others, build knowledge together, support and care for each other, resolve conflict constructively and make decisions responsibly.</p><p>It is difficult for bullying to thrive in such a context.</p><p> The teachers' own attitudes and behaviour serve as powerful role models in this respect.  For instance, it is important that teachers in their classroom management do not rely heavily on punitive coercive measures and do not bully or humiliate students themselves.  For instance, research shows us that bullying tends to be higher in schools where classroom teachers use authoritarian approaches and inflexible classroom management or where they are perceived by the students as being biased against particular groups of students.  This requires, however, that all teachers need to be adequately trained not only in teaching and implementing socio-emotional education but also in developing their own socio-emotional competences.  This is not just about social, personal and health education, SPHE, specialist teachers but about all teachers across the curriculum.  They need to have the competences to regulate their emotions, to work on their own biases and prejudices, to be empathetic, to embrace diversity, to work as part of a team with others, colleagues, parents and children, to resolve conflicts constructively, and to engage in instructional and restorative classroom management.</p><p> My second recommendation, therefore, is about teacher training, which is that we need to start at initial teacher education supported by continuing professional learning.  Teacher training programmes in higher education institutions need to include a competence framework that outlines the key competences teachers need to have to implement socio-emotional education effectively.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is, I believe, straightforward, concerns best practice, which is contained within this European framework, and it is a matter of putting it into play.  Within this State, could we do with a greater amount of gathering and monitoring of incidents of bullying just to see the particular type we are dealing with, whether that is based on gender, sexual orientation, race, family circumstances and probably many other types I have not even considered?  We then build that into what we need in respect of social and emotional education, particularly if that is SPHE.  Beyond that we need to ensure we include children, parents and teachers in that.  It is obviously vital young people are included in this part of the conversation.</p> <p>  A big issue for me with bullying is that we all understand the outworkings and how terrible it can be for particular children, and it can have a lifelong impact.  We also get scenarios where people transfer between being a bully and being bullied.  I got an understanding of what cognitive dissonance means, which is the idea that if I bully the other kid, I am not a bad person and I do it because he or she deserves it and it is not very serious in any event.  From the other end it is a case that they bully me and do so because I deserve it.  I imagine it is vital that that idea is built into any training programme and that people understand this, especially for parents, because parents are always afraid in the first instance that their children are being bullied and then that their child is engaged in bullying activity, which can happen to anybody.  Can I put those not-too-straightforward questions to the group, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shelley Hymel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#C00400"><p>The Deputy asked about different types of bullying and whether it is important to identify those types.  Research has been done and teachers and schools seem to be most concerned about physical and cyberbullying.  In fact what children tell us is the commonest types of bullying are much more subtle.  These are the social and relational types of bullying, the teasing etc.  These are difficult because they are in a kind of grey zone.  Teachers do not know if the children are teasing each other for fun or if they are really trying to publicly humiliate people.  It is useful to identify those but to target specific programmes at them does not seem to be critical.  We have to do the larger picture of trying to stop the whole thing.</p> <p>  As to the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on how children think, we know that children who bully others do something that is now being dubbed as moral disengagement.  They justify and rationalise that behaviour.  That has not been prioritised to date in the intervention although there are two promising studies showing now that simple additions of components of anti-bullying programmes that address moral disengagement and create empathy are very effective.  Both of those things are important, therefore.</p></speech>

It is important to note that bullying is not a static phenomenon in a school.  It can change over the school year.  I would very much encourage school-based surveys.  I have come across situations of surveys where you could have three fourth class groups, for example, one of which with very significant bullying issues and the other two without any significant issues at all.  The class-by-class granular analysis to document that, term by term, is an important dimension we need to have as part of the school co-ordinating committee.  It can fluctuate quite significantly.</p> <p>  The challenging of the deep-seated thought processes of some of the entrenched bullying perpetrators is an intensive support that is needed at times where there may be many reasons the person is putting up cognitive defences.  That needs an intensive relationship of trust built up over time to really explore the roots of why that person is engaging in bullying and for him or her to discover his or her own motivations in respect of the bullying situation.  This is not then just a glib once-off conversation.</p></speech>

Professor Hymel was in fact saying research shows us children&rsquo;s understanding of bullying is not always the same as others' understanding of bullying.  One way of working around that is the importance of including children in any exercise in identification of the conditions that are contributing to bullying and the sense that they make of those situations.  Children should be included in bullying interventions both in terms of the resources and the types of activities.  Research is very much showing that children are more likely to be engaged in resources where fellow children have been involved in co-creating.  Research shows children can provide us with very useful insights and materials on how to deal with and overcome bullying and we need to give them a say on the way forward in the initiatives we have to do.  This is not just an academic exercise by referring to the student council but real authentic participation.</p></speech>

Professor Cefai has given a certain indication as to how this can be dealt with.  How do you engage parents in this because this can be a real difficulty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#C00800"><p>I will begin the answer to that question and will then leave it to my other colleagues to continue.  From our report for the European Commission, we emphasise that a number of good practices have been found to be more effective and others which are less likely to engage parents.  Within a whole-school approach where we include all of the parents, there also needs to be a particular focus on the selected preventative approaches.  Those families and those parents where bullying is taking place or where their children have been engaged in bullying need to have a particular focus in our approaches.</p> <p>  Second, research shows very clearly that when we just provide information in a talk-down approach, those parents who we especially need to engage with do not engage with us.  We need to take an approach which is very much a sharing of our thoughts and resources together and to focus both on capacity building of the parents such as through parental education but also, and this is a very important part, to do it in an empowering rather than a talk-down way.   A further very important point is to have active parent participation.</p><p>It is not just providing information.  If there is a need to go to the parents, then we expect them to come to us.  The focus is more on community.</p></speech>

Trust building with some of the most alienated parents is a slow and difficult process but it needs family support centres as a dimension of that strategy, as well as parenting programmes, which gain credibility in the community by word of mouth.  Not all the parenting programmes have to be delivered on a school site.  They can be in community settings as well.</p> <p>  Again, we need a community dimension to this strategy.  Those parenting programmes are not just focusing on preventing bullying.  It is about a social and emotional education, as well as a culture shift.  There are interesting examples of that such as restorative practice approaches at community level that are well developed in many Irish contexts.  We need to seriously expand those dimensions.  It is not impossible but there certainly is a trust issue that needs to be bridged, which needs more than schools in that trust-building process.</p></speech>

There is also a more general point that parents are not often informed when bullying happens, meaning parents are often out of the picture completely.</p></speech>

While accepting that the idea is to stop the bullying, can we build in an element of protection for those kids who do suffer it?</p></speech>

We have the benefit of some international experience through Professor Hymel, .  Is it the case that the causes of bullying appear to be consistent throughout the world?  What are the common characteristics of a child who engages in bullying in British Columbia and elsewhere?  Are they the same as they are in Ireland or elsewhere?</p></speech>

People sometimes demonise the children who bully.  It should be remembered that these are kids.  Kids are niche finders.  They try to figure out how they survive in the world.  Many kids entertain bullying because it works.  It is a way to get power and what they need.  We have to think of them as developing individuals and worry about them from that point of view. Generally, it seems to be fairly consistent around the world.</p></speech>

Have we to be careful that we do not interfere too much in the ability of children to form relationships?  Obviously, a child may feel excluded by other children who have formed friendships.  There may be no intention behind the exclusion of that child, however.  Is that something we might also need to counteract?</p></speech>

For example, teasing brings in camaraderie between friends but it also hurts the person who is the target.  Those are real subtleties of relationships.  At least what we have to do is address them with the children and help them start learning what the impact of their behaviour is on others.</p></speech>

For example, the roots of empathy programme starts out very early.  It can start out in kindergarten.  The point is that no one programme gives someone all the skills.  There has to be a lot of diversity.  For example, there could be an empathy-based programme in one grade level and a conflict resolution programme in another.  One has to keep varying skills that are focused on because it is not one thin; it is multiple things.</p></speech>

That has been in operation, for example, in the Childhood Development Initiative, CDI, in Tallaght for children as young as three.  The intuitive social skills of turn taking, negotiating, listening to other people are embedded quite firmly in the primary school curriculum.  We have quite a complex web of social and emotional competences built into habitual practices in our system.</p> <p>  The research suggests to try to commence these as early as possible.  We look at the climate of our early years sector, the communicative practices there and then as it moves through the system.  It is about habits of communication in many ways.  Bullying within that is seen as a failure of communication.</p></speech>

This is an area about which we have to be sensitive because it is impinging on the relationship between the child and parent.  What can one do to counteract a situation where there are parents who are inflicting negative parenting practices on their child that may subsequently result in the child engaging in bullying?</p></speech>

We have some kind of national network where investment has gone into these family support centres to link in with parents who are under severe strain for various reasons.<br/><br/>I would also argue that we need to educate people to be parents and that needs to be in the life skills curriculum in secondary school.  There can be community-based parenting programmes as well.  It is very much hit and miss and lacks a systematic strategic national vision.  Anything the committee could do to  go beyond <i>ad hoc</i>, here and there bits of these sorts of parenting support programmes would be welcome.<br/><br/>This is not only in the early years or primary settings.  Adolescence is a hugely complex parenting time in terms of boundaries, rules, negotiation and dialogue.  We need a developmental dimension to that as a support for parents.  Again, it is not only within a bullying lens, but also a more social and emotional education lens.  At EU level, there are now new competences for lifelong learning called personal, social and learning to learn.  The personal and social competences across different dimensions of the education system, including lifelong learning and adult education, are now a key European priority.</p></speech>

Of course, we need to start from home.  However, in terms of formal education, we have to start as early as possible such as in kindergarten or nursery.  Research shows that, in those early years, there is a window of opportunity when personality and development behaviour are more malleable to make it easier for the children to develop these competences.  As early as possible and throughout the whole-school time is the answer.</p></speech>

My first question is for Professor Hymel.  I was very struck by what she said about moral disengagement and the challenge in that regard.  She made the point that it may be difficult to talk about this with children, given that they are not, as it were, fully formed morally at the point at which they appear to be showing this lack of empathy.  She drew a parallel with the behaviour of soldiers or terrorists in certain contexts.  How do we build empathy and establish the kinds of behavioural norms that everybody can share across identities and philosophies?  I believe it is very important to talk about creating a moral position that bullying is something that is wrong.  However, in the context of restorative justice, for example, if a person who is bullying gets some kind of satisfaction in the short term and can see that his or her behaviour causes suffering, how do we show such people that this is not the way to live a good life and is not ultimately good for them?  How do we create that sense of understanding?  Is there a need to emphasise in this that there are issues of right and wrong?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shelley Hymel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#E00200"><p>Yes, there is.  Unfortunately, there is not yet a lot of research on how to do that.  The first study showing a link between moral disengagement or justifications and bullying came out in 2015.  Just last week, I reviewed another study that is soon to come out, in which it is demonstrated that five simple lessons involving telling children stories about the impact of negative behaviour on others had a really strong effect in reducing bullying.  We are just beginning to explore the "how" in this regard.</p> <p>  It is sometimes the case that children do not see the impact of their behaviours on others.  Part of the answer to that is a simple matter of getting them to understand what they did and how it impacted on other people.  I tend to think of children as being in the process of developing morals and we have to help them through that process.  Frankly, we do not have a lot of opportunities to do that because it is usually left to the family or the religion.  Families are busy, often with both parents working, and religion is on the decline.  The problem is being pushed into schools and the schools are just learning how to deal with it.  There needs to be more work done to help us figure out how to deal with this.</p></speech>

I was also struck by what Professor Hymel said about the evidence showing that we are reducing bullying by only some 20%, with little evidence of effectiveness at secondary level.  That suggests to me that early intervention is required.  Thinking about what Dr. Downes said, it seems clear that parent training is a key issue here.  There may be negative experiences within the home that are obviously being reflected in the child's behaviour.  If much of the education that needs to happen must take place at an early stage, do we need to ask whether it is possible to transform parental attitudes?  I will address that question to both Professor Hymel and Dr. Downes.</p></speech>

We cannot put all our eggs in one basket, which is why I am arguing strongly for a diversity of approaches.  There are children whose parents have done everything right, but those children have, in effect, found out they can get what they want if they push other kids around.  We have to temper our response because one particular strategy will not work for everybody.  Dr. Downes may have something to say on this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#E00500"><p>To take Professor Hymel's point further, there is not a single, unitary motivation for why somebody becomes a bullying perpetrator.  Some of the research seems to assume there is but, in fact, there are many different reasons for such behaviour.</p> <p>  Going back to the Senator's point about disengagement, I would point to the capacity to connect.  If we have children who have experienced trauma, then their emotions are frozen because they are holding back and repressing those emotions.  That is when specialist intensive supports are needed, to allow them to connect first with themselves, as a dimension of their connecting with, and having empathy for, others.  There is a cohort for whom a cognitive message about being nice to everyone will not register because their emotions are frozen due to trauma-related dimensions.  There may also be issues around separation anxiety and early-years attachment that are quite deep-seated aspects, as recognised by development psychology, that relate to the formation of empathy.</p> <p>  Another point I want to make is that when I argue for restorative practice, it is important to differentiate that from restorative justice.  Restorative justice is where the offender and victim - in this case, the bullying perpetrator and the victim of bullying - would come together to confront each other in some way and make peace.  I am not advocating that in respect of bullying.  Restorative practice is a different set of competencies.  It is a way of questioning things whereby the person reflects on his or her behaviour and is helped to work out how he or she may be causing harm to others.  It is a way of getting people to reflect on how they might change their patterns of thoughts, emotions and behaviours in the future.</p></speech>

The more I have learned in recent weeks about the diversity of pretexts, means and contexts for bullying and the diversity of approaches to dealing with it, I am struck by a particular point.  We live in a time when there is very much a focus on identity, whether that identity is sexual, racial, disability-based and so on.  There are programmes that focus on particular pretexts for bullying.  However, the more I learn about all of this, the more I wonder whether it is a mistake to focus on one area.  Does such an approach risk hogging time and resources and playing down, even by implication, other kinds of bullying?  Could it appear to "other" certain categories of people whose experience is not being reflected because there is a focus on one kind of bullying?  Might it be better to reach for some kind of higher ground that seeks to be inclusive of everybody and always keeps every kind of bullying in context?  There may be particular interest groups that want to specify particular types of bullying, and they may have good reason to do so, but are there risks inherent in focusing on specific identities when trying to combat and prevent bullying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#E00700"><p>I think we can do both.  As a starting point, we need to begin with a universal preventative approach.  When we talk about socio-emotional education, which includes things like developing empathy, building relationships, perspective-taking and constructive conflict resolution, that is for the whole class.  Alongside that, it is important to include examples that relate to particular types of bullying.  We do not keep it at a general level.  The approach should include all children, including those who are at risk and those who are not.  In this way, we are being inclusive.</p> <p>  Within this inclusive approach, however, there is a need for what we call proportionate universality.  We address the whole group inclusively but we give examples, within the activities for the whole classroom, that relate to particular students who may be more at risk because of, for instance, gender or disability.  I would start from there.  We need to focus more, to begin with, on a universal preventative approach.  However, research shows this may not be enough because children who are at risk or already victims of bullying may need additional support, including at a preventative level.  There are programmes that are tailored to particular needs, with activities targeted at particular groups.  I would go for a universal approach, complemented by a targeted intervention.</p></speech>

For example, we can have programmes or activities that focus on sexual identity and others that focus on racial identity.</p><p>These things have to be repeated in different ways because you reach different children with different approaches.  The more diversity we have in our programmes, activities and lesson plans, the more we are likely to hit different things that children will find relevant to their particular experiences.</p></speech>

It has come up at previous meetings, and through TUI research, that Irish children are less likely to experience bullying.  In fact it is below the OECD average.  That is positive.  I was interested by a statement at a previous committee meeting that bullying has actually halved in the last 20 years, which is welcome.  What we are dealing with is where bullying occurs outside of the school, mainly online through social media use.  That has been flagged consistently.  It is a problem and schools have to deal with a problem that did not start in the school but outside it on social media platforms.</p> <p>  I am interested to hear views on guidance counsellors.  I have strongly advocated for the guidance counsellor posts to be restored to schools to the levels we had before the recession.  There were a lot of cuts at the time of the recession and the number of posts has never been restored to the same level in second level schools.  Do the witnesses feel that guidance counsellors would have a robust role to play in tacking any bullying that emerges in schools?  My view is they have a very significant role to play in second level schools.  The restoration of these posts is something I have sought for a long time.</p></speech>

At the latter level, guidance counsellors are not qualified therapists.  I would not agree their role is for one-to-one intensive sustained support for trauma and adverse childhood experiences.  Some of them have stated publicly that they see their role as referring on to the specialist services at that level.  We need to distinguish between the two levels - the guidance counsellors who lead whole-school bullying initiatives at the universal level of a school, and those who provide specialist, intensive one-to-one support.  I am not in favour of the provision of this kind of one-to-one support by those who are not qualified therapists.  I do not think anyone would suggest giving university lecturers extra continuing professional development and put them in to be counsellors for university students when there are specialist counsellors available who work at that level.</p> <p>  On the whole-school level, a feature of international bullying prevention approaches is that they do not put guidance counsellors in a central role.  Guidance counsellors do not have a central role in many of the prevention and intervention programmes.  I would argue that the Deputy is proposing a half-baked Irish solution to an Irish problem.  I am not saying that an individual guidance counsellor could not lead and be the champion for a whole-school co-ordinating committee - there may be some who would be very good in that role, and there may be others who would not - but a lot depends on how we conceive of the composition of a driving committee at whole-school level.  The different levels of intervention need to be distinguished.</p></speech>

As someone who spent 12 years working in the education system, I suggest we need to acknowledge that we have very long waiting lists for kids to see therapists.  I am suggesting that if a guidance counsellor is there, at least the child has somebody to hear them, listen to them and talk to them, and perhaps to put a programme in place in the school to alert other teachers to the problems and to the fact that the child needs support.  I am not suggesting for a second that they fill the role of therapist but that children should have access to an adult who will listen to them if they are very overwhelmed on a particular day or there are problems in the family.  It is about having a listening ear, whether it is from a counsellor or a therapist.  We have to acknowledge that the waiting lists here are unacceptably long.  I have seen at first hand how long it can take for children who need psychiatric care to receive the services they need.  It is ridiculous.  We have a sham of a system.  All I suggest is that an adult who is already in the school can try to fill the gaping gap in services, so that the child can speak to somebody as part of the journey towards getting help, if there is trauma.  At least it would be a stepping stone if there were someone in the school who could alert other staff and put supports in place urgently.</p></speech>

I very much hope the second level focus will be there for specialist emotional counselling supports in schools, as there are in many European counties.  We are not talking about a huge amount of money.  We could have a system of the specialist supports that are urgently needed.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's wider point, there is a role across the school system for mentoring and social and emotional supports from the guidance counsellor or others in the school system.  One would hope that a supportive school culture would include a range of adults.  For many who are alienated from the school system, and there are strong links between bullying and non-attendance at school and early school leaving, a teacher may not be the best person for a child to open up to.  Students have told me on a number of occasions that they would be concerned about opening up to a teacher as opposed to other health professionals.</p></speech>

I am not familiar with the system in Ireland.  In our system, there are guidance counsellors but they do not focus on the social and emotional end, especially at second level.  They focus on college preparation and things like that.  We have to talk about the kinds of counsellor training and the kinds of counsellors who are available.  In Canada, at least, the counsellors are completely stretched.  They have way too many clients and not many kids go to them.  Kids go to the person they trust.  My experience is that if they go to anybody, it is a peer or a person in school such as their teacher, if they have the trust with the teacher.  It has to be done at many levels.  One counsellor with 2,000 kids will find it very difficult to satisfy that need.  We have several problems.  Teachers will also be at the front line.  They are most likely to see what is going on and to be the person the kids will go to initially, and then they need help to figure out what to do.  I was head of a department that trained counsellors.  Frankly, we did not train them in these types of therapies.  We need to consider what we are training them to do.</p></speech>

The principal networks from primary and post-primary levels were before the committee last week.</p><p>I asked them a similar question.  The representatives from both primary and post-primary spoke about the difficulty of engaging with parents.  They outlined how meetings may be open, public, face to face or on Zoom, but it is always the same parents and guardians who attend them.  Often, the parents the teachers really want to reach do not attend these meetings, whether they are about education or whatever.  This question has been asked in different ways during this meeting and previous meetings, but I would be interested in hearing our three guests' thoughts on it.  Is there a way to ensure that parents will concentrate on this issue?  I refer both to the parents of a bully and to those of a student who may be on the receiving end of bullying.  It might be only in order to educate them.</p><p> Turning to cyberbullying, no longer does the bullying stop in school, as it may have 15 or 20 years ago.  Now it comes home with the student, through Snapchat and all the other social media platforms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shelley Hymel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#G00200"><p>On engaging parents, they first have to be interested.  Professor Donna Cross, who is based in Australia, once told me the best way to get parents involved in order that they will at least be engaged and willing to give information is to have the kids stage a play.  She had put on a play, which the kids organised in order that they had a voice, and the parents came to it.  Beyond that, it is difficult to get some parents in because they simply do not have time or energy to devote to this.  That is something we really have to work on.</p> <p>  On the social media issue, parents increasingly get access to information online about parenting and their children.  Right now, there is not a lot of good stuff out there on bullying and so on for parents, so that is another angle where we could reach some parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#G00300"><p>To amplify the point on bridge-building or non-threatening activities, such as the example of the play that Professor Hymel gave, a trust-building exercise is needed here.  If we go straight to saying there is a bullying problem and a particular parent's child may be the one at fault, and we want to bring them into a universal parenting programme on that basis, parents may feel quite threatened by that.  It is about trying to get in earlier with the social and emotional education and softer parenting programme approaches.  It could include a range of health-based issues such as sleep-awareness issues or a range of other dimensions.</p> <p>  I reiterate that there needs to be different sites of engagement, such as community locations, where families may feel more at ease and where there is a social element, as well as the family centre dimension, where programmes can be run.  There should be community outreach, school outreach into the home and outreach to individual families.  There are home-visiting programmes, both for early years children and at primary school level, whereby there are visits to the homes of families where there are known to be major issues of mental health, domestic violence or conflict.</p> <p>  We need to have that multidimensional outreach approach but it should be more than just an information-based model.  It is also about how parents may co-construct some of the solutions. One of the criticisms we made in our report for the European Commission was that much international research tended to treat parents passively.  They were treated just as objects of information rather than being seen as co-constructers of material that may have been of relevance for, first, wider social and emotional education, and bullying as a dimension of that.</p></speech>

The community outreach point is very important.  I attended a seminar last week in which the head of the school explained the efforts they make to go out into the community where the parents are.  They speak the parents' language and relate to their culture.  This is a very important point.</p> <p>  We must realise that schools cannot always do it alone.  They need the help of other institutions and social systems, starting with the community.  For example, in the case I highlighted, the school developed an agreement with the local council, which had access to many of the parents, in order that together they could reach out to particular parents.  The school worked through the local council sometimes and through social services at other times.  Sometimes people from the school would visit the bingo nights that some of the parents often attended.</p> <p>  I recall an initiative from Australia that related to engaging the parents to lead the initiatives themselves.  To bring the parents closer to the school, a number of parents were nominated who acted as champions for that cause, and the parents themselves led the parent training.  Of course, the school invited in experts, but this was not seen as a school-based intervention but rather one organised by parents for parents.  That is a good way forward.</p></speech>

I am not sure what our guests' experiences are, whether in Canada, Malta or Ireland, although I am most familiar with this country.  Do they believe social media companies are doing enough to tackle cyberbullying?  At previous meetings, we heard terrible experiences of kids, and teachers have told me about cases of online bullying, specifically on Snapchat, which is more difficult to prove because the posts disappear, unlike on Facebook, Twitter or whatever.  Online bullying is a very significant issue.  Some children now use social media platforms until 1 a.m., 2 a.m. or even 3 a.m., if their parents are not strict about turning off the Wi-Fi in the house, or whatever the case may be.  We all will have heard dreadful stories and experiences.  I am interested in hearing our guests' views on social media platforms in particular.</p></speech>

According to the World Health Organization study on health behaviour in school-aged children, HBSC, Maltese children aged 13 and 15 years old are at the top in terms of addiction to the Internet, which of course opens the door to cyberbullying and abuse.  As a start, one way in which we are trying to address the problem is by educating both the parents and the young people - we are talking especially about teenagers but they may also be young children nowadays - about cyber safety.  This relates to what I was saying earlier about social and emotional education.  A specific part of the curriculum in the context of social and emotional education will focus on cyberbullying, cyber safety and the potential dangers of the Internet if it is not used responsibly.</p></speech>

Cyberbullying is the least frequent form of bullying; I should put that on the table.</p><p>It is also unique.  The children most at risk in traditional face-to-face bullying are what we call bully victims.  These are people who bully others but who also get victimised.  In the cyber world, this happens a great deal.  Those things are very highly correlated.  It is not that there is a subgroup of kids who are victimised and another who are bullies; they are both engaging in bullying, often in a retaliatory manner.  We are just beginning to understand this.  What seems to be happening, at least based on a number of our recent studies, is that kids are getting desensitised.  I do not really want to use that word but I cannot think of another.  They do not see it is a problem but rather just as the way the world is.  We have a really big problem with cyberbullying and, right now, it is really difficult to understand the ways in which it is unique and how it can be addressed.  I certainly agree with Professor Cefai that we need to include this in our programmes and to attack it but we also need a lot more research to understand how those relationships are different and what impact they are having on the children.</p></speech>

People sitting and look at screens for hours every day, and lockdowns have accentuated this problem, may not be particularly happy in their daily lives.  Part of it is a spillover of general unhappiness.  We need a vision for extracurricular activities, after-school projects, meaningful sports, the arts and nature and to channel people's energies in other directions.  This is linked to the discriminatory bullying I mentioned.  Research in the area of social psychology highlights that it is not enough just to have contact with people to overcome prejudice or discrimination.  Contact and structured co-operation are required.  It is about structured co-operative tasks.  The online environment is so unstructured in many ways that it facilitates that sense of mutual antagonism.  As part of a revitalisation of our society, we need to integrate arts and sport, which are individually strong in many ways, with a social and emotional education.  For example, there is increasing interest at the level of the European Commission in outdoor education, social and emotional education and the interplay between the two.  It is about challenging our young people's energies in diverse directions.</p></speech>

To revisit some of the issues that have been raised, I get the idea that any interventions need to take place as soon as possible, as is true in most other areas.  I really welcome the commentary suggesting that multiple sites must be picked and this anti-bullying framework built into everything as opposed to asking parents to come in and telling them their kid is the main problem with regard to bullying, to use the example given.  That is obviously a major issue.</p> <p>  We have a number of community-based programmes.  The example in County Louth to which I probably halfway alluded is the Genesis programme, with which I have a familial connection, to put that on the record.  This service operates parenting programmes for the parents of children of varying ages, starting from the very young.  It also operates the KiVa anti-bullying programme.  It runs stuff in the community and programmes connected to the schools.  That serves a really good purpose but a certain cohort is missed.  The witnesses spoke earlier about people who suffer multiple adverse childhood experiences.  We are possibly talking about multigenerational issues or abuse connected with poverty along with many other issues.  There is a wider piece of work to be done there.  A holistic set of interventions with particular families is required.  This probably means starting when kids are very young and dealing with a lot more than just the very specific issue of bullying.</p> <p>  In fairness, the witnesses have laid out quite well the sort of framework at which we are looking with regard to best practice.  Can resilience be built in?  As much as we want to deal with the problem of bullying and as much as we need to address it and prevent it happening, it will still happen and we need to help kids protect themselves.  We talked about social media and the amount of time people spend on these platforms.  We are in a world in which people are not doing what they did 20 or 30 years ago, which is to go out and interact with their peers.  There were good and bad points.  People fell out with each other and had fights but learned how to get over it.  To a degree, those skill sets are just not as readily available to kids these days.  That is probably an issue.</p></speech>

I served on its committee for a while so I know it pretty well.  The area-based childhood programmes present a great opportunity.  They represent a key underutilised lens for a community vision on bullying, as do the local area partnerships.  I firmly encourage the committee to make some recommendation in this regard.  Many of these have already been developing social and emotional education initiatives.  They tend to focus on the younger years while a lot is also needed for adolescents.  The scope of some of these groups does not stretch to the adolescents in their remit.  It is certainly a structure.  There are the area-based childhood, ABC, initiatives.  That is a community-based structure which has great potential.</p> <p>  With particular regard to KiVa, in our formal submission to the committee we raised concern with particular regard to the peer defenders aspect of KiVa.  It is questionable both legally and psychologically.  Those are aspects to be considered.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on resilience, Professor Cefai may disagree with me but I am concerned about some of the discourse around resilience because it risks blaming children who are suffering for supposedly not being sufficiently resilient.  I do not believe we need to make Teflon children or children who are superheroes in the midst of adversity.  I personally prefer the term "agency".  We want to enable children to respond actively to situations.  We need to create inclusive systems around them to facilitate their agency.  One part of resilience, if I was to be committed to use the term, is stopping the cycles of self-hate.  International research shows that victims blame themselves.  They internalise the logic of the perpetrator, feel hopeless and engage in patterns of fatalism, which is associated with risk behaviour.  Stopping those cycles of despair, self-blame and self-hate is a key dimension.  Intensive supports are needed to do that but universal competences may also be involved.</p></speech>

To give an example, several studies have shown that kids who are victimised by peers or more generally show a blunted cortisol response.  Their body changes.  We exert cortisol for that fight or flight response under conditions of stress but kids who have been victimised do not.  They exert less cortisol.  This is only seen in victims of the Holocaust or repeated rape.  It is a very major factor.  If we want to create resilience, we really have to start thinking about the impact of bullying in making kids less resilient and how we can compensate for that.  We do not have answers to that question yet.  We are just beginning to uncover how difficult that may be for the child who is repeatedly victimised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#J00100"><p>I would start with an inclusive approach where children at risk of bullying or already bullied would also benefit from general socio-emotional skills such as self-regulation and developing a positive self-concept.  That is an important point.  We are trying to create a context where bullying cannot thrive.  However, until we reach the ideal situation where bullying does not exist, we need to provide additional targeted supports for those at risk of being bullied in terms of gender, disability, ethnicity - we know who these are - while providing as much classroom and whole-school context as possible where the children are protected.</p> <p>  At the same time, there is the concept of multifinality and that is where the concept of resilience is important.  Research shows and we have seen how harmful to mental health bullying is.  However, the relationship between bullying and mental health problems is not linear.  It can be mediated and that is where resilience comes in by a number of processes that promote the resilience of the person. </p> <p>  We know what the factors are to deal with the trauma and to prevent further exacerbation of the problem and of the bullying.  Research has shown that, where children are at risk of being or already being bullied and are therefore at risk of mental health difficulties, they benefit from the support of peers.  There could be peer support schemes or mentoring.  An important point can be having a stable, close relationship with a teacher at the school, a sort of mentor.  That will be a scaffold of support.  It is also of importance that they have understanding parental support.  A further important factor can be their work, as Professor Hymel and Dr. Downes were saying, on developing a more positive self-concept, believing more in themselves and self-efficacy.  Socio-emotional learning can work in that way.  There are also social skills such as learning to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in certain situations, how not to exacerbate a problem such that it becomes more violent, for example, and how to make the best decision in a difficult situation.</p> <p>  When it comes to the concept of resilience, I agree we should not put the onus on the victim or expect them to be resilient in tough situations.  The idea is to remove the unjust structures and tough situations.  While we work to provide a context at school, at home and in the community where bullying does not thrive, we have to give at the same time a resilience vaccine to children at risk so they are strengthened when they face a bullying situation, first, in how they deal with it and, second, so it does not have so much psychological impact on their well-being.</p></speech>

We talked abut words we like and words we are not such big fans of.  For me, the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; does not really describe the extent of what we face sometimes.  It does not seem to capture the seriousness.  Two earlier contributions mentioned how bullying leads to suicidal ideation.  That is the shocking horror faced by the children and families going through this.</p> <p>  With regard to many of the presentations we have had during recent meetings, I was trying to get to what a good place looks like.  What does a good school environment look like?  What does a proactive engagement with parents and other leaders in the community look like?  Would some of our speakers like to give an example?  I think Professor Hymel spoke about a play.  In my mind, I have the idea that role plays in schools might be a way to let children know what to do if they encounter a bullying incident, whether they are bystanders, upstanders, the people perpetrating the bullying or the victims.  As the witnesses mentioned, each of these groups suffer the long-term impacts of not taking action.</p> <p>  What does the perfect environment look like?  Is there a place for role plays or plays in our school system to help identify the people to go to or people students might trust or, in general, because it happens all the time and to show students how to deal with it?</p></speech>

Role play is important but it has to be done well.  There has been some great success incorporating socio-emotional learning in drama.  We have had people go in and work with students so students have a voice in creating plays and activities they do with younger children which allow for that more intense working out of what to do in a certain situation.  There is a way to do that.</p> <p>  I see schools adopting socio-emotional learning and teachers taking it to heart.  In our province, each school has counsellors and that is separate from what they call a social-emotional champion.  We meet every month with representatives from several school districts who talk, exchange ideas or whatever.  We need time to talk, exchange strategies and activities and work together.  Those things operate to begin to create really wild things.</p> <p>  The other thing we have done that has been effective is bibliographies.  Many great books can be used.  I love the diversity of approaches.  Different teachers will feel comfortable or uncomfortable with different approaches.  The more we give them the capacity and the capital to take all sorts of different approaches, the more likely we will reach some of those kids and create those environments.</p></speech>

We need to start by foregrounding SEL.  Socio-emotional education is not yet recognised in many countries, schools or regions as being of enough value to spend resources and invest in its development.  Many schools, and maybe the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, do not help in this way, and are driven by a reductionist view of education based on cognitive or academic learning.  There needs to be more awareness of the importance of socio-emotional education as a crucial part of human development.  One way of doing this is when the whole-school community mobilises its human and physical resources to put this vision of socio-emotional education into practice across all systems.</p> <p>  We need to identify the needs of our students and community.  We would start with training the adults in the school before working with the children on socio-emotional education.  In particular, we start with the teachers and school administration so they become converted.  Some teachers and parents are not convinced of the benefits of socio-emotional education.  By doing it and developing these competencies, they can be good role models for the school population.  We would also work with the parents and empower them to educate themselves.</p><p>We have to be a bit careful not to be patronising or to blame the parents in one way or another.  As I said, schools can organise training with parents themselves leading.  Once we do that and we have the whole school mobilise its resources with a clear vision, we have trained the staff and we have worked with the parents, we can then start implementing social and emotional education in the curriculum, in extracurricular activities, in academic learning, in the classroom climate and in school bullying policies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#K00400"><p>To add to a number of the points, working with the principal is a key aspect so we need the professional development of principals regarding social and emotional education.  We have restorative practice schools here where there are whole-school approaches.  We are not that far away from it in many of our schools and there are a number of schools where we can see models of real openness.  Conflict is not avoidable in schools, conflict is part of life, and it is a question of how those conflicts are mediated.</p> <p>  Professor Cefai made a point that I want to amplify, which is that social and emotional education is not opposed to academic learning.  The academic research points out that social and emotional education improves academic learning because it involves a deeper engagement with the material, deeper connection to life experience and deeper processes of questioning.  For example, in English they are trying to understand characters&rsquo; motivations in a novel or they are trying to understand empathy in history.  Drama and role-play is something which is part of the primary curriculum and can be used as a method across subjects, such as in history, religion or ethics.  There are ways in which role-play helps the key social and emotional education goals, which are empathy and perspective taking.</p> <p>  On the point on the ideal features of a school, we can almost sense this when we go into schools.  One of my roles is to go around to different schools on school placement, and I can see the tangible climate in the school where all the school staff are engaged with the school process, they are happy to chat with the children and they talk at the level of the children, so there is democracy in action in the school environment.  It is about all of those whole-school aspects.</p> <p>  If I am being asked what other layers there are on that, I have already argued for a whole-school committee to drive through change at a whole-school level, not just one champion but a committee, and to have emotional counsellors and therapists onsite.  What I would add to that is a vision of a school community lifelong learning centre, where the school is available after school hours, where there can be after-school activities that children want to stay for and where parents are engaged.  The role of the arts in regard to bullying prevention and social and emotional education is usually underdeveloped.  There are many different multidimensional lenses to build on.</p> <p>  I would add that around secondary school level, many of the wider programmes have been shown to be less effective for older teenagers.  There is a risk that overly didactic approaches will get the teenagers to react against it, and they will do the opposite.  There is quite a lot of research, even going back to the 1970s, that if we try to programme youth into things, they will go the opposite way.  We have to be careful around that aspect also.  With older children, it is about co-constructing meaning-making material.</p> <p>  In our report for the commission, we also emphasised how youth would have an input into curricular materials.  In the international research, one of the key features of successful bullying programmes was video.  Videos were actively developed by minority groups who were victims of bullying to show what it is like in their life experience.  To have different minority voices come through in videos is another dimension that international research says has a key impact for bullying prevention.</p></speech>

To take away a key point, it would be that early intervention in primary school is crucial.  We heard from other schools talking about the roots of empathy programme, which was very impressive.  I take it that the focus on primary schools and early intervention is crucial, along with training the teachers within the whole school on these programmes and the emotional skills the witnesses are talking about.</p></speech>

I would also emphasise there needs to be a consistency with the climate and culture of secondary school.  It is very important that those democratic, voice-based principles at primary are carried through into the secondary school system.  We risk a disillusionment if we have a very different type of school climate from primary to post-primary.  I argue that we need to be looking for that continuity of climate, and that would obviously go back to issues such as conflict resolution skills for secondary teachers as well as primary teachers in initial teacher education.</p></speech>

Today, we are joined by representatives of the following advocacy groups: Mr. Bernard Joyce, director, and Ms Jacinta Brack, co-ordinator of political advocacy communications and campaigns, Irish Traveller Movement, ITM; Mr. James Doorley, deputy director, National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI; and Ms Jennifer McCarthy Flynn, head of policy, and Ms Catherine Lane, women in local community and rural development officer, National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI.  Their opening statements have been circulated to members in advance.  I welcome them all.</p> <p>  We have spent some time on the  Bill, which is quite right because it is hugely important legislation.  Today, we want to concentrate on how to improve engagement with the political system, how to get more people to participate in the electoral system, and how to get more people to vote in local and general elections.  We welcome and appreciate the attendance of the witnesses.  We will benefit from their experience and the submissions they have made to help us improve this legislation. </p> <p>  What we do is we go round the members.  It is a six-minute slot for questions and answers for each member.  If we stick to six minutes, we can get to every member and possibly get back in for a second round of questions.  </p> <p>  I will read the note on privilege.  Members attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster house or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level as immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.</p> <p>  The opening statements, which were submitted to the committee, will be published on the committee website following this meeting. </p> <p>  I now invite witnesses to make their opening submissions.  I will start with Mr. Joyce.  </p></speech>

We refer to our submission to the forum on a family-friendly and inclusive parliament and related recommendations, which may have meaning here too.  We also note the current Government-led interim report of the anti-racism committee, and any actions and recommendations arising there.<br/><br/>The establishment of an electoral commission and provisions connected to that can make way for broader engagement of Travellers, minority and under-represented groups in a political democracy, and ensure those are upheld in a non-discriminatory way, a principle objective of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. <br/><br/>Travellers encounter many obstacles to participating fully in political democracy, from low voting, lack of political awareness and apathy to the political system, which as a duty bearer, has under-served Traveller needs and dented trust, in many settings.  This is coupled with a lack of sanctions for running candidates and elected representatives who have, over many years, articulated anti-Traveller sentiments in electioneering matters and often in housing decisions, with some of them openly canvassing against Travellers as a strategy to be elected or, in some cases, re-elected. <br/><br/>The structural obstacles are a problem too, where there is no universal right.  Right now, there are approximately 45,000 to 57,000 Irish Travellers in the Republic, 60% are aged under 25 and just 3% are aged over 65.  Given our population size and age, our political system of proportional representation statistically disadvantages us when competing with non-Travellers in elections.  A more successful way for some Travellers was through the local town councils.  Unfortunately, these have been abolished now.  Other obstacles to achieve presence in constituency settings through the normal pathways to politics, such as through social and civil engagement and sporting and cultural arenas, are also a restrictive barrier.  Even after those barriers are overcome to get onto a ballot paper, Travellers encounter deeply ingrained prejudices at a level, including for nominations by political parties and groups.  Notwithstanding that, in the 2019 local and European elections, five Traveller candidates ran.  This was the most significant number to date.  There is hope that we will see more candidates in future.  However, the reality is competing in an environment of anti-Traveller sentiment is challenging and limits success.  However, there is much that we can do.  <br/><br/>Improving Traveller visibility, where we are participants in national and local political structures in mainstream politics would support integration and inclusion.  Traveller-led articulation would not only promote but could be seen as an approach that would also mainstream our identity beyond the stereotypes.  Encouraging greater Traveller voter participation requires proof that the system will deliver for our community and that we are participating in discussions and decisions of national importance.  That means that when national policy decisions are made, we are part of that discussion of how democracy happens.  For example, the function of the citizens&rsquo; assembly is to inform legislation and public policy.  Members of the assembly are currently selected at random from the electoral register.  Travellers are not always on the register and were therefore unlikely to be included in assemblies so far.  It is difficult to see that this is true to their remit &ldquo;in reflecting Irish society&rdquo;.  <br/><br/>We must also be included in national Government planning strategies<b>, </b>which are not comprehensively inclusive in design.  Travellers are not factored into Ireland&rsquo;s broader plan across cultural, social, community and environmental strategies.  That is a matter of fact.  Consultation on those matters assumes that Travellers are included in broader public cohorts and across all national engagement strategies.  The Seanad and presidential election systems, by their design, disadvantage Travellers, and other under-represented and disadvantaged groups, and should be broadened at their entry level.  The likelihood of having a Traveller as President is remote, worsened by obstacles in the first stage, where a candidate must be endorsed by either 20 Oireachtas Members or four local authorities.  Up to now, the Oireachtas has not created a minority panel system.</p><p>In that context, but not exclusive to it, there is an immediate opportunity within the Seanad, a proposal which has been supported by some political groups.<br/><br/>Finally, representation in political decision-making has been recognised by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, in 2005, 2011, 2016 and finally in 2019, saying that:</p><blockquote>	the State party take effective measures, including special measures, to improve the representation of ethnic minority groups in political and public life, including by implementing the goal of ensuring that 1 per cent of the civil service workforce are from ethnic minorities. </blockquote><p>Travellers should now be included in that.  It also said recommended that &quot;the State party collect and provide updated statistics on the ethnic composition of its population based on self-identification&quot;, including in political life.  We would be very happy to address any of these matters further and can reply by submission.</p></speech>

We have outlined in our written submission the work we did in advance of the 2020 general election.  As a result, we have organised campaigns to encourage and support young people to register to vote and to vote in all elections and referenda.  We welcome the fact that there has been increased participation by young people in recent elections and referenda.  The level of pre-election engagement, voter registration and participation in recent referenda and in the 2020 general election was unprecedented, in our experience.</p> <p>  We have called for the establishment of an electoral commission for many years.  As a result, we have a strong interest in this legislation.  In the interests of brevity, I will focus on those areas of the draft legislation on which we have substantive comments and concerns.  I do, at the outset, welcome the long-awaited establishment of the electoral commission, the introduction of the rolling electoral register, the move away from household to individual registration, the greater availability of online voter registration, and the pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds.  I will now outline our comments and concerns on particular sections of the legislation.</p> <p>  In relation to head 5, membership of the electoral commission, we understand the integrity and independence of our elections is vital and we understand the rationale for using the current membership model of both the Referendum Commission of Ireland and Standards in Public Office, SIPO, with regard to the membership of the electoral commission.  However, we believe that if we are serious about promoting greater participation by young people and, indeed, by under-represented groups, the legislation should explicitly include provision for a youth representative and-or others who have experience of promoting participation by those from under-represented groups in the electoral process.  We also believe the electoral commission should have a member with expertise in IT systems and digital cybersecurity, given the remit of the commission and importance of this expertise now and into the future.</p> <p>  On head 28, functions of the electoral commission, we are disappointed the remit of the electoral commission omits key functions.  We note the proposed functions are referred to as &ldquo;initial functions&rdquo; and that other functions could be assigned to the commission over time.  However, since it has taken us more than 14 years to get this far, since the first commitment to establish an electoral commission was made in 2007, we believe additional functions should be included in the legislation which can be enacted and commenced over time.  For example, under head 30, the electoral commission will have the remit to promote public awareness of a referendum and encourage the electorate to vote at that referendum.  However, the commission has not been assigned the same role with regard to promoting awareness of an election and encouraging the electorate to vote.  We believe the commission should have an explicit role in increasing electoral participation and should be empowered to undertake its own actions and support actions by non-governmental and non-partisan bodies which are solely concerned with promoting voter participation.  Head 77 does refer to the electoral commission having a role to "increase participation in our political processes through voter education".  In our view, this appears to be vague and limited.  It needs to be clarified and further expanded when the full Bill is published.</p> <p>  Likewise, the commission has not been given an explicit function to promote voter registration, which we believe is a major and significant omission.  In 2007, a poll conducted for us by Red C found that 22% of young people under the age of 30 were not registered to vote.  Based on the current population cohorts, that would mean that up 155,000 young people were not on the electoral rolls.  We believe democracy is diminished and undermined when so many young people are excluded.  We have to take into account that every year we have to get 60,000 young people on the electoral rolls.  We believe the work to promote voter registration should not be left largely to voluntary youth organisations or, indeed, other organisations such as us, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and SpunOut, which are doing their best on limited resources to encourage and support young people to register to vote.</p> <p>  We also welcome the inclusion of a research function in the remit of the commission, but it does appear limited to electoral policy and procedure.  A previous contributor to the committee's deliberations referred to it as tightly defined and unambitious.  We agree.  If we are going to look at how we increase participation of those who are under-represented, we believe the commission should have a wider remit to undertake and commission research on electoral participation, means to increase turnout, and barriers to registration to vote.  We are particularly interested in research on examining ways to support and increase the participation of young people.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, produced a report on the 2011 general election.  However, we have had two general elections, two sets of local and European elections, and numerous referenda since then, and we do not have any detailed data or research on voter participation available.  In the absence of regular and robust data, it will be difficult for the electoral commission to contribute to policy and advise Government, as set out in the legislation.</p> <p>  The other area is oversight of the electoral register.  Many aspects of the electoral system function well and, most importantly, have the confidence and trust of the people.  However, we are concerned about the voter registration system.  We are of the view that it is not fit for purpose as it is under-resourced, inconsistent and incomplete.  We are running 21st century elections with 19th century processes.  This is not a reflection on either the staff of the franchise unit in the Department or on the many staff in the local authorities, who do tremendous work on tight timeframes, especially in advance of elections.  I am sure members of the committee are familiar with this.  What we are saying is that the registration system is under-resourced and outdated.  We welcome the move towards a rolling register and towards online registration, which will make it easier for young people to register to vote.  We would have anticipated that the legislation would have assigned responsibility for the electoral register to the electoral commission.  Instead, it has been given an oversight role.  We are concerned that, instead of being a regulatory body with the powers and resources to reform and improve the electoral register and registration process, the electoral commission appears limited to undertaking research and making recommendations.  This, in our view, will not give the commission explicit authority to address the inadequacies in the individual electoral registers which are compiled by the local authorities.</p> <p>  While head 90 provides for the development of a national shared electoral register, it is not clear if and when this will happen.  This has already been provided for in legislation for 20 years and has not occurred.  We accept the establishment of an electoral commission may make this more likely, but we would have preferred this to have been more definitive.  We know from other jurisdictions, such as Canada, that up to 17% of electoral information changes each year.  This is especially an issue for young people, who are highly mobile.  It is important, therefore, we have a national database that does not lose voters in the administrative cracks.  As I said, young people are moving around and may deal with three or four local authorities and electoral registers over a number of years.  They can get lost in the system and end up not having a vote when it comes to an election.</p> <p>  We welcome the introduction of the pending electoral list which will allow young people aged 16 and 17 to register to vote so that they do not have to wait until they turn 18.  However, we call on the Government, as we have for many years, to implement the commitments that the Convention on the Constitution recommended to extend voting rights to young people aged 16 and 17.</p><p>We believe this can be done as a first step by means of legislation for the upcoming 2024 local and European elections.</p><p> Those are the main issues we have with the Electoral Reform Bill, as outlined, but, as I said, there are also have other issues.  I thank members for their time and attention.  I am happy to answer any questions or comments they may have.</p></speech>

We are the leading representative women&rsquo;s membership organisation in Ireland.  Established in 1973, we represent a membership base of over 190 groups and organisations across a diversity of backgrounds, sectors and locations and we are committed to the promotion of full equality between women and men.  Our mission is to lead and to be a catalyst for change in the achievement of equality for all women.</p> <p>  We welcome the Electoral Reform Bill in its intention to deliver a much-needed centralised and professional structure to provide for the needs of all residents, candidates, political parties and the media.  Its responsibilities and obligations to uphold democratic values should be clearly outlined, including ensuring that electoral politics delivers for women.  Equality, diversity and inclusion should be clearly evident across all its functions and responsibilities, including broadening the scope of the functions currently outlined in the general scheme.  These should specifically include the promotion of gender balance in political life and in electoral contests, including necessary change to support women&rsquo;s access to elected office.  It should include using the broad policy role to engage groups facing barriers in participating in the electoral system and safeguarding equity of access for all, including Travellers, young people, disabled people and people from minority ethnic backgrounds.  It should also include the creation of conditions for safe and fair elections, electoral competition and electoral communications, both online and offline.</p> <p>  There is an urgency in this area to deliver substantive change for women&rsquo;s representation and participation in public and political life.  Representation of women in politics remains unacceptably low.  At local level, only 26% of councillors are women, with significant disparities between rural and urban areas.  In rural areas, in the most recent local elections, women made up 23% of candidates as opposed to 35% in urban areas.  Only ten local authorities have achieved a critical mass of 30% or more women councillors.  The local elections are a critical pipeline for elections at national level, as over 80% of women Deputies have served as local councillors.  We welcome the commitment outlined in the programme for Government to "introduce practical measures that will encourage more women to stand in local elections in 2024" and to consider the recommendations of our report on Women Beyond the D&aacute;il: More Women in Local Government, with a view to reporting in 2021.  As was the case with the general election, a gender quota for local elections is a necessity if we are serious about achieving gender equality in political life.</p> <p>  The number of women in politics matters.  In a representative democracy, it matters who represents us and what they represent.  Women&rsquo;s representation is essential to the quality of our democratic processes.  This is because principles of justice and equality dictate that a representative government should constitute a microcosm of the larger society in terms of gender, class, age, minorities, disability and so on.  The under-representation of any of these groups weakens our democracy as their interests are at risk of being marginalised or ignored.  Women make up the largest group who are currently vastly under-represented in Irish political institutions, government and political parties.  We believe that the electoral commission can contribute to addressing and challenging these systemic gender inequalities still evident in Irish political institutions.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly on gender equality recently presented its comprehensive recommendations covering many key areas for women and women&rsquo;s equality.  It outlined a clear pathway to achieve gender equality in Ireland and has called for the Government to act promptly and decisively.  The citizens have made a clear statement that women&rsquo;s low representation in all sectors of society needs to change and they do not want soft measures, they want quotas.  Some 87.6% of the citizens voted in favour of extending the gender quota for party candidates at general elections, local elections, elections to the Seanad and European Parliament elections by the end of 2022.  We have advocated, and continue to advocate, for the introduction of quotas of candidates for local elections.  We will continue to campaign for systematic and cultural change which addresses the hostile environment that women, particularly minority women, experience online, utilises the technological advances that can support access and inclusion in the system and supports elected representatives with caring responsibilities.  Specific positive action measures need to be introduced to address the particular barriers experienced by Traveller women, disabled women, young women and women from minority ethnic backgrounds.  We are asking the commission to specifically address the following areas as part of its functions.  It should take on a role around supporting and promoting political candidacy among women and under-represented groups, including overseeing the extension of candidate selection quotas for local elections.  It should monitor the reporting and public investment of political parties to ensure the participation of women.  That could include funding related to carrying out gender and equality audits of political parties, covering membership, officer roles, candidate recruitment and selection.  It should develop standards for political discourse that are free from discriminatory rhetoric and hate speech, and tackle online abuse.  The rise of online abuse has impacted women's lives in many ways.  It can have a chilling effect, leading to women turning away from political life because of those difficulties, which risks widening the gap in gender representation.</p> <p>  The Electoral Act should be amended in order to protect the legitimate advocacy role of civil society organisations, as set out in the Electoral (Civil Society Freedom) (Amendment) Bill, which is also before the Oireachtas at the moment.  This is an issue on which the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom, of which we are a member, has set out a detailed position.  We believe we need to use all the opportunities available to us to support the participation of women in public and political life.  Transformation is required to achieve gender equality in Irish politics and to break down the barriers for women in politics.  We look forward to engaging further with the work of the committee and assisting its work in any way we can.</p></speech>

We were anxious to ensure that groups such as those represented today with a long track record of representing people who are under-represented within the political system had a voice in this Bill.  Our guests are right in saying it is something that has long been campaigned for.  I certainly appreciate the fact this legislation has come before us so soon in the lifetime of the Government and that a commission will be established.  I also welcome some of the positive suggestions that are being made with regard to the ambition of the commission.  It can go ever further.</p> <p>  To bridge the three different areas represented within a five-minute speaking slot is challenging.  I will try to ask each of our guests a specific question and I promise to try to flesh out some of the ideas that our guests have put forward when we are drafting our report.  We have made a start on many of these issues but we have not gone a long way.  There were no women on the ballot paper the first time I ran for election to Dublin City Council.  When I left, almost 50% of the members of the council were women.</p> <p>  My first question is to the representatives of the National Women's Council.  I fully support gender quotas at local level.  My fear is that quotas may erode some of the progress that has already been made.  On Dublin City Council, the majority of Fianna F&aacute;il, Green Party and Social Democrats members are women.  A gender quota may actually erode some of that progress.  In other words, there may need to be male quotas in some cases.  Could we talk a little about how we can avoid eroding the progress that has been made and how we can build the capacity and experience of women councillors?</p></speech>

We have seen very positive developments.  I understand three urban local authorities now have gender balance but, as I outlined, the lack of female representation across the north west and midlands is stark. </p><p> We have seen how quotas have worked quite quickly and that pace of change is required.  We saw the impact when they were introduced for general elections, for example, which was very positive.  Obviously, more remains to be done.  What we learned from the most recent local elections is that the action that is required is from political parties themselves.  We saw a lot of positive progress in some smaller parties.  Some of the bigger parties did not put in the effort in terms of fielding women candidates on the ballot paper across all of the different constituencies. </p><p> In terms of the impact and change that we need and want to see, and that women and our membership want to see, the introduction of quotas at a lower level will bring about that positive change.  We also recognise that other areas need to change, such as maternity and paternity leave for councillors, more family-friendly processes and system changes within local government.  Some of those are being addressed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other stakeholders, which we welcome. </p><p> On the obligations that have been set out, the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality has voted overwhelmingly in favour of the introduction of such quotas.  We would not be concerned that the obligations would erode any progress that has been made.  They would accelerate progress in areas where it is desperately required.</p></speech>

The National Youth Council made a suggestion around head 104 and the electoral register.  I do not disagree.  It is an area of increasing concern.  Will Mr. Doorley talk about how the preregistration system might work?  What user experience does he want for that system in order to encourage as many young people as possible to register?</p></speech>

We have worked over many years to encourage young people to vote and register to vote.  We get calls from young people during every election and referendum campaign who may have naturally assumed they were already registered to vote, that there was a system which they were on and they could just turn up at polling stations to vote.  Lots of young people lose out.</p> <p>  Thankfully, because of the good work done at local level by our members, we get many young people registered.  We have 54 voluntary organisations working with young people around the country and some of them, such as USI, do amazing work on college campuses.  The system is set up in such a way as to make it hard for young people to register.  The criticism is based on the old model that people were born, raised and lived in one area for their entire life and everybody knew them.  We live in a very different Ireland now where people move around.  The age of 18 is a bad age to get people on the register because a lot of young people are moving away to college, work or training. </p> <p>  Our experience has been quite frustrating.  I acknowledge the great work that is done by staff in local authorities, but the system is not set up to support young people to get on the register.  We welcome the preregistration process which would allow young people aged 16 and 17 to register.  That might be a better age at which to encourage young people to get on the electoral register.  There would have to be work done by local registration authorities to ensure that happens. </p> <p>  I do not know if it is a global phenomenon, but it is certainly an Irish phenomenon that we tend to leave things until we need to do them.  We always find there is a huge rush for young people to get on the register.  The 2020 election was phenomenal.  In my experience, the numbers of young people who wanted to register were much higher, as was the case for the referendums with which we are all very familiar.  There was a huge interest in them among young people.  The system-----</p></speech>

I apologise for cutting Mr. Doorley off.  Mr Joyce may not have time to answer all of my questions.  In my area, I see a dysfunctional postal service, in particular on halting sites, as one of the issues that affects voting cards, election literature and so on.  Is that something on which the Irish Traveller Movement has engaged with An Post?  How can we improve that?  I appreciate I have gone way over time.</p></speech>

I fully support the comments from the other national organisations.  In terms of the postal service for halting sites, in 2021 some people still do not get post directly delivered to them.  That has been a concern in the work of the Irish Traveller Movement, not just for voting but also in terms of people getting medical appointments and other serious matters.  When An Post needs to directly deliver post to a halting site or house and there are issues with people being registered, that needs to be taken up with local authorities which are the landlords of Traveller-specific accommodation.  That issue needs to be addressed.  That is my understanding.</p> <p>  I would also like to add that I concur that the current system is very outdated.  It is from the last century.  In terms of a modern Ireland, Travellers are a nomadic group in Ireland and one would think we would have a right to vote.  It is only in the past decade that people have started to feel they can vote and have the right to vote.  My father never voted, and nor did his father.  We never had a right to vote because we never had a fixed address.</p> <p>  When people talk about the last 100 years there have never been any Travellers in D&aacute;il Eireann in the history of the State.  Our voice has never been presented until recently with the appointment of Senator Eileen Flynn, and we commend the State and Taoiseach in that regard.</p></speech>

I had another meeting with some colleagues which has just finished.  I thank the witnesses for the presentations and written submissions.  My questions are to all of the witnesses.  We will probably come back to these with other people.  They should feel free to give their answers and come back at a later stage.</p> <p>  Two key elements of the legislation are how we ensure the Act and subsequent reform of the register and electoral commission maximise voter participation and, therefore, fix the problems in registration, in particular for people who, as Mr. Joyce said, have been traditionally excluded from the system. </p> <p>  Outside of marriage equality and repeal, which saw huge youth registration, there are real difficulties in terms of voter registration for young people, especially those from low income backgrounds, as well as the new Irish and minority communities.  Do any of the organisations have specific proposals they would like to see us insert into or add alongside the Bill on how to improve voter registration and electoral participation?  I ask Mr. Joyce to continue where he finished, or if his colleagues have specific proposals for how we can facilitate nomadism and a formal registration that allows Travellers to vote.</p> <p>  The powers we give the commission are important because this Bill is not going to fix everything.  If there are things that we do not think can be fixed in the Bill, the commission could, if we gave it the necessary powers, keep improving and refining the process, almost on a rolling basis.</p><p>Have Ms Lane, Mr. Doorley and others thought about whether the powers to be given the commission are sufficient or should other elements be included to allow it to keep up with work on the register and the electoral process?</p></speech>

People who are moving may find difficulties with registration because of travel.  The process is set up in a way that does not provide in a culturally appropriate way for the Traveller community, which is an indigenous group.  There will have to be some elements of change in order that this is done in a way that facilitates the cultural needs after the Traveller ethnicity recognition in 2017.  That must be considered and part of that may be today's discussion.  There must also be further consultation and dialogue as we need to look at this in a way to create dialogue.</p></speech>

Does post office box registration or some similar system provide a practical solution?  My question, I suppose, is if the witness has a preferred option.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to one example but there are other means that could facilitate voting rights in Ireland.</p> <p>  We must also give confidence to voters with regard to the political establishment.  I was highlighting the challenges at local level and the witnesses from the National Women's Council referred to the fact that many people become Deputies having gained much experience at a local level but this does not happen with the Traveller community.  There is not the same opportunity at a local level.  There must be reform and a move away from a sense of the elite.  People should be able to bring their own living experience, knowledge and insight to Parliament.  It is also really important that the Parliament reflects the community it represents, which includes Travellers, minorities, black people and women.</p> <p>  How can we do that in a system that is very competitive and where people want representatives who look like them?  That is a challenge.  The last Traveller who ran for election to a D&aacute;il seat was Ms Nan Joyce in the 1980s.  She was the mother of nine children and never wanted to run but she just felt she had no other choice.  At the time, some candidates canvassed on an anti-Traveller platform.  They were using phrases like "knackers out of Tallaght".  That was not a million years ago but during the 1980s.  Against all the odds, Nan Joyce ran for election and although she was never elected, she highlighted her plight.</p> <p>  Travellers could not vote at the time and many still cannot.  That means the people who voted for Nan Joyce were members of the settled community.  She was able to bring them with her but she could not depend on her own community, as its members were not registered.  It is an awful shame that the same position exists today.  There is much work done in the sector to register Travellers to vote and there is an onus or responsibility on the State to ensure this process is accessible.  It should also facilitate a process that works for everybody in the community, including those who move around.</p></speech>

I look at the three entities represented today and it appears that two are disenfranchised.  We are trying to advance their cause.  From women's point of view, meanwhile, we are trying to ensure we have greater female representation.</p> <p>  The submission from the Irish Traveller Movement has that really tangible feeling of otherness and this was captured extremely well in the document.  Senator Eileen Flynn is fantastic for also articulating what is that experience of otherness, and that it is incumbent on all of us to ensure we are inclusive in our society and must hear the voices that everybody must hear.  When Senator Flynn speaks, I would say the entirety of the Seanad stops and listens to her.  If we all had that experience, it would be great.  I am sure Senator Boyhan supports the view that she represents incredibly well.</p> <p>  We must empower people like Senator Flynn and give her greater visibility in getting people on board.  She is the Chair of the joint Oireachtas committee dealing with Traveller matters and it has dealt with housing and accommodation and the employment and labour market.  I welcome more of such meetings where we can hear further about those matters through the fantastic voice of Senator Flynn.</p> <p>  The witnesses have made fantastic points and the question of a citizens' assembly seems obvious.  It is shameful that the matter has not been considered.  Perhaps it has but I still want to highlight it today.  I am talking to the witnesses about their submission but it is great.</p> <p>  With regard to the National Women's Council of Ireland, I note the point in particular about political discourse, discriminatory rhetoric and hate speech.  There was recent legislation brought forward by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee.  Is it proposed that the Electoral Commission would have a right to issue take-down notices to social media?  As a woman in politics, I know we receive messages privately and publicly that refer to us with the "C" word or in a number of other ways that it is astonishing to think people consider okay.  When I report such matters, I am generally told it does not breach community standards.  There should not be anonymous accounts on the likes of Twitter because it enables people to get away with murder in what they say.</p> <p>  What is the proposal of the witnesses in this regard?  Do they want the Electoral Commission to have the power to injunct if it sees particular trends?  Should there be a threshold of tolerance, as that is generally what people in public life are told?</p> <p>  The Youth Council of Ireland has a broad church of membership.  Are there particular impediments for lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender youth and ensuring their participation in the process?  What about new communities?  What more could be done to further their participation.  I very much support this idea of preregistration and loved those comments.</p></speech>

I am trying to get the meeting back on track.</p></speech>

I welcome the Senator's comments.  As regards the way the structures are established, they are not as inclusive or engaging as one might think so that does need to change.  The Senator can see that and so can other Members.  The recommendations from the Irish Traveller Movement are very clear and moving on them would make things somewhat more open and inclusive.  That is the purpose of and rationale for why we are here today.</p> <p>  Regarding the Senator's point about Senator Flynn, there is an onus on all of us to assure and support Eileen, who is the only Traveller within the Seanad.  At the same time, it should not be on her shoulders to bring forward all the issues.  There is an onus on all of us and on all parliamentarians to support those issues and ensure that all parties progress them.  It would not be fair to put that responsibility on her alone.</p></speech>

However, there is something missing from the legislation, which is to empower the electoral commission to support the promotion of participation in elections and encourage registration.  That cannot be done by one office.  The electoral commission must have powers and resources to work with organisations that are supporting those communities, such as LGBT young people.  One of our member organisations is BeLonG To, which is doing amazing work.  If it was supported in a non-partisan way it could engage with young people from that community to ensure they are registered.  The same could be done with ethnic minorities, young Travellers, young women and young people from different groups.  We would like the Bill to be more ambitious and for the electoral commission to not solely be about making sure the technical aspects are all good.  We need to reach out.  While the electoral commission cannot do it all by itself, it should be able to work with groups, like we do at the moment.  We work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage every year to encourage young people to register but we have very limited resources for that.  There are other groups that could do that as well.  We would like the Bill to be more ambitious and to provide for more engagement through those representatives groups.</p></speech>

We are supportive of a stronger regulatory framework for online companies.  The Association of Irish Local Government recently carried out a survey of its members and found that very high numbers of councillors and elected representatives experience a high level of abuse online.  We are concerned that this will further marginalise women and add to the existing barriers to them entering or staying in political life.  We do not necessarily agree that there should be a threshold of tolerance for abuse because someone is in public office.  Why would people take the type of abuse that women, and particularly women from LGBT backgrounds or Traveller women, have to endure on an ongoing basis?  I will not say any more because I know we are tight on time.</p></speech>

This is an issue to which we will return and which we discuss a little more because some of the online abuse politicians get is horrific.  The question is how we deal with it.</p></speech>

For millennia, minority groups, young people and not least women have been prohibited from electoral participation.  While in living memory everyone has been able to participate there is a legacy of non-participation.  I completely support gender quotas and full society participation in our political system.  My question is short and may come out of left field.  What are the witnesses' positions on compulsory voting systems, such as the one in place in Australia?  I feel that would make people participate.  Do the witnesses have an opinion or position on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021060800002#F00600"><p>We do not have a position on compulsory voting, although I do think we need to do a lot more before resorting to it.  I would see that as a last resort when engaging with young people.  It is one thing to force people to vote in a compulsory voting system but the danger is that they are going there against their will and will ask why they are doing it.  It could be put in place but we have a long way to go in removing the barriers to registration for young people, encouraging young people to vote and supporting the NGOs that are doing that.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice did a lot of work in disadvantaged communities by running workshops with groups of people who did not vote and making them understand how decisions were happening at local level.  It has to be an option that governments and politicians keep in their back pocket but my initial reaction is that we have to do a lot more to enable, support and encourage citizens to vote before we take that quite drastic measure.</p></speech>

In our submission we welcomed the recommendation on pre-registration.  I was involved in many community organisations that delivered those active citizenship workshops at local level but they are poorly resourced and there is not any real investment in that kind of voter education and participation.  It is left to community and civil society organisations to try to bridge that gap.  We need investment in those mechanisms before resorting to mandatory voting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.242" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021060800002#F00800"><p>It is an interesting question.  For people living in a particular halting site where no political canvassers come in electioneering, because they do not see any value in those people voting, who would they vote for if that kind of system was brought in?  We need to go back a number of steps, build confidence, canvass and show what issues those people stand for when it comes to inequality, participation, engagement and legislation.  There is still a significant gap for those who feel very disenfranchised from the establishment.  Mechanisms, supports and structures must be put in place but it is also up to elected representatives to canvass and show that their party stands for the communities that are very far removed from society.  Travellers are still very far removed from that, as are other minority groups.  Steps need to be put in place, as well as supports and structures, to bring people along.  That kind of electoral reform is the responsibility of the establishment.</p></speech>

There are 43,000 houses in my constituency.  It is very difficult to get around to 43,000 houses.  There is an electorate of 100,000 and that would probably be higher if everybody had the vote.  Given the time constraints and everything else there is to do, it is very difficult to canvass in a particular area.  I like canvassing but looking at the map it is very difficult to get around the constituency.  That is why that might happen.  I thank the witnesses for their responses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021060800002#G00100"><p>I thank our guests.  I return to the common theme running through the three submissions, that is, promoting politician participation and encouarging and supporting candidacy.  That is what is coming back to me continuously.  There are two words jumping out at me.  Mr. Joyce has articulated this particularly well.  It is about confidence and about participation.  We see this with the demographics and the people engaged in politics.  I was a member of Gaisce, the President's Award, and was always amazed when certain groups were never represented in the early days of Gaisce.  We began to ask why.  Why was it that the private schools were engaging in this and why were we finding it difficult to get into certain communities?  We decided, therefore, to carry out an outreach programme.  Mr. Doorley spoke earlier on of the importance of outreach and engaging with people.  He talked about the Vincentians and I am very familiar with the work they did.  When the Vincentians went out to communities, they went to Traveller communities and all sorts of communities.  They went to vocational schools and all over the country.  Suddenly they got engagement and when one asked those people if they would be interested in being in politics they would say they had no education or had no confidence or they could not speak.  They would say they had nothing to say or to contribute.  That is what people feel.  Therefore, we must go way back if we want to engage in political participation.  It goes back to primary schools, back to those young kids who are recycling cans and are heads of committees.  We are giving our young boys and girls confidence to be leaders, to be vocal, to be articulate, to be able to be listened to, to be able to be valued, to be able to be authentic and, more importantly, to be believed for who they are and respected for who they are.  That is why we must go back that far, because where we give confidence, where we give support, where we give love, acknowledgement and affirmation, we build confidence.  People then have that confidence to participate in their communities and in their lives.  There is much work to be done on that and it is particularly worth saying.</p> <p>  I was interested in the commentary on the electoral register.  One of our guests, I think it was Mr. Doorley, said the commission should have control.  An independent commission should have absolute control over the administration of the register.  It is important.</p> <p>  Turning to questions, it slightly touches on the area we were talking about, that is, the registration of 16- and 17-year-olds but let us hear what our guests have to say about giving votes to 16-year-olds because once a person has a vote he or she has equity in it, he or she has an interest in it and will engage.  I am not going to be registering for something two years down the road.  Most of us do not do our tax compliance certificates until the last minute.  By contrast, when someone tells me I can have a stake in my local council or local community, in who shapes our swimming pools, who develops our sports pitches, that that person listens to me and is involved in a whole range of things, then I am interested.  Thus we must have voting with the registration, otherwise we are not going to have the take-up.</p> <p>  I will say two things and conclude.  Women's participation in politics is also a common theme running through this.  Are any of the groups aware of a circular or correspondence issued in May by the Minister on the subject of participation of women in local government in the next local elections?  I ask because the focus is on political parties and I am an Independent Senator and was an Independent councillor as well.  I noted no mention of independent-minded people in the political process.  It is all framed around engagement with the registered political parties.  If our guests are not aware of it I will send them each of these circulars before I close business today.   Secondly, our guests might tell me what single thing they think we could include in this legislation that would in some way improve it, from their perspectives.</p></speech>

The extension of voting rights to young people aged 16 and 17 is something we have long supported and campaigned for.  The Convention on the Constitution in 2013 recommended voting rights be extended to young people.  I agree with the Senator that we may have a difficulty asking a 16-year-old to register for something he or she may not be able to actually use for another two years.  We always say that what youth organisations and schools do around democracy and encouraging youth participation is great.  However, many young people say they can talk about democracy but they would like the opportunity to practise it, to actually go out and vote and express their opinions on local issues.  I fully agree with the Senator.  We would like to see the Government move ahead of the 2024 local and European elections to extend voting rights.  It does not need constitutional change and can be done via legislation.  We just saw young people in Scotland and Wales having the right to vote at 16 in their respective parliamentary elections.  It is a question of when and not if.  We really would like to see the Government move in this legislation and introduce an amendment to allow young people to vote in the local and European elections in 2024.  We have time to do that if it is done in the next year or two.</p></speech>

I will try to keep my questions brief.  Beginning with Mr. Joyce, in his opening statement he talked about there being a lack of sanctions for running candidates and elected representatives who have articulated anti-Traveller views for many years.  What sort of sanctions are needed?  Does he think those sanctions should be in this legislation?  Should the electoral commission be able to impose sanctions?  Should they be sanctions which affect electoral funding or what are his thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021060800002#G00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question and the line of questioning as well.  It should really be about holding people to account for their anti-Traveller rhetoric.  The Deputy mentioned sanctions, it is about ensuring those in public office adhere to standards and ensuring that there are protocols in the political parties, but also with the electoral commission, to ensure such behaviour does not go unnoticed.  People should be requested to refrain from any elements of rhetoric or commentary in their electioneering.  All of this can be done in a very dignified and respectful manner, where canvassing is concerned.  People certainly do not have to push communities which are already on the margins out further to try to gain votes from it.  That has happened time and time again.  It also diminishes the status of the political establishment and the ability of communities like the Traveller community and others to have confidence in it.  There must be strong sanctions around removing those who are canvassing for local or general elections.  The sanctions must be very strong to hold people to account and in some cases even to remove people from the elections if their rhetoric is directed towards any particular community.</p></speech>

I have a question for Ms Lane of the NWCI on the issue of gender quotas.  They are currently set up such that each party must have a minimum of 30% male or female candidates and that will rise to 40%.  Does the NWCI have a view on the male side of those quotas?  Are they needed?  Men have always been over-represented in Irish politics.  We have a situation now where some parties, mine for example, has a majority of female representatives.  As those quotas go up that will affect parties with majority female representatives, possibly forcing them to have more male representation on the ballot paper when males have been over-represented.</p><p>Do the witnesses think the balance between males and females regarding gender quotas is needed, or what is the view in that regard?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Lane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021060800002#H00200"><p>We want to see our Parliament, local authorities and all those decision-making spaces being reflective of who lives in and makes up our local communities and society.  The introduction of gender quotas for general elections was a blunt instrument which was required to address that persistent imbalance in our democracy.  Regarding our campaigning for the extension of gender quotas to local elections, what we are concerned with is that the two big parties, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, failed to run the minimum of 30% in the previous local elections.  Therefore, and in the context of the size of political parties, they are the main gatekeepers in respect of women getting on ballot papers.</p> <p>  We are interested in giving voters more choice.  We are also very aware of the positive impact that seeing women on posters, and especially women from minority backgrounds, has on young people and, indeed, all people living in the local community.  The issue here concerns getting more women elected, but even getting more women to run, to be part of campaigns and to take part in canvassing locally has a positive impact.  Turning to the scheme the Department has introduced to incentivise political parties to support more women and people from diverse backgrounds to run as candidates, we have seen those sorts of soft measures taking too long to achieve the change we must see in our representative democracy.  While those kinds of measures are to be welcomed, we do not believe they are going to bring about the required change.  </p> <p>  Women also face particular obstacles in running as independent candidates in local elections.  Without the backing of a party, there can be financial barriers to running and that can be very challenging in respect of canvassing and having to rely much more on the support of family and friends in that regard.  The research we did in 2019, entitled "Women Beyond the D&aacute;il: More Women in Local Government", clearly identified the barriers faced by women in rural communities in getting on the ticket, and that is where we believe the quotas can really make a difference.  The question arises of where political parties go to seek their candidates.  It has traditionally been in spaces where men continue to dominate, such as in chambers of commerce, farming organisations and sporting organisations.  Therefore, quotas would bring pressure to bear on bigger political parties to look outside the traditional pools of candidate selection.  </p></speech>

It is evident that they all want the same thing, as does this committee.  I refer to having more diverse D&aacute;il, Seanad and county council chambers.  The establishment of this commission will give us the opportunity to get a step closer to achieving that objective.  I have a quick question for each of the witnesses, and I promise to keep them brief because I know we are tight on time.</p> <p>  Starting with Mr. Joyce, I am particularly interested to hear more about challenges he spoke about regarding registration.  I would love to hear his ideas regarding how we can ensure full voter registration and encourage more participation from his community, not just as voters but also as candidates.  Turning to Mr. Doorley, I have rented in four different properties, so I understand fully how difficult it can be to ensure that mobile people, who are often younger renters, are able to easily change their addresses online to allow them to participate fully in democracy.  The online voter registration system trialled in Dublin works well from that perspective.  I had good feedback from my constituents, and especially from my younger constituents, about the system and it will be rolled out nationally as part of this legislation.  I would love to hear the views of Mr. Doorley concerning whether he thinks this initiative is and will help.  </p> <p>  Moving to the contribution made by Ms Lane, she referred to women coming up through the councils and I am one of those women.  Some 18 months ago, I represented an area along with six other councillors and they are all male.  South Dublin County Council is a progressive and fairly well gender balanced council and it is in an urban area.  Therefore, there is still an imbalance even in Dublin.  Having high percentages of women in certain areas allows us to meet our national gender quotas because it drags up the average, but it still means that areas are being left behind.  I do not believe that having 80% or 100% of councillors on some local electoral committees being female and then 0% or 20% on others is what we want.  Everyone is aiming for more gender balance overall, and I would love to hear the views of Ms Lane on that point.  </p></speech>

In developing that extension of quotas, legislation in respect of the Electoral Acts will be required to introduce the candidate selection quota for local elections.  Again, the research function of the electoral commission has potential.  Not much research exists concerning the experience of women at local government level and we must learn and understand more about that aspect and the barriers to women's participation.  We could definitely build in geographical targets to address the existing imbalances in many rural constituencies, as well as in some urban constituencies.</p> <p>  Some members of the committee may be aware that Longford Women's Link and 50:50 North West are delivering an innovative programme called 'See Her Elected', which is targeted at rural constituencies.  It is part of the voter education and participation programmes, many running with different groups, but this is really about demystifying politics for women and engaging women who may be active in community organisations at local level.  We need to try to create a greater understanding of what local government does, how important it is and how close it is to women's lives.  Mr. Joyce mentioned the abolition of town councils in 2014.  We agree that was a move that may not have been considered properly, because it was the closest level of representation.  I also refer to the impact that abolition had on the representation of women and other minority groups.  It was a step back in trying to build more opportunities for women and other minority groups to get involved in local government and decision-making at local level.  </p></speech>

Regarding the Traveller community, there are numerous issues with the whole process.  However, if we were to look at this issue just in respect of what is needed, the commission should examine setting up a group to look specifically at Travellers and other minorities that have been so disenfranchised from the political process.  The commission should explore ways of making it more accessible and inclusive by giving confidence to those communities.  That would be one positive step in the right direction.  Another aspect is the need for a more holistic approach.  Last week saw the launch of the draft anti-racism plan and associated consultation process.  As has been highlighted so often, however, anti-Traveller rhetoric has been to the forefront.</p><p>Guidelines need to be in place to ensure that type of rhetoric is not acceptable.  Political leaders cannot simply preach about this.  They need to show leadership for others to see that is not the type of society we want to live in or endorse.  That leadership is needed not only at national level but in Europe and at a global level to show we expect more from one another and we expect that leadership from our political leaders in terms of the process.  </p><p> Regarding the challenge, there needs to be an initiative or targeted intervention to support people in registering and voting.  Otherwise, it will not happen.  A targeted intervention approach is needed to support the work.  We have seen good models of that by civil society groups, specifically by some of the Traveller groups across the country.</p></speech>

Apologies for that delay.  I thank Mr. Joyce, Mr. Doorley and Ms Lane for their presentations.  I would like to hear from them rather than listen to myself speak.  It comes back to the same issues with respect to what needs to be done from the point of view of the legislation and the electoral commission.  The only pontificating I will do is on the electoral register.  We have talked for a long time and I want to get our guests' views on voter registration being automatic.  It must be within our gift to do that.  People say there are difficulties in associating personal public service, PPS, numbers with the electoral register but it cannot be beyond our ability to solve that problem.  It is not a rolling register in that it is not possible to register for part of the year.  When elections are called, a temporary register is in place which involves people having to complete a form and bring it to a Garda station to be signed.  That needs to be sorted.  If our guests have a view on that I would be delighted to hear it.</p> <p>  Reference was made to hard-to-reach communities.  Mr. Joyce represents Travellers specifically.  It is a matter of getting people to engage in the system.  What can be done to strengthen the electoral commission to enable it to do that?  I would to hear our guests' responses to those questions.</p></speech>

We think the electoral commission will have to invest significant resources in the electoral registration system.  We examined the New Zealand system some years ago.  The clear issue is that we under-resource the electoral register in Ireland.  I cannot remember the exact figures but two and a half or three times as much funding was invested in the New Zealand electoral registration system compared to our ours.  The Deputy is right in what he said.  Young people do not understand why they have to print out a form, get it signed in a Garda station and post it.  I agree with the Deputy that we make it difficult for people to register to vote.  We have always said that by linking electoral registration to PPS numbers - a person's PPS card contains his or her date of birth - people could be automatically included on the register and they would not have to go through that elaborate and difficult process.  We would definitely welcome that.  There are probably technical issues involved in doing that.  It should be our ambition in the long term to move towards a system where people are automatically registered rather than having to go through a very elaborate system.</p> <p>  We are concerned the legislation, as drafted, even though it is only the heads of the Bill, provides for the commission to only have an oversight role, make recommendations and do research.  We will not have a national register.  A question was raised by previous speakers regarding a person who moves house three or four times.  That person could end up being on the register in three or four places.  The register is incomplete and inaccurate.  We are not convinced based on what we have seen so far that the register will speak nationally to itself, as it were.  There will still be 30 separate registers and it will be difficult for people to move around in terms of the accuracy of the register.  We need to invest time and resources to make sure we have an accurate and up to date register.  That work needs to be done by the electoral commission as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

We are aware there are barriers to registration.  It was raised by many of our members in past when we examined that particular issue.  For example, a person having to go to the Garda station to get a form signed would be a big barrier for many women, for example, for those living with an addiction, on the basis of their legal status or for many of other reasons.  We would be supportive of anything that can make the process more straightforward and accessible.  The research function of the commission could offer us a greater understanding of the differences in voter turnout for men and women and what we need to be mindful of when we are planning in that respect.  We know from other jurisdictions that voter turnout among women can  be lower in local elections, even though the many functions and services provided by the local authorities are critical to women and families in local communities.  There is definitely a disconnect there.  We would be interested in having a better understanding and being able to respond, in an evidence based way, to support equality in terms of voter turnout and engagement.</p></speech>

The conversation I am having is about how far removed the Traveller community is from the political establishment and that includes the electoral register and voting.   I know first-hand that Travellers would find the process of going into a Garda station to get an application form signed quite daunting and difficult.  They would not get a sense of there being mutual respect.  The challenge we face is to make the system more accessible but also to streamline it in a way that works for everybody, not only most people.  I do not recall any research or work that has been specifically done with respect to minorities.  We have called today for the commission to appoint a minority advisory committee for Travellers and other representative groups.  Other groups can also experience a sense of being disenfranchised from the political establishment.  Such an advisory committee would help to inform the commission's work or at least start the engagement process.  We want to move to a level where people have confidence and can, as a constitutional right, vote but we need to make the system accessible to people to vote and to ensure they have the information to do that.</p></speech>

I would make a few points regarding the prelegislative scrutiny work we are doing on the Bill.  Our democracy depends on free and fair elections and for those to be healthy, effective and strong, they need to be representative.  I agree with everything Mr. Joyce said about how far removed Travellers are from the political process and establishment and voter registration and participation, and we have to charge the electoral commission to try to address that.  I come from Dublin Central and the north inner city of Dublin Central is a constituency that has in parts 60% to 65% of the population identifying as non-Irish.</p><p>In the most recent census, more than 500,000 people identified as non-Irish.  That is more than 12% of our population.  There is a massive disconnect there too.  We live in a diverse society and we need our politics to be diverse also.</p><p> With regard to the electoral commission, Mr. Joyce referred to having a minorities advisory committee or a committee with a minorities function.  Will he elaborate on how that would work, and in particular how it would address the non-Irish cohort?</p><p> In the context of gender equality and gender quotas in politics, progress has been made in certain respects.  I do not necessarily agree that it is easier for Independent female Members who are outside the party system to progress politically than would be the case if they were in parties.  That debate is for another day, however.  The quotas are applied to parties.  Would there be merit in changing it to a situation whereby quotas were assigned to the assemblies, for example, seats would be reserved at local authority level, in the D&aacute;il or in the Seanad along the lines of 40% for females, 40% for males and 20% could be a mix or some variation of those percentages?  We could remove the quota element from the organisations or the Independents and apply it to the assemblies.  This would drive political behaviour and result in assemblies that are representative, as opposed to us trying to drive activity within subsets of the political anomaly, be they political organisations or others.</p><p> I completely concur with all of the witnesses in terms of the electoral register.  We need to strengthen the functions that are being proposed.  We need a  centralised register.  We need to simplify the registration process but we absolutely need to beef up the authenticity of it also, and the verification process.  This is a hard balance to get right when one is trying to accommodate people who may be transient, to facilitate their easy access and registration, and at the same time ensure that we mitigate against the impact of voter fraud.  If the witnesses have any thoughts on how we or the electoral commission can do that, they would be very welcome.</p></speech>

I will be brief because I am conscious of the time for other members.  I absolutely agree that when we are talking about minorities we are also talking about new communities and existing communities in that context.  It is really about ensuring that it is looked at with an holistic approach with the commission, and also that it can appoint people from those minorities within the group so it is not people talking about the communities, it is the communities engaged in the process.  That would be a really positive step in trying to move from the level of people feeling disenfranchised to putting in further steps to bridge the gap between them and the political establishment.</p> <p>  On the other side, it is about people who are representative of those groups and that the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, for example, would represent the society we live in.  It is always great to see Travellers or other minority groups represented because it gives a sense of it being reflective of the true Ireland we represent.  It was highlighted that Travellers had not previously been represented in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il in the past 100 years.  That is only happening now.  While we make such a big deal about it and think it is great, we are still so far removed.  The onus should not be on any one individual, it should be on all of us to do the right thing, which is to make this space a place that is representative and inclusive of the decisions that are made about our lives.</p> <p>  There is also the point I made previously that the Seanad is formed by the elite.  Only 1% of Travellers attend third level.  If one takes this into consideration, 99% of Travellers do not go to third level.  Therefore, the process used to make up the Seanad is already restrictive and already puts certain groups at a disadvantage.  That would have to change also to make sure that while we are talking about reform it must be reform that is fit for purpose in the 21st century.</p></speech>

I welcome all-female participation in elections.  There is a lack of women representatives.  I, too, came up through the county council system.  I served six years on my local council.  The first couple of years were within a party and I was elected as an independent candidate on the second occasion.</p> <p>  I can see where a lot of the issues lie.  When I sat on the Limerick City and County Council, two young ladies left because they found it too hard to serve as councillors and try to keep their outside jobs.  Young men also left the county council, whether they had families or other commitments, because they found it very hard to keep down a job with the way the council was structured.  This is one of the things that needs to change.  We have a lot of fantastic young political minds out there and we need to make sure that they can participate.  As with any generation, one cannot put an old head on young shoulders, but we are all here to learn and every day is a learning day, no matter what age a person is.  This is what helps us to move from one day to another.</p> <p>  I fully welcome the point of view of representatives of Travellers.  I was one of the people who grew up old school, where we had the generations of people coming to our house, such as the tinsmiths and so on.  They all had their own cultures.  I am involved in cultures, through vintage and otherwise, and I would like to see all people being represented by members of their own cultures.  Col&aacute;iste na Tr&oacute;caire is a secondary school in Rathkeale.  When one mentions Rathkeale, people might imagine that it has about 54% or 55% of a Traveller community within Rathkeale, where it goes to secondary school.  With the cultures that exist, however, the females do not go to mainstream school because their cultures do not want them mixing with the different cultures.  They are accommodated through a different schooling system.  This creates a problem.  The males usually come to second level school for the first two to three years to learn trades, and then they leave school.  Less than 1% of Travellers in the State actually finish second level.  This is also an issue we need to address from their point of view.  I am delighted that this school helps and works with the different cultures and societies.  Col&aacute;iste na Tr&oacute;caire should be commended for its work in this regard.</p> <p>  On 16-year-olds having their voice, I am the father of four boys.  Many 16-year-olds would have liked to voice their opinions on the driver theory test delays recently, and especially those from the farming community.  Many young men and women in the State would have liked to voice their opinions on this at the time.  I welcome that.</p> <p>  On the electorate and voting, no one has mentioned it, but people are saying how hard it is to get onto the register.  I believe that it must be linked to a person's PPS number.  If a person is at school and working part time, the first thing he or she gets is a PPS number.  Neither has anyone mentioned how distraught people get whenever a voting card arrives into the house for a parent, a grandparent, a brother or a sister who is deceased.  I am surprised that nobody mentioned this matter.  The link with the PPS number would get rid of all that because it would be linked to a death certificate when a person passes away.  Using PPS numbers is the only way we can link such things, and then we would not cause upset to those whose relatives have passed away.</p> <p>  This could also apply when people move around.  I saw it with the general election when people would call me to say that they had received three polling cards, one to their current address and the other two to previous addresses.</p><p>They might be in the same parish but in different townlands.  If a person goes to vote and has his or her PPS number, there cannot be two, three or four votes.  It would clear up the system that we have at the moment and knock out anything to do with fraud.  Not only would we make sure that only one person votes, we would also respect the people who have passed away by making sure voting cards are not being issued for them to the upset of their families.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

It would mean that their issues would get on the agenda because as we know, the democratic system we have is designed to respond to voters' needs.  Certainly if 16- and 17-year-olds had a vote, different decisions on issues such as the driver theory test or, in the past couple of years, the leaving certificate might have been made.</p> <p>  I also agree with Deputy O'Donoghue on linking the PPS number to the voting card.  I have had personal experience of receiving voting cards for deceased members of my family.  It is very upsetting.  It is not the fault of the local authorities.  Unfortunately, they do not have a proper system in place.  Anything that would improve the system and allow people to be taken off the register when they have passed away would be very welcome.</p> <p>  I also agree that we need to get our local authorities and our Parliament to represent citizens.  There are particular issues for young people in terms of getting on to local authorities.  Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned some councillors in his area who had to step down because of work commitments.  We need to look at supporting young people to get involved in politics but also at supporting them once they get there.  I would certainly agree with that at both the local and national level.  We need to get the best.  All of the committee members put themselves forward for election and they now have a mandate.  We need to ensure that all of our citizens have such an opportunity to go forward.  We certainly support young people's right to run.  Whether they get elected is up to the electorate but if they are elected, they should be supported to fulfil their mandate.</p></speech>

It is now my turn to ask questions.  In your opening statement, Mr. Doorley, you said that 22% of young people are not registered to vote, which means that 78% are registered.  That actually seems quite high.  What would be the average level of registration among the various age cohorts?  Of the 78% that are registered, how many actually go out and vote?  I have had the experience of knocking on the doors of homes where there are five or six names on the electoral register.  The parents are still living there but their four children have long moved out.  The parents say that their children come home to vote because their voting cards still arrive there but I suspect that a lot of the time those voting cards do not get used because the children have moved away and might not even be living in the country anymore.  Does Mr. Doorley know how many of the 78% that are registered actually turn out to vote?  Has the NYCI had the opportunity to do that kind of research?</p></speech>

We do not have that data.  The CSO conducted research in 2011 looking at the turnout among different age cohorts and found that among young people, it was at 63% or 64%.  We would argue that the electoral commission should be given the mandate and resources to conduct the kind of research to which the Chairman refers.  We do not know the turnout among young people or among Travellers or other minority ethnic groups, for example.  It would be really helpful if the commission had the resources to find that out.</p></speech>

We could suggest that it examine voter turnout among those young people who are registered.  Over the past couple of years, we have seen a lot of youth engagement with the political system.  I am thinking of the climate strikes in particular, as well as the two referendums on marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment.  The come home to vote campaign was particularly interesting in that context.  Would Mr. Doorley agree that there is currently greater youth engagement in politics than was previously the case?</p></speech>

Having been involved in this work for a number of years, I would say that in the past five or six years we have seen a big upswing in the numbers of young people engaged in politics.  The referendums demonstrated to young people that voting makes a difference and that they can influence the shape or direction of the country.  That was a good demonstration for them and in the last general election in 2020, the numbers of young people who engaged with us in terms of registering to vote and making sure they had a vote was much higher than in previous elections.  A great deal of work had to be done by our member organisations, particularly USI, at local level in universities to get young people onto the electoral register within a very tight timeframe.  We believe that we need to invest more in the electoral register.  I agree with those Deputies and Senators who said that we need an accurate register that mitigates fraud or wrongdoing but that is only possible if we invest in it.  The electoral register is so important.  Committee members know, as do I, that there is nothing as disheartening as making the effort to vote by going to a polling station and then being told by the polling officer that one is not on the register.  That is very disillusioning.  We need to invest in the register.</p></speech>

On that same point, Mr. Joyce gave us a figure of approximately 50,000 in terms of the size of the Traveller community.  Does he have any idea how many Travellers are on the electoral register?  Has any research been done on that?  If people are on the register and their voting card arrives, there is a possibility they will vote but if they are not on the register, they are never going to vote.  It is a fairly obvious thing to say but if we can get people registered, that will make a difference.  Is there greater engagement among the younger cohort of the Traveller community in terms of those things that are driving young people to become more active in politics?  Has Mr. Joyce had the opportunity to research that?</p></speech>

In general, young people can feel very removed from the political system.  That can relate to the make-up of our Parliament and the fact that here are not many young people in the D&aacute;il.  In terms of young Travellers, the potential is there in terms of confidence, engagement and participation but more times than not they are not asked to engage.  When one talks to Travellers in their homes and their caravans one finds that they have strong opinions about what is happening around them and what structural changes they would like to see.  A significant amount of work is required to bring the political system into a new age that is reflective of the society it represents.  At the moment, it does not reflect society.  There is potential and there are many different initiatives underway but those initiatives are not really engaging young Travellers.</p> <p>  The Irish Traveller Movement is developing a national youth participation strategy because we do not see young Travellers participating in the spaces they should be in.  Young Travellers are further disadvantaged within the Traveller community.  They are not engaging and they are not being asked to engage.  Being here and being part of this process allows me to raise issues on behalf of the Irish Traveller Movement, which is really important.  I see this as a good initial step but would love to see a lot more happening in terms of the key recommendations from today.</p></speech>

I must cut myself short now in order to be fair to everybody else.  I apologise to Ms Lane.

It is incumbent on every politician and everyone in society to stand up and call that out when they see it happening.

A process would have to be undertaken to develop legislation to address those geographical disparities and to not disadvantage independent candidates.  We already spoke about the incentive scheme recently introduced for political parties to support and motivate changes in behaviour in respect of supporting more women to run in the local elections in 2024.  I reiterate that we have had previous incentive schemes and voluntary commitments.  People will be aware that there was such a voluntary commitment concerning State boards and it took 25 years to come to fruition.  That was only the average to achieve a gender balance on State boards.</p> <p>  There may be opportunities in this regard.  If it is not practical or if there is no agreement to extend the existing quotas for local elections to general elections, what other mechanisms are at our disposal?  We have presented some options in that regard.  The possibilities include investment in the political parties and tying that more to sanctions and more robust reporting of how that public money is being used to support the participation of women and other minority groups in political parties.  A decent amount of supplementary funding could be made available for having reached a target or quota after the local elections in 2024.</p> <p>  We believe work in this regard must start happening now in order to give the women we hope will be selected in greater numbers in all the different constituencies a real winning chance.  Some of the feedback we have had from women candidates referred to them feeling that they were not on a winnable ticket or that they were added too late.  That is not doing the women involved any justice or doing our democracy any service.  Therefore, there are several options to address the situation and achieve the desired outcome.  If it might be helpful, we have written up information in that regard that we could submit to the committee, based on engagement with our members and academics in this area.</p> <p>  Returning to a previous point, we are very concerned not only with the imbalance that continues to persist but also the retention issue for women councillors and younger men, in particular, who have caring responsibilities and who are trying to manage other paid employment as well.  We believe that aspect needs serious attention in the run-up to the local elections in 2024 to ensure we do not see the gender representation gap widening even more.</p></speech>

The local and European elections are coming up in three years' time.  Some people may have the right to vote in general elections and-or referendums, but many may not.  Therefore, there is a great opportunity in 2024 to allow people residing here, and who may not have Irish citizenship, to vote in local and European elections.  The legislation as drafted gives the electoral commission the mandate to promote votes in referendums, but not the mandate to promote votes in elections.  We think that may be a bit of a gap.  We would love to see the electoral commission having a proactive role in encouraging people from different backgrounds, including those who may have language difficulties, and background to participate in the local elections and, if they are citizens of a European Union country, in the elections for the European Parliament.  There could, therefore, be a role to be undertaken in that regard.</p> <p>  Turning to the electoral register, ensuring that it is accurate and up to date involves having a national register.  Then we must invest more in that national register, because we do not do that now.  It is starved of resources and the technical and human resources required will necessitate additional investment.  I say that because we do not want to set up this body to fail in respect of it not having the resources to do what it is supposed to do.</p></speech>

Younger people have been represented quite well across the party political spectrum in Waterford, but women not so much.  I echo some of the earlier comments of Deputy O'Donoghue, however.  Many of the people elected at the same time as me in 2009 did not seek re-election when their terms ended in 2014, while many of those elected in 2014 did not seek re-election in 2019.  It was mostly because of the structure and timing of meetings in the context of trying to hold down another job at the same time and the aspect of online abuse, which increased significantly from 2014 onwards.</p> <p>  It is difficult to try to balance the competing interests at council level in respect of meeting times.  We traditionally had meetings in Waterford at 5 p.m., and then they moved back to 4 p.m.  Since I have been elected to Seanad, those meetings are now being held during the day.  I would not be able to attend those meetings and fulfil my obligations if I was on the council now.  The organisations represented here today could take it upon themselves, therefore, to engage with each other and try to come up with ideas concerning the best times for meetings.  I refer to a system that could facilitate the engagement of young people and women, in particular, in politics.</p> <p>  I echo the comments regarding the mobile youth vote.  It is probably difficult to nail down people when they are 18 years old.  Would Mr. Doorley agree that if we reduce the age of preregistration to 16 or 17 that there could be significant engagement at secondary school level to get people registered in advance?  Those students are a captive audience and it is the major opportunity to preregister them.  Turning to Ms Lane, what measures, over and above the quotas, would she like to see implemented?  She touched on this area in her last answer when she mentioned the penalty in the supplementary funding.  Gender quotas are working for national politics because there are penalties for political parties if they do not meet them.  Such penalties do not exist at local level because funding is not linked in that regard.  Ms Lane mentioned supplementary funding, however, and I ask her to tease out that aspect a little more.  I think that is a very good suggestion.</p></speech>

We have always said that.  People get lost through the administrative cracks then and they are not sure if they should register where they live or where they are going to college, working or doing an apprenticeship.  Therefore, preregistering young people at 16 years of age would allow work to be done through schools and youth organisations to encourage those young people to register and we would welcome that change.</p><p>We will be asking the Government to go a step further and extend voting rights to young people aged 16 and 17 for local and European elections.  That is a matter for the Government.  I agree with the Senator about pre-registration.  It would make a difference.  I also agree about encouraging young people to go into politics and democratic representation.  We need to look at the structure of local councils, in particular, and even town councils, as other colleagues have mentioned.  We should make it easier for people to take that first step on the ladder.  That brings us to the thorny issue of whether being a councillor is a part-time job or a full-time job with a part-time salary.</p></speech>

They have to make the decision to commit themselves to politics or earn a full-time wage.  Employers can facilitate people but, as the Senator said, that would not be possible if every meeting is at 2 p.m. and the aspiring politician has other tasks to do.  There is an issue there.  We should look at how local authorities are structured and whether being a local councillor is a full-time or part-time job, and councillors should be paid accordingly.</p></speech>

The meeting times are difficult and challenging.  People come from different backgrounds and have different responsibilities and commitments.  If we try to ensure access can be facilitated, it might get around some of those issues.  We hope to begin a process and piece of work with local authorities around developing more family-friendly policies, for example, making it no longer acceptable to extend a meeting for a further hour with ten minutes' notice.  That compromises people who have caring responsibilities and other obligations that must be planned for in advance.  Practical things can be brought into protocols and procedures to facilitate councillors with caring responsibilities.</p> <p>  There are many other measures we need to take on beyond the quotas.  The Senator said he was interested in supplementary funding.  We could, for example, look at 10% or 15% additional funding if a party runs 40% more women candidates that it did in the previous local election.  We could see where parties were at in 2019 and compare their performance in 2024.  That may remove an issue for Independents because they could also receive additional funding if women Independents are elected.  That is something we could tease out further.</p></speech>

We welcome Barry Andrews, MEP, Ciaran Cuffe, MEP, and Colm Markey, MEP.  Maria Walsh, MEP, is running slightly late and she will join us shortly.  For the information of members, Mr. Cuffe is due to leave at 1:30 p.m.  We will take opening statements from all MEPs but as Mr. Cuffe has to leave, if members have questions specifically for him, they might ask them before 1:30 p.m.</p> <p>  Regarding privilege, witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence that they give to the committee.  This means that a witness has a full defence in a defamation action or in regard to anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third party or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, so they may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to publication by witnesses outside of the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their initial contribution, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If they are directed to cease giving evidence by the Chair in regard to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  We will go straight to MEPs for opening remarks and, with the agreement of witnesses, we will then go back to members for questions.  I ask Mr. Andrews to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is great to be here.  It is an honour to have the opportunity to share ideas on these important topics with some former Oireachtas colleagues in the Seanad.  It is great to see MEPs engaging more regularly with the Oireachtas and it will be an ongoing challenge to establish much closer links, not just with the European Parliament, but with other EU institutions in the months and years ahead.</p> <p>  The trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, enjoyed a huge majority in the European Parliament following a reasonably short period of scrutiny, but a much longer period of scrutiny than had applied at Westminster.  We are now making progress on the establishment of committees.  Incredibly, there are 19 committees under the Joint Partnership Council and ten of those are specialised trade committees.  There is a vast institutional architecture but all of that is officials, not elected individuals.</p> <p>  I want to comment on the parliamentary scrutiny envisaged for the TCA in the first instance.  At the moment, three strands are emerging from the European Parliament in this respect.  The first that is expected is what is called the delegation, so we have delegations to the US, China and South Africa - the delegation of which I am a member - and a delegation to the UK will be set up fairly shortly.  Under the TCA, there will also be a joint parliamentary assembly and it is possible that the delegation will comprise the MEPs who will take part in the joint parliamentary assembly.  However, the powers of that joint parliamentary assembly are fairly limited to being informed of what is going on and to being informed about major changes that might take place, such as the suspension of some parts of the agreement.</p> <p>  The third strand is what is going to replace the current UK coordination group and what had been the Brexit steering group.  What is on the table at the moment is that there will be a new scrutiny group in the European Parliament, and it will comprise the chair of the trade committee, the chair of the foreign affairs committee and the chair of the UK delegation, together with 15 rapporteurs from different committees, and maybe one member of each of the political groups.  It is very important that one of the 13 Irish MEPs, at the very least, is present on that scrutiny group.  It will only be a temporary group lasting perhaps one or two years but, at the moment, there is no Irish MEP on the UK coordination group.  Given the critical nature of everything that is emerging from the implementation of the TCA and the withdrawal agreement, that is a significant deficit and one we urgently have to correct.</p> <p>  In terms of the protocol, which is the second item on the agenda, there is a very important meeting tomorrow between Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and David Frost.  We are all very familiar with the tensions that currently exist between the two parties.  Two articles have appeared in the newspapers in the past couple of days, one by David Frost and the other this morning from Vice President &Scaron;efovi.  It does not augur well for the meeting tomorrow.  Nevertheless, some progress is being made on some of the key issues relating to the protocol.  To be honest, and I do not say this lightly, I do not believe David Frost is a trustworthy interlocutor.  He and his cohort have consistently underplayed the significance of Brexit to the island of Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  They have consistently ignored warnings about the effects of Brexit on the island of Ireland.</p><p>Mr. Frost and his team rammed through the Northern Ireland protocol in order to get Brexit done and now they are blaming the EU and saying they did not understand it, despite the protocol being negotiated in English between people speaking English as their second language and Mr. Frost and the UK Government.  None of this is very credible and it does not augur well.  Unfortunately for Ireland, we run the risk of becoming collateral damage in the increasing tensions between the EU and the UK.  All of us want to see this relationship being based on partnership rather than rivalry but there are many examples of the UK indicating that it does not want to go down that path and that is very worrying.  As far as I am concerned, there is no alternative to the protocol.  The EU has demonstrated a willingness to exercise all flexibilities possible within the protocol.  The UK Government has to come to the table in good faith and it has not done so thus far.</p><p> The final issue on which we have been asked to comment is the issue of EU supports to assist Ireland in dealing with the challenges of Brexit.  From a European Parliament point of view, the key issue here is the Brexit adjustment reserve.  The proposal for the allocation of funding across member states was recently voted through in committee.  This emerged from the meeting of the European Council in July 2020.  Happily, Ireland is going to receive the greatest amount of funds from the Brexit adjustment reserve, an allocation of just over &euro;1 billion.  How that will be applied in Ireland is a matter for the Government.  We will have to see how it operates.  This reserve will be passed in the European Parliament.  Trilogues, the discussions between the EU member states and the Parliament, will happen from 17 July on.  I hope the reserve will be in place by the end of this month.</p><p> The Oireachtas, and the Seanad in particular, has a crucial role to play in EU scrutiny.  After Brexit, there needs to be much greater visibility of EU legislation, proposed directives and regulations at Oireachtas level at the earliest possible opportunity.  This will allow for upstream analysis of what is to come.  There have been really good examples of this in recent times.  For example, I had engagement with Member of the Oireachtas on the digital services act and engagement on the digital markets act with Senator Malcolm Byrne and others.  We need to see an awful lot more of this.  I really welcome this engagement.</p></speech>

I am speaking from Strasbourg.  It is a plenary week so it is a busy time and a lot of debates and voting are going on.  One of the issues that has become abundantly clear to me over the last two years, for which I have had the honour of being an MEP, is that the big issues of our time do not recognise national boundaries.  Issues such as globalisation, immigration, Covid and the climate crisis transcend national boundaries and demand regional co-operation and co-ordination.  We have certainly seen that with Covid over the past 18 months.  The voice of history will show that we need to co-ordinate in much greater detail than we have heretofore.  Brexit goes against the tide of the major movements of our time.</p> <p>  The Chair has seen my written statement but I will summarise a couple of issues I raised within it.  Mr. Andrews has already spoken about the Brexit adjustment reserve.  Within the committees of the European Parliament, we have been putting on the green jersey to ensure that Ireland receives the funding it deserves.  I am pleased that approximately &euro;1 billion of the &euro;5 billion fund will come to Ireland.  There were certainly many voices from the other 26 member states arguing that they should benefit from the Brexit adjustment reserve.  My eyebrow certainly raised over some of the demands other countries made in that regard.  A great deal of the money will go to fisheries.  My colleague, Grace O'Sullivan, has argued for stronger support for the small-scale, sustainable fishers of Ireland.</p> <p>  In some of the committees on which I sit, including the Parliament's energy committee, significant impacts from Brexit are already being seen.  For instance, we have an electricity interconnector with the UK.  This is not operating as well as it was before Brexit.  That results in higher prices for electricity both for people in the UK and for people in Ireland.  That is a very practical consequence of Brexit.  </p> <p>  Back in April, I voted for the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  I am pleased that went through the Parliament but it is worrying to hear the constant statements from London to the effect that the Northern Ireland protocol is not sustainable and not fit for purpose.  I think about some of the announcements we have seen made without consultation.  The surprise extension until October of arrangements with regard to pets travelling between Northern Ireland and the UK seems like a small thing, but there was no consultation on this as far as we know.  We have seen quite a bit of grandstanding, which only exacerbates the existing sensitivities that have arisen from efforts to balance the Good Friday Agreement with Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol.  Perhaps a little less ideology and a little more co-ordination from the UK Government would be helpful. </p> <p>  I note that Edwin Poots, the new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, visited Dublin last week.  That was encouraging but I would remind him that, regardless of Brexit, we live on a shared island and that the future lies in regional co-operation and not in the continuation of extreme grandstanding.  Brexit and the future relationship between the UK and Ireland will disproportionately affect the people, and particularly the young people, of Northern Ireland.  Their voices must be heard in all of this.  We have seen the generous support the Irish Government is giving to allow the Erasmus programme to continue without interruption to allow young people who are studying and training to continue to travel and to extend these links between Ireland and other regions around Europe.  Travel broadens the mind.  The more we open up our borders and extend the hand of friendship and of trade to all European countries, the better placed we will be.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Markey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairperson and all of the members of the committee for inviting us to this engagement his afternoon.  It is very important.  Since joining the European Parliament, through my membership of various committees, including those on agriculture, transport and tourism and fisheries, I have found myself engaged at the coalface of the key issues involved in the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  I will focus on a couple of examples of the issues I have encountered.</p> <p>  There are many issues of concern in the area of agriculture and food.  One in particular relates to products of mixed origin, such as milk which is collected on both sides of the Border before being pooled and processed together to make cheese, milk powder or Bailey's, for instance.  Likewise, there are products such as whiskey, which traditionally moved seamlessly over and back across the Border at the various stages of processing and bottling.  Where products are sourced, processed and packaged exclusively in either the South or the North, their status is clear.  However, where products are sourced or processed on both sides of the Border, their status is not clear.  They may not qualify for trade agreements and, therefore, may be subject to higher tariffs that undermine the idea of an all-Ireland economy.  The UK has taken a flexible approach in this area.  I have questioned the EU's approach and urge the Government to ensure the EU takes an equally flexible approach.</p><p> As regards fishing, the most significant problem is the disproportionate loss of fish quotas, which has created great difficulties for an already struggling industry.  The Government must continue to work at Council level for a rebalancing of the burden sharing and to explore practical opportunities such as total allowable catches, TACs, under the Common Fisheries Policy to adjust share of fishing rights to help countries worst affected.  I look forward to the report from the Government seafood task force and the recommendations it makes.  Ultimately, fishermen want to fish and talk of compensation or decommissioning of boats holds no appeal.</p><p> In the area of transport and trade, there have been successes and challenges.  The enhanced ferry capacity to mainland Europe which has been delivered by public and private investment has been extremely effective.  However, since the start of the year, there has been a significant reduction in trade between Britain and the Republic.  A corresponding increase in trade with Northern Ireland might suggest it is being used as a back door.  The Government and its agencies need to offer support to importers and exporters, particularly in navigating the complexities of customs clearance.  The removal of derogations in the coming months will further increase the regulatory burden on these businesses.  </p><p> Previous speakers referred to the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve.  I have questioned the motivation of some countries who sought, if you like, to reopen the allocation key for the reserve.  I pointed out in a committee that it was something of a cash grab.  It seemed in some way to change the direction of travel of this.  While the European Parliament has agreed its position and that is to be voted through this week, I remain concerned that when it goes to trialogue the Council of Ministers will seek to change the allocations.  It is vital the Government continues to defend the Irish position and does not let the allocation be eroded in any way.</p><p> These issues serve as examples of the practical difficulties we have encountered.  As the Member of the European Parliament who lives closest to the Border, I believe the biggest concern of people I know, North and South, is the re-emergence of any semblance of a border, economically or socially.  Recent comments and events have served to reignite these fears.  Suggestions of alternative approaches serve to undermine the structures that have already been painstakingly agreed and are underpinned by international agreements.  This approach is being championed by people who are uncomfortable with how effective the protocol and withdrawal agreement can be and have placed ideology ahead of practical solutions.  Those interested in dividing rather than uniting, looking to undermine rather than build out current structures and concerned with personal attacks rather than finding workable solutions need to stop playing politics with the Northern Ireland protocol and get down to the critical work of forging real solutions for the unique status that Northern Ireland has and which such people have not focused on making enough of.  I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.</p></speech>

It is great to have him at the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.333" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#D00300"><p>I am delighted to join my European Parliament colleagues and representatives to discuss how we can work together.  I commend the committee on the work it is doing, particularly the examination of issues concerning our citizens and communities as the committee develops its interim report over the coming weeks.  I look forward to the ongoing conversation we will have.  The joy of speaking last among the European Parliament representatives is that my colleagues have covered a great deal of the monumental work going on in Brussels, where I and my Ireland Inc. colleagues are sitting, Strasbourg and our respective constituencies.</p> <p>  By ratifying this agreement, we provided certainty to our businesses and citizens and protected Ireland as a whole from the damaging consequences of a no-deal outcome.  The final outcome, as echoed by all colleagues, was a great example of Ireland Inc. working together and coming together.  All 13 Irish MEPs put on the green jersey and voted in favour of its adoption.  It was a welcome stance given Brexit is far from over and our communities still need us to stand together to protect the interests of all communities and businesses throughout the island.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, in the early weeks of this year, we saw some difficulties in the management of Brexit and Article 16.  I commend the swift backdown by the Commission, which was necessary and welcomed.  It should never have happened and needs to be acknowledged but to focus on this and distract from the significant support we have received from the Commission and fellow EU member states would dismay me.  The support we have received since the Brexit vote in 2016 shows the power, co-operation and strong relationships between our representatives, Government Ministers, Senators, including the committee members, local representatives who are the focal point of connecting to our constituencies and businesses, and our EU colleagues.  Not only did Europe put Ireland&rsquo;s concerns at the heart of Brexit negotiations, it has also pledged to deliver significant financial support to offset the impact of Brexit.  It is imperative that we, across all political houses, continue to work together to achieve what the agreement sets out in terms of protecting our citizens and businesses.</p> <p>  In terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, we will see continued engagement this week, as my colleagues alluded to.  We will hopefully see both sides take stock of the progress made and look at the holdbacks our communities are experiencing on the ground.  My colleague, Mr. Markey, alluded to some of those.  The continued intensive engagement between the EU and the UK on the implementation of the protocol is welcome.  The shared goal must be achieved, even if it is tiresome to watch given that not everybody seems to be on the same page at all times.  It is in the best interests of our communities and businesses that we, as representatives in the European Parliament, continue to engage and look forward to progress.</p> <p>  Barry Andrews highlighted the Brexit adjustment reserve.  There is &euro;5 billion in the pot and it is necessary that we draw down as much as has been allocated.  I will walk through some other areas that I feel we can rely on and lean into.  Not only will the Brexit adjustment reserve support economic sectors, business and local communities and, as Mr. Markey highlighted, our fishing communities by funding employment schemes, training and retraining, it will also support the infrastructure, particularly for custom and security checks, that Brexit could, and likely will, impose on us.  It will support fisheries control, certification and authorisation regimes for products, which essentially means, as far as practical, it will help to minimise the distribution movement of Irish goods.</p> <p>  Ireland is the biggest benefactor of the reserve and stands to lose the most, particularly in our fisheries sector.  We are projected to get an initial fund of approximately &euro;1 billion, as colleagues have said.  A total of &euro;109 million of that fund has been allocated to support our fishing industry.  I am working on this with Colm Markey and Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan on this, with other organisations.  We are not just representing large fishing industries but also our small fishing communities to ensure that in regions such as our constituency, specifically places such as Arranmore Island and Killybegs in County Donegal and Rossaveal in County Galway, this money is released quickly, invested wisely and not held back by bureaucratic conversations.</p><p>It needs to get down to the communities that it is serving.  There are a couple of other funding initiatives that the EU offers us and a good example of an opportunity to fundamentally change the way we work and move towards more sustainable industry is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which was set up to offset the impact of changes in the world trade patterns and the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  It specifically offers funding to member states to support displaced workers and those who are self-employed to move towards sustainable industries and to support measures to provide flexible working arrangements, childcare allowances and mobility allowances.  This is key in the next stages of the post-Brexit and post-pandemic period in developing the skills needed in the digital age, particularly across the region of the European Parliament's Midlands&ndash;North-West constituency.  It is a great opportunity and we cannot pass these by.  We have benefited positively from the EU funding in the past.  For example, in recent years we have seen funding for research and development through the Horizon funding programme for our third level sector and through the EU INTERREG programmes, such as the PEACE programme, which focuses on building community relations in particular among young people, which is key to this.  I know that Mr. Cuffe also alluded to this.  Youth is our focal point in this and it is great to hear Ireland Inc in the European Parliament also echoing that same sentiment.  With that, I will work with representatives and agencies to ensure that our citizens feel that support.<br/><br/>Finally Chair, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament, it is really worth highlighting and commending the Government and in particular my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, on his work in guaranteeing young people in Northern Ireland continuing access to the Erasmus+ programme.  This programme involves, as many members will already know, learning mobility and cross-border co-operation projects for millions of Europeans of all ages and backgrounds.  It is a fantastic programme with many benefits to young people in particular, giving them the opportunity to study, train and gain experience abroad and <i>vice versa</i>.  We have seen that footfall here in Ireland.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the British Government refused the opportunity to continue to support such a programme despite continued participation being offered by the EU.  Our neighbours decided to leave and we must deal with the footfall.  The decision by the Irish Government supports all students in Northern Ireland being able to participate regardless of their citizenship and students will have access to the Erasmus+ programme by temporarily registering with the Irish higher education institutions.  If anybody is watching this meeting online as this meeting is being streamed, is studying in Northern Ireland and have not quite heard of the Erasmus+ programme, please check it out.<br/><br/>I will park it there, Chair and colleagues, and I very much look forward to a fruitful discussion and hope that this will be continued into the future.  I also want to have acknowledged in the committee&rsquo;s report and in these conversations that we should also continue to engage with our local representatives and bring them into this conversation by having the engagement and the experience of those who are working with our community members and citizens on a daily basis, through seeing the footfall and issues at hand.  It is very important that we hear their voices at all of the stages of Brexit that are ahead of us.  I thank the committee and I appreciate the opportunity to speak with its members.</p></speech>

I welcome our MEPs and I thank them for their contributions.</p> <p>It is very reassuring, without being patronising in any way, that we have such a level of competence on the Irish team.  As some of the guests have said and indeed all believe, it is important that we keep that active link between our Parliament and Europe not only in personal interactions on a regular basis but structurally as well, in looking at directives, regulations etc.</p> <p>  First, I detect in a number of speakers a great pessimism around the protocol and perhaps a small degree of optimism towards the end.  I just hope that we can have an agreement on the protocol that will not prejudice our all-Ireland free trade arrangements or, in other words, will not return any sort of a Border.  Can I ask our guests to comment again on whether they believe we can reach an outcome there and as to how this is progressing?  One would like to think that despite the bellicose language etc., that it would.  </p> <p>  On the Brexit adjustment fund, I got the initial impression that it was without labels but it seems that it is broken down to the sectors in which it must be spent.  It would seem that a section of this must be spent on fisheries which nobody will object to, as such.  I was thinking that the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which will be coming into place might suggest then that the Brexit adjustment reserve could be spent in different areas and that there would be a need for level of national discretion on that.</p> <p>  Nobody referred to it directly but do the witnesses believe there is a hope that we can arrive at the veterinary agreement with Britain?  The consensus seems to be that we will.  This would have enormous implications for free trading and the for the non-intrusive movement of goods which would be important.</p> <p>  I was very disturbed to hear what my neighbour, Mr. Markey, had to say about products sourced on both sides of the Border and I ask that he might elaborate on that, please?  That would have enormous implications for the village in which I live, in that there is a Lakelands Dairies facility there, which is the only substantial employer with the best quality jobs in the area, of which there are a few hundred up and downstream.   We would be worried if there were difficulties with any of those jobs because Lakelands Dairies has plants on the Northern side and the milk flows in both directions.  It would be very disturbing if anything was to go wrong there and Mr. Markey might elaborate on that point.</p> <p>  Is there a risk that were the protocol talks to break down fully and go badly, that might endanger the entire trade and co-operation agreement?  Implicitly it would but could it take the whole deck of cards down and set us back a very long way?  Where would the witnesses see us then at that point?  Let us hope and pray that that does not happen.  </p> <p>  Those are just some of the questions that occurred to me.  I find this a very worthwhile engagement and we are going to continue this in the Seanad, as some of our guests and  members will be aware already.  Ms Walsh and Mr. Markey are already aware that we hope to have a full plenary Seanad session on 19 July with MEPs from the Midlands&ndash;North-West constituency and moving then to each of the other national constituencies, month by month or every few months.  This should also be an exciting exchange and has great potential.  I thank our guests for this opportunity.  It is good to be here and I look forward to their responses later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#E00400"><p>I thank our witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.  I will try to be succinct but many issues have been covered.  I echo Senator O'Reilly's point that the engagement between the Seanad and MEPs is important.  I will start by referring to Mr Markey's point about enhanced ferry capacity.  Unsurprisingly, of course, I will mention that it remains increasingly important to continue to invest in Rosslare where most of that ferry capacity is being provided.</p> <p>  Coming to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, which follows Senator O'Reilly's question around allowing a certain level of national discretion, I equally take the view that we should also encourage as much national discretion as possible when it comes to CAP.  </p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe made reference to the issue of pets and to fisheries.  Two of the issues that have come up before this committee in a big way and are of concern relate to some of the rules of origin issues in respect of flour and steel.</p><p>The question I have for the MEPs in this regard relates to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund and how it may be allocated, as well as other measures we can introduce.  There are obviously very serious cost implications for flour and steel as a result of Brexit.  Can the fund be used to offset some of that cost?<br/><br/>Ms Walsh made important points about the Erasmus programme and Horizon Europe funding.  I welcome that the Commission has now dropped its plans to try to exclude the UK from certain aspects of Horizon Europe funding.  What should we be doing or recommending to Irish higher education institutions and businesses in terms of getting a larger chunk of the Horizon Europe cake, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario where the UK may not be engaged to the same extent it was before with that programme?<br/><br/>An issue I have raised many times and that is of concern to the committee relates to the data adequacy decision.  Even though there is a preliminary adequacy decision concerning exchange of data between the EU and the UK, the European Parliament has expressed concerns in that regard and some of those concerns seem to be legitimate.  One or more of the witnesses might comment on that.<br/><br/>Finally, Mr. Andrews mentioned the article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>today by Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, in which the Commissioner said the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly if the UK acts unilaterally.  It is important the EU sets out its position clearly in this regard.  If the UK does act unilaterally, what are Mr. Andrews's fears about what could happen?  What action should we be recommending to the Government in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Andrews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#F00300"><p>I thank Senators O'Reilly and Byrne for their questions.  I will not touch on everything they raised but will work through as many of the points as best I can.  The scrutiny aspect is very important.  When I was in the Oireachtas, there was a dedicated subcommittee dealing with the scrutiny of EU proposals.  I understand that function has been farmed out to the various committees.  In other member state parliaments that scrutiny is done by an upper house.  In Finland, for example, the Upper House is entirely dedicated to looking at EU regulations and directives and acts as a sort of proxy European Parliament within the Finnish Parliament.  There really is an argument for Ireland to scale up that scrutiny because we scaled it back from where it had been when there was a dedicated subcommittee of the European affairs committee.</p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly asked what the outcome of the discussions around the protocol might be.  A really sensitive point is coming in the next few weeks, when the grace period in regard to sausage meat and other meat products is due to expire at the end of June.  We have seen before that the UK is willing to make unilateral extensions to grace periods.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi indicated in his article today that the European Commission would act swiftly if that happened.  Tomorrow's meeting of the EU-UK Partnership Council is really critical.  The question of whether the UK will again ignore the agreement it signed up to and extend grace periods unilaterally will become clear very quickly thereafter.  Members may recall that the extension of the previous grace period from the end of March was triggered in the first week of March.  The UK Government explained on that occasion that additional time was needed.  Today is 8 June and something similar has not happened yet.  This would tend to suggest that the UK is prepared to agree something in regard to the grace period in this instance instead of acting unilaterally, which would be positive.</p> <p>  On the question of whether the whole EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement is at risk, the disputes arising from the protocol and the withdrawal agreement could end up in the European Court of Justice.  As members know, there are infringement proceedings arising from the earlier unilateral extension and that matter could go all the way to the European Court of Justice.  That is a potential remedy but I am doubtful as to whether it will resolve anything.  Many member states are very anxious about the integrity of the Single Market and the implications of the UK ignoring its obligations under the withdrawal agreement.  In effect, a sort of slow puncture in the Single Market is being created if the UK does not implement what it has signed up to do.</p> <p>  On sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, measures and veterinary issues, there is an agrifood forum in which DG SANTE and the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are engaged on those issues.  The EU has provided a very good solution whereby there would be a temporary alignment until such time as the UK feels it needs to diverge from the EU's SPS standards relating to food safety and animal health.  We will see what happens in that regard.</p> <p>  Before letting the next speaker in, I will refer briefly to the point raised by Senator Byrne relating to the data issue.  I have been interested in that for some time and it is a real worry.  From a practical point of view, Ireland really wants the data adequacy decision to be made.  The example we have all heard about is the Fermanagh accountant doing payroll for a school in Cavan, which involves a data transfer when the payroll is done every month.  Without a data adequacy decision, all sorts of safeguards will have to be brought in by individual companies and public authorities, which will add a substantial cost to doing business between Ireland and the UK.  The European Parliament has passed a resolution saying the UK's treatment of EU citizens' privacy in respect of data is not adequate.  In addition, the European Court of Human Rights has said there are technical shortcomings in the way the UK does all of this.</p> <p>  Where does that leave us?  We need to balance the practicality of the implications of there not being a data adequacy decision, and all the costs associated with that, with the reality that the UK is genuinely backsliding.  This is a really strange situation.  Normally with third countries, they are coming up to, and converging with, an EU standard.  In this instance, we are beginning from a point where the UK is technically aligned with EU standards and is now beginning to diverge.  A critical point is that there is a sunset clause of four years in the draft adequacy decision, which means it will be revisited.  The right balance is there and we just need to add certain dimensions, such as making sure there is not mass surveillance for security purposes of EU citizens' data by the UK.  We need to get that locked in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.340" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#F00400"><p>A number of issues were raised by the Senators.  Before addressing them, I will pull back a little and say that the mood among member states shows they are starting to get a bit annoyed.  The EU cannot really let trading partners get away with not implementing previously agreed conditions.  If the UK were allowed not to implement what it has agreed to implement, other third countries would start demanding to do the same.  There is a meeting tomorrow of the EU-UK joint committee, chaired by Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, and I hope some of the loose ends will be tied up there.  Senator Byrne mentioned the steel issue and the different VAT rates, which are still a real concern.  There are other issues as well.  In addition, we are approaching the start of the marching season in Northern Ireland and we do not know to whom Mr. Poots will be appealing over the next few weeks.</p> <p>  I would like to focus on some hard facts regarding the Brexit adjustment reserve.  The eligibility period is very specific, being from 1 July last year to 31 December next year.  This means member states have two and half years in which to prove they suffered losses as a result of Brexit.  The first funding tranche of &euro;4 billion will be allocated in 2021, with the remaining &euro;1 billion to be allocated in 2024.  A particular issue for the Government is that a lot of money was spent on getting Dublin Port ready for Brexit but, because it was spent before 1 July last year, it does not qualify under the Brexit funding.  It is important to go into the detail of that.  There is quite a large amount of detailed guidance from the European Commission.  I have just tweeted the link to it, if members want to have a read of it.  It is easy enough to drill down through it and it may be of interest and use in respect of the fisheries allocation, for instance, which will make up a large part of the money that is allocated.</p><p>Senator O'Reilly had some more detailed questions about the veterinary side of things.  I do not sit on the agriculture committee so I do not have the detail on that.  </p><p> Looking at it from the Brussels side, the EU wants to help Ireland in dealing with the very real challenges we have had with Brexit.  The money is there.  It will be allocated in a very above board way depending on the losses that have been incurred.  They will have to be crystal clear in their fiscal transparency.  The EU is there to help us.  Michel Barnier may have moved to a different stage but the Commission's view is that it will continue to help Ireland where we need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.342" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Markey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#G00200"><p>On the link with MEPs, it is vital that we engage in that meaningful way.  Conversations like this are very important.</p> <p>  The protocol undermining the trade and co-operation agreement is something we need to be very conscious of from our end.  If we allow that kind of a narrative or conversation to begin, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  It is an international legally binding agreement.  Unless we allow its credibility to be undermined there is no reason it should not hold.  It is very important that our engagement and discussions are about progressing it rather than questioning its strength.   It is very important that we do not create a narrative that others would feed into on that.</p> <p>  Ms Walsh mentioned the &euro;100 million towards the fisheries end.  While there is a focus on ensuring a proper spend of the money and appropriation of funds, there is significant discretion at national level in how that money can be spent.  Therefore, it is important that it is used flexibly.  From the fisheries side, the big challenge is how one compensates fishers for loss of quota or fishing rights.  Anything you do in the area of decommissioning or compensation does not wash with fishers who ultimately just want to fish.  I welcome the report that is coming out from the Government task force in that regard this week.  It is a real challenge to determine how one can spend that effectively.  It is not straightforward.  There is significant discretion for the rest of it at national level, however, although much of the spending was before the timeframe.  It is not just about national governments - it is equally about private sector investment.  The funding can be directed in that route too, and that is very important.  </p> <p>  The status of products of mixed origin is a major issue, and not just for creameries in the Border area.  The whiskey industry has a very integrated supply chain across the island.  If that supply chain starts to break up because it is not practical to move produce North or South to get it bottled, for instance, it will cause a major issue at a political level and at an economic level.  It is a major problem in the dairy sector and, equally, in other sectors like the whiskey sector, which is ultimately all about exports.  If the export of whiskey is going to be challenged in relation to its eligibility for free trade agreements, that would be very significant.  It is something that needs to be looked at more.</p> <p>  On sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS checks, my sense, based on Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic's comments today and the meetings this week, is that the tolerance at European level for the UK position is waning significantly.  If there is another move similar to the previous move when unilateral action was taken, I do not think it will be received at all well at European level.  There is real concern in this respect.  It is something we have to look at.  I understand that there has been a significant lack of engagement at the North-South Ministerial Council with Edwin Poots and the last number of months.  That could have helped with SPS and particularly with products of mixed origin.  More work needs to be done on that.  Generally, if people are willing to engage, there is no doubt that solutions can be found on SPS and on products of mixed origin.  The problem is the lack of willingness to engage.  The mood in Brussels and Strasbourg this week shows a significant lack of tolerance for any more posturing from the UK.  Europe is seriously considering going down the legal route.  There is no doubt that any sort of legal moves will leave Ireland as collateral damage.  We need to try to get a situation where we can make meaningful progress.  The North-South Ministerial Council is a classic example of a structure through which progress could be made, but there is no engagement.  We have to be careful that we express full confidence in the structures that are available.  There are legally binding agreements.  We need to put it to others to stand up to them.  If we question them in any way, it makes it easy for those who want to undermine them.  There is a legal basis to this international agreement.  Under no circumstances should we tolerate any language of dilution that anyone might try to use in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#G00300"><p>One of the joys of going last is that all the more difficult questions go to the earlier speakers and then I can row in from behind.  Senator O'Reilly suggested that he was picking up a sense of pessimism from us.  I think it is a question of reality.  We have reached a point of frustration and are probably beyond it.  When we speak as Irish representatives at various committees and engage with people in Germany and France, the efforts to figure out why it is so difficult for our neighbours to move on with things are becoming more heightened.  Actions elsewhere are impacting how other things are flowing and moving.  As a centrist politician who is probably a little bit more progressive in some things than others, I think it is incredibly important that we continue to work together, that we are constantly communicating and consistently opening up the lines of communication and that we finish in optimism.  Like many things, politics can change in a day and we do not know whether the UK may return to the EU fold some day.  It is giving other EU states food for thought.  I hope the conference on the future of Europe will highlight the impact the EU has had on Ireland and also, from a solidarity perspective, what the EU as a whole has done for other member states.  As Mr. Markey said, we must continue to engage and drive forward.</p> <p>  I am looking at a note my team just passed.  A question was asked about the future growth loan scheme coming out of the Brexit adjustment fund and the agricultural sector.  That scheme provides a long-term lending option to SMEs in the agriculture sector, with terms of seven to ten years to support strategic investment for sustainability and growth.</p><p>No doubt many Senators are already aware of that but I highlight it for anybody watching from home or online.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has been phenomenal and continues to do great work in providing a range of financial supports in respect of Brexit, including upskilling, reskilling and continuing engagement on Brexit.  Everything can be found its the website.  Equally, our local enterprise offices have access to a number of financial supports for those looking into continuing to live, exist and operate through Brexit, such as training in online vouchers and microfinancing loans.  They also support other supports available through InterTradeIreland and so on and so forth.</p><p> On Senator O'Reilly's point about whether the protocol could set us back, I do not want to cross over my other colleagues' input but I will add to it by saying that, as a country, now is a crunch time.  We need to see the UK step up to the plate in wanting to see balance and fairness for all citizens throughout the island of Ireland in particular.</p><p> I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for highlighting Horizon and ERASMUS+ funding because they are incredible instruments for us as an island, considering we are now the leaders in being a predominantly English-speaking country.  We need to use that in our favour.  From speaking with people in some third level universities, particularly those on education and training programmes, we see many cross-EU funding applications.  I am happy to provide more information on those.  We link in quite closely with, and I send many organisations to, Teresa Lennon, who is head of the Irish Regions European Office.</p><p> The Committee of the Regions plays an instrumental role for us in keeping an eye on what we could be buying into or adding to.  The fact is that we have not just investments coming in from overseas, especially the US, but also both a trained labour force and a youth sector that is really engaged in third level education.  In particular, I see huge success in vocational and educational training in how we are further lifting our idea regarding studying.  Going to a certain university and having that third level or on-site experience can certainly be of benefit.  I see a cross-EU application area for that linked into Horizon funding and ERASMUS+.  I ask the committee to come back to me if members want specifics.  Billy Kelleher was at the meeting the day I attended with Teresa so no doubt the committee will talk to him.</p><p> Mr. Andrews picked up on the data adequacy decision so I will park that.</p><p> On flour and steel and other commodities, again, I sit on the employment and culture committees as well as the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, so forgive me if I miss some important information.  I spoke with businesspeople, particularly in the west of the country, around the time Brexit was really gaining a foothold in the Parliament.  I asked them about trade, what opportunities they were seeing and whether they were seeing any impact.  One supplier, who worked for a large supermarket food chain, said he struggled to find the likes of yoghurts and dairy goods coming from the Republic of Ireland.  He just could not get them in time.  That person is connected to a business in Northern Ireland and now has a growing trade.  That is probably a very easy and simplistic example to give, but there is a huge opportunity for us if we can get Northern Ireland on board in creating really good language and trade co-operation within the island of Ireland.  Again, further opportunities for us to grow our businesses are certainly welcome.  I will park it there and pass it back to the Chair.  I see a number of hands up so I look forward to more questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1658" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#H00200"><p>It is great to see everyone on board.  I can feel Ms. Walsh's pain in that for Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and I, and whoever else is on this call, all the questions have been asked at this stage.  I was beginning to think that Senators Joe O'Reilly and Malcolm Byrne were the spokespersons for the entire committee.  I am only messing of course.</p> <p>  On a more serious note, this is a very welcome opportunity to speak with MEPs.  Other speakers have mentioned the fact that perhaps some ongoing engagement like this would be very welcome.  I, for one, am very much in favour that.  It is refreshing and encouraging to see from all the contributions this afternoon that all the MEPs are collectively wearing the green jersey for the betterment of all our citizens.  That is great to see.  As Senator Joe O'Reilly outlined, we are very fortunate to have such a competent team representing us in Europe.  Mr. Andrews mentioned EU scrutiny of legislation, which, again, is vitally important.  I believe the Seanad has a great role to play in that.  It is something I would like to see develop if we ever get to a point where Brexit does not get the main headline of the day.  I look forward to that happening.</p> <p>  The European Parliament and the role of MEPs are so important.  I would not underestimate that because many laws and regulations emanate from Europe.  I still feel that citizens of this State do not fully get that.  We all have a job of work to do in educating not just ourselves, but the entire population, of the importance of Europe and the importance of us all tuning into what is going on there.  I know this is an old chestnut, but how do we make people sit up and take notice of what goes on and of the role of MEPs?  There is a job of work to be done there, not that MEPs should sell themselves by any means, as they are all well fit to do that, to make Europe and its goings-on centre stage for Irish citizens.</p> <p>  Regarding the point on the protocol, is the rest of the EU pulling the hair out of its head at this stage?  Brexit has dominated and been the main headline in Europe for the last number of years.  Even though the vote has now taken place, we are still talking about it and it just seems to be ongoing.  Is there a sense of frustration among other EU countries that this particular topic still dominates the landscape, perhaps at the expense of other issues be they climate change or whatever?  Do the witnesses get a sense of frustration among their colleagues when they are in Europe?</p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe mentioned an issue I was thinking about as well, which is the protocol and the temptation for the EU to just go and get this done once and for all, and the effect it could have on us here, particularly on the situation in Northern Ireland.  Edwin Poots is the new Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, leader and we are all watching that space at the moment to see how things pan out.  It is a worrying time for us all as we watch the goings-on in Northern Ireland.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is speaking after me and is closer to it than I am, but I have concerns and worries about it.  I can certainly understand the temptation and desire in Europe to finally get Brexit done, get all the parts of the protocol wrapped up and get on with life again, so to speak.  We have to keep an eye on the calendar as well because we are coming towards the marching season in Northern Ireland.  Edwin Poots is trying to find his space and trying to appeal, perhaps, to both sides of the DUP coin.  That is fraught with danger because there are elections just around the corner as well.</p><p>That is all in the mix and I am fearful about it.  Frustrating as it might be, I am conscious that we should take a deep breath again and try to tread carefully in the context of any decisions we make in this regard.</p><p> My main concern is the frustration that might exist in other EU countries.  They are sick and tired of talking about Brexit, Ireland and all the rest of it.  Do the witnesses envisage this having a negative impact on relationships among themselves and their colleagues as we move forward?</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to hear from and engage with our MEP colleagues this afternoon.  As others have said, the more of these kinds of discussions, the better.  It is not the fault of our MEP colleagues but the stark issue for me is the lack of representation for a citizen like me and the many hundreds of thousands of citizens like me in the North who, while retaining Irish and EU citizenship, no longer have representation in the EU institutions despite our clear democratic opposition to Brexit being forced upon us in the first place.</p> <p>  Ms Walsh rightly lamented the British Government's decision not to continue to allow access to Erasmus for us but the Irish Government decided not to allocate the additional seats to citizens in the North.  That was a real failure on its part.  I do not want to bring the discussion down another track but that is an important point to make at a meeting like this, at which I have the opportunity to engage with MEPs.</p> <p>  As with my colleagues, I welcome the ongoing solidarity and certainty regarding the protocol.  We need to remain steadfast in respect of it regardless of what occurs.  Colleagues have talked about various political uncertainties in the North but adherence to, the implementation of and the effectiveness of the protocol as we navigate the choppy waters have to be key.</p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe spoke about generosity.  I do not know whether he misspoke.  It was a poor choice of words on his part.  He spoke about the generosity of the Government in continuing access to Erasmus.  I do not think any of us is looking for generosity or benevolence.  We are just looking for our rights and entitlements, particularly given that we lost so many as a result of Brexit.  This brings to mind two issues that have come to the fore for me, particularly over the past couple of days.  Some of the MEPs will not necessarily be able to answer my question but I hope they will be able to assist us in seeking clarity and gaining support for a resolution to these issues.</p> <p>  My first question is on the European health insurance card.  There were provisions made in the omnibus legislation such that if there were to be no agreement on that, the Irish Government would put a scheme in place.  It has transpired that the British Government has introduced the global health insurance card, albeit emblazoned with a huge Union Jack, for people in the North.  Nevertheless, it has been revealed in the media in the North in the past couple of days that there are several countries in which we will not have insurance, such as Switzerland and Lichtenstein.  We need clarity on that.  If colleagues in the European Parliament could be of assistance in that regard, it would be helpful.  I am going to try to achieve clarity at our end in the Seanad.</p> <p>  My other question is on the digital green certificate and on how EU citizens, including Irish citizens and anyone beyond that in the North, will be able to access it.  Will it be based on residency?  Is there work we can do to ensure there will not be another right denied to us in the North?  When I raised this with the Minister for Health in the Seanad last Monday, the one-sentence response I got was that it is being looked at.  Given the roll-out of the vaccine scheme and what I hope will be more positive and safe liftings of restrictions, we are coming to the point where it will become a live issue for people, whether they want a holiday or to travel for work and business purposes.  If that is not on the radar of MEP colleagues yet, it may be a matter they can take note of.  Collectively, right across the board in the spirit of wearing the green jersey that people have referred to, we should not just obtain clarity on the issue but also work to ensure citizens of the EU and Ireland who are trapped in this Brexit situation against their will can continue to avail of rights and entitlements as opposed to losing even more of them.</p></speech>

I am probably the final speaker and most of the questions have been asked.  I would like to return to the issue of agriculture and the produce that frequently crosses the Border.  Produce coming from the North to the South basically comprises raw milk and other materials.  There is also produce going in the opposite direction.  I refer to the export of in-calf Friesian heifers.  This is a significant trade for the dairy industry in the South.  This is being grossly affected by Brexit.  Issues pertaining to that need to be considered.  I refer in particular to the certification of live animals and how this will work.  This will be a major issue for us, particularly at the back end of the year.  Regarding Irish whiskey and Lakelands Dairies, coming up with a solution presents a significant issue.  I am open to correction but 40% of the milk from Lakelands Dairies comes from the North.  It is a significant volume.  We are aware the milk price is quite buoyant at the moment.  Any disruption to that market could see major change very quickly.  We need to start considering the key issues.</p> <p>  Some speakers have mentioned how the fishing industry has been grossly affected by Brexit.  In southern parts, the fishing industry is probably the one most affected.  The proposed cuts, if made, will see places such as Castletownbere, Baltimore and Union Hall devastated.  These are really rural parts that very much depend on the industry.  It is not just a matter of the activity of fishing because it is about the knock-on effect.  If the proposed cuts are made, it will be devastating in the parts of the world in question.  Putting a fund in place to protect the affected communities is one thing but the point is that any loss to the quota will significantly affect their survival.  With the deepest of respect, putting broadband and everything else into these remote areas just will not do.  This is too big an issue for them.  Fishing is the primary industry.  The fabric of society will collapse if something is done to protect them.</p> <p>  I have been asking and talking about Brexit having thrown politics and economics up in the air for the past three or four years.  Covid has added to this.  The tourism industry in Ireland has been devastated.  While we had good news in the past few days with the opening up of outside dining, what is the potential for an all-Ireland tourism strategy considering the chaos we are currently seeing?  Tourism is going to be one of our really significant drivers.  Unfortunately, the market we are talking about is that of 2023.  Unfortunately, the prospects for 2022 are nearly gone because it is going to be very hard for international travel to open up.  We are not going to have the trade shows.  We are not going to have the liners and aeroplanes to bring to Ireland the millions who have traditionally come here.  Where will the all-Ireland tourism strategy come from?  Where will we find the political drive to deliver it on the ground?  While I believe there is genuinely a will to achieve this, will anything happen given the chaos we are seeing?  The knock-on effect will be huge for Border counties and the Republic as a whole.  It will be devastating for the North unless a coherent plan can be put in place.</p> <p>  I referred to 2023 because that is the space we are in at the moment.</p><p>That is the what we are planning for in west Cork.  We may have ten liners visiting Cobh next year but we will have on average 100 liners visiting in future.  That is the logic of it.  It will take another 18 months for the business to build.  Where is the political drive, including in Europe, to put this policy together?  How can we ensure this happens by 2023?</p></speech>

All members who indicated have contributed.  I will ask a question and then go to our guests in reverse order, with Ms Walsh responding first this time, followed by Mr. Markey and Mr. Andrews.  As with Ms Walsh, all of my questions have been.  There is one area of particular interest to me that I will focus on because it does not get attention, as Mr. Andrews noted.  It is the issue of parliamentary scrutiny and oversight of the implementation of the agreement.  I was not aware that we did not have an Irish MEP on the European Parliament's United Kingdom coordination group.  When will that membership come up for renewal again?  Will there be an opportunity to get an Irish MEP on to the group?  When will the new scrutiny group replacing the Brexit steering group be in place and when will be know if we have Irish MEPs on it?</p> <p>  Mr. Andrews referred to the limited powers of the EU-UK parliamentary partnership assembly, which is to oversee the agreement.  That is a cause for concern.  It is such a high-level body and perhaps we do not pay enough attention to it.  We need to ensure that citizens have oversight through their representatives.  Mr. Andrews stated the Parliament will be informed of decisions on or changes in the operation of the agreement.  Is it possible for parliamentary partnership assembly to make recommendations to follow through on that and to direct that something might happen?  If it does not have such powers, is there an argument for having these powers introduced?  There needs to be a mechanism by which citizens, through their MEPs, can have a say on how this is operated rather than, effectively, civil servants running it without any parliamentary oversight.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  My final comment is on the Northern Ireland protocol.  As I have stated previously, I have serious concerns regarding the vote that will take place in Stormont in four years' time to allow for the continuation of the protocol.  We should not take the outcome of that vote for granted.  We are told the veterinary agreement will deal with 80% of the problems that have been identified.  We hear time and again from the Unionist community, particularly the DUP, that it does not matter how much one tinkers around the edges, adjusts or amends the protocol, the very fact that it exists is abhorrent to it and it will not support its continuation in any shape or form.  I do not know what we should do about that, to be honest.  Continued engagement North and South and east and west is very important but I have concerns that this will be a live issue in Northern Ireland politics from now onwards.  I would appreciate comments from our guests on those points.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair for bringing me in and for her questions.  The first meeting of the partnership council is scheduled to take place in London tomorrow.  Mr. Markey or Mr. Andrews can speak on the logistics around it because I am not <i>au fait</i>with them and do not wish to waste time on it.  I will revert directly to the Chair on what I am hearing as she is only down the road from me.<br/><br/>On the vote on the protocol in four years&rsquo; time, as with the Chair, I do not see a solution yet other than through continuous engagement, working with citizens North and South and highlighting that solidarity is needed now more than ever.  I also anticipate and hope that, as part of the Conference on the Future of Europe which was officially launched on 9 May and will run until next year, space will be given to look at what Brexit means to our citizens and political representatives, including at local level, within the space of citizen engagement and in anticipation of what things will look like in four years because Brexit is not going away any time soon.  It will continue to be a talking point, which is the reason conversations are needed, whether on one or two issues or, as with this engagement, covering a series of issues in order that we all learn from each other and Ireland Inc. is not resting on the shoulders of certain MEPs in the European Parliament but on all of us.<br/><br/>On Senator Lombard&rsquo;s point, because I do not sit on the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, AGRI, I will let our colleague, Mr. Markey, respond on the issue of produce.  <br/><br/>On tourism and the all-Ireland strategy, there is funding available for North-South tourism promotion.  I love Senator Lombard&rsquo;s vision on this.  I see Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile nodding his head in agreement.  Perhaps Senators and Members of the European Parliament can work together collectively on a whole island vision, rather than singing into a vacuum.  I will get back to Senator Lombard on that.<br/><br/>I will have to get back to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile on the European health insurance card when I have clarity.  I will speak to some of my colleagues on that issue. <br/><br/>On the digital certificate, about which I was also asked by a constituent living on the Border yesterday, the latest news I have from the permanent representative in Brussels is that it is currently based on residency but the EU is in negotiation with third countries, including the UK and the US, on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates.  That sounds like Brussels-speak but it is the information we received.  I will follow up on that and link directly with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile on it.</p></speech>

Senator Gallagher and the Chair spoke about speak about EU scrutiny and I welcome the points made.  We can certainly work together on that, as it is a fitting space.  We have a very important role to play in homing in on solidarity.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked how we can get people to engage with the European Parliament and the EU institutions as a whole.  I have been scratching my head about that since I ran for office in 2019.  As a person new to politics, when I meet citizens I am consistently asked what happens in the European Parliament, what does an MEP do and how can people engage with the EU, other than seeing the symbol on buildings and roadsides.  There has to be some education on this.  </p> <p>  Without attaching too much weight to the Conference on the Future of Europe, it can really help us, as Irish citizens, to take an all-island approach to talking about what the EU has given us, what we want to see being learned from it, what each institution does and develops for us and to connect those who feel most disconnected from the EU overall.  </p> <p>  A great deal of what happens in the institutions has an impact.  The impacts may not be immediate because it can take from three to five years for proposals to be enacted.  Many great things happen here but the media is not picking up on them or we are not communicating effectively across all channels, both traditional and social.  Perhaps we should invest more in the blue star programme, which is a brilliant initiative for our primary schools, and the European Parliament ambassador school programme for transition year students.  Are there ways for us to do that?  I have not found a solution.  At the Committee on Culture and Education I am looking at how we can entice third level students to see the vision of what Europe has brought for us, other than through Erasmus+ because not everybody opts in to that programme.  We need to ensure we bring all citizens together on that.  I will connect separately with Senator Gallagher on that to see if we can figure out ways to together on that in the constituency.</p> <p>  On the sense of frustration with Brexit, I am interested in hearing the views of Mr. Markey and Mr. Andrews on this.  In the committees on which I sit there is a sense of frustration.</p><p>That is not necessarily being placed on us and it is more of a frustration that a former member, our neighbour, is not adhering to diplomacy and democracy in the way that we have built the institutions to be.  There is also the fact that this polarised vacuum conversation happens, so we see that one says one thing in the press and the other posts out a tweet to say another thing, and it is building up to a space where nothing ever happens and we continue on this track of &ldquo;he said, she said&rdquo;.  What creates fear, and it has been mentioned a number of times, is that we are coming into the marching season and we have seen unrest.  We will continue to see unrest, I believe, if we do not have players around the table to have these honest conversations.  The frustration for my vision is this idea of the United Kingdom versus us, as a country or as representatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Markey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#LL00200"><p>I will try to take the issues from top to bottom.  The importance of Europe was raised by Senator Robbie Gallagher and his point was quite reflective.  On the ground, the image of Europe has not been helped in the last six or 12 months.  The Brexit issue probably has not helped but, equally, there is the whole vaccine situation and, although it has probably improved in the last month or two, the perception of Europe is not as good as it should be on the ground.  Ireland was always a very pro-European country but there is a disconnect and it is very important that we bridge that disconnect.  The forum on the future of Europe is a part of that but we have to be careful it does not become a PR exercise for Europe.  It has to be about people engaging with the substance of the issues, and the talk of scrutiny of legislation being brought into an Irish context is very important because it makes all that European activity relevant.</p> <p>  In regard to the Senator&rsquo;s comments about worrying times in the North, that commentary was very fair.  There are obviously those who are trying to stoke up a bit of fervour coming into the marching season and there is a need, particularly at European level, to let that pass to some degree, and then let us have the conversations in more measured times than in the middle of the marching season.  Perhaps we can buy a little time and move it to the autumn, where it might be more straightforward to have a conversation and the grandstanding might be gone at that stage.  To be honest, every time I have seen a new leader on the unionist side in the North, grandstanding in the early days has always been a big part of it.  That might change a little over time, so the Senator's suggestion about the season we are in and taking a little time is very important.</p> <p>  With regard to the rest of the EU and Brexit, there is a distinct frustration or lack of tolerance at a couple of levels, in particular in regard to it taking centre stage and being a distraction from the rest of the work being done.  That is the first point.  The second is the fact it was felt that the measures were put in place and that this should, in many ways, allow things to progress, and a lot of work was put into that.  As much as anything, there is the broader question of whether this is impacting on the EU and what the collateral damage for Europe in the long term could be if a country cannot hold to its commitments, and whether this means other countries would look at this.  The unity and the definition of what it is to be part of the EU has been challenged by some of this, and that is a frustration at European level.</p> <p>   I will move on to the points from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.  With regard to the digital green certificate, from the get-go, at European level the sense was that this is something that Europe was open to rolling out on a broader basis if others were willing to co-operate with it.  That is the starting position from Europe.  The question then is whether others are willing to engage on the other side.  There is certainly interest in engaging in regard to the vaccines but, in the broader sense, it will take the other parties to come on board in order to get co-operation.  Certainly, from the European perspective, while the digital green certificate came in for an enormous amount of flak at the start from pressure groups, the general consensus is that it is a good idea.  It is definitely something I would see like to see rolled out to the UK and the USA but it remains to be seen.</p> <p>  In regard to a health insurance card, I would not comment as I am not an expert.  I appreciate the point the Senator is making about the number of countries that are outside and I can certainly come back to the Senator on that scenario.  It is important that, in all these measures, and it is no different from the Erasmus programme, we bridge the gap and keep everyone unified in whatever way we can because it might be good in the longer term.</p> <p>  Senator Tim Lombard raised several points.  On the situation on products of mixed origin, there is a point that has not been covered.  That is the fact that, particularly on the dairy side, in the same way that this product is not eligible for third country trade agreements, it also may not be eligible for intervention-type supports if they were needed in the future because it may not actually be European produce, and there is a question of how we deal with it in that context.  There is a question and there is certainly a need for clarity.  I specifically asked the Commission about this several times recently and it has not come back with an answer.  However, it is vital that the North South Ministerial Council feeds into this because it has the option to come up with workarounds that could be a solution to put forward to the EU, and that has not happened.</p> <p>  It is a massive issue when we consider the level of exports involved on the dairy side, but particularly on the whiskey side.  We see Irish whiskey moving up the charts in terms of the competition with Scottish whisky, which was always the dominant player in previous decades.  If that is going to be challenged by us being at a competitive disadvantage because of trade agreements, it is very significant to the future of that industry.  It is something the Seanad should look at further.</p> <p>  On the fisheries issues, I agree totally with the Senator in terms of the multipliers, which are different from the agri sector.  In rural economies which do not have many other things, the multiplier from the fisheries side is vital.  When we talk about the cuts in fish quota, the question is where we recover that from.  Compensation only lasts so long and it is only backstopped for 18 months.  We have to look at the Common Fisheries Policy in the longer term - it is a long-term play - and we have to look at total available catch, TAC, so there are those two options whereby we could work our way back from the current position.  With regard to total available catch, that is really looking at other countries giving ground towards Ireland and, given the amount of work that has gone into Brexit in the last couple of years, that is going to be hard.  However, total available catch and the Common Fisheries Policy are two issues we should focus on in terms of the future of the fisheries industry.  If we go back to the Hague preferences from the 1980s, there was a clear identification that Ireland was at a disadvantage and, through the Hague preferences, additional recognition was given.  If we can use that as precedent to suggest something similar can happen again, it would be very important.</p> <p>  On the tourism point, I sit on the transport and tourism committee.  At European level, the budget for tourism is extremely small.  When I asked about that, the reason given is that it is due to the fact the competition is between European countries and one is pitching against the other for the same market, that is, the European tourist.  We need to look at this in the context of attracting US tourists or those from outside of the EU so we are looking at bringing additional tourism business into the EU.  That is a way to look at it that may be relevant as a justification for a greater tourism budget going forward.  It is definitely not considered a priority for EU funding currently because it is seen as an internal market rather than an international market, although that is possibly something we should change.</p> <p>  To come to the Chairman's points in regard to the protocol and the situation in four years time, as it stands, a significant cohort of people in Northern Ireland are ideologically opposed to the protocol and we are going to have a massive challenge, so I could not agree more with the Chairman.  However, one thing that has not been allowed to be part of the conversation to date, although it may be when the marching season is ended and calm comes again, is the unique status that Northern Ireland has been given in the trade and co-operation agreement through the protocol in terms of having a foot in each camp.  That has not even begun to be a conversation in any of this yet.</p><p>Perhaps we have an opportunity to win over people who are currently sceptical about it if, at the end of the day, it is money in someone's pocket.  I always believed that when we were flying during Celtic tiger times, the negative sentiment towards the South from the unionist community was less.  If we can create an economic opportunity for unionism, and everybody in the North, around the TCA and the protocol that gives them a unique status they can build on, then maybe they will start to believe in it.  It is very important that we do that.</p><p> On the UK coordination group, while to date there have been no Irish people on it, it has to be recognised by everybody that this group has been very good to Ireland during the workings-out of the past number of years.  In a way, maybe it was more objective without Irish people on it because outsiders on that group were batting for the Irish interest.  That has not necessarily been a negative.  However, at this stage, where it is becoming more about implementation and the latter stages of all this, it is practical, on-the-ground experience that will count.  There now needs to be a change towards, let us say, a more Irish influence, where it is experience of the practical concerns and how they are playing out on the ground that will be very important.  </p><p> There is a need for a system approach change from an objective European position up until now to a more considered, practical experience on-the-ground position in that UK co-ordination group.  That could be telling in undermining some of the negatives or misrepresentation that has come from other sides on this as well.  If there are people with practical experience on the ground in Ireland, for instance, who are able to challenge the misrepresentation of the situation, that could be key going forward.  A greater Irish interest in that would be welcome.  There may be a willingness at European level to look at that too because, frankly, in many places across Europe people feel they have given enough to Brexit.  If somebody from this end could step in and offer a few solutions that would move things forward, Europe would be receptive to that.  Certainly, we need to look at getting greater representation from an Irish perspective.  </p><p> I will leave it at that.  I appreciate all the questions from everyone.  As we said at the start, engagements like this are very important, especially if we can do it on an ongoing basis.  For one thing, it makes Europe far more relevant at home but it also brings the interaction between the two parliaments closer together.  That is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.357" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Andrews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021060800002#M00200"><p>It is sometimes said that at this stage of a meeting everything has been said, but not yet by everybody.  I feel Ms Walsh's pain coming in, finally.  I will recap the points.  On Senator Gallagher's point regarding reports, we are now in the space where we have to think about recommendations so let me just be concrete about this.  The committee has to take note of the fact that the proximity between Irish and British officials and ministers is gone.  That proximity, which is crucial to developing peace on the island of Ireland, is all gone as a result of Brexit.  Whitehall used to X-ray everything that came from the EU from a common law perspective.  That is gone.  In addition, the political alignment perspective between Ireland and the UK, whether we like it or not, is gone.  The academic review in the UK of what is happening in the EU, whether it is textbooks, university departments, journals, symposiums and seminars, is gone.  There is a new element, not isolation but a new relationship, we need to develop with both the EU and the UK now, separately.  It should be part of the committee's analysis.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile made a point about lack of representation.  I wrote to the Commission about this.  Under the proposed joint parliamentary assembly there needs to be a specific group where the Northern Ireland Assembly and MEPs have regular engagement.  Failing that, it could be a carve-out of the UK delegation from the European Parliament where there would be connective tissue, as it has been described to me, between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the European Parliament.  In addition, the joint consultative working group is under the specialised committee under the withdrawal agreement.  There is no reason there should not be Northern Ireland academics, and civil society and other representatives, on that join consultative working group, which is supposed to meet once a month.  One way or the other there has to be a dramatic upscaling in Northern Ireland of visibility of proposed legislation coming from Europe, particularly with that vote the Chair mentioned in a few years.</p> <p>  On the European health insurance card, as I understand it the UK is proposing to extend its global health insurance card to the three countries mentioned.  We can double-check that.  As Ms Walsh said, the digital Covid certificate, DCC, is intended to be interoperable between both the UK and the US but is caught up in the data adequacy issue.  There is a little recognition around data adequacy and protection of EU citizens' data that is connected to that.</p> <p>  On Senator Lombard's point about strong recommendations, there has to be a strong recommendation from the committee on rules of origin and the flexibility being demonstrated by the European Commission, particularly on the issue of warehousing in Great Britain of supplies into the Republic of Ireland.  The recommendation must also include the issue of Northern Ireland inputs into Republic of Ireland products and recognition of that in future free trade agreements.  That is a really critical point we should not be shy to make if we are truly interested in protecting the all-island economy.  </p> <p>  Finally, the Chair asked when the scrutiny committee issue will be settled.  I agree with Mr. Markey that it has done much good work for us but I sincerely believe we need representation on this.  It has been on the agenda of the conference of presidents, that is the group leaders, for the past three or four weeks, without agreement.  There is something holding it up but I do not know what it is.  That is where the real power will be.</p> <p>  There is a proposed interinstitutional agreement between the Parliament and the Commission.  Normally, the European Parliament merely has the right to be informed about trade agreements under the treaties but this interinstitutional agreement will sit alongside that.  It uses language such as it will give the utmost account of the European Parliament's opinion and it will scale up the European Parliament's input.  This scrutiny committee will have a key role there.  It really is crucial we have at least one Irish representative on it.  I certainly put my hand up for it and I am sure others have done the same.  The problem is I am a very new MEP and new MEPs really are at the bottom of the food chain.  It has been a very interesting experience so I have no idea if I will make it onto that.  I hope that answers the questions and I thank the Chair for the opportunity.</p></speech>

He brings to an end all our questions back and forth.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the MEPs who attended this afternoon.  It has been great to have the engagement.  The sentiment echoed right around the virtual room is that, on both sides, we welcome the engagement and would like to see more of it.  It helps us better understand what the European Parliament is doing and<i>vice versa</i>in terms of what we are doing in the Seanad in looking at and scrutinising matters of importance to the EU.  It has been very good.  We will look to produce our interim report in July so the engagement we have had today will form a significant part of that process.  We thank the MEPs for taking the time to engage with the committee this afternoon on a variety of issues.  The questions were very broad and each of the MEPs displayed a really excellent knowledge of all aspects of Brexit, the protocol and everything surrounding that.  I thank them for having that information with them.</p><p>For committee members, we have a number of issues to discuss to finalise our report, such as dates and other bits and pieces, to make sure we can report on time.  I propose to organise a private meeting, possibly next week, to finalise those last few details because there is not enough time this afternoon to go into private session.  That brings our meeting to a close.  There is no other business.  Our next meeting will take place on Monday of next week at 3 p.m.  I thank everyone who tuned in from home as well. </p></speech>
