I welcome Mr. Jim Miley, director general of the Irish Universities Association, IUA.  He is accompanied by Mr. Michael Casey, finance director of the IUA.  We thank them for making themselves available to meet the committee.  The purpose of this session is pre-budget scrutiny and consideration of issues raised in the IUA's submission.  I will ask the witnesses to give their opening statement in a moment but I first must deal with the normal housekeeping matter of privilege.  I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.</p><p>However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Mr. Miley to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#V00200"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to address it.  We have included our opening statement in the documentation provided to the committee and I will go through it briefly.  We also included a copy of our pre-budget submission and an impact report, to which I will refer later.</p> <p>  Universities are key catalysts of economic growth.  Ireland's economic success is increasingly linked to our capacity to compete globally in a competitive knowledge economy.  As a small open economy within the EU, we have succeeded in attracting a disproportionate level of inward investment from the global leaders in technology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other sectors.  Our success in foreign direct investment, FDI, combined with the development of a thriving indigenous SME sector, has enabled us to recover from recession and emerge as one of the fastest growing economies in the EU, all within a single decade.  It is well recognised by all that our pool of high-quality talent and our capacity for innovation at a globally competitive level in a range of industries is central to this achievement.  We contend that universities and other third level institutions are the engine rooms for the production of this talent and for cutting-edge research and innovation.</p> <p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for higher education has described our emerging talent as Ireland's oil reserve and how right she is.  However, the value of those oil reserves of talent cannot be tapped unless we invest in harnessing and developing that talent, which will, in turn, fuel our future economic success.  This is why investing in our universities must be a national priority.</p> <p>  In April, Indecon published a major study on the impact of universities, the first of its kind in Ireland.  It provides a detailed measurement of the contribution of the seven universities represented by the IUA to the economy and the country generally.  We have included a summary copy of the report in the documentation.  The universities collectively contribute approximately &euro;9 billion annually to the economy, support 22,000 jobs, and more than 120,000 students are enrolled.  The universities generate close to &euro;400 million a year in export earnings from international students.  By comparison, this is almost double sheep meat exports from the country.  The research and innovation activities of the universities generate &euro;1.5 billion annually to the economy.  Critically, Indecon has shown an estimated net gain to the Exchequer of &euro;1.6 billion per year arising from the increased earnings and tax take from higher-earning university graduates.  Given that the total annual State investment in universities is of the order of &euro;1 billion, there is a clear cash return to the State.  In summary, universities not only deliver on the public good of producing top talent and driving innovation, they also deliver a cash return for the State.  This is why investment in universities is an investment in our economic success.</p> <p>  Over the past decade, State funding per student in the third-level sector has been dramatically cut.  The core grant from the Higher Education Authority to third-level institutions throughout the sector has dropped from almost &euro;9,000 per student a decade ago to just over &euro;5,000 per student now.  This &euro;4,000 gap has been made up in two ways: half by an increase in the student registration fee and half by cost-cutting at universities and generating new sources of income.</p><p>In spite of welcome but modest funding increases over the last two budgets, State funding per student - the<i></i>critical measure - has hardly moved as the increases are largely mopped up by a growth in student numbers.  This bulge in student numbers is set to grow over the next decade, with an estimated 40,000 extra students to be catered for by 2030, as compared with the 2015 baseline.  The funding problem will get considerably worse unless there is a significant step-up in investment to support our growing student base.  There is almost unanimous support among employer leaders, unions and students for a comprehensive programme of investment, with IBEC, chambers of commerce leaders, USI and ICTU all in support of such a programme.  <br/><br/>The Irish Universities Association is calling for a three-part response from Government to the urgent investment needs of the third level sector.  First, an additional &euro;117 million for core operational funding is required, inclusive of &euro;40 million in new money to improve quality and enhance services and the remainder to cater for a known increase in student numbers and known increases in staff pay awards arising from the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, reversals, which are out of the control of the universities.  Second, we are seeking a step-up in investment in research, including an additional &euro;50 million for frontier research by our top scientists, many of whom currently receive no national funding.  This was amplified in the last week in regard to the prestigious European Research Council, ERC, grant awards - a pot of &euro;600 million - in respect of which Ireland succeeded in securing only one of 408 grants overall.  This was a direct result of applicants not having seed funding from national government.  <br/><br/><b><i></i></b>On capital funding, we propose a two-strand injection with &euro;100 million for new build to cater for growing student numbers in the first instance.  We acknowledge the recent announcement by Government on grant funding for capital projects in four of our universities.  Second, &euro;110 million for year one of a seven-year capital investment recovery programme to upgrade many of our decades-old facilities, in particular the refurbishment and upgrade projects that have remained neglected over the last decade or longer and are now urgent.<br/><br/>We have set out our proposals in detail in our budget 2020 submission, Investing in Ireland&rsquo;s Future Talent and Innovation.  We would welcome the support of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight for these proposals.<br/><br/>I am happy to take comments or questions from members.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I attended a meeting of business leaders from the Cork region at which third level funding and education generally was raised as one of the key issues.  For them, it is right up there with infrastructure and housing.  Many of those present were the owners of growing businesses or start-ups, but all of them expressed concern in regard to where their next tranche of staff might come from.  The point was made that as a State we regularly point to the quality of our workforce in terms of education.  Increasingly, no matter where one travels in the world there is a high level of education.  Concern was expressed in regard to the league tables and ranking systems.  People understood that these are a mixed bag, that they can be gamed and that some are better than others.  Nonetheless, there was a recognition that this is a reality.  People were specifically concerned about research.  They expressed the view that while we might be leaders in specific areas such as, for example, food, drink and perhaps electronics, Irish universities are falling behind.  While there are several streams of funding here, is it the research element that is causing us to fall down the rankings?  As there are several asks in terms of research and innovation and capital funding and core funding, what is the most crucial element in tackling the continuing fall in the rankings of Irish universities?</p><p>We have discussed this issue previously.  An increasing number of institutions in Asia and other parts of the developing world are entering the league tables and becoming more competitive.  Many of our third level institutions meanwhile are becoming more reliant on international students for income.  To what extent is that the case?  Can a percentage be put on that funding?  Is there a strategic risk - perhaps not this year or next - to our institutions if international student numbers begin to fall off because they choose universities closer to home? </p><p> I might be asking the same question in two ways.  The request regarding finance is significant and I appreciate the value for money aspect that was outlined.  Can the delegates identify the most important investment that can be made?  A similar question relates to the risks the Irish university sector faces if investments are not made.  What will the position be like in three or four years?  What will the university sector look like and what shortfalls and deficits will there be?</p></speech>

That is particularly the case as we are reaching peak employment.  There are significant shortages of key talent in a wide range of areas in the economy.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to rankings and research.  This is related to the Deputy's previous question about overall priority.  I will make two points.  First, core funding is absolutely critical.  An increase in State funding was a fundamental ingredient of all of the options outlined in the Cassells report which was published more than three years ago.  I will hand over to my colleague in a moment as we conducted an exercise on that issue.  It is included it in our budget submission and examines where we are versus what was outlined in the Cassells report.  Increasing core funding is critical, but we are not suggesting we have to go anywhere near closing the &euro;4,000 gap that has opened up in the last decade.  A meaningful contribution does, however, have to be made towards doing that.  What we have outlined refers to pushing that figure upwards in order that the &euro;5,000 in direct funding per student that we receive from the State can, within a couple of years, become perhaps &euro;5,500.  That is relatively modest compared to the drop we have seen, but given the increase in numbers, we are conscious of what the State can afford.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced research in both of his questions.  That issue is also critical.  It relates to parts 2 and 3 of our submission.  We have proposed extra funding of &euro;50 million for core frontier research.  A significant number of our top researchers and scientists do not receive national funding.  that inhibits their capacity to build teams and develop the ability to compete for other funds such as from the ERC fund which I mentioned.  If that issue is not addressed, we will certainly fall further down the rankings over time.  The second aspect of research relates to the capital investment programme, in particular the facilities that need to be upgraded such as laboratories and technical equipment.  That is directly related to the research agenda.  Therefore, the two absolute priorities are addressing the issues of core funding and research in the context of direct funding and the capital investment programme.  </p> <p>  I ask Mr. Casey to comment further on the Cassells report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#X00300"><p>Committee members will be aware that the Cassells report set out a number of options, all of which involved additional investment in the context of core funding.</p><p>I suppose core funding is the funding that keeps the institutions ticking over.  It is the bread and butter stuff.  It is the area that has suffered dramatically in the past decade or so.  It is fundamental to the quality of what universities produce, whether it is at undergraduate or research output level, etc.<br/><br/>The Cassells report had 2015 as its baseline.  At the time direct State grants to third level institutions amounted to &euro;923 million.  By 2019 that figure had increased to &euro;1.1 billion, but in analysing the figure, it translates to an increase of &euro;189 million over the period, with &euro;102 million being subsumed by increases arising from pay restoration and centrally agreed pay costs which are outside the control of the universities.  The increase in funding, net of pay awards, over the period was &euro;87 million.  The Cassells report identified a number of options.  Now we are faced with the <i>status quo</i>with respect to maintaining the student contribution and increased State funding.  The report identified increased investment by the State of &euro;842 million by 2030.  If we assume that figure applies on a flatline basis over the period, it amounts to &euro;56 million per annum.  On that basis, by 2019, we should have seen an increase of &euro;225 million in real terms.  As I indicated, the actual increase was &euro;87 million; therefore, we are &euro;138 million shy of where the Cassells report identified we should be.  That is fundamental to the quality of what we produce and it is one of the risks for the sector in terms of investment.<br/><br/>Quality is a tricky issue with which to deal.  As a representative body for the universities, the quality of what we produce is fundamental.  We need to maintain that quality.  We are trying to promote what we produce, but with the lack of investment, it is inevitable that quality will be at risk.  We do not necessarily want to say this, however, because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The reality is we cannot absorb the cutbacks in funding without there being some impact on quality in the long run.  The big risk from a quality perspective is that there tends to be a time lag between investment and quality.  By the time we, as a state, realise quality may be impacted on, we could be chasing ten years of investment to try to get ourselves back into position.  The time lag is a critical factor.  We need to realise as early as possible the importance of investing and maintaining quality.</p></speech>

We have grown the number of international students.  As I indicated in my opening comments, it is now worth close to &euro;400 million per year in net export earnings.  There is much economic value and it has been a major buffer for universities and other third level institutions in catering for the fall in income elsewhere.  There is, however, a potential risk.  There is massive investment in Asia in third level systems, including in China, Indonesia and countries in that part of the world.  Some of the universities there are moving into the top 100 in the world.  Even a decade ago, that would have been unheard of.  Taking the medium term view, it is reasonable to assume the flow of international students to this part of the world will certainly plateau and could decrease.</p><p>However, there is a substantial risk attached to relying on that funding.</p><p>   Second, we know an extra 40,000 of our students will be at the doors of the system by 2030 compared with the 2015 baseline.  If we do not have sufficient funding in place, we will be unable to cater for them.  Universities do not want to be in the position where they must take in international students to balance the books to the detriment of Irish students, which is another risk.  The year 2030 is more than a decade away but the steps of that stairs have begun and that is a real and live risk in the coming years.</p></speech>

What is the IUA's view on how third level should be funded?  What solution will the association commit to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#Z00400"><p>The comments we have made in that regard related to the fact that two of the options mentioned in the Cassells report - loans and an increase in student fees - have been effectively ruled out by the current Government.  Implicitly that then means the only solution left on the table is to substantially increase State funding.  However, we are also hearing that the capacity of the State to fund the entire piece is limited.  Failing that, the other option is to restrict the number of student places.  If there is not enough money to pay for them, restricting the number is the only option but that is an untenable option as far as we are concerned.  We pride ourselves on the fact that we have one of the most educated populations in Europe and one of the most educated workforces, which we want to continue.</p> <p>  When the Cassells options first came out, we expressed some views at that time on the loans or fees options.  We understand the political sensitivities of dealing with those issues.  We pose our solution to the funding crisis in the context of access and ask the following question.  Is it acceptable that the son or daughter of a wealthy individual studying, for example, medicine, veterinary science or a laboratory-based course, should be effectively subsidised by the State while there are schools in this country where as few as 9% of the leaving certificate students access third level?  We think that the issue of access, as part of the funding solution, must be addressed.  That inherently means that certain people who can afford to pay a little bit more should, perhaps, be asked to do so because if we do not do so, and the State does not have the capacity to pick up the full tab, as we continually hear, the only other option is that we continue to restrict access to those who otherwise cannot afford to avail of third level education.</p> <p>  Very firmly, I shall refer to our ethos.  Last year, we published a charter for the future of Irish universities, which we shared with all of the members of the Oireachtas.  One of the six core principles of the charter was to enhance access for the future.</p></speech>

Will ability to pay be adjudicated by the universities or the State?  Has the association done any work on what its solution might look like?  The association has come in here and said there is a funding problem.  I ask him to please explain how its solution to the funding problem will work.  What is the ballpark figure for the family income threshold?</p><p>My concern is that the bands of the SUSI grant, which formerly was the higher education grant, have been tightened.  The household income limit to avail of a SUSI grant is very low.  It cuts out those on middle incomes, which means these students cannot get any help and cannot afford to go college.</p></speech>

The association would look at it in terms of cost.  The cost of what the student is earning needs to be factored into it.  The cost of producing a medical graduate in terms of annual fees is many multiples of the &euro;3,000 registration fee.  If one looks at a whole range of disciplines, such as engineering, veterinary medicine, the cost of producing the graduates is dramatically greater and yet the lifetime earnings are substantially greater in the long term.</p> <p>  If one applies the principle of fairness, one would have to say there needs to be some rebalancing on that.  There are pragmatic difficulties in getting public support for some of those issues, but if we bring it back to the question of open access and ask whether it is fair that 100% of students in one secondary school in a particular postcode area have access to third level while at present as low as 10% of the leaving certificate students in another postcode area access third level, even though we know that there is no such gap in their potential and academic capacity, we as a society need to address that issue.  There is a difficult political challenge in that but the universities are very open to having a very honest discussion with Government on how best to tackle that issue.  I do not think we have had that proper debate since the Cassells report has been published.</p></speech>

I am still not clear as to what his solution is or how it works.  If Mr. Miley is looking at rebalancing on the basis of the earning potential of a particular course, it will do exactly what we do not want to do, which is to become a course for those in certain postcodes because they can afford the repayments.  That will put certain professions out of reach for many people.  I am not sure that is the way forward.</p> <p>  The universities say there is a funding problem.  It would be very helpful to the politicians, who, as Mr. Miley has acknowledged, are struggling with the issue politically if the association stated what it thinks is the best solution.  It is just the association's view.  It is not binding, but such an advisory view would be most helpful.  I am still not quiet sure what he is suggesting.  Is Mr. Miley suggesting that some students should pay something and that it should be based on the earning potential of those who do that course?  That is a bit intangible.  I will move on, but I kind of see the direction of where Mr. Miley is going.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Miley said that the gap in direct funding from the State of &euro;4,000 per student has been made up in two ways.  Some 50% of it has been made up by an increase in student registration fees and the other 50% has been made up by cost cutting at the universities.</p> <p>  A particular issue that politicians have encountered in recent years has been the hikes in the cost of on-campus student accommodation.  I am assuming that money is going to the universities and is probably being used to plug that hole.  That is an unwelcome development in the university sector because once again the universities are doing the one thing that Mr. Miley does not want to do, which is to make universities inaccessible to low and middle-income families.  The increases in the cost of some campus accommodation has been astronomical, and far higher than market rent increases.  It does seem to be a gouging of vulnerable students who have worked very hard to get a place in a particular university.  They almost have them where they want them because there is no alternative private rental market.</p><p>I would like to hear the witnesses' response to that because it has been a particularly difficult political situation for us.</p></speech>

It is recognised that if the universities had not provided student accommodation over recent years, the student accommodation crisis would have been much worse.  We have provided approximately 15,000 places.  If one examines the model used by universities, one will see that the money to build blocks of accommodation is almost exclusively borrowed.  The eight universities we represent have borrowed almost &euro;800 million from the European Investment Bank.  As the universities are run on a not-for-profit basis, any surplus that is made is ploughed back into refurbishing older blocks or building newer blocks.  Obviously, building costs have increased.  That directly reflects the current situation.  The universities are not-for-profit institutions.  They are not by any means looking to generate significant surpluses out of this.  If one looks at the profile of recent developments, one will see that the cost of building blocks of student accommodation has escalated dramatically in the past three or four years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#BB00900"><p>I suggest that the specific recent rent increases should be looked at in the context of the longer term.  As my colleague, Mr. Miley, has said, student accommodation is run on a not-for-profit basis.  Universities are not interested in gouging students or whatever.  Students are our core business.  Fundamentally, the first responsibility of a university is to its students.  If one examines the cost of student accommodation over the past ten years, one will find that there were few, if any, increases during the initial period.  Over the past two or three years, prior to the most recent round of increases to which the Deputy has referred, we have seen universities responding to market pressures like the cost of construction and the cost of refurbishment.  Increases have been introduced to reflect such pressures.  As my colleague has alluded to, the universities are operated on a cost-neutral basis.  In effect, the cost of new blocks helps to refurbish older blocks, many of which are 20 years old at this stage.  In many cases, the price increases in the most recent round were agreed with students six months ago.  When universities increase the price of student accommodation, it is generally following consultation with student unions.  Student unions are engaged with and are part of the decision-making process when prices are being decided on.  The prices were set in advance of the recent developments with regard to the Residential Tenancies Act.  It is not the case that the university sector increased prices in response to legislation aimed at capping prices.  In most cases - I cannot speak for every case - the decision to increase the price was made before there was any indication that purpose-built student accommodation would come within the ambit of the Residential Tenancies Act.</p></speech>

I do not agree that the price increases were set before there was any indication that pressure zones were going to come in.  For more than two years, we have been pressing for rent pressure zones to cover university accommodation.  It was very clear that this was coming down the tracks.  Some universities are charging in excess of &euro;1,000 more per month for rooms with shared living space.  Members of the Irish Universities Association may consider that acceptable, but it is not.  It is gouging students.  Universities should not be responding to market pressures.  They are not-for-profit organisations.  I acknowledge that they are not making a profit from the accommodation but, rather, redirecting funds to other areas of the university where money is lacking.  While I understand why that is happening, what is being done is not okay and students are suffering because of it.  The universities are pricing low to middle-income families out of student accommodation.  Very few of them can afford the rates being charged.  Universities are using funds from accommodation to plug holes elsewhere.  No one is buying the suggestion that the money is being recycled to refurbish other apartments.  There are clear problems in the university sector.  The rents were increased significantly because that is what is happening elsewhere and it is seen as acceptable.  I would have expected better from the universities than to respond to those market pressures.</p></speech>

On the funding model, I fundamentally disagree that parents who can afford to pay slightly more should do so.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the area which I represent, many non-fee-paying schools are at capacity and many parents have no option apart from sending their children to a private school.  Many make massive sacrifices to do so.  The fact that families send their children to a private school does not automatically mean they can afford to pay more than other families to send their children to college.  I understand the witnesses' thinking in that regard but we are a long way away from that being feasible.</p> <p>  On student accommodation, we must recognise the Government policy that has enabled its construction, including fast-track planning permission, European Investment Bank funding and the low-cost funding model.  It is a long-term investment.  It is not a quick fix but, rather, an ongoing income for colleges.  I acknowledge the maintenance cost involved and I agree that the cost of construction has increased.  What income is realised from the accommodation being let in the summer?  How much of it is let in the summer?  Is that money ring-fenced?  Does it go to the same area as the student accommodation income?</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Lisa Chambers on this issue.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government has been discussing this issue since the Thirty-second D&aacute;il was convened.  Representatives of several student unions appeared before the committee.  It did not come as a shock to anybody that student accommodation was included in the rent pressure zones.  We must recognise the security that gave to tenants and that the colleges came with us on that.</p> <p>  On the cost of student accommodation, the newly-built accommodation is of exceptionally good quality.  I visited a significant amount of it.  Whether they are four-bed or six-bed units with communal areas, the standard is very high.  However, that comes at a cost.  Do the witnesses envisage the cost of that accommodation decreasing in light of the anticipated increase in supply?</p></speech>

However, we are back in the territory of what we do not want.  We are asking the Government what is the solution.  If it does not wish to bring in student loans or to address the level of fees, the only logical solution is for the State to increase its contribution.  If that is the decision of the Government, universities will support that and will operate our businesses accordingly.  We need clarity on that issue to come out of the political process.</p> <p>  On accommodation, if it were feasible to decrease accommodation charges, universities would do so.</p><p>We need to bear in mind that the average lifespan of a university accommodation block, before it requires substantial refurbishment, is approximately 25 years.  Some of these accommodation blocks are on 25 to 35-year loans.  As we all know, loans have to be repaid and there is a charge to that.</p></speech>

The budget will build upon the parameters outlined in the summer economic statement.  Regarding the economic backdrop, the Irish economy continues to grow at a robust pace.  Gross domestic product, GDP, growth of 8.2% was recorded in 2018 while growth of 3.9% is forecast for this year.  We have one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, the public finances have significantly improved and last year, the country had an underlying surplus for the first time since 2006.</p><p> This year a general Government surplus of 0.2% of GDP is projected.  The general Government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall further to 61% by the end of 2019, bringing it below the euro-area average of 86%.  We are close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 5.2%.  However, some significant risks remain, including the increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.  There is also increasing evidence of a global economic slowdown, with the decline in growth of advanced economies occurring at a more rapid pace than previously anticipated.  As Ireland has a small open economy, with a high degree of integration in the world economy, any further escalation in trade protectionism would also have a strong impact on Irish growth forecasts.  There are also vulnerabilities in the public finances arising from the high concentration of corporation tax receipts.  Furthermore, there is a domestic economic risk related to overheating as the economy approaches full employment.  In summary, the economy is positioned between possible overheating, on the one hand, and the very real possibility of economic disruption, on the other.  Framing the budget will, therefore, be more challenging than usual.  The appropriate budgetary strategy is to build up resources that can be deployed in the event of a slowdown.  We will aim to build on what has gone well in recent years, but we are doing so at a time of real change.  </p><p> Earlier this year I outlined two budgetary approaches, while last Tuesday I decided that the budgetary strategy should be formulated on the assumption of a no-deal exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union at the end of October.  Consistent with the fiscal projections published in the Stability Programme Update, SPU, the framework for the budget involves a budgetary package of &euro;2.8 billion for 2020.  Of that budgetary package, &euro;2.1 billion is already pre-committed, with an expenditure reserve of up to &euro;200 million, with the capacity to accommodate funding requirements for the national broadband plan and the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  That leaves &euro;700 million to be allocated specifically in that part of the budget.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government has stated t will provide counter-cyclical support for the economy through social protection payments occasioned by higher unemployment and, on the revenue side, lower tax collections.  The Government has also indicated that it will introduce timely, targeted and temporary measures for the sectors most exposed.  Brexit contingency support may also be needed to address specific issues in the event of a "worst case scenario" of a disorderly Brexit.  This may lead to a deficit in the order of 0.5% to 1.5% of national income next year, amounting to a negative swing in the headline balance of up to &euro;6 billion.  In that context, the scope for budgetary measures, outside the Brexit-support package, needs to be constrained.  As such, all Departments need to ensure expenditure this year is managed within the allocations agreed by the Government and voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and, where expenditure pressures emerge, that mitigating measures are put in place.</p><p> At the end of August gross voted expenditure of &euro;42 billion was 0.6% below profile, with gross current expenditure 0.3% below profile and gross capital expenditure 3.7% below profile.  Year-on-year expenditure growth was 6.5%, with current spending up by 5.1% and capital spending by 25.5%.  The year-on-year increase of 6.5% at the end of August compares to the budgeted for full-year increase of 5.8%.  Health current expenditure has a budgeted for full-year increase of 5.8%.  At the end of August health expenditure was up by 6.7% year on year.</p><p>Given the priority placed on ensuring the delivery of sustainable improvements in the health service, with an overall allocation of &euro;17.1 billion this year compared to expenditure of &euro;14.1 billion in 2016, it is crucial that health expenditure, which was within profile at the end of August, continues to be proactively managed with all the necessary measures implemented to mitigate the risk to the public finances from an overrun this year.  This is why it is critical the expenditure position for budget 2020 is managed within the parameters set out in the mid-year expenditure report.  Departments are all required to reprioritise and manage spending to ensure offsetting measures can be put in place to mitigate the impact of emerging expenditure pressures and proposed new policy priorities.</p><p> We have always been clear that the UK's exit from the European Union will have a detrimental impact on our economy and public finances, whatever form it takes.  Work on a no-deal Brexit has the highest priority across government.  From a budgetary perspective for Ireland, which is the member state that will be most directly affected, it means ensuring we are as prepared as we can be for whatever outcome emerges.  We have taken steps in our national finances, capital investment plan, work on the rainy day fund and broadening the tax base.  We have also taken specific steps, including publishing two comprehensive contingency action plans, holding more than 1,200 stakeholder preparedness events in key sectors throughout the country, enhancing physical capacity at our ports and airports, providing training and financial supports to increase our customs capacity, recruiting additional staff in key areas and supporting additional dedicated measures to get Ireland Brexit ready in the budgets for 2017, 2018 and 2019.</p><p> Budget 2019 included an allocation of &euro;115 million in a number of areas, including increased resources of &euro;25 million in a range of Departments, a &euro;71 million package for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, an increase of &euro;14 million to the current allocation for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, &euro;5 million for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and &euro;13 million to support the opening of new markets and a higher international profile though our Global Ireland 2025 strategy.</p><p> Budget 2019 also put in place a longer-term loan scheme for terms of up to eight to ten years to provide a longer-term scheme facility of up to &euro;300 million to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment.  This will be jointly funded by the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> Further work is under way.  The Getting Your Business Brexit Ready &ndash; Practical Steps campaign focuses on the nine steps every business should take to help prepare for Brexit.  Revenue has issued tailored letters to more than 90,000 companies.  Work is also under way to issue targeted letters to approximately 10,000 traders who traded with the UK in the first quarter of 2019 and who are either new operators or in businesses that are newly trading with the UK.  We have launched the Clear Customs initiative.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has had direct engagement with more than 200,000 businesses via a tailored email issued by the Companies Registration Office.  Through LEOs, Enterprise Ireland is encouraging businesses to avail of the Prepare Your Business for Customs workshops.  InterTradeIreland's Bitesize Brexit campaign covers quick and practical steps for cross-Border traders.</p><p> On fiscal vulnerabilities, the high concentration of corporation tax receipts continues to represent a more vulnerable revenue stream.  This is why I stress that public spending must be financed on revenue that is predictable and sustainable.  Work is under way to examine the future sustainability of tax receipts in this area.</p><p> The management of the economy means that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit from a position of strength.  However, I am under no illusion about the challenges that could approach.  Our job now is to build on the progress made to date.  In the forthcoming budget, we will use a well-run economy and the progress we have made in recent years to support and protect our people at a time of unprecedented uncertainty.</p></speech>

I want to raise some specific points.  During the summer I met a number of car dealership owners in Kildare, who are constituents of mine.  They highlighted their concerns about changes due to be made in 2020 to the CO2 testing regime and the potential impact of the changes in bands on the price differentials between old and new cars, with specific reference to car imports.  Their view is that changes to the VRT regime are needed to take account of the distortions that will be caused by the new CO2 testing regime.  There is a lot of concern about this issue in car dealerships.  I want to check that this is something with which the Minister and his officials are familiar and of which they are aware.  I would like to hear any view the Minister might have on it.</p> <p>  The Minister referenced Brexit.  We are all concerned about the level of Brexit preparedness.  Looking at the key economic indicators in assessing how well prepared businesses are, I am conscious that the economic operators' registration and identification, EORI, number is something an Irish business will need to have to import into and export out of the European Union.  Irish businesses will need to have an EORI number to be able to trade with the United Kingdom post Brexit, while UK businesses will need to have a number to trade.  Does the Minister have statistics or numbers to indicate where we are with applications for EORI numbers?  Has there been an increase recently?</p> <p>  Last week Mr. Seamus Coffey of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, came before the committee.  I raised my concerns about IFAC's role in the costing of Opposition party budget proposals.  In particular, I referred to Fianna F&aacute;il's growing list of spending promises made it seems to every group.  The total cost was &euro;14.35 billion in the first six months of 2019.  In his response Mr Coffey highlighted IFAC's narrow mandate to assess the fiscal and macro plans set out by the Government.  He highlighted that the bodies in other EU countries with a similar mandate to that of IFAC also worked on costings and the plans of Opposition parties.  Yesterday I wrote to the Minister to ask whether the Department was open to enabling a broader costings function in IFAC's policy framework.</p></speech>

On his point about the CO2 testing regime and the consequences for the motor industry in Ireland, I met the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the representative body for car dealerships in Ireland, and we had a lengthy discussion on its concerns about the impact of introducing tax payments based on the real-time emissions of cars.  We also had a lengthy discussion on the impact of car imports on the sale of new cars in Ireland.  The mix has consequences for tax collection.  I saw some comments by SIMI today on the issue.  All I should say at this point is that I am certainly aware of the issues it has raised and that we will give them consideration.  Last year we introduced a new diesel surcharge to better reflect the environmental consequences of some diesel vehicles.  In the coming weeks I will have a look at whether further changes are needed.  I am aware of some of what is happening in the car industry and some of the changes in the numbers of new cars being sold and the composition of all car sales in the country.</p> <p>  On where we are with EORI registration, this was an issue that received some attention earlier in the year.  As the Deputy is aware, all businesses will need an economic operators' registration and identification number to trade with the United Kingdom if and when it becomes a third country.</p><p>Some 5,000 businesses registered in August alone and that was an increase of 600% on the July figure.  There has been a significant increase in the number of registrations that have taken place.  A total of 88% of the import trade with the UK in 2018 was carried out by businesses which now have an EORI number.  The comparable number for export trade is 95%.  There has been a significant shift in the registration of traders to get their customs numbers in place.  </p><p> That said, my concern is there is a large cohort of smaller companies whose share of trade with the UK is small or the share of whose imports from the UK is small as a percentage of total trade.  There are, however, many of these companies, all of which employ people and create income and jobs in their communities.  While we have made progress on customs preparedness across the summer, more needs to be done in the coming weeks.</p><p> Finally, on the point about looking at the mandate of IFAC, that is something to which I will give consideration.</p></speech>

The Minister says that he is planning budget 2020 on the basis of a no-deal Brexit.  Can he explain whether that means the official statistics to be contained within the budget book will show that Ireland expects to have a deficit in the region of &euro;5 billion next year or will the Minister provide two options?</p></speech>

If we continue in a deal environment or an agreement environment next year, we will point to the level of surplus we will have.  We would expect a growth in our first surplus of this year into next year.  We will be outlining in the budget documentation the predicted outcome in respect of our national finances if a no-deal Brexit occurs at any point next year.</p> <p>  The level of certainty about some of those impacts is different to other kinds of economic planning that we have done because it will obviously depend on when in 2020 a no-deal Brexit might occur.  Even now, despite all the modelling we have done, it is still difficult to be definitive about the exact impact on our economy.</p></speech>

We must put in place the right measures that are needed to support the economy.  A considerable fund will potentially be needed to do that, but, at the same time, we need to put in place measures that will be temporary and targeted in order that we will be in a position to move from that level of support when the time comes.</p></speech>

None of us knows what the real impact of Brexit will be and I am not asking the Minister to predict what it will be, but we have indicative figures that suggest there could be a deficit of &euro;5 billion.  That is the base line that was set out in the summer economic statement.  Can the Minister give a sense of the size and scale of additional, temporary measures envisaged?  Are we talking about a figure of &euro;1 billion, &euro;2 billion, or much less?  That will obviously have an affect on the overall deficit figure, possibly moving it from &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion, depending on the scale of the measures the Minister has in mind.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned a deficit of &euro;5 billion.  That is not the case.  We anticipate a swing of up to &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion if we were to go all the way to 1.5% of national income.  The work on the composition of the additional measures is not yet done.  I am engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the measures that might be needed in a no-deal setting.</p></speech>

I am using the figures the Minister presented in the summer economic statement which show there is the potential for a deficit of &euro;5 billion in year one.  The question for the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is about the amount.  I do not expect the Minister to answer to the nearest euro or cent, but are we talking about an amount in the hundreds of millions or billions for the temporary measures that would be needed to address a no-deal scenario?</p></speech>

They are a mix of jobs not created and jobs lost.  As we are not able to make a sectoral analysis with any degree of accuracy, I am not going to put figures in front of the committee that I will subsequently be unable to stand over.  The supports that will be provided will vary in different parts of the economy.  Some parts of the economy will need some grant support to deal with the changes through which they are going.  We may need to look at other measures, for example, for what the agrifood sector could face.</p></speech>

Some of the job losses will be concentrated in particular regions.  Is it time for the Government to revisit the decision it took last year to increase the VAT rate to 13.5% in one fell swoop, given what the tourism and hospitality sector may be facing into?</p><p>Is that one of the options the Minister would look at?</p></speech>

I have noted some of the analysis on the change in visitors to different parts of the country.  Much of that is driven by consumer confidence in other countries and the income levels in those countries.  We need to bear that in mind when examining the policy response.  There are two levels to my current thinking on this point.  First, I am well aware that some parts of Ireland will be affected differently to others, such as is the experience of the Deputy's constituency.  This is a factor in the work I am undertaking at present.  I refer to Border counties and areas that are particularly dependent on tourism.  Second, I must consider access to the country and awareness of everything Ireland has to offer from a tourism perspective.  I am examining these areas with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  I am well aware that the impact of Brexit will be felt differently in different parts of Ireland.</p></speech>

It is not only tourism where the north west will be hit hardest but also manufacturing, along with the south east.</p> <p>  I refer to the customs checks which will arise in the context of a no-deal Brexit and that the Government is now discussing with the Commission.  The Taoiseach has stated that checks will be required near the Border.  Has the Minister factored this into his estimates for 2019 or 2020?  Can he give the committee and indication of how many different locations there might be in close proximity to the Border, or near the Border as the Taoiseach said, where they would have to be set up?  Can he speak on the employment of the personnel needed to carry these checks out?  I ask this question while mindful of my complete disagreement with the idea of customs checks.  It must be resisted by the Government.  It will harden the Border on the island of Ireland, it undermines the Good Friday Agreement and serious consequences arise from it.  However, my questions are from a budgetary perspective, that is, on the cost associated with the personnel to man them and the number of checks that will be required near the Border.  I know none of this is nailed down now but will the Minister give an indication of what we face?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#SS00400"><p>I absolutely understand all the sensitivities on the potential location of checks.  This is the very reason why we are standing by the need for the backstop and standing over the principle of regulatory alignment.  As the Deputy knows well, the way we can ensure that all our commitments to the Good Friday Agreement, to the need for frictionless trade on the island of Ireland and to our membership of the Single Market can be reconciled is through the principle of regulatory alignment as an insurance policy.  That is why we have stood by this principle for two and a half years.  To be fair, the Deputy and his party have understood this.</p> <p>  On whether I have made any decisions on the number of checkpoints or on hiring staff for them, the answer is "No".  I have not done so because work and engagement with the Commission on the area is still ongoing and we are deeply mindful of the sensitivity to which the Deputy refers.  I am deeply aware of the need to be very careful in this area.  I reiterate that this is why the backstop is so important and why the principle of regulatory alignment is the answer to the Deputy's questions in the long run.  The reason we are even considering this is that at some point, we need to be able to give assurance that the manufactured goods being made in Donegal, which are being sold elsewhere in Europe, are being made in Donegal.</p><p>Ultimately, this is about how we can protect jobs and investment in Ireland.  We wholly appreciate the sensitivity around this, which is why the backstop and regulatory alignment is critical and why so much work is being undertaken on it.  </p></speech>

I will start where the Minister left off, namely, on regulatory alignment and specifically on the need for some form of fiscal alignment, particularly from a cross-Border perspective.  To what degree are the Minister or his officials speaking to the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the person responsible, David Sterling?  For example, the Minister has flagged well his intention to introduce some form of carbon tax this year.  The detrimental effect of what is mooted would probably equate to approximately &euro;2 or &euro;3 on a full tank of petrol or diesel.  Another more recent example is the commitment to reintroduce duty free shopping.  While everyone along the Border will welcome the opportunity to go on booze cruises, the much lauded and appreciated Carlingford Lough ferry will become a booze cruise because of the differential rates in VAT and taxes.  Ultimately, such differences in respect of commodities will drive people to both buy fuel and to do their weekly shopping across the Border.  I think I am expressing the view of most Border Deputies that some sort of fiscal alignment needs to be guaranteed.  I suspect that was happening in recent years, as the differential in price between those commodities were very small.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Minister indicated to this committee that there would be contingencies on a sector-by-sector basis for supports that were needed, particularly from the EU.  He gave a commitment that those packages would be in place.  Will he reiterate that assurance?  As I stated then, one only needs to look at the current beef crisis, where we had an allocation of &euro;100 million earlier in the year, but it took so long to trickle through.  The sectors must be supported and guaranteed the necessary finance, not in three or six months', but almost immediately.</p> <p>  The Parliamentary Budget Office has clearly flagged the Minister's remarks about the sustainability of corporation tax, which rose from &euro;2.3 billion in 2015 to around &euro;4.2 billion in 2018.  We all know it is not sustainable but I was alarmed by the figures provided to us.  Some 77% of all corporation tax receipts come from the multinational sector, as do 22% of employment, 25% of income tax and USC and 39% of gross value added.  We have been given figures to the effect that were one of these multinational companies to exit, it would amount to a loss to the economy equivalent to &euro;430 million.  That is equivalent to the carbon tax figures referred to by the Minister.  We all know this cannot be sustained.  What are the Minister's plans to correct this?  Were we to lose one or two, and it is all possible in a downturn, we would be in serious difficulty.     </p></speech>

I am well aware of the sensitivity of any decision that I make on carbon tax to petrol stations and local trade in Border counties.  It is not that long ago that cross-Border shopping and trade flows were significant issues to our economy and had many impacts, including on tax receipts.</p><p> The Deputy's second point related to duty free.  When I introduced the Brexit omnibus Bill earlier in the year, I made clear that I would only introduce duty free on a reciprocal basis.  If the United Kingdom made a decision to introduce it - it has now indicated that in a no-deal situation it would introduce it - we would then give an indication that we would do the same.  One of the reasons for doing that is to ensure that we are treating all third country passengers the same in respect of the shopping facilities available to them.</p><p> On the engagement we have had with European Commission about dealing with a no-deal Brexit, the EU has referred to the fund that was made available to deal with the consequences of the change in pricing for farmers in the beef sector and the major difficulties they are facing.  I understand the most recent figures indicate an uptick in the drawdown of that fund.  I expect that to continue as the level of challenge the Deputy mentioned grows.</p><p> On the work the Parliamentary Budget Office has done, the Deputy touched on many vulnerabilities.  During the global economic crisis from 2008 up to quite recently, we increased our share of foreign direct investment into the country.  While he is correct to say there is always the possibility of a company leaving, which would have serious consequences for employment and tax take, there are two ways of responding.  The first is by running budgetary surpluses.  We began the slow process of putting in place a budgetary surplus for this year.  I hope to grow it next year, assuming we work our way through Brexit.  Separately, through projects like the future jobs programme, we will put in place the kinds of programmes we need to create new forms of work that are either higher value within the international sector or are located outside the multinational sector.</p></speech>

It is imperative to have a greater understanding of the implications and what the State needs to do to cushion ourselves against the calamitous events that might ensue.</p> <p>  As the Minister has alluded to, with a no-deal Brexit we would be facing substantially greater budget deficits, increased borrowings and growth forecasts adjusted downwards.  Is it not inevitable, therefore, that there will be an almost immediate impact on the ongoing capital development plan?  We have had many announcements associated with Project Ireland 2040.  Investment in transport alone will be &euro;25 billion over ten years.  A capital investment of &euro;2 billion this year has been announced in the area of health.</p> <p>  The Minister has said that the surpluses that will be available based on the projected growth rates will inevitably pay for the national broadband plan over time.  In the absence of a contract being signed for that project, is there a cost on the State having conferred preferred bidder status already?  I asked that question some months ago and am still awaiting the answer.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?</p> <p>  An extra &euro;2.4 billion has been pumped into health since 2017.  The constituents we represent do not see that manifested on the ground.  They do not see the sorts of inroads one would have expected to address waiting lists.</p><p>While there is a commitment in name to the all-party committee's recommendations, will we now see less provided for their implementation because of the impact of a no-deal Brexit?  Therefore, we will continue not to see the impact we would like on waiting lists.  We will continue not to see the great increase in funding manifesting in the availability of home help packages or hours or assessments for those most in need.</p><p> Earlier this year the Government committed to having a health oversight committee.  Has it met?  Has it been effective?  What improvements have ensued because of it?  Are we still facing an overrun?  Are the minutes of meetings of the committee available to us and the public to ascertain if it is having the effect the Government sought?  We are told that there is something to be learned from our past and the failure to rein in in a timely fashion our dependency on revenue that accrued from the property sector.  In recent weeks others far more qualified than I have pointed to the same mistakes being made with the windfall in corporation tax receipts.  In that sphere the Minister said he would carry out a study which would be available in March.  In the context of a no-deal Brexit and given the perilous nature of the State's finances as a result of commitments we have to make, would it not advisable for the Minister and is it not incumbent on him and his Department to bring forward the study at this juncture in order that it can play its part in informing the House in making the right decisions as it is expected to do so on the budget?</p></speech>

We all hope the risks will not materialise.  Even though we are framing the budget on the basis that there will be a no-deal Brexit, of course, every effort will be made to avoid that taking place through the diplomatic and political work in which the Government is involved.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the public capital plan and Project Ireland 2040.  The case I will be making to the D&aacute;il and the public is that if Brexit is actually happening, with the effect it will have across the island, this is the time to stand by Project Ireland 2040 and deliver on our commitments.  One of my big learnings during the economic crisis and in its aftermath was that very sudden and large reductions in public capital investment meant that in many cases the need was greater when an economy recovered.  If we are moving through a slowdown of economic growth, in many ways Project Ireland 2040 is the best possible response.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, will bring a report to the Cabinet on the debates that took place at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the national broadband plan.  The current bidder is still the preferred bidder, but the Minister will bring a report to the Cabinet to update it.  On a related point, the parts of the economy and country that will suffer the most in the event of a no-deal Brexit are also the parts that have the potential to benefit the most from the roll-out of the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  On health expenditure and current performance to date, at the end of August we had budgeted for an increase of 7.1%.</p><p>At the same point in the year we had an actual increase of 7.9%, which was a difference of 0.8 percentage points, whereas at the same point one year ago that figure was 3.2%.  There is a different level in terms of where we are with the management of health expenditure, but I am still very much alive to risks that could materialise later in the year.  How we deal with that potential risk is a massive area of ongoing focus for me.</p><p> I shall now turn to the health expenditure oversight group.  The group met eight times this year.  Reference was made to the minutes of the group meetings being available.  Many of the minutes from this group have been in the national newspapers where details have been outlined in a fair bit of transparency.  The agenda for those meetings and the work that has happened has been around where we are - from a budgeting view - with recruitment for different parts of our health service and where we are with spending versus what was budgeted with regard to different sectors within the HSE service plan.</p><p> The Deputy's final question was on bringing forward the work on the sustainability of corporate tax receipts.  I will certainly give this consideration but between now and next March the action step is going to be the same.  The action step will be in the context of a no-deal Brexit taking place and to try to ensure our surplus next year is as high as possible so that if we end up in a no-deal situation the effect on our national finances will be more manageable.  I will, however, talk to my officials about it and see if we can make that work available to the House more quickly.</p></speech>

The Minister has already indicated that he is not inclined to change income tax credits or allowances for people paying income tax, which is the whole PAYE sector and others who pay income tax.  Speaking at this committee last week the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council indicated that this is worth some &euro;600 million.  At a time when workers' incomes are rising by about 3% per annum it would actually generate a plus to the State of some &euro;600 million.  Today I heard the Taoiseach suggest that it may now be identified as some &euro;700 million.  On budget day this is going to be the key area within which the Minister will have to play around.  I appreciate the very difficult constraints of Brexit; we all do.</p> <p>  I want to find out, however, if the Minister is seriously thinking of no social welfare increases at all.  There are two points to be made in this regard.  The Minister must bear in mind that people who are carers, are pensioners or who have a serious disability - especially those who are over the age of 55 - have no capacity to go out to get extra work to earn extra income, and therefore they are particularly vulnerable.  While not disclosing the details of his budget, perhaps the Minister would share with us his thinking on this very important group of people.  I am aware it is very difficult.  I recall as a Minister inheriting a requirement for &euro;440 million of cuts in the deal done by our predecessors in Government.  I got that figure down to some &euro;200 million.  I cannot understand that the Minister and the Taoiseach could actually be contemplating no increases in social protection.</p><p>I understand the Minister has been cautious in his use of language, but I believe many of the PAYE workers who are contributing the &euro;700 million to the Exchequer are glad to see that it goes towards something important.  The demographics show that there has been an increase in the number of pensioners, as well as in the number of carers, which is linked with the rising age of the population.  In a way, this is a great boon to the State, but I cannot understand how it will be dealt with, especially in the context of Brexit and the recent developments in oil prices.</p><p> The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and other commentators on the economy and the European Union are concerned about the skills shortages in the building industry.  I have raised this issue with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  I stress to the Minister that areas with significant pockets of high unemployment are being left behind as the rest of the economy tightens with almost full employment.  The performance is very poor in taking on trainees and apprentices.  Will the Minister put a rocket under whoever runs SOLAS?  Ireland will need to import people, for whom we do not have homes, to build houses as happened during the last boom.  That is what then helped the economy to crash.  Everyone here is prepared to work with the Minister on this issue if we can get that to happen.</p><p> My third question-----</p></speech>

It is a fair point.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about social welfare changes, I represent a constituency which is beside hers.  I have many constituents for whom social welfare payments make a gigantic difference.  They are not in work and the payments make a very big difference to their standard of living.  Many of them do not have the opportunity to benefit from the changing and improving incomes we have seen in the past two years.  I am, therefore, well aware of the importance of social welfare policy to such persons.  There will be a social welfare package included in budget 2020, but its scale and composition will be different from that in previous years.  I will be working with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and Fianna F&aacute;il on it.  Guiding it will be an appreciation that social welfare payments and parts of the social welfare code make a very big difference to some citizens.</p> <p>  On the issue of skills shortages, I had a meeting with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, a number of weeks ago and this was the key item we addressed.  We discussed apprenticeships and how - even now there are 100,000 fewer people working in the construction sector than a decade ago - we needed more people working in it.  We need more people who are living in Ireland to work in the sector.  We have a construction sector working group, on which the CIF and other bodies are represented.  We are looking at a few ideas to see if we can increase the awareness of apprenticeships and do more to encourage more men and women to take them up.</p> <p>  I turn to the Deputy's question about smuggling.</p><p> I am well aware of the level of risk we could face from smuggling and other illegal activity in a no-deal setting.</p></speech>

Some of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked.  The Minister mentioned apprenticeships, which has been a hobby horse of mine for several years.  He needs to start not where he has done but rather engage in education.  As I stated at another debate when representatives from the Construction Industry Federation appeared before the committee, this year, as always, there were hours of wall-to-wall coverage of leaving certificate results and of the Central Admissions Office process, whereas only three minutes were given to apprenticeships.  The change has to start in school and it will take a while for it to spin off.  We have to begin a process of valuing apprenticeships and putting them on an equal platform to a college education.  That is a matter for another day but the Minister might bear it in mind.</p> <p>  On the control of the health budget, is the Minister aware of any budgets that had always been under the health Vote but that were transferred to the Vote of other Departments?</p></speech>

We envisage there will be another overrun in the anticipated corporation tax take, that is, that it will exceed expectations.  If that happens, how does the Minister intend to use any excess over what was anticipated?</p> <p>  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has received many warnings in the past two or three years about the over-reliance on a small number of significant contributors to the large corporation tax figures.  Does the Minister discuss such matters with the Revenue Commissioners?  They do not reveal the details to the public but they know who pays tax and who the big payers are.  Does the Minister know who the big payers are?  I presume the answer is "No" because it is a confidential matter.  Is there any mechanism for the Revenue Commissioners to warn the Government if they notice a significant decline in the corporation tax paid by a principal contributor over, say, the past five years?  Are there any warning lights?  IFAC is not able to give us the information.</p></speech>

The total level of Supplementary Estimates last year, which materialised between September and November, was not acceptable and I do not intend that to be repeated this year.  I am working to ensure that as much as possible of the additional corporation tax we collect will feed into our national finance position, as opposed to it dealing with the cost of Supplementary Estimates.</p><p> On the question about the Revenue Commissioners and how they engage with me, they share information with me regarding the concentration of revenue tax collection within various sectors, by decile.  That information is publicly available and they share much of it with the Oireachtas.  I believe that the Deputy has used it, as have other Deputies.  They do not provide much beyond that to me in private, nor would I ask them to.  We have a large cases division, which manages tax collection from the largest employers.  The information is sometimes shared with me in different aggregates from what might be provided publicly, with a little more detail but not enough for me to know who pays what.  That is not made available to me and I would not request it.</p><p> This is why I believe that the work Deputy Cowen mentioned is important and why I want it to be done by the Department of Finance rather than by a third party.  IFAC finds it difficult to answer the question.  I have a number of views on what I expect to happen but the answer will depend on what happens sector by sector.  My Department, therefore, should do that work and should have a different level of engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to be able to give the House a better answer on the medium-term sustainability of corporation tax collection.</p></speech>

It is a strength of our institutions that the only job of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect tax in accordance with the law.  Nevertheless, because of the growing concentration of corporation tax receipts within certain companies, and the growing share of that in the scale of our total tax collection, we need a different approach to how we manage the issue in the future.  We recently appointed an independent expert, Mr. Seamus Coffey, to produce a report on the matter.  He did great work on it and it has been very helpful to me.  We need a different level of private engagement with the Revenue Commissioners, and only my Department can do that.  They do not raise red flags or make forecasts beyond what we make in the budget book seen by Deputies because they are not charged with doing that.</p></speech>

I attended a conference earlier where somebody stated that, when taken in the round, the impact of electric cars will be to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 20%.  In light of all the ballyhoo, that is not very significant and it does not take into account that when they are run in Ireland, they probably are powered by fossil fuels.  What is the Minister's latest thinking in that regard?  We could be very good in Ireland, given that the Minister is late in addressing the matter.  Perhaps that is not a bad thing for devising policy because we can learn from other countries.  The matter is reflected in car sales.  Consumers are confused about the best step to take.  Should it be hybrid or electric or where are we going to be?  I am not trying to trap the Minister but instead trying to understand his thinking on the matter.</p></speech>

We will have to make changes to VRT to align it with environmental performance.  Due to the changes happening at European level, we are introducing real-time emissions testing.  The paper was well received by the motor industry because it was clear.  I will work on the issue in the next few weeks.</p><p>In response to Deputy Lahart, a 20% reduction of itself is still valuable and is still worth having.  I am sure he would agree with that, but I believe that saving will improve over time.  As the technology that is available to the motor industry continues to improve, the contribution that either hybrid or electric cars can make to our climate challenge will improve too.  I am not just looking at measures for the vehicles that are available now.  I am thinking about the vehicles that could be available in a few years.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, could not have been more critical last week, saying that the loss of control in our public finances in the past three years precluded a countercyclical borrowing response in this upcoming budget based on its projections on the likely effects of a no-deal Brexit on the economy.  Will the Minister state whether he thinks there will be additional borrowing?  Obviously this is difficult because our borrowings keep changing, we refinance some loans and start other loans.  Does the Minister expect that there will be a net increase in Government borrowing because of the scenario we are facing.of a no-deal Brexit?   If so, what is the timing on that?  Will that be agreed on budget day or is it pending a no-deal outcome after the fact?  How does the Minister forecast for what he will borrow next year?</p></speech>

He simply made the point that it is better to borrow to keep somebody in a job than it is to deal with the consequences of the person not being in a job.  Lest there be any doubt about this, when we have to make additional resources available to pay jobseeker's benefit as more people become unemployed, we will of course, do that.</p> <p>  On the issue of the general assessment of our preparedness in terms of the national finances, options could have been taken in recent years to bring us to the point where we would have a higher surplus that we are projecting to have this year.  However, if levels of capital investment in our economy were still in line with where they were in 2014 to 2016, no doubt I would be facing the charge that the Government was not investing enough in building more homes, hospitals and so on.</p></speech>

That was not because of an overrun on the children's hospital or on the national broadband plan, which we have not spent on yet, but increased spending in every area.  There was a &euro;10 billion difference between what we expected to spend and what we did spend.</p> <p>  Is the Minister projecting to increase borrowing in this budget that may give additional fiscal space to the stated &euro;2.8 billion that IFAC has agreed?

The Oireachtas committee agreed a broad consensus, with some exceptions, that we should increase the price of carbon to &euro;80 a tonne by 2030, which would mean a &euro;10 increase in 2020 and an increase of &euro;5 per annum thereafter.  It is reported in the newspapers today that Fianna F&aacute;il believes that the increase in the first year should be lower and it is also reported that the Government agrees with Fianna F&aacute;il that we would not increase it, as the Oireachtas committee recommended.  I would be keen to know if the Minister has any view on that.</p> <p>  We held an event in the audio-visual room during the summer where we brought in the best expertise to look at how one would use that money and it confirmed in my mind the view that giving back the money as a cash back dividend is progressive and hugely beneficial.  In social progressivity, it really benefits those on lower incomes.  It has the desired effect of lowering emissions, it gives a clear signal and politically it is beneficial insofar as we do not have to decide between one sector or the other as to where we would allocate the revenues that would be raised.  It would take the issue out of this annual debate, where in this case Fianna F&aacute;il is saying that although it agreed the position a few months ago it is now scaling back because there is understandable political heat around it.  The cash back approach is the best way in my mind to introduce this and give certainty and gain political acceptance.  I would be interested to learn whether the Minister is still considering that option and will still consider it.  Has he agreed with the Oireachtas committee's graduated approach or has that changed now?</p></speech>

I have had discussions with Fianna F&aacute;il, and we have both publicly acknowledged that these are just about the overall issues we have to think about in terms of the budget.  On the question of whether I have made any decision if we were to do a change in carbon tax and how we would handle the revenue generated by that, again at this point, we are considering options, we have not made a decision.  However, I have said on a number of previous occasions that if we are going to make changes in carbon taxation, we have to treat the revenue from carbon taxation in a different way from other tax changes that we have done.  For example when I made the change last year on VAT, that went back into general Government revenue.  If we are looking to make a considerable change in the price of carbon in our economy, we will have to demonstrate to the country that the money is being used in particular ways.</p> <p>  On the question of the level of change that is being made or could be made, I have not made a decision but I am very mindful of the effect that Brexit could have, of the impact that a lower value of sterling could have on the price of fuel and of some of the issues that Deputy Breathnach raised.</p></speech>

I know the Department of Finance came out with a report in the summer, stating the revenue should not be given back in a dividend or cash back.  I suppose the Department would say that, in terms of asking whether a fox wants a hen house open or not, of course the fox does.  The Department wants that revenue, even if it is hypothecated for expenditure on energy efficiency and other measures; it knows we have a massive budget requirement in that regard so by not giving it back as a dividend, it will help their general Exchequer position.  Let me put the other political argument in favour of why we should pay a dividend.  It is because of the political reason that it builds public support among every section of society.  We were going to ask everybody to take part in helping this by giving it back as cash back payment, it fundamentally assists us in actually getting everybody on board.  That is a political reason that the Department of Finance could not possibly measure or gauge but it still exists.</p></speech>

The kinds of considerations that I am weighing up at present is that we will have parts of our economy that will experience rapid change as a result of the change to a lower emission economy.  It is already happening.</p><p>Is there not a case to be made for using the proceeds from changes in carbon tax to help cushion or support people in adjusting or getting new jobs or forms of work?  We have not made a final decision in this regard and I am examining both options.</p></speech>

I said that within the &euro;2.8 billion, we will look to use the funding to deal with the measures needed to get our country Brexit-ready and dealing with some of the effects of a no-deal Brexit.  If a no-deal Brexit were to occur next year, the needs we would have in meeting social welfare commitments and putting in place measures to support different parts of our economy would likely require us to put new funding in place.</p></speech>

I have now been participating in debates like this for three years and I have never sat in front of this committee while somebody called on me to run larger surpluses.  That has not happened.  In my many years participating in debates like this, I have never had a single politician calling on me to spend less.  The reason is that it is my job to get the balance right because I have the privilege of being a Minister.  If we are going to have a debate on whether we should be running larger surpluses now, I am well up for that debate.  Of course, I will ask anybody participating in any of the budget day debates to point to where I had been asked to run larger surpluses or smaller deficits.</p> <p>  More broadly, taking in rates of Government expenditure over the past number of years, the cumulative rate of growth in current expenditure over the past five years was 19%.  Between 2004 and 2009, it was 57%.  That is the level of difference in comparing now and then.  There are 2.3 million people at work in the complete absence of the private sector lending boom that last time was needed to create that rate of employment.  I look at where we are overall in our national finances and the broader health of our economy and we are in a very different place to where we were a decade ago.</p></speech>

That is effectively what he said.  Representatives of IFAC, an independent watchdog that exists to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, came before the committee last week and were scathing in their comments.</p><p>Effectively, they said the mistakes of the past are being repeated and they advised that surpluses should have been run for the past three years but these have not materialised, with corporation tax receipts masking this.  The Minister is having a cut at Opposition politicians for not putting more pressure on him to run a surplus but this does not answer the charge levelled at his door by IFAC.</p></speech>

I was very clear in putting forward my argument that the responsibility sits with me.  I was crystal clear about it as I agree with the Deputy.  It would be a pretty poor argument to put to her that I did not run a higher surplus because I was not asked to do so.  I was very clear in what I said, perhaps in anticipation of her retort.  I said it is my job to try to get the overall balance right.</p> <p>  For example, the Deputy made the point that there were some areas of unplanned expenditure, particularly those associated with health, that could have been handled differently and better.  That would, of course, have caused significant consequences too with respect to citizens and service delivery.  It is fair in any debate to make the point about the level of current expenditure now versus where we were a decade ago.  That is in the context of us coming out of a crisis and the level of pent-up need and demand to meet that need.  The figures I put to the Deputy merit a role in this debate, and that is why I am now putting such effort into managing where we are with expenditure this year and ensuring we can at this point deliver a surplus.  I seek to maximise that surplus in advance of getting into any difficulty if such difficulty arises.</p></speech>

I read the Minister's opening statement, which indicates that public spending must only be financed by revenue that is predictable and sustainable.  Corporation tax receipts are neither predictable nor sustainable and yet they were used to plug considerable holes in health spending last year.  It looks like we are on track for significant overrun in that Department's expenditure again this year.  IFAC has also taken that opinion.  It seems that although the Minister for Health has been asked not to oversee an overrun in his budget, he consistently does it anyway.  I assume a supplementary budget will yet again be forthcoming to plug another hole in the health area.</p></speech>

We had a planned budget increase of 7.1% for the end of August and at that time, the actual increase was 7.9%.  There was a 0.8% difference between planned and actual expenditure.  The figure a year ago was 3.2%.  There is a considerable change in the current figures when compared with where we were a year ago.  That said, there are still three and a half months in the year and the Minister for Health and I are working very hard to deliver a better overall performance than we did a year ago.  As I said a few moments ago, what happened a year ago was unacceptable with respect to the magnitude of the overall supplements required.  The group put in place to deal with the matter, chaired by my Department, has met on eight different occasions this year.</p></speech>

I am working to do so.  Against that, in most of the years in which I have been involved with this process, the magnitude of the health overrun would have been clear at this point of the year.</p></speech>

Reports from Ernst &amp;amp; Young last week suggest rural communities could go into a type of recession, while there is a report today from the Central Bank that one third of small farms could go out of business in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  These communities and sectors will need considerable immediate support in that event.  There are also reports that in the tourism sector we could be facing up to 10,000 job losses and in the agrifood sector, perhaps 12,500 jobs.  There is real concern about this in rural communities because in many communities these are the two biggest employers and there is no alternative source of work.  Will specific supports be provided for in the budget for the tourism and agrifood sectors that would be put in place immediately, rather than adopt a wait and see approach to see how bad things are and then borrow money?</p></speech>

We need to be very careful when we say potential supports are available and then grant them, even though a no-deal Brexit does not happen.  That would create a considerable and significant deterioration in the national finances.  I have not made a decision on that matter.  It is fair to say most of the resources that might be available would be for how we deal with a no-deal Brexit because I am well aware of the impact it would have on the communities to which the Deputy refers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#EEE00300"><p>It is clear from the budget the Minister is preparing that there will be a tax package and a social welfare package.  The official statistics will show that we are in surplus, not a no-deal situation, where we will be in deficit, yet, as the Minister says, it is being framed as a no-deal budget.  If it was really being framed as a no-deal budget, it would be very different because it would show the deficit.  They would be the official figures and so on.  I am concerned about the package that will be available to deal with contingencies.  Unfortunately, not much information on the sector-specific analysis has been released.  It would equip us to see what would be the best responses for those sectors in the context of there being no deal.  None of us knows what the real impact would be, but there are some things we can predict in respect of the agrifood sector and what will happen if sterling moves to a certain point because certain sectors are price-sensitive.</p> <p>  We have argued for a Brexit contingency fund.  On Brexit preparedness, the Minister has said he has the rainy day fund.  We have heard the IFAC tell the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that the rainy day fund cannot be used to fund Brexit mitigation measures.  As set down in legislation, it is very clear that there are three criteria for its use: structural reform, financial support and natural disasters but not something that is anticipated or identified.  Is the Minister suggesting the rainy day fund can be used to support sectors such as agrifood and tourism in particular regions that will be hit by Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>

The deposit has not yet happened.  If it had happened and we were dealing with the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, section 9 of the Bill would allow me to use that funding to deal with those consequences.  It is semi-moot at the moment because the deposit has not happened.</p></speech>

The language the Minister uses is very measured because he refers to the tail-risk Brexit, but the fund cannot be used for issues identified.  Some of the documentation from the Department specifically states that it cannot be used for Brexit.  That might be a moot point, as the Minister said, because the money has not been lodged.  Has the &euro;1 billion from ISIF gone into the fund?</p></speech>

There was &euro;1.5 billion to go in at the end of the year and &euro;500 million from next year's budget.  Would it not be wise, given the political and economic likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, not to lodge that money with a fund when there is at best a question mark over our ability to use it for that, and create a fund instead that could be left in the surplus but that could be drawn down when and if it is needed to deal with sectors and regions in response to a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>

I will take on board what the Deputy says.  I simply have not made a decision yet on the use of that funding.  The Deputy is correct.  I am being careful in my use of language on how a rainy day fund could be used because it is described as being used for dealing with tail risks of a no-deal Brexit.  I am considering the use of funding like that and how it would be managed, but the first matter I want to be clear about is the right level of support.</p></speech>

He should not lock down resources that may not be available to us if we need them for Brexit, because otherwise we will have to borrow those resources.</p></speech>

I would find it scary to believe that everything that has been done has been published, as was suggested earlier.  There has to be serious consideration given to the impact of no deal, sector by sector and region by region.  It may not be released for whatever reason, negotiations are continuing and so on, but will the Minister put me at my ease by saying that work has been carried out?  Is it not time, or when is the time, for the Minister to release that information and make it available to the public, and to us as committee members, to discuss and plan the best response for those sectors in the event of no deal?  Otherwise, a rabbit will be pulled out of a hat because we have not seen any of the detail.</p></speech>

The last contingency action plan was published before the summer.  It referred to different impacts that Brexit might have on different parts of the economy.  Work is ongoing on the sectoral impact in the greatest level of detail possible.</p></speech>

On that occasion we legislated for it but the Minister had had assurances from his counterpart, Philip Hammond, that the British Government would not go down the direction of a duty-free zone.  That has obviously changed.  At the time, the Minister clarified to the House that this would be of serious significance for himself and the Exchequer.  Now that it potentially is a reality, given a no-deal Brexit, what is its significance?  What will be the hit to the Exchequer?  Is it just the case that it will be balanced off given that we have reciprocated?  In that debate I raised an issue, which was picked up earlier by Deputy Breathnach, namely, that there are three well-established ferry crossings between North and South.  I know that this would require authorisation but there would be an EU frontier on our island.  Is there now a scenario where one could nip across the Border on the ferry and, as one can in London, buy 400 Silk Cut purple for &pound;63 rather than paying &euro;260 for them in the shop in the South?  Is that a real scenario?  The crucial point is the impact of duty free on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  It is a budgetary matter, but given the difference between the price of 400 cigarettes on a flight to Manchester, Glasgow or wherever, at &pound;63 compared to &euro;260 in the shops here, I assume that the Minister is not looking to increase the price of tobacco products.  Is this something he is worried about?    </p></speech>

That happened last week.  On its overall cost, the Deputy is correct that other things could happen that could reduce the cost of this to us overall.  However, when we get into the realm of working out what they might be, it is very difficult for me to put a figure against that as we must make all kinds of assumptions on consumption and where it would occur.</p><p>I have a highly approximate overall gross figure for the potential impact of the introduction of duty free, which is up to &euro;350 million.  That would be included in the no-deal Brexit planning to which I refer.  That is based on the assumption that a certain number of passengers would avail of duty free and would buy a certain amount of cigarettes and alcohol.</p></speech>

They have closed because of the rip-off in insurance premiums and because certain insurance companies have withdrawn from the market.  We know that approximately 16 companies that sell into Ireland will no longer be registered etc. as a consequence of Brexit but there is a particular crisis in a certain sector, namely, bouncy castles, adventure centres and that entertainment sector, which no company in Ireland or Britain will insure.  Jobs are being lost week in and week out.  Unless there is an intervention, whether it is budgetary or the Minister sitting down with the industry, a situation will arise where children will never be able to have a birthday party with a bouncy castle again, as there will be no company providing them in Ireland as they will not be able to get insurance in Ireland or in Britain.  When Leisure Insure withdrew from the market, it caused serious chaos.  We are now waiting for companies' renewals to arise, at which point they will be left high and dry.  The company that underwrites Leisure Insure is AXA XL.  When AXA XL moved its headquarters from Britain to Dublin as a result of Brexit, two Ministers issued a press statement to tell us how good this was.  Surely, Ministers should sit down with AXA XL and Insurance Ireland to address the crisis we face both in the fabric of how our children play and so on and in the thousands of jobs that are at risk as a consequence.  There is now a complete market failure.  I wrote to the Commissioner, who said there was no reason why the State cannot intervene and investigate a market failure in this scenario.  There is a market failure in the insurance industry.  Will any budgetary measures be introduced in the next three weeks that will address this issue?  Alternatively, is it a case of wait and see, where we can sit on our hands and let company after company, some which have operated for 20 or 25 years, to just close their doors one after another?</p></speech>

I well understand the issue raised by the Deputy regarding the leisure sector given the profile that was received before the summer.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that I cannot comment now on any budget day decisions on any sector.  I will observe that any response by myself or the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to that sector overall cannot be characterised as sitting on our hands.  A huge effort is ongoing to deal with rising motor premiums and rising insurance premiums here.  Most of the response back to this rests in policy rather than budgetary policy.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and I are working closely on that.</p></speech>

The Minister is absolutely correct that over the years, politicians have all looked for more spending on everything but on this occasion, it was meant to be different.  We are a budget oversight committee, the first of its kind.  We had a meeting earlier today with the Parliamentary Budget Office, which we have resourced to advise us.  Last week, we had a meeting with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which was established after the crash to specifically avoid what the Minister just mentioned.  There was an accusation that no one from the Opposition was calling on the Minister to spend less.</p><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would say that the Opposition did not know where the goalposts were because they kept moving.  In our budget submission every year, we tried to address what the council was saying because we wanted to learn the lessons of the past.  What the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council says is true, that even when that was done, it did not matter because the Government turned up on budget day with a whole load of additional measures.  That meant it was a different game that everyone was playing and we were not comparing like with like.</p><p> I was unable to get the record that is usefully prepared of what the representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said last Thursday but my recollection, which can perhaps be checked and we can come back to it, is that they were fairly clear in referring to &euro;2.8 billion.  The council said that its assessment was that, even with a hard, crash-out Brexit, we would not go into a recession, although it would cause a dramatic fall in gross domestic product, GDP, or gross national income, GNI, or whatever measure one wants to use.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council did not anticipate an immediate recession that would warrant the sort of borrowing the Minister is talking about.  If I recall rightly, the council representatives said that, if the economy did go into recession, one could then switch to countercyclical borrowing, but they advised against doing that in this budget.  I wanted to check the record because I think that advice even covered specific, additional measures that the Minister might want to prepare for sectors that might need it.  I stand to be corrected when I read the record and it is difficult to check with those witnesses because they are independent, so we will have to check the record.</p><p> My understanding is that the Minister has said today that the Government intends to ignore the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and engage in additional borrowing.  Each party is working on its financial submission and ours was based on an intention to borrow, to be honest.  We had to turn that 360 degrees around last Thursday because we could not ignore that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said that does not look prudent.  We had to scale back our borrowing intentions and we are now looking at a few additional tax measures to cover some of the amounts that need to be spent.  The point I am making, in a long-winded manner, is that it seems to me that the Minister is saying that he will not take the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council subject to a no-deal Brexit.  The council factored that in and said, even in those circumstances, the Minister should not do the amount of borrowing he is talking about.  Is he not going to do that?</p></speech>

The council always says that additional tax measures could be raised which might have some dampening effects.  Let us take the example of a tax on financial transactions.  That would probably not affect the agricultural and rural sectors that might be affected by Brexit, so it could be transferred in that manner.  There are ways to address the sectoral issues that would arise in a no-deal Brexit without necessarily resorting to borrowing.  If we do enter a recession, we should be doing a green, new deal stimulus borrowing package, but I am loath to ignore the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The Minister seems to be doing so.</p></speech>

I thought I had an appreciation of the advice it has given.  We published this in the summer economic statement where we outlined that there could be a move into a deficit of between 0.5% and 1.5 percentage points of national income.  I published that before the summer.  I want to make clear that we will, of course, need to deal with many of the different issues in getting ready for Brexit and the challenges that will bring within the framework of the &euro;2.8 billion and look to expand that, if necessary, through revenue-raising measures.  That is the case.</p></speech>

If we scroll down to the next page, what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representative said was that measures to deal with the cost of a no-deal, hard Brexit should be accommodated as far as possible.  Mr. Seamus Coffey said: "The council has repeatedly criticised the Government&rsquo;s medium-term plans for not being credible."  He goes on to say, as I said, that that accommodation of a no-deal Brexit might mean a tax-raising as well as a spending measure.  That is how I read it.</p></speech>

If I look at what the cost of a hard Brexit might be, of course I will look to accommodate that insofar as I can in the budgetary framework of &euro;2.8 billion.  We will look at how to expand that through the normal revenue-raising measures available.  I am simply making the point that if a no-deal Brexit happens, the level of support needed for that could be significant.  I will look to deal with as much of that as I can through revenue-raising measures that I will put in place.</p></speech>

A novel technique is being used here where the text of previous witnesses is being presented in real time.  I hope this is used fairly in other committee meetings and I am sure it will be but Mr. Coffey also said earlier on that day:</p><blockquote>A large budget deficit could emerge due to falling taxes and rising unemployment-related costs.  This is even before potential customs infrastructure and supports for hard-hit sectors are considered.</blockquote> <p>That is the point I am making.  If a no-deal Brexit occurs and we must deal with the consequences of that in real time, the State may need to look at the options that are open to it, apart from its ability to raise revenue through tax measures.</p></speech>

Why did the Minister go with a range for the deficit?  Is the &euro;2.8 billion based on a 0.5% deficit or worse?  What does the Minister envisage being the package in the event of the outturn being a deficit of 1.5%?  Could he explain that?</p></speech>

I opted for a range because we are dealing with an unpredictable event.  It will be important that, if we are dealing with the consequences of an event like this, we are able to establish a path for recovering our deficit back into a balanced position and an eventual surplus.  We will have to do that nearer the time but there is significant unpredictability in dealing with this kind of an event.  I do not want to be in a position where I am laying out an exact deficit figure here that it turns out we have got wrong through failed attempts to model something that is very unpredictable.</p></speech>

Perhaps he did not have a chance to press the Minister on it further when he said the response would be more on the policy rather than the budgetary side.  As the Deputy outlined, there is a real crisis.  As policies come up for renewal, more and more traders, many of whom are self-employed, are finding that there is no offer of insurance cover because essentially their provider has left the market.  It may not be a big bang because it is not all happening together, but as policies come up for renewal, they will have to close their businesses, something which is happening increasingly.  I have a question for the Minister, even though I know that this matter falls directly within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  It concerns financial services.  Is the Minister aware of interventions or initiatives under way to ensure those involved in the leisure sector, in particular, can continue to access insurance?  It is going to be on fully commercial terms, but at this point many of the people in question are facing a scenario where they will not be able to access insurance, which means automatically that they will have to close their business.</p></speech>

There is going to a big bang.  I am well aware of the effects the issue is having business by business.</p><p> In terms of what kind of work is happening at the moment, the Deputy will be aware of the work that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is doing on the book of quantum.  Recently the Minister of State met underwriters on this issue and he spent much of the summer engaging with insurance providers to see how we can make progress.</p><p> In an earlier debate that we had, I was asked if there was a budgetary policy on this matter.  The question that I would have to be satisfied with is how a levy or additional taxation would address the issues the Deputy referred to, given we already have a number of levies in place in the insurance sector.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty indicated he had a short quick question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019091700002#MMM00900"><p>I have three quick questions.  If the overrun in health stays at its current level - 5.8% was projected and 6.7% is the outturn - there will probably be an overrun of about &euro;158 million.  The impact on this is massive.  It has been budgeted to recruit as many as 1,300 nurses, 100 of whom are in the north west, but the posts are not being filled.  The list of people waiting more than 18 months has increased by 2,000 persons.  As many as 3,600 people in Donegal are waiting more than a year and a half.  It does not make economic sense that we starve the service.  I know that the Minister will reply that this is the biggest health budget ever and all the rest, but I am a year older than I was last year as well.  The reality is that 1,300 nurses were budgeted for, but they are not being accounted for and, therefore, procedures are not being carried out in hospitals.  We need to deal with this matter.  The simple idea that, above anything else, we must stay within budget does not make budgetary sense and is definitely not patient centred.</p> <p>  On the insurance industry, I refer to the point that I made, which is the same point that was made by the Alliance for Insurance Reform, in particular.  When AXA XL relocated here as a result of its Brexit contingency plan, two Ministers issued press statements.  We are asking the Government to meet the insurance industry.  It is not just a case of high premiums, but that people cannot get any price.  In motor insurance, if a person gets three refusals, the industry must give a quote, but the same does not apply to public liability.  We need to consider solutions and there are no easy or quick-fix solutions.  There probably needs to be market intervention at this stage because we cannot allow the entire sector to go.</p> <p>  I do not have the summer economic statement with me, although I did try to bring it up on my phone, but in terms of Brexit, looking at option B, the no-deal Brexit scenario, there is a &euro;2.8 billion package for year one, and then for every other year for the next four years there is a package totalling in the region of &euro;3 billion.</p><p>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but it demonstrates that within five years, in a no-deal scenario with a budgetary package in the region of &euro;3 billion each year, the State's finances will be back in surplus.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Brexit cannot be used as an excuse to stall the type of advances and restructuring that we need in health and dealing with the crisis in housing.  My fear is that the public is being led to believe we will not be able to do anything because of Brexit.  A no-deal scenario is not a pretty picture and nobody wants to be in the scenario where a general government balance is in deficit over the next three to four years.  However, even with quite significant budgetary packages, the economy will continue to grow and tend towards balance.  Will the Minister address my earlier points, particularly the impact of the health budget?  Will he give us a commitment on having serious talks with Insurance Ireland?</p></speech>

It is very different in scale and that is the reason I am saying that even in a no-deal Brexit, commitments with respect to capital expenditure and dealing with the demographics of our society should still be met.  We can do so.  Notwithstanding the debate we had earlier, we have an economy that is able to deal with the challenges of Brexit and to meet the other commitments we have.  It is what I want to do.</p> <p>  In the first seven months of the year, we had an increase of 1,138 whole-time equivalents working in the health service.</p><p>Going back to the debate we had earlier, I am very aware that any decision I make about budget supplements for the Department of Health and elsewhere has a really big effect on services and citizens.  I was very much aware of this when I made the decision last year.  If I had taken other steps to reduce the scale of supplement beyond what it was at that point, I would have faced other charges on the effect.  I made the decision and I am accountable to Members for t.  As I stated to Deputy Lisa Chambers in our earlier exchange, issues, mistakes or things that could have been done differently are my responsibility.  I made the decisions conscious of the consequences at each point in time.</p><p> The Deputy asked about dealing with the insurance sector.  I have participated in engagements and discussions on the sector with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  When the budget is done and in the light of the points made by the Deputy, I will work with the Minister of State to see if further engagement involving me could make a difference.</p></speech>

Our strategy there was consolidation around communities.  Some 152 post offices closed last year and that business transferred to nearby post offices.  Some 60% of the post offices that received the transferring business are seeing double digit growth and that is good because it means that the next tranche of 55 to 60 post offices are more viable and we are working closely with those post offices that might not have seen that business uplift.  That is one aspect of the strategy.  We appreciate that was a painful process for communities around the country but what we have done is to secure those next 160 post offices.  The feedback from both postmasters and the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, is that it has been successful.</p> <p>  The other aspect of the strategy was to focus on developing new products and services and to put them through the network.  A significant shift is going on in the business.  The social welfare business, which is the largest part of our business, and some associated services, such as BillPay, etc., are all in decline at a rate of 5% to 6%.  Those are big numbers.  The growth in our business at the moment is coming from financial services and we are seeing some good growth come from that.  The total post office network this year will see turnover growth of approximately 1%, but within that, there are huge shifts in business that is in decline as we build the new businesses out.  We are working hard to stand still.</p><p>We have seen some great growth in our current account business with the number of accounts going up 20% year on year.  The consumers only have to present themselves in the post office to do their anti-money laundering process.  That is a benefit.  We are getting a new younger consumer as we have re-launched our brand this year and advertised quite heavily on television so we are not just selling to the existing base.  In March of this year, we launched credit cards and consumer lending in conjunction with Avantcard, which is based in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Looking at Central Bank figures published every month for new credit cards issued, we estimate that we are getting between 20% and 25% market share.  That is a big success for us and we are considering doing another burst of television advertising at the end of the year to capitalise on that.  </p><p> Consumer lending got off to a slightly slower start but we recently got a new rate from Avantcard.  We have the best rate in the market for lending under &euro;10,000.  That is where we see our sweet spot, at that lower lending threshold.  We are advertising that rate at the moment.  We have seen our loan business treble over the past two weeks.  Postmasters are getting used to that and having new conversations with consumers.  We feel very happy about that.  We have also done some research.  We are number one in the market for foreign exchange and, as the banks either close branches or do not want to deal with cash, we are filling that gap.  We carried out an analysis recently with GeoDirectory.  There are 510 post offices that do not have a bank within a 5 km radius.  We are really filling the role of a community bank.</p><p> When we were here in July 2018 another group had been in before us and there was a lot of talk about Sparkassen and community banking.  I think in that year, we have shown that we can be a credible force and can provide an alternative to the banks within the community.  We need to build on Government services where we have had very little traction.  I urge people present as they launch their party manifestos today to include this.  We will try to make inroads in that and we are building out our e-commerce proposition.  Much of the noise has been around consolidation but those of us in the GPO focus on the growth and the new products and services.</p></speech>

As we think consumers should be offered choice and convenience, it could be something like motor tax or driving licences.  At present, a person has to take a day off work and go to one place in Dublin for a driving licence, queue for half the afternoon and may or may not get in before 5.30 p.m.  We see that there is an infrastructure for the State to use to drive income for postmasters.  We want to both drive that sustainable income and provide convenience for consumers.</p></speech>

It is the description of what has not happened which is concerning.  Every effort has been made by her and the team in An Post to get a framework in place for Government services.  There was supposed to be a memo to Cabinet and then to a sub-committee.  It has been quite dispiriting.  I still see post offices as having harps above their doors.  We are a Government office.  There are 950 Government offices throughout the country and the Government is not using them.  I can understand that tenders have to be issued for certain services and so on, but where there is a will there is a way.  When committee members, as public representatives, face post office closures they should know we have done everything we committed to in terms of introducing new services.</p> <p>  Ms Byrne talked about introducing financial services.  We could not do that any faster than we are currently, and we are gaining huge shares in some key areas.  Government services have been a real disappointment and, as Ms Byrne said, we would appreciate the support of the Oireachtas in terms of political parties and manifestos stating that these Government offices are worthwhile and are great outlets in terms of providing opportunities to have Government present in every town and village across the country.  </p></speech>

I was slightly concerned when I saw a twinkle in some executive's eye when I asked where it was going to make money on the lending side.  The executive referred, with a smile, to mortgages.  I remember shutting down that bank because it went bust, like so many other banks at the time.  </p> <p>  It is good to hear that An Post is having success in terms of credit cards and deposits.  I know a certain amount about banking, such as that money is not made in banking unless there is lending.  I will be perfectly honest.  I am concerned I have not heard anything about An Post having any commercial lending experience or expertise in the two years since it first indicated this as a strategic direction.  I am encouraged that An Post is talking to Sparkassen because it seems to have a certain capability in that regard.  A warning sign is going off in my head because if a bank is not lending it is not making money.  Maybe An Post is the exception because it is good at dealing with large volumes of low value transactions.  Where is its expertise in lending?</p></speech>

We have built a team of very experienced and talented executives from the banking sector.  We are not a bank, so we leverage third party providers which have the expertise.

An Post is now on a safe financial footing.  That has come with some very considerable pain for the communities that have lost post offices.  We should be mindful that there are people, particularly in rural Ireland, who now have a worse service than they had previously.  They have to travel further to access their service.  While the financial liability of An Post is on a firmer footing, thankfully, there has been a very considerable loss for parts of rural Ireland.  That is especially pertinent as we try to maintain those communities and retain services.</p> <p>  Based on the presentation the witnesses have given, I am shocked to hear that the Government has not engaged in the utilisation of An Post's distribution channel for State services.  It brings into sharp focus the crocodile tears shed by Ministers and supporters of this Government throughout rural Ireland during the very difficult period of post office closures.  The support offered by the Government at the time rings hollow, particularly with the passage of time.  The Government has not engaged with An Post so that more services could be delivered through its offices.  It is clear that An Post has engaged because it has managed to bring financial partners on board and to deliver more services.  It is doing good work around parcels.  If the Government was committed to rural parts and to the services that An Post would deliver, surely these services, which are an integral part of the State's engagement with its citizens, would be available through that office that has the harp over the door.  I am shocked.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses provide the committee, insofar as they can, with a detailed list of the services on which An Post has offered or engaged with the State?  I would like some kind of chart showing where those discussions are at.  It is incumbent on us to haul the relevant Ministers before this committee and expose their lack of commitment, not to An Post but to the people in rural areas who need these services that An Post is prepared to provide.</p> <p>  I do not want to go over ground that has already been covered.  An Post recently launched an initiative around the reduction of carbon emissions and launched a fleet of zero emissions vehicles.  How is that working out?  Will the witnesses update us?  They have covered the issue of dog licences.  That is positive.  It is a new service.  Will the witnesses give us their view on the potential loss of the service of issuing TV licences?  Do they see issues there that must be addressed?</p></speech>

The roll-out of electric vehicles is going very well.  Our target was to reduce our carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, based on figures from 2010.  We have moved that forward to a 50% reduction by 2025.  We will get there early.</p><p>From today, we only have electric vehicles for daily deliveries and collections between the canals in Dublin, apart from a couple of heavy collections, one of which is from Leinster House.  We have to start and stop our vehicles all the time so if An Post can do it, there is an opportunity for the Oireachtas to consider whether there is any reason to have anything other than electric commercial vehicles in the centre of the city.  By the end of next year, our aim is to have only electric vehicles in all the five cities of Ireland, which includes greater Dublin, and we are on track to do that. </p></speech>

These are not just electric vans, of which we have more than 100 to deliver to all houses and businesses between the canals because, in suburban areas, we have electric trikes for deliveries, which are large electric-assisted bicycles.  By the end of this year, we will have over 200 electric vehicles operating in the cities.  We will extend to Cork later this year and to all other cities by the end of next year.  We also have an order for over 750 electric vehicles over the next 12 months so we are being very aggressive, even in comparison with other postal services in Europe against which we benchmark as a leader.  We are very proud of that as it goes to the core of what An Post is about.  It is about being a force for good and is about sustainability for generations to come.</p></speech>

An Post moves a lot of freight from north to south and east to west.  Is it considering using biofuels or hydrogen?  I believe An Post has the capacity to be involved in the pioneering stage of new technologies, by virtue of effectively being a State agency.  The State must show leadership in these areas, even where it does not always make economic sense.</p> <p>  Is An Post looking at changes in heat management within its facilities?  What is the general picture across its range of operations?</p></speech>

The first electric truck is coming on stream and I want it to be made available in Ireland first.  Trucks that run on biomass do not have zero emissions, only lower emissions, while our aspirations are for zero emissions.  We will be the first company in Ireland to operate electric trucks.  Solar panels are being put onto the roofs of all our delivery offices and post offices and we are rolling out a programme in the next 12 months in which we will install electric charging points for customers to use outside post offices.  We have huge plans but we also focus on the small things, such as encouraging people not to print things off that they do not need, and this is happening throughout the organisation.</p></speech>

There are two big infrastructural investments that will help us to do that.  One is investment in the database, so that we know the number of houses there are and who lives in them, and the other is enforcement.  The burden of proof is part of that and it is important that it is not against a household but an individual.  We have a rolling one-year contract that will go to tender, which we welcome because we have not been able to put that investment in.  Three independent studies carried out by the Department estimate that we would need to spend between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;2 million on the database and we could not certainly not commit such investment with a rolling one-year contract.</p><p>It is an important stream of income for postmasters, as it represents about &euro;3 million.  While it is an expensive business for An Post to run, given the 90 inspectors and so on, it is still a source of revenue.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-17a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1240" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019091700002#K00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  I thank them for the overview and their report, which is informative, useful, and sends out a progressive and positive message about where An Post is at.  I have followed the fortunes of An Post for some time, and over the years I have seen Ministers refusing to make decisions for political reasons, kicking to touch, and pushing An Post to the brink of insolvency.  I commend the current management on effectively making decisions that have rescued the company from freefall, stabilised it and put it on a path of growth.  I also welcome the fact that turnover and profitability are increasing.</p> <p>  I notice that there has been a huge change in the management structure of the company, which is a case of out with the old and in with the new.  Older members of An Post made valuable contributions to the company over the years but times and circumstances have changed and it is important to have people in the company with modern skills and talents to address the opportunities that are there.  There also have been many casualties along the way.  We have lost many good people and many of those who gave great service to the company lost their jobs.  We need to be sensitive to that.  There has also been a diminution of services, particularly in the withdrawal of services from local parishes and communities, which has been very difficult for people to understand or accept.</p> <p>  It is important that the company has access to Government services.  We cannot say it is a Government operation while at the same time not giving it the support it needs to devolve these services.  As Deputy Dooley stated, it is important that we understand the issues and are given information about what efforts are being made and where the obstacles are.  I sense there is a level of protectionism coming from existing organisations within the public service, which do not want to devolve services to An Post.  Now that the hard decisions have been made with An Post, it is important that the company is allowed to deliver the services that are needed and required by a younger generation of people.  Those services have changed, as have the demands and expectations of the quality of the service being delivered.  The reality is that consumers will not accept anything other than a proper, full, and modern service.  That is where we are at and that is where we need to be.</p> <p>  I was one of the members who asked for An Post to come before the committee initially, because there was a full-blown controversy going on in my own constituency at the time regarding the Thurles post office.  I am sure plenty of comments will be made about the decision on the Cork mail centre as well.  Change affects everybody, and if dramatic changes are made without prior notice or consultation, people will not understand the logic or rationale behind them, which makes it much more difficult for people to accept the decisions being made.  It is hugely important to communicate, as is clear from the relocation of Thurles post office.  There was no advance notice or pre-consultation on it and as a result, it was the subject of considerable protests and agitation.  It unfortunately became very divisive in our local community.  It left a sour taste, and An Post lost a lot of goodwill as a result of the way it was handled.  The decision to relocate is having, and will have, a significant impact on the business community on Liberty Square.  An Post coexisted with that business community and was part of the fabric of the local town for over 100 years, therefore it was a dramatic change and a big shock for that to happen.</p><p>I have seen the new centre in Thurles and it is impressive.  Much of the public has welcomed the wide range of new services provided through a modern network.  I am happy there continues to be a flagship post office in Thurles.  What will happen to the vacated premises?  It is in a prime location in the town centre and we want to ensure that it will be put back into use, whether for private or public service, at the earliest opportunity.</p><p> Two other issues are important in the context of the service An Post provides in Thurles.  There is a question about the parking available for older people at the shopping centre.  There need to be designated parking spaces for people who are unable to walk up ramps or access higher levels in the carpark.  There is also a need for a bus stop outside the shopping centre.  The bus stops at Liberty Square but it needs to stop closer to the shopping centre in order that people can access the post office.  </p><p> Traditionally, An Post has been strongly associated with the delivery of social welfare entitlements.  What percentage of pensioners visit a post office to collect their pension?  From meeting older people, I detect they often prefer to receive their pension online, which reduces the footfall to post offices throughout the country.  What is the trend in that regard?</p><p> I reiterate that the committee supports An Post in its efforts to promote access to, and to deliver, government services.  It has made fantastic strides in an area where it should have been active years ago, namely, in the processing of parcels, which has proved lucrative.  The public will appreciate and use the post office network if there is access to government services.  It is important that An Post give the committee the information that is needed for us to put pressure on the various Departments to co-operate with it.</p></speech>

We respect his comments on consultation, or the apparent lack thereof, in respect of Thurles.  It is not an excuse; we have to do our job properly.  We have had to work fast on a vast range of issues to ensure we execute them but, on behalf of An Post, I fully accept the comments to the effect that it would be more helpful to communities wherever we are if we engaged in early consultation.</p> <p>  Before Ms Byrne answers the questions specific to Thurles, I turn to social welfare, which is gradually declining as people take more payments through electronic fund transfer.  It is important that An Post is not viewed as what is sometimes called an offline channel.  It is not the case that we just carry out the physical transaction while others do the digital transaction.  We have invested heavily in a digital team.  We have appointed a chief digital officer and developed first-class digital products.  For us at An Post, the key is to use the retail jargon of "omni-channel".  For whatever services, such as the provision of dog licences, the customer will know that they can be obtained from An Post either online or at a post office.  An important aspect in respect of communities is that we are human in our contact.  People can contact a human being for help if desired but they can also benefit from digital services.</p></speech>

I need to check where we are at, but we have engaged with the local council on the issue of the bus stop.</p> <p>  Social welfare is a big part of our business.  Thankfully, unemployment is falling, meaning that the number of jobseekers coming into the post office is also falling.  We are trying to get at the pensioner figure with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We estimate that we are getting fewer than 20% of new pensioners coming into the post office, with the other 80% opting for direct payments into their bank accounts.  It is true to say this is a declining part of the business.  The figure for children&rsquo;s allowance is probably higher.</p></speech>

It is important for An Post to officially and formally contact Tipperary County Council to request the provision of a bus parking spot outside the shopping centre.</p></speech>

I listened carefully to the presentations.  What struck me was the theme about An Post&rsquo;s relationship with the State, the harp above the door and the 900 Government offices.  What conversations, discussions or consultations, if any, did Mr. McRedmond have with Ministers before the decision to shut the Cork mail centre was announced?</p></speech>

We certainly raised the issue of a mail centre closure consistently because it was public owing to a recommendation made by the Labour Court.  Over a period of 18 months we discussed the issue of having to decide on the closure of a mail centre.</p></speech>

They were both clearly unhappy with it, but I was clear that the decision had not been made lightly.  We used external consultants who had been given an extended period to ensure the decision was, to the best of our ability, objective about the future of An Post.  It also took into consideration a broad range of issues, including the re-employment of employees.</p></speech>

When the State is spoken about, one sometimes wonders whether the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.  The Government has a strategy entitled Project Ireland 2040.  Cork will be the fastest growing city in the country in the 2020s and 2030s and there will be a doubling of population by 2040.  Was any account taken of that plan when An Post was making this decision to close the Cork mail centre?</p></speech>

Pretty much every economic consideration was made.  I will ask Mr. Garrett Bridgeman, who leads the business and led the project that worked through that decision, to explain the elements in that decision.  We took into account all known factors.  We worked with Accenture, which is a global consultancy and one of the world experts in postal organisations and logistics infrastructure.</p></speech>

It was not one we took lightly.  We stepped back and said we have four mail centres and looked at the way mail volumes will go and the way parcels will grow.  All of that analysis and data came up with the conclusion that the Cork mail centre was not needed as a letter processing centre.  Our letter volumes have gone down by 50% in ten years but our parcel business is growing.  It grew by over 60% in two years and will quadruple over the next number of years.  All the modelling and analysis showed that 80% of those parcels would originate in the Dublin region, which is a key reason there is no requirement for a processing centre in the Cork area.  However, there is a requirement to have a considerable number of delivery staff in the Cork area and we have more than 650 staff spread across 35 units.  Our focus is on looking at those 35 units and improving the delivery infrastructure in Cork and investing heavily there in terms of making sure those delivery units transfer from being ones that deliver letters to ones that deliver parcels and that we have lockers and all that for the people of Cork.</p></speech>

One factor is that the road infrastructure in Munster tends to be better than the road infrastructure in other parts of the country.  A critical issue for mail is ensuring we can provide next-day deliveries.  If we had closed a centre in the midlands, we would not have been able to guarantee next-day delivery to Donegal so the road infrastructure is one factor.  Another factor that was of significance and one of our four criteria was the possibility of re-employing staff.  This was a very important criterion, which the Deputy can imagine would be important for the unions as well.  The ability to redeploy staff in the Cork area because of the growth and strength of the economy in Cork worked against Cork in terms of keeping the centre in Cork open.  Since then, there have been a high number of applications - probably slightly higher than we expected - for voluntary redundancy.  We have also had a very successful job fair with a range of companies in Cork.  Those two factors were specific to the local economy.</p></speech>

I understand that the position is that a letter posted in County Kerry or County Cork will not go to the Cork mail centre for sorting but will go to Athlone or Portlaoise.</p><p>If that letter was posted to someone across the road or town or 20 miles down the road, it would come back to them.  Will all vehicles bringing letters be electric?</p></speech>

What the Deputy describes is true of anywhere in the country.  I could send a letter to a neighbour, but it would still have go to a processing centre.  It would have to travel to a main processing centre in any part of the country to be redistributed.  That is how the network works.</p></speech>

We will be the first to have electric trucks.  By the end of the year, all deliveries in Cork will be made using electric vehicles.  A substantial number of trucks in the Cork area will be electric.

We are very keen to get electric vehicles on the road and will be the first to do so.  However, it is not an extra vehicle that travels from Athlone or Portlaoise to Cork, rather it is a vehicle that travels from Portlaoise to Cork.  We do not have hundreds of vehicles.  That is how the network works.  Yes, there will be extra vehicle runs, but there will not be a huge number.</p></speech>

In that case, trucks meet at another facility such as that in the north and south of Limerick city.  The network is very detailed and planned in the most efficient way.  We do not have trucks travelling all over the place.  They carry letters and parcels, which is an efficiency that was not achieved some years ago.</p></speech>

If the number is multiplied over a period of weeks, months and years, it will be a significant negative in terms of climate change.

It is a valuable property.  Is it An Post's intention to rent or sell it?  What price might it expect to receive?  Is this issue being actively pursued?  There is a flipside to that question.  I understand the growth of the parcel business has meant that there will be a parcel hub in 2022 or 2023.  The delegates might clarify the position in that regard.  Presumably, it would be an opportunity to rehire postal workers.  If someone in the Cork mail centre was to apply for a job in the new parcel hub, can the representatives of An Post guarantee that they would at least have equivalent wages and conditions, or would they be employed on lower wages and conditions?</p></speech>

Those who are being offered roles are being offered them on the same or higher terms.  The value of the Cork mail centre is not a significant factor in the decision on which mail centre to close as it would be a one-off as a capital asset as opposed to the recurring savings that would be derived each year from not operating a mail centre.</p><p>While the decision on the Cork property is important for Cork, it is a relatively minor decision financially in respect of the case for closing the mail centre.</p></speech>

The ones in the north and south of the city, Ballincollig for example, need to be adapted for the parcels world; we will need to invest in those facilities in order that they can handle parcels.  All of the 240 staff members in the Cork mail centre were offered voluntary redundancy - a significant number have taken that up - and redeployment.  Redeployment can be to any of the other 650 positions we have within County Cork.  As Mr. McRedmond has said, when they transfer they will keep their existing terms and conditions.</p></speech>

We are virtually the last postal operator in Europe that still has bicycles and we need to replace them. This is why we are pushing electric vehicles so hard.  Blanchardstown, being in the greater Dublin area, will have all electric vehicles from the end of 2020.  There is probably just a timing issue on getting those electric vehicles.  It is quite hard to order enough electric vehicles to get them in.  That is all it is.  We have committed from the end of 2020 to have only electric vehicles in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

I met representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union last week as one of my first engagements to get a sense of their concerns about the impact the change to the television licence collection might have on post office services.  Looking at the post office sector in the State, are any criteria used to establish the viability of a post office or is it a demand-led service?</p></speech>

If a post office is located in such a centre, offering the services that are coming through, it ought to be viable.  However, it is not guaranteed because post offices are individual businesses with their own characteristics such as rent payments.  Some post offices pay rent, while others are rent free and some are co-located.  We have a set of criteria that can help those businesses to be viable.  First-----</p></speech>

There must be sufficient demand, not just for it to be viable.  It is not a sense that it is purely market-driven.  We have a requirement to have a post office within 15 km of 95% of the population in an area or 3 km in a town, as I think the Deputy knows.  They are the criteria in place.  Our number one obligation is to provide a service, which is what we do, but because postmasters run individual businesses, it is not the job of An Post to make sure they are viable.  The best we can do is to design it in a way that it can work.</p></speech>

As we were discussing, the social welfare payments service is in gradual decline, as are some of the older services, which is why we are developing financial services.  There is a mixture of related elements.  We are very clear on what our social purpose is.  We are clear that we exist for the common good, but as a commercial semi-State body, we also have an obligation to be viable.</p></speech>

Invariably, when they close, it causes a major problem in the locality, particularly in towns and villages.  Sometimes the heat is on for a few weeks, but then, obviously, it dissipates.  However, people have lost the service and that presents a difficulty, particularly for many older people.  We have discussions about how many post offices we have, how many were closed and so on.  Has there been a mapping exercise to assess how many are needed in the State to provide necessary services?  That should be the starting point.  There should be a proper mapping exercise to assess the service provided and how many post offices are needed to ensure those post offices are viable by providing them with State services at the level that is necessary or whatever other services they need to make them viable.  Has that exercise been carried out by An Post?  What is the number in that regard?</p></speech>

In looking last year at the network's sustainability and viability we carried out a forensic mapping of post offices and the country using the most recent census data.  We used the criterion that every community of over 500 people should have a post office, while maintaining coverage on the islands and in such places.  The offer of a voluntary exit programme was then made to postmasters within the country.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is between 700 and 800.  If the next question is whether we are going to close another 150 post offices, there are no active plans to do so.

The atmosphere today is more calm than it normally is when we are discussing post office closures.  At this point we must provide security of tenure.  Let us bed down the system and say, "Let us move on."  All politics is local.  The post office in the parish of Athleague, in which I live, was closed down, as Deputy Naughten is aware.  More than 500 people live in Athleague.  Certainly, there are more people living in the entire parish.  The electoral register is a very powerful tool.  I could never understand why the post office was closed.  I do not want to ask for details at this stage, but will the delegates come back to me on the issue?  Why was a contract in an alternative location not tendered for?  Has a post box been provided?  One was provided in the Castlecoote area of that parish.  The post office in Castlecoote was closed down and turned into a post box facility, which provides a good service.  The post office in Athleague was a great facility, at which the Connaughton family - Josephine, Martin and Niall, with their staff - provided a tremendous service.  It provided financial services also.  It was a major loss to the area, as I think Deputy Naughten would agree.  Its closure has had a major impact on the village which has a key industry in Kepak.</p> <p>  I commend An Post on the credit card facility.  Will the delegates elaborate on the matter?  I understand a person must have money in his or her account to operate it.  Perhaps I am wrong, but can I volunteer to sign up to avail of the service?  As a former Minister of State at the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I would love to use An Post's credit card.  I encourage others to join because there is great loyalty to An Post and State services.  </p> <p>  There is potential in the use of Internet services.  It is not the most viable service, but there are many schemes under which farmers must apply for grants.</p><p>Many people do not have the skills to do that.  It would be worth looking at carefully to see what An Post can do to help with application with a viable cost for that consultation.  It is a very important service.  It is becoming increasingly computerised.  Many farmers - elderly and younger - do not have the time or the skills to go through that process.  The same applies to booking flights and holidays.  There is potential there.</p><p> There is potential to push the saving bond system further.  One could update the cost of bonds.  I know there was a reduction in the number of prizes.  It is a great gift to give people, encouraging them to save.  I would be in favour of the saving bond system being turned into a housing bond system allowing people to save there, with the funds directed into social and public housing.  It would give people an incentive.</p><p> I suggested to the late Brian Lenihan that we should have a national saving bond.  I think that was implemented and there is a saving bond in An Post.</p></speech>

An Post should exploit the saving book account.  The interest rate is very low as it is everywhere - it is as competitive as any bank.  We should encourage schoolchildren to save - bring them in young and get them involved in An Post with saving accounts.</p> <p>  In the past two weeks I visited the GPO.  It was very busy.  There is a fantastic atmosphere there.  I went in to do some work there; to look at an account there.  I witnessed some staff who were subject to considerable abuse.  I know there are security people there.  People come up to the desk looking for a social welfare payment that may not be in or whatever.  An Post should look at that.  The security present was not as strong it might be.  I thought they were very vulnerable.  I heard verbal abuse of staff which is totally unacceptable.  The 1916 interpretive centre at the GPO is brilliant and I congratulate An Post on that.  It is a very historical building and it is a great honour to work there. </p> <p>  I was always very anxious that An Post would have the television licence fee collection and I hope it succeeds.  It seems a natural bond because RT&Eacute; was created by the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I hope An Post wins that contract as it is in a very strong position to do.  I do not think anyone can do it as well as An Post does and in a humane way.</p> <p>  The transfer of funding has been a bone of contention with Deputy Burton and others.  They kept sending money out to banks, as opposed to the post office saving accounts.  Has there been any change in the policy in this regard?  If somebody wants to get direct payment of a pension or another payment, they should nominate An Post as the centre for the collection of that pension.  Now people go with their books and get their money, which is fine.  However, if people want to transfer it to an account, there should be a facility to have it there.</p> <p>  My colleague made points about the Cork situation.  Was there any agreement that one sorting centre would be closed or that one possibly was surplus to requirements?  The decision was probably based on location.  Of course, it is very disruptive and I accept what my colleague said about the staff there.  It was a very active office and any transfer or other change is a major blow.  Sometimes there can be negotiations involving the unions.</p><p> On a local note, I wish to speak about the service provided by our local postman, Damien Meally.  He comes there well turned out with the green image of An Post.  He delivers his services regularly.  He is a terrific person.  That applies to all the staff.  I worked with them as Minister of State at one time.  I congratulate all the postmen and postwomen who go out delivering every day in all sorts of weather providing tremendous service.  I am glad that their equipment is being upgraded and everything else.  The presentation is very good.  The presentation of the staff is very good.  When it comes to their work, it is obvious that they are An Post.  They are trusted and provide a tremendous service.  The service they provide throughout the country is second to none.</p></speech>

He also spoke about staff facing abuse.  As our team discussed this week in a different context, our number one duty is a duty of care to our employees.  I am very proud to be leading a company of outstanding individuals.  There has been some critical comment, but it is largely good comment about the transformation of An Post, making it viable for the longer term.  We are moving from an old world of letters and social welfare payments into a newer world of e-commerce and financial services.  All of that was delivered by the employees.  All of it was done with the agreement of the employees and with the active participation and quite often the intellectual leadership of the unions, in particular the Communications Workers Union.  I value the opportunity to commend the work our staff have done.  I ask Ms Byrne to answer the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

It is very important that people view the post office as not just being in the offline world.  We have state-of-the-art technology at the counter.  We process a considerable number of social welfare payments every day.  We also do agency banking for AIB and Ulster Bank.  Our state-of-the-art IT infrastructure transfers many payments and messages to various entities, including Eir and other utilities.  That often gets overlooked.  When people think of the post office they often think of it as the old world.  There is a state-of-the-art system at the counter that can be linked into any Government entity.  Before broadband gets rolled out to rural areas, there is a role for postmasters to assist people with Government services or other services.  We have the infrastructure to do that.  We have visited various Departments to correct that image of the post office being of another world and not of the modern world.</p> <p>  We operate saving bonds on behalf of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  We would love to take more money in.  It is not so keen now, given existing rates and all of that.  If that changes and the market changes, it is an area we definitely want to expand.  We manage more than &euro;20 billion on behalf of the State there.  After the crisis, a lot of money flowed into the post office because people regard it as a safer place for their money.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned trust.  There is big trust in the brand.  Independent studies are carried out every year and An Post ranks in the top five most trusted brands in the country.</p><p>It is because of that that we have had success with the launch of An Post Money, credit cards and loans.  People feel it is a viable alternative to banks and we have stimulated the competition based on the trust within the brand.</p><p> The Senator is right about the post office savings book, which is a great way to get kids saving.  It is a little bit old-fashioned and we are looking at developing a new product in that space, which we hope to introduce next year.  We also sponsor handwriting and spelling competitions in schools, together with the Department of Education and Skills, so we have great links into schools and we want to use that connection to promote financial awareness and prudence among kids at a younger age.  That is something we are working on.</p><p> I take the Senator's point on the GPO.  We had a post office on Parnell Square which the postmaster refused to operate any more because of inner-city issues.  Many of those clients transferred to the GPO, so it can be a bit rowdy on certain days.  I take that point.</p></speech>

The new IRFU stamp An Post brought out is brilliant, and is one of the largest stamps ever printed.  I launched a few stamps featuring Joyce, de Valera and others.  I was once in An Post's philately section and it is a great area with much potential, as it is allows for the recognition of people who have served, current issues, and so on.  I compliment that section.  I do not know who is responsible for it but it might be one of the witnesses.</p></speech>

The current account is one of the only products we operate ourselves under our own licence.  I mentioned earlier that the loans, credit cards and State savings are operated with third parties, however, the current account is a product we operate under our own licence.  When we launched the current account, which has had good growth on year on year, we engaged with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with a view to seeing whether there was an opportunity there to give people the choice of using it if they did not want to come in and get cash.  There is definitely a requirement within the State in terms of the unbanked and how people might be missing out.  For example, utility companies give preferential pricing if one pays online, and so on.  There is a role there for a subsidised bank account, for want of a better word, which could also be used for TV licences and other services.  As we give out nearly half a million free TV licences every year and various other allowances are given for fuel etc., there is an opportunity for the subsidisation of some of the fees on the current account.  As part of our role, as Mr. McRedmond said, we would welcome working with the relevant Department to bring that unbanked sector of the population into the fold in order that they are not relying on loan sharks and so on.</p></speech>

The big benefit is that if someone with a balance of, say, &euro;2,000 on his or her credit card opens up a credit card account with An Post and that balance is transferred to An Post, he or she will get that &euro;2,000 interest-free for 12 months.  That is the big hook but if one did not have a balance he or she could equally just open an account.</p></speech>

We spent long days and very long nights looking at many issues in relation to An Post and at one stage, we were looking at substantial compulsory closures across the post office network.  Particular credit is due to the staff, management teams, and postmasters right across the An Post network for the work they did in turning the company around.  The company has transformed.  It now offers credit cards and personal loans through Avantcard in Carrick-on-Shannon, sustaining local jobs in a provincial town which, previously, would not have had a strong reputation for financial services until MBNA moved in there.  An Post is consolidating and growing jobs in that particular town and I look forward to the development of the SME offering, which will be a huge boost to many local businesses.</p><p>My first question is for Mr. Bridgeman.  Will he outline for the committee the potential impact of a hard Brexit on the parcel business, as An Post sees it?  This is of huge concern to staff in mail centres and district mail offices across the country.  Will he outline how An Post is preparing for it?<br/><br/>As the delegates know, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is running a campaign about changes to consumer rights if people can no longer purchase goods and services from the United Kingdom.  Do the delegates agree that this is a huge opportunity for Irish businesses?  Irish consumers are spending approximately &euro;30,000 online every minute, of which &euro;20,000, sadly, is being spent on goods and services outside the jurisdiction.  An Post has been engaging with local businesses through the eLocal initiative, but I do not know whether it has been a success or if there are plans to expand it or work with the Department of Communications, Climate and Environment to ensure local businesses can take advantage of the trading online voucher.  When it comes to Brexit, the only opportunities on which we can capitalise are in e-commerce, particularly in provincial towns in rural Ireland, as we can bring more business through the post office and mail networks across the country.  That is one opportunity on which we should be capitalising.<br/><br/>I am personally very disappointed by the comments Mr. McRedmond made at the start of the committee meeting.  The reason I am contributing is that he has said the engagement he has had on Government services has been dispiriting.  I am disappointed to hear that because, as he knows, a decision was taken by the Government, with the full support of colleagues at the Cabinet, that the post office network would become the offline avenue of choice for Government services.  I am surprised that decision taken by the Cabinet does not seem to have filtered down.  It is not just about motor tax, passport and driving licence applications.  One issue that has come to the fore recently is that of the public services card.  The post office network and postmasters could provide the identification and verification services that are so important in dealing with online services, not only with the Government but with many other bodies also.<br/><br/>We also need to remember that one in seven people in this country has never used the Internet.  I commend the Government for moving more services online, but for the one in seven people who cannot access those online services, having an offline avenue such as the post office network is vitally important.  It cannot be delivered through Government offices across the country, as suggested by some senior civil servants, because we are excluding the people mentioned from the efficiencies the online services can provide, while the post office network can provide efficient access to them.  It is not only about Government services.  Sites such as<i>switcher.ie</i>and <i>bonkers.ie</i>that allow people to save up to &euro;300 on their electricity bills can only be accessed online.  Has there been any success in working with private sector companies such as Switcher or Bonkers to see if they would work with An Post for a transaction fee?  That would provide huge opportunities for people to save on their gas and electricity bills.<br/><br/>The committee is not happy that there has not been the level of engagement we, as Members of the Oireachtas, expected on foot of the restructuring of An Post.  There is an onus on all of us to send that message to every Department.  It is vital to the survival of the post office network that new Government business comes through the door.</p><p>We have spoken about it for long enough.  The decision has now been taken by the Government to do that, yet, from what Mr. McRedmond said today, I understand that is not filtering down through Departments and agencies.  That is just not good enough.</p></speech>

I recall on many occasions having to sort out some of the issues in An Post and was grateful for his support as the then Minister.</p> <p>  On Government services, we worked assiduously with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Efforts were made and there were memos to Cabinet.  Unfortunately, nothing has come out of that and we are now in a position whereby we have to switch our efforts because we have a lot of work to do.  Our focus now is principally on developing financial and e-commerce services within the post office network.  We have not entirely given up on Government services, but we need a serious response from the various Departments.</p> <p>  I do not think they should be doing that to save the post office network.  We see it as being very frustrating because we want to provide a brilliant service for citizens, both offline and online.  We think we can provide the omni-channel environment, to which we referred earlier and which the Deputy implied in his questions on some of the different private sector companies.  I will let Ms Byrne respond to that.</p> <p>  An Post can play a role in the public services card.  We have excellent technology.  Not only that, we have identified technology for the future, in particular around identity and verification.  As the committee knows, that is not just for the public services card but can also be used for bank accounts and a range of other services.  I will let Ms Byrne address that before Mr. Bridgeman answers questions on a hard Brexit.</p></speech>

I had to take a half-day from work to get my card and go to an office, which was very inconvenient.  It is important to point out that we are there to offer a better service on behalf of the Government to consumers as well as trying to keep the network viable.  The identity verification space is an ideal space because postmasters are used to doing verification for social welfare customers and the anti-money laundering verifications that are required for bank accounts.  They are well placed to provide that infrastructure for the State.</p> <p>  Someone who recently moved back from Germany to a good job here told me they had to go around ten million houses to try to get a PPS number to open a bank account and all of the rest of it.  If one place was the doorway for verification to get a PPS number and so on to open a bank account, it would be very beneficial.  Postmasters have the expertise and there is also the infrastructure and technology in place through our system to do that.  We need to provide new Government services, and not just motor tax and driving licences.</p> <p>  I will need address the opportunities in terms of Bonkers and Switcher separately.  I cannot say that we have engaged with them.  We can address the matter separately and see whether there is an opportunity.</p></speech>

We have engaged in extensive planning.  We are lucky because our three remaining mail centres are all bonded warehouses with customs staff on site.  We have worked very closely with customs staff on planning and have put extra offices into our mail centre in Athlone to accommodate additional customs staff.</p> <p>  We have also worked very closely with Royal Mail in the UK on ensuring that any products which are bought in the UK receive green lanes when they get to Dublin Port so they are brought straight to our plants.  We have also worked with many UK companies such as Amazon to ensure there is minimum disruption to our staff.</p><p>The Deputy is correct about our online journey.  Earlier in the growth in online shopping, many Irish people bought from shops in the UK and Irish retailers had not caught up.  The massive growth we are now seeing is from online Irish retailers, particular on the SME side.  The barriers to entry for someone opening an online store are reducing.  We are finding that a significant growth area for us is smaller businesses that do not have to be in Dublin or a city.  People in west Cork or Galway can open a business.  We are working with companies such as Portwest, Elverys and Smyths to help them to sell their product and bring it to every home in Ireland as well as every address across the world, because we can sell companies' products anywhere in the world given that we have connections.  We have noticed a significant increase in local business and the growth levels will continue.</p></speech>

It is well deserved.</p> <p>  I met Mr. McRedmond earlier and we had a quick chat.  As someone who worked in the post office system for many years in a former life, I note the major contribution the post office service makes to the public.  The witnesses know that, but they also have to make it a viable business.  It is not a charity and its purpose is not ensuring that old people have someone to talk to on a Friday and so on.</p> <p>  As the witnesses know as well as I do, the post office network is a nationwide service and its counters are open six and half days a week.  All counters are now automated.  There is significant potential for new business.  What active role do the witnesses play in looking for new business and enticing it to be part of the post office network?  </p> <p>  Do they have an approximate cost for their Brexit preparations?  The spokesperson for a competitor bandied about a figure of &euro;3 million on radio yesterday.  He is getting ready for a hard Brexit.  As we all know, whether Brexit is hard or soft or does not happen, the genie is now out of the bottle.  We need to be ready for whatever happens.</p></speech>

In the event of a hard Brexit, parcel volumes could quadruple or fall by 70% or 80%.  A major factor will be what will happen to sterling because of the conversion rate.  There are so many different factors that we can only plan within a certain acceptable range, and that is what we do.</p> <p>  The actual cost for us at this stage does not involve a major investment because we have invested in our network.  We have made a significant investment in parcel automation, which we would have done anyway.  The centre in west Dublin will open in October and we visited it today.  When the centre opens, we will be able to handle much greater volumes if they increase.  There are scenarios where volumes would increase.  If they decreased, that would be a cost in terms of revenue to the system, but none of us know what that will be.  The issue for us is much more about the predictability of revenue.  That is where the cost or benefit will be, rather than the physical cost, because we have invested in the network.</p></speech>

Our current focus is driving growth in new products and services.  That comes under three pillars.  We have had major success in financial services over the past year.  We have launched credit cards and loans.  Our current account figures are up 20% year on year and One Direct, our insurance business based in Athlone as part of the retail division, is experiencing good growth year on year for car, motor and travel insurance.  That is all going to plan and we are currently signing two or three new contracts, which are going through a legal process, for new financial services products that will be launched in the spring, SME lending being one of the products.</p><p> The second pillar we have spoken about is Government services and we need to keep going on that.  We have engaged extensively and we have given a commitment to the committee that we will come back and outline everything we have done over the past year.  We did that in conjunction with various partners and we will outline that.  It has been extensive.</p><p> The third pillar is e-commerce.  Part of the strategy for the network is to co-locate it, which means post offices will have extended opening hours.  That is part of the deal we did with the postmasters last year.  It was ridiculous that post offices were closed at lunchtime in key urban areas.  That may have been less important in deep rural areas.  Our move towards co-location means that post offices if they are co-located with a convenience grocery retailer will have extended opening hours, which makes it easier for consumers in commuter towns who are not at home to pick up a parcel.  In certain categories, such as fashion, for example, 40% of what is purchased is returned.  We want people to be able to bring that return to their post office and they can do that five days a week and on a Saturday morning.  The opening hours have been extended to match those of the shop.  That e-commerce enablement is important and we want to be that out-of-home provider.  That helps small businesses as well.  We work with some postmasters to drive and service what we call the eBay, low-end SME market sellers who bring in their parcels.  We have a new scheme called Advantage card, which gives them a discount for shipping their parcels.  There is a big focus on SMEs and consumers.</p></speech>

It was very clear that the union requirement was that we follow a full process considering all the criteria, and its number one criterion was the welfare of staff, which slightly worked against Cork ironically because the Cork economy has been doing so well that the opportunities for staff who would be made redundant were much greater there than in the midlands.</p></speech>

It was clear that its concern was for its members.  It is my interpretation how that concern is best dealt with.  When I responded to Senator Leyden about the welfare of employees being our number one duty of care, that is also a duty in hard circumstances where people are going to lose their jobs.  It would have been one of the criteria, not the sole criterion, because we have commercial obligations and a service obligation.  Broadly speaking, they are the three criteria.</p></speech>

That was not the decision An Post arrived at.  There was a lot of anger, frustration, concern and worry among the staff there. While it has been dismissed as irrelevant, there was a lot of discussion among employees about the McKinsey report that was, I believe, commissioned.  It was the understanding of staff that it did not recommend the closure of the Cork mail centre.  Did it recommend the closure of the mail centre, and if not, what did it recommend?</p></speech>

They would just say those would be options.  That would be done without any analysis of the network.  One consideration in the decision on Cork was staff welfare, which is the redeployment capacity in an area, which was greater in the Cork area.  The second was the operational feasibility or customer service, for example, whether we could guarantee next-day delivery.  We could not do that if we decided to close Athlone because we could not guarantee next-day delivery to parts of Donegal.  The third consideration was on the financial criteria, which were strongest in respect of Cork.  The decision was made on those three grounds.</p></speech>

I disagree with the decision and know that many of the staff also disagree as the centre was high-performing.  The staff were extremely productive, perhaps more productive than in any of the other centres.  It was felt adequate regard was had to that fact.  The concern is that the volume of traffic of letters and parcels that has to be brought to Little Island is transported by lorry, that none of the sorting offices has the capacity to properly manage it and that additional capacity will need to be bought.  There is a concern that a small mail centre will have to be leased by An Post.</p></speech>

Mr. Bridgeman will answer the question about our plans in Cork and what we may do there.  </p> <p>  There are no plans to employ agency staff or to employ staff on lower wages.  I absolutely understand that when employees are under pressure from redundancies, inevitably there are such rumours, but I can state categorically that we have no such plans.  Our intention is to provide a first-class service and be a first-class employer.  Even in difficult circumstances, where we have to make staff redundant, offering decent work is one of our values.  It is a core value which I, personally, hold very high, as does An Post.</p></speech>

The easiest thing in the world for An Post to do would be to pay staff per parcel delivered or to go down that route, but respecting staff and offering them decent work are so central to and at the core of our values.  The reality is that within Cork we have 35 delivery units.  The units in the city include those in the north city, south city and Ballincollig.  As they will not be fit for purpose in the next three to four years, we need to invest and put in place a parcel delivery depot that will accommodate the staff and improve facilities for them in order that they can handle larger parcels.  These are jobs for existing staff.  We are upgrading facilities in Cork city.</p></speech>

Therefore, we need to ensure we will have enough space there to accommodate the delivery of parcels.  It is all about parcel delivery.  What took place in Little Island was parcel sortation.  It will all be done in one centre in Dublin, which is the most economical way to do it.</p></speech>

A place in Midleton was leased for a period at Christmas time because there was inadequate capacity available.  The delegation has stated there will be a need for additional capacity, but there was capacity available at a location.  I find it hard to understand the rationale behind renovating the centre in Ballincollig, north Lee, south Lee and the south city or whatever it is called when there was a place available in Little Iisland that was owned by An Post, in which parcels were sorted.  I do not understand why the work could not have been reoriented towards distribution.</p></speech>
