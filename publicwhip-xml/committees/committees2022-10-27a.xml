I hope we will have seating accommodation for everybody.  I begin by welcoming everyone to this morning's meeting.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Imelda Munster.</p><p>If attending from within the committee room, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p><p>Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied this morning by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit, at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to examine the following matters: Appropriation Accounts 2021: Vote 40 - children, equality, disability, integration and youth.  The Department has been advised that the committee has expressed a particular interest in direct provision, emergency accommodation, and related matters.</p><p>Also for examination from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services is chapter 13 - guardian <i>ad litem</i>follow-up report.</p><p>We are joined by the following officials from the Department: Mr. Kevin McCarthy, Secretary General; Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks assistant secretary; Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary; Ms Lara Hynes, assistant secretary; and Ms Sheenagh Rooney, assistant secretary.  We are joined by the following representatives from Tusla in relation to the guardian <i>ad litem </i>report: Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive officer and Ms Kate Duggan, deputy CEO, national director of services and integration.  The following representatives from the relevant Vote section in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are joining us remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House: Ms Jessica Lawless, principal officer, and Mr. Fionn Jenkinson, assistant principal officer.  The witnesses are all very welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p><p>Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards the reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Witnesses within the precincts of Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-27a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102700002#A00700"><p>The 2021 appropriation account for Vote 40 records gross expenditure of &euro;1.8 billion.  This was distributed across five output programmes that provide a broad range of services to meet the needs of children and of vulnerable persons in society.</p> <p>  Programme A provides for children and family support.  This is the largest area of spending under the Vote, at approximately &euro;888 million, or 49% of the total.  The grant to Tusla, amounting to &euro;857 million in 2021, represents the bulk of the spending on the programme.</p> <p>  Programme B comprises funding for a wide range of schemes and programmes to benefit children and young people, at a combined cost of &euro;680 million in 2021.  This area of spending has increased rapidly in recent years, and it was significantly affected by Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years.  Most of the schemes funded under the programme are administered by Pobal, acting as an agent on behalf of the Department.</p> <p>  Expenditure of just over &euro;200 million in 2021 was charged to programme E, which funds the provision of support for international protection seekers.</p><p>Most of the expenditure was in respect of accommodation for persons seeking international protection, accounting for &euro;191 million in 2021.  Members will be aware of the very significant additional pressures in that regard that have fallen on the Department in 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br/><br/>The remaining two Vote programmes are on a smaller scale.  One supports a range of equality initiatives, the other caters for policy development and legislation within the Department&rsquo;s remit.  Due mainly to savings that occurred across the Vote, the surplus at the end of 2021 was &euro;98.5 million.  The Department was allowed to carry &euro;3.2 million over to 2022, to fund capital works, but surrendered &euro;95 million at the year end.<br/><br/>A clear audit opinion was issued in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the disclosure by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control regarding non-compliance with procurement rules.  This was mainly in relation to contracts put in place for the provision of accommodation to international protection seekers.<br/><br/>Members may also wish to note that, while the Department has been developing its ICT infrastructure, it still relied in early 2021 on the provision of financial management system services by the Department of Health.  This support service was interrupted as a result of the ransomware attack on health sector bodies that occurred in May 2021.  Work-around processes were adopted for a period, and completion of a planned migration of the Department&rsquo;s financial management service away from the Department of Health&rsquo;s systems was accelerated.  Normal financial management functions were resumed by the end of June 2021.<br/><br/>I turn now to the chapter which is on the agenda for today.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>is an independent person appointed by a court to ensure the best interests and views of a child or children are heard in public family law proceedings.  While the service is provided at the direction of the courts, the costs of the service are discharged by Tusla, even though the organisation is a party to the family law proceedings.  The cost of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service averages at &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million a year.  Costs vary widely at the individual case level.  I previously examined the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, and published a report on my findings in September 2016.  That report contained three recommendations which, at the time, were agreed to by the Department and by Tusla.  Our examination this year found that the recommendations had not been implemented, for a variety of reasons.  However, a revised legislative<i></i>basis<i></i>for the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service was finalised in July of this year, with the enactment of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022.  This potentially removes the main obstacles that prevented progress being made in developing effective management oversight and control mechanisms for the service.  </p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary; Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, assistant secretary; Ms Sheenagh Rooney, assistant secretary; and Ms Lara Hynes, acting assistant secretary.  We are also supported by Mr. Gordon Gaffney, finance officer; Mr. Andrew Patterson, principal officer; Ms Marie-Louise Molloy, professional accountant; Ms Erin Ryle, administrative officer; and David Byrne, principal officer.  <br/><br/>In my opening statement I will give a very brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing supplied in advance of the meeting is of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.  As we all know, the year 2021 brought ongoing challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic which continued to impact on how we delivered services and required ongoing adaptation and innovation in order to support our objectives to enhance the lives of children and young people, adults, families and communities; to recognise diversity; and to promote equality of opportunity in Ireland.  <br/><br/>During the year there were some minor changes to the responsibilities under the remit of the Department.  There was a transfer out of functions related to education welfare services from the Department to the Department of Education and responsibility for the Balance for Better Business initiative transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Both transfers took effect from January 2021.  The total provision for the Vote in 2021 was &euro;1.923 billion which included capital carryover of &euro;4.1 million.  <br/><br/>In terms of the Vote, three spending areas represent almost 90% of the overall Vote spending in 2022, namely Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, early learning and childcare, and international protection seekers' accommodation.  The current expenditure allocation was &euro;1.887 billion, with a further &euro;36.1 million allocated for capital expenditure, including capital carryover.  The net allocation for the Vote was &euro;1.884 billion when appropriations-in-aid of &euro;39.1 million are taken into account.  The final outturn for the Vote in 2021 was &euro;1.785 billion, with a surplus of &euro;98.5 million of which &euro;3.2 million is to be deferred as capital carryover to 2022 leaving a total to be surrendered at year end of &euro;95.3 million.  <br/><br/>During 2021, Covid-19 continued to impact on spending across all areas of the Vote.  In Quarter 1 of 2021, the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme, ECCE, was suspended and access to other early learning and childcare services were restricted to children of essential workers and children experiencing disadvantage.  Moreover, for the remainder of 2021, there was a reduced demand for early learning and childcare owing to changes in parental working arrangements and other Covid-19-related issues.  This led to savings across all early learning and childcare funding programmes, namely ECCE, access and inclusion model, AIM, and the national childcare scheme, and resulted in an underspend of &euro;46.7m, or 7% of the allocation of &euro;640.2 million for early learning and childcare. <br/><br/>The impact of Covid-19 also contributed to an underspend of &euro;27.2 million, or 12% of the 2021 provision of &euro;218 million for international protection seekers' accommodation and related services costs.  It should be noted that restrictions on international travel resulted in lower than anticipated arrivals and demand for international accommodation.  Towards the end of 2021 as we emerged from Covid-19 restrictions, expenditure across the Vote, particularly in areas such as early learning and childcare and international protection accommodation, started to rebound and this has continued apace into 2022.  All other areas on the Vote also started to return to normal patterns of spending.  <br/><br/>When I addressed the committee in June, I referenced the significant impact the outbreak of the war in Ukraine was having on the work of the Department.  The demands of this situation have not abated in the meantime.  The Department&rsquo;s role in the humanitarian response to the needs of Ukrainians arriving here under the temporary protection directive continues to pose major challenges and has involved a significant diversion and allocation of staffing resources.  The parallel and significant increase in numbers of applicants for international protection in 2022 has also placed extreme pressure on resources.  The overall requirements of this response, including the use of various forms of emergency accommodation, has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on costs in 2022 and beyond as the Department continues to deal with the twin challenges of providing accommodation for Ukrainians and other international protection applicants.  <br/><br/>I refer also to Chapter 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021.  This chapter is a follow-up report on guardian <i>ad litem </i>or GAL reform.  As the committee is aware, GALs are appointed in child care proceedings to ascertain the views of the child and communicate these to the court.  The GAL also makes recommendations to the court as to what is in the best interests of the child.  The Department has acknowledged that the present arrangements for GAL services are in need of significant reform.  Work has been ongoing for several years to provide the legislative underpinning necessary for this reform.  The committee will be aware that the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022, which provides for the reform of the GAL system, and will enable the<br/><br/>Minister to establish a new national GAL service, was signed into law on 19 July.  The Department intends to publish a request for tender in the coming weeks for the development of an operating model and practice manuals for the new GAL service and legal services unit.  This will build on significant work already undertaken, including costings prepared for different models of the service, the development of an IT system to be used by GALs for case management, and extensive discussions with relevant stakeholders.  The Department also has sanction for a director post for the new office, and intends to recruit a<br/><br/>director for the service next year.  It is expected that the body of work to establish the executive office and the new national service will continue throughout 2023 and into 2024.  The purpose of this reform is to regulate and expand the provision of GAL services in a consistent manner across the country.  The reformed service will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.</p><p>The reformed service will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.  I am satisfied that it can also address the concerns raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the costs of the service and the lack of transparency and oversight that exists under the current unregulated system.</p><p> Finally, in reviewing the 2021 accounts, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the Department, and our partner agencies and providers, for the enormous contributions they have made in sustaining delivery on so many our objectives during 2021 and since in the face of successive unprecedented challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  I thank the committee members and Chairman for their attention and look forward to taking their questions.</p></speech>

There is not currently a statutory underpinning for it.  It is very much on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis.  That legislation was prepared and published in January 2017 and made its passage through the Houses.  There were issues around the original set of proposals.

The intention is to establish an executive office.  As I said, the legislation was published in January 2017 and made its way through Committee Stage in the Houses when the general election was called in mid-2020.  We brought back revised proposals following the election and the appointment of the new Minister, which took account of some of the issues that had been raised through the Committee Stage discussions and by stakeholders in the preparation of the original legislation.  That legislation has been enacted from July so that paves the way for us now, as I said in my opening statement, to appoint a director and put the arrangements in place.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will recall, as a result of Covid-19 closures in 2021 from the earlier part of the year, services were closed due to public health restrictions other than to essential workers.  That, therefore, resulted in significant savings on the early years front in particular.  In the case of international protection, the overall arrivals numbers were significantly down in 2021 on the normal projected arrivals level, again, because of international travel restrictions in that case.</p></speech>

It is just an extension of what we see in the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2015 report.  In 2015, a report was published on non-compliant procurement.  Although it was less, there was &euro;57 million in non-compliant procurement over a ten-year period.  In 2021, non-compliant procurement totalled &euro;91 million.  Do we learn anything?  Is it ever taken on board when a report of that nature is issued?  A procurement process is a legal requirement.  There is &euro;91 million worth of illegal contracts in place, involving 54 different entities that have not had to follow the procurement process.  Do any legal issues arise from this?  Is the Department at risk of being sued for not following procurement rules?</p></speech>

To put those 54 contracts into context, 52 of them are in the international protection area, which was the subject of significant non-compliant procurement in 2020, as well as 2021.  The context was that we were facing significant challenges in meeting the needs of international protection.  In the Covid environment, for example, there was a requirement for the "thinning out", as it was referred to, of facilities.  In other words, people had to be moved on from existing international protection facilities in a context where public health requirements were introduced, including social distancing and so on.  The contracts at that time-----</p></speech>

Just to finish what I was saying about procurement, on foot of the RFT there is a limited amount of additional accommodation coming on stream.  We continue to procure outside of that process to meet the demands of international protection.  The demands on the international protection front, as the Deputy is aware, have grown very significantly over the course of this year.  We have seen over 11,000 arrivals so far this year, as against the normal projected arrivals rate of 3,500 per year.  There is absolutely an issue with the number of people with status within the system, who continue to remain in accommodation provided as part of the international protection process.

I will continue Deputy Verona Murphy's line of questioning on the capacity of the international protection system and the current capacity of the current temporary Ukrainian protection system.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy can differentiate between both systems in terms of how we are approaching it, and can indicate what the current capacity is within the system.</p></speech>

I referenced the figures on the number of arrivals on international protection.  We have seen over 11,000 so far this year, and we have of the order of 16,000 in our international protection accommodation at this point in time.  In addition, we have 43,000 or thereabouts on the Ukraine side in accommodation provided by the State.  Overall, we are currently accommodating well over 50,000 people on both fronts.  It continues to be a significant challenge, particularly given that we are currently looking at a seven-day rolling average of close to 200 Ukrainian arrivals - 194 or something of that order - and a daily arrivals average of something of the order of 50 to 60 on the international protection side.  It is a daily challenge to add capacity.</p></speech>

With regard to the scale of the task of screening, Mr. McCarthy previously mentioned that there were 3,500 international protection applicants yearly.  That has increased to 11,000.  The concern among communities is that we are not doing checks at the same level.  What are we doing to alleviate concerns among communities given the number of migrants entering our country without adequate screening or safeguarding?  Have the Department and Tusla put measures in place to respond to the concerns about child protection, trafficking, safeguarding and de-risking &ndash; the issues that nearly every community across Ireland will face?</p></speech>

There are good protections in place for those arriving in that if somebody arrives unaccompanied &ndash; as a minor, for example &ndash; Tusla immediately flags it and identifies the needs.</p></speech>

IPAS centres would all have child safeguarding policies in place, and relevant staff would be vetted.  When we come to rely on emergency settings, it is more challenging.  There is no question about that.  I refer in particular to hospitality settings.  It is important to emphasise, however, that children arriving will be arriving in the care of their parents and will remain in their care.  Where children are unaccompanied, a very strict process and protocol kick in immediately on arrival to ensure their needs are met.  Mr. Gloster might want to say something more about that.</p></speech>

At an earlier stage of this challenge, we would have had some spare capacity in recognised international protection centres, for example.  We have contracted with hotels that have subsequently come through a request-for-tenders process for international protection accommodation.  Given the pressures on international protection accommodation in these circumstances, we have had to pivot to international protection where international protection applicants can be accommodated.  We are much more limited in terms of the range of offerings available to us on the international protection front.</p></speech>

There is some concern.  I am referring to the Department&rsquo;s engagement with local authorities and local communities to ensure their concerns are taken on board.

We obviously try to avoid situations in which we have no accommodation to offer to somebody.  We found ourselves in that situation within the last week, as members will be aware.  The challenge for us throughout all this has been to try to meet the needs of people on arrival, which means on the day they arrive.  We have a holding facility in Citywest that has allowed us to buy a little time at times, but that is operating at full capacity at this point.  It does create issues whereby we have to move much more quickly, and we have to short-circuit some of the consultation we would like to have in normal circumstances.  In a normal environment, there would be a very well-planned engagement and communications process when significant moves are planned and being made.  However, in the circumstances, it has not always been possible.</p></speech>

When Members of the Houses speak of the areas Mr. McCarthy deals with, they often begin by saying they know the Department is dealing with a huge range of issues.  We should acknowledge this in the first instance.  Leaving aside the issues concerning birth, information and tracing, the redress scheme, IPAS, Ukraine and the core funding model for childcare, I would say that the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, alone would keep all the officials busy.  There is a huge amount of work being done by the Department.  I will come back to staffing in a moment.</p> <p>  There is a significant concentration on those people who find themselves without accommodation.  Last weekend, the number was 47, I believe.  However, we should not forget Ireland&rsquo;s response.  We have had 55,000 Ukrainian refugees, involving 11,500 school places.  Some 43,000 people have been accommodated by the State and 43,000 medical cards have been issued.  Ten thousand have found employment.  While 47 is a very significant number, we have to put it in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s huge response.  Communities across Ireland have been very willing to respond.</p><p>Some local authorities are taking a very considerable burden and that may be because of traditional accommodations and so on.  I want to touch on a few areas within that.  For the two years that are referenced here, the staffing between the Department and agencies was approximately 5,000.  Will staffing be at a similar level between agencies and the Department for 2022?</p></speech>

Obviously, there are plans to grow that further.  As part of the Ukraine response, we have 135 people in our Ukraine division at the moment, which is a combination of people who have been reassigned internally into that division, people who are with us on loan from other Departments on secondment and so on, and others who were commissioned into the division.</p></speech>

It needs to find a physical location and make a contractual financial arrangement.  Another part of that is working with communities.  As the Department has been forced to act so quickly, given the numbers, it is the one area where I know departmental officials feel they would like to do more.  We need to have more staff available within the Department to work with communities to talk to them about concerns they may have, to address those concerns and to meet community leaders in advance of centres being opened.  The absence of that creates the very thing that many people in this House do not what to see, which is communities rejecting people coming to such accommodation.  Does the Department have plans to increase that capacity?</p></speech>

We absolutely acknowledge and recognise the point, which is very well made.  Particularly when talking about more medium-term developments in communities, the modular or off-site housing developments are a good example of that.  We have put additional resources into our communications team to support us in that.  We have some dedicated resources and a dedicated plan on how we engage with communities as part of that element of the programme in particular on which we are partnering with the Office of Public Works, OPW.

Many people in this House accused Government Deputies of sealing the records of mother and baby homes.  However, this year thousands of people will be applying for birth information.

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I think it is fair to say that Mr. McCarthy, Ms Baxter and their team at this moment in time have almost the toughest job in Ireland.  I would like to frame my questions with that conditioning on it because they are in a perfect storm at the moment.  I will get back to that because I believe in a way, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been isolated a bit from a national and Government perspective.</p> <p>  To help us in dealing with the issue of those for whom we quite rightly are providing protection at the moment through whichever strand - I note the distinction between both strands, it would be good if Mr. McCarthy could provide us with the Department's Min-MAC minutes from the date of the invasion of Ukraine and with a chronology of all Cabinet subcommittee meetings and attendees, any meetings of senior officials or other ancillary meetings in order that we can understand the volume of work, who is helping and who is not.  That is my first question.</p><p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is the lead Department on this, and it has a significant percentage of the overall role.  It is a little strange because there are so many other strands to it.  I accept that some Department has to be the lead Department, but there are significant roles for the Departments of Social Protection, Education, Health, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I could go on.  Does Mr. McCarthy feel that everybody, across all those Departments and other bodies, is working at the same pace as his Department?</p><p> I know this is a loaded question, which is difficult for him to answer in a public domain.  He might say something different privately.  Does Mr. McCarthy feel that he has been let down by any Department as regards meeting some of the requirements the Department has as the lead Department to deliver on the volume of people coming here, in particular as regards getting accommodation and services?</p></speech>

It meets weekly on this issue, brings everybody to the table and holds everybody to account in terms of their response on it.</p></speech>

The Department will be moving to look at alternative large-scale accommodation and modular or rapid-build housing, whichever description Mr. McCarthy wants to use.  A contract has been signed with Sisk to deliver this, and I understand five companies are subcontracting.  Has a contract been signed with them?  Why did it take from April, when the Minister visited the sites - I have a reply to a parliamentary question on the matter?  Why has it taken so long?  That is just one minute aspect of a range of Departments that should be co-operating with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p></speech>

The OPW and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage were involved in canvassing and identifying suitable sites for inclusion in the programme.  There was a process of narrowing down candidate sites, which would have taken some time.  If I am correct, the procurement process that led to the appointment of Sisk was probably completed in July.</p></speech>

I must move on.  As regards the process by which sites are selected for either strand, what pre-qualification filtration mechanism is used to ensure that all the ancillary education and health requirements are in place?  I recently asked a parliamentary question about the smallest communities that have taken in those seeking protection under the temporary protection directive for Ukrainians or other refugees.  The Department was not able to answer.  I was just given a list by county.  The reason I ask is there is an issue in my constituency regarding a small area called Puckaun, where 215 people live, and it is proposed to put in 56.  I am not saying the issue is right or wrong, but it just appeared from nowhere.  The school is full and there are no local facilities or transport.  What is the process by which that happens?  Is it the case that those who are contracted to provide these services find accommodation, buy it and present it as a solution or are providers given a checklist with minimum requirements they have to meet as regards access to facilities and services?</p></speech>

The providers of the accommodation would not have had any role in that.  Following on from the Government decision there would have been a process of engagement with the local authorities involving the OPW and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to identify candidate sites.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  What I am getting from him is that there are some sort of criteria.  This may not be the Department's fault, as it happened so quickly, but there has been some secrecy about the system or perhaps not enough communication.  It is probably a resource issue.  I want to be clear.  Councillors and officials in local authorities on the ground know more or less what works.  If there are some basic criteria, as Mr. McCarthy has outlined, when somebody comes with a location like the one I just mentioned in Puckaun, would the Department then consult with the local authority before signing a contract?</p></speech>

The initial identification of role requirements was probably in the order of about 60 but this develops and goes through various phases.  To give the Deputy an example, as I mentioned, we have accommodated 42,000 people but the number of accommodation moves involved within that, where people come into rest centre accommodation, for example, and then move on into subsequent accommodation, amplifies the need as various streams of this develop.  Reference was made to the communication requirement.  We have kept our needs under constant review.  It is not a simple case that we prescribed our needs at the outset.</p></speech>

Essentially, the Red Cross was relied on very heavily.  In fact, there has been quite a lot of criticism about people not being followed up.  That was to be where quite a sizable amount of accommodation would be provided and, even now, we are hearing from people.  On the voluntary nature of that, was there a projection in respect of what was going to be required to support the likes of the Red Cross?  Did the Department have any role in that?</p></speech>

Smaller providers, in particular, are people who are only involved in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  We hear that quite a lot of providers are teetering on the edge, especially the smaller providers who are uniquely involved in ECCE.  On the Department's case management and its engagement with the county childcare committees, has it provided those committees with very specific information for those smaller providers to engage with the sustainability fund?</p></speech>

Those committees are all very familiar with what is involved and required in engaging with a provider that is identifying sustainability or viability issues.  There is support available from the Department for those county childcare committees if there are any issues that require elaboration or clarification.  A lot of information is available to them.</p></speech>

No.  All providers are benefiting from the new funding model.  There is a significant overall increase in investment, as people will know.  That will reach &euro;1 billion next year, in fact, which is five years ahead of target.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of engagement with them around the issues they are raising.  I will make the point that, as I said, there is a funding guarantee under the new funding model so no provider is less well off.  Some 99% of providers are better off and many are significantly better off.  That is all part of an objective of investing in quality in the sector and ensuring that staff in the sector are supported as professionals.  An employment regulation order is in place now to allow that.</p> <p>  Small ECCE providers will benefit relatively less well from core funding or from the new funding model than larger, full-programme childcare providers, for the simple reason that their operations are smaller in terms of the number of hours offered.  They are open for 15 hours a week for 38 weeks a year so by definition they will not benefit to the same extent from a funding model that provides-----</p></speech>

It is certainly nothing like what all of us are hearing from smaller providers.  We do not want to end up with providers pulling out where there is a necessary service.</p> <p>  Last week, Mr. David Moloney, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, informed us that it offered Tusla the opportunity to take over Benefacts.  That Department was told that Benefacts did not meet the data needs of Tusla.  How was that offer presented to Tusla?  What was required of Tusla or what resources would it have had to provide?  How did the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth consider the analysis of what Tusla's data needs were?  The representatives might take us through how the offer was presented.</p></speech>

As that moved on over the years and organisations started to develop their own different data sets, there was a question as to the continuity of that.  It had been funded centrally.  We certainly expressed a view on the positive dimensions that Benefacts continued to offer.  If it was going to change, we were anxious to see whether there was a possibility that State agencies outside the previous Department of Public Expenditure and Reform model could look at retaining Benefacts.  In fact, I corresponded in detail with my colleague, Mr. Paul Reid, the CEO of the HSE, at the time.  I do not know whether it was a confluence of factors, such as Covid and other things, but it took some time.  The HSE decided that it really was not within its ability to continue it.  It was interested in taking over the Benefacts data but not necessarily continuing the Benefacts service.  We would not have been able to sustain retaining Benefacts in our own right just for ourselves.  The cost would have been in excess of &euro;1 million.  It was originally not set up as specific to Tusla at all.</p></speech>

Our early estimates would be, at a minimum, more than 50% more.  We have to take account of the fact that we are looking at a full year cost, but also the arrivals numbers are growing cumulatively.

What is the lifespan of those modular homes?  Hopefully, this war will be over soon.  Families have been split up and are in an awful situation.  The right thing to do is to try to help them for now but many may decide to go back.  I think 80% of the people coming are women and children so many of them will have husbands, boyfriends, partners, mothers and fathers in Ukraine and will want to return so we could finish up having some extra homes.  What is the lifespan of those homes?</p></speech>

We are not talking about prefabs.  These buildings are of a very good standard.  They are constructed off site.  The phrase "modular" may be somewhat misleading and may be misinterpreted in terms the quality of what is being provided.</p></speech>

I know Mr. McCarthy is involved with this because it came up at a meeting of Laois County Council but it would be useful for local councillors to have a briefing on it as well.  In terms of medium and long-term planning, we may be able to find a follow-on use for many of these homes and people would see that as a benefit.

I can read out the full list of updates.  There were names and addresses updated to reflect the change to the description of the Department and its functions.  In sections 1(2)(e) and 1(3)(e), text was added on notifying Pobal of relevant EU regulations and the requirement on Pobal to ensure compliance with these.  Obviously, we can provide copies of the previous service level agreement and the updated service level agreement, with changes tracked, if that is helpful.</p> <p>  On section 2(4), material was added on protected disclosures.  That was on foot of legal advice provided by both the Department's legal adviser and Pobal's legal adviser to ensure the respective roles set out in the legislation would be properly captured within the service level agreement.  There was a piece added to section 3(4) in relation to Pobal's requirement to return surplus funds to the Department.  There was material updated on the GDPR Act because the previous service level agreement had been agreed before the Act had come into force.  There was a line added in relation to the Department in agreement with Pobal having the capacity to add additional performance measurements should the need arise.  The updated service level agreement reflects each of those changes.</p></speech>

In the first instance, is that the term the Department uses?  My understanding is that there are private companies which essentially source accommodation, whether that be hotels or private properties, on behalf of the Department for international protection housing.  Is &ldquo;intermediaries&rdquo; the correct term or would the Department use a different term for people in that role?</p></speech>

I have plenty of examples where it did not happen.  I will give one example of a person who was contacted but was unable to take the call at the time because they were on another call.  When the person rang back they reached an Army barracks which stated it knew nothing about the matter.  The person then contacted the local authority, which contacted the Irish Red Cross.  The Irish Red Cross stated that the person was not on the list and then added the person to the list.  The local authority offered to inspect the property the following day but the person was not available.  When the person telephoned the local authority six weeks later, the local authority stated it had already inspected the property when, in fact, it had not.  Nine months on, the local authority has not come back again since.  That is only one example that I have.  I do not believe there is co-operation on this.  This needs to be worked on.  I am not blaming the Department but pointing out that there seems to be a lack of co-ordination and no one person seems to be taking charge of this issue.</p></speech>

When the Irish Red Cross set out to embark on it at the earlier stage of the crisis, it probably did so on the basis of previous pledge programme responses and its experience with those.  Obviously, however, this has been way in excess of anything that had gone before in terms of the scale of what was involved.  As I referenced earlier, we had to support the Irish Red Cross in terms of additional resourcing to assist it in managing those early phases.  More particularly, the role of the local authorities came into play by way of activating and trying to activate those pledges on the ground, given the scale of what was involved.  It is a very intensive process.</p></speech>

Certainly, the pace at which people have moved into pledged accommodation has picked up since the local authorities have become involved.  One of the things we have been able to do through their involvement is to target rest centres or temporary accommodation - the emergency accommodation in which Ukrainians have been placed on arrival - and to try to encourage, in an intensive and targeted way, people in those centres to take offers of pledged accommodation.  One of the challenges we realised we were up against early on in the process was that people who were in fully-serviced hotel accommodation were not interested in taking up pledged accommodation.  There are additional costs involved, for example, in living independently.</p></speech>

It provides young people who have dropped out of school with a structured education.  The funding provided for it is under &euro;200,000 for 50 children.  In the case of Oberstown, &euro;24 million is being spent on 46 children.  Do we need to look at a better way of approaching this in a more structured way?  I was involved in one of these facilities for a long number of years.  I have raised this matter at the committee previously.  We had up to 50 young people in with us at any one time.  Most of them were referred to us by the Garda.  They had dropped out of school, had become involved in minor incidents and the Garda stepped in before they got into major difficulty.  Many of the facilities providing this kind support developed when people got together and set them up rather than one Department being involved.  Do we now need to look at that and have a more structured way of dealing with it?</p></speech>

It was set up by a number of people voluntarily and they eventually got State funding.  To this day, it provides support to approximately 50 people.</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. Gloster, might want to say something more on that.  It is, however, a really important part of our capacity as a society to support these children and ensure that as communities, we are putting in place the supports and structures that can catch, support and address need on the ground.</p></speech>

Do we need to step in at a faster rate rather than waiting for someone else on the ground to do it?

If it is okay, I will ask Mr. Gloster to come in on this point.  I am sure he is anxious to add to what I have said.</p></speech>

The Deputy gave the example of the Cork Life Centre, which is a fantastic service.  There are so many examples of that around the country.  The question is why that comes from within communities themselves as opposed to appearing like a proactive State intervention.  Very often, State intervention at that level is much better as a funded support to community and voluntary organisations.  They find a greater level of acceptance-----</p></speech>

It is not getting funding and may very well close.  We have 50 children.  It now technically comes under the Department in the sense that we have vulnerable young people who are going to be out there without any support mechanisms and we are getting less than &euro;200,000 per annum.  Each child in Oberstown costs more than &euro;500,000 per annum whereas we are supporting 50 children for &euro;200,000.  With another bit of money, we could keep going.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point and it is well made.  It is a very important local issue whereby 50 children are being supported.  The Deputy and Mr. Gloster might have a follow-up engagement around the funding for that centre in Cork, because it is important.  That might be the best approach.  Is the Deputy happy enough with that?</p></speech>

It is, unfortunately, that 80:20 position where the smaller number with very high immediate intensive needs in the most serious crisis situations utilises the greater share of the resources.  I would not dispute that at all.  It is a constant challenge.</p></speech>

In that context, we are on record as saying the allowance that was set at that period has not kept step with time and there is a requirement for it to be reviewed.  To be fair, we have much agreement with the Minister and the Department around working through that as part of an overall approach to improving foster care.  The allowance is &euro;352 per week per child over the age of 12 and &euro;325 per week per child under the age of 12.</p></speech>

It is one of those few payments that really has been untouched over such a long space of time.  Is there a rationale behind that?</p></speech>

It was set against two parameters of the State that made it different.  One is that it is not counted as income for Revenue under any purpose of the legislation in Ireland for income.  The other is that it is not means assessable under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act or any other payment.  Is there a rationale after that?  We can take the economic downturn and the succession of other demands and issues.  There have been additional and enhanced payments made on top of it for special needs but I am very much on the public record as saying they are not consistent in any way.  We have a very clear plan and a very significant support with foster carers to correct many of those in 2023.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Gloster for the information; it is very helpful.</p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise is much more serious.  The State is under enormous pressure around dealing with the war in Ukraine and also around the current ongoing situation with inbound migration.  It is something that is extremely difficult for the Government to manage.  Of course, it falls under the auspices of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  All of us are conscious of trying to identify the challenges but also to identify what could be done better from the perspective of developing an understanding for the public around how this is being managed.</p> <p>  I will outline the scenario to Mr. McCarthy and I want him to reply.  Does he have concerns about the direction of travel around the acquisition of hotels around the country being purchased for potential operation as direct provision centres in the long run, or around expansion into the nursing home sector where small nursing homes that are closing down may be turned into direct provision centres?  I want to ask about the future of this area.  What is the Department's position on this at the moment?  It has been put under huge burden and stress by the war in Ukraine, but there are also additional challenges as a consequence of what happened with policy changes by the United Kingdom Government.  I will ask Mr. McCarthy that to start with.</p></speech>

We are at the front end of it in terms of the accommodation pressures.  However, there are wider service pressures in terms of managing and responding to all the needs of people on arrival.  Obviously, people in the international protection system can have very particular needs.  Much work has been put into developing good systems to ensure those needs are met in a timely way.  Those processes come under strain when the numbers accelerate, as we have seen over the course of this year.</p></speech>

In 2021, prior to the war in Ukraine, was there a projected increase in this area from the Department?  Was it expecting a huge increase in the amount of inbound migration when it came to people who would be accessing the direct provision system in Ireland?</p></speech>

There may have been an expectation of some element of increase but our overall yearly average was on the basis of 3,500 over a number of years.  Our Estimate this year was based on a projected arrival rate of 4,500, which would have reflected the expectation of some level of catch-up but certainly nothing like what we have seen.</p></speech>

I am not expressing a view but I am trying to get a better insight for the public in this area.  Is the Department reaching a tipping point when it comes to what it will be able to handle?  I hear, off the record, from people who are working with local authorities that they are at breaking point when it comes to trying to handle the refugee situation.  Any of us who have any decency would accept that the most appalling, devastating and sad of circumstances have caused this to happen.  However, we have to ask ourselves the question, when we are to approach numbers in excess of 70,000 by the end of the year, whether this direction of travel is wise when it comes to have cohesion, response and community buy-in from the public.</p></speech>

I know we have international obligations.  I do not think any of us in elected office, to be fair to us, is trying to step away from those obligations but policymakers and elected representatives need to get a better insight as to the limit.  Where does this situation get to a breaking point at which the State will not be able to manage it?  We saw that we got quite close to that point last weekend.</p></speech>

Our objective is to add capacity through as many means as possible and in a effective and timely a way as possible to be able to meet the demand.  However, I have concerns about our capacity to respond on time to the pressure that materialises.  We have seen shortfalls in our accommodation offering, at a particular point in time, at various stages.  From late March, we have had to rely on the support of local authorities on a number of occasions to stand up emergency rest centres to allow us to cope with surges in numbers.  Clearly, there is-----</p></speech>

I am from Youghal and I am sure the Deputy is aware that the former Quality Hotel in Redbarn was acquired by a private company which is now providing one of the largest centres in the country, outside of Citywest in Dublin, if not the largest.  I wish to understand how buildings such as that were identified by operators for purchasing.  How did the communication work between the Department and those operators when it came to identifying what was appropriate?  That is important for all of us because we are now looking at a situation where small nursing homes may wish to close down and move into this area.  It will become much more common, to judge by recent commentary in the media.  The public needs to understand how this works.  It is essentially important that people have an understanding of what is going on because politicians such as me, who are in government, have been kept completely in the dark about this, which has made it impossible for us to communicate with our constituents about it.  People have considerable concerns.</p></speech>

I asked Mr. McCarthy about the service level agreement.  The reason I asked him was that there were recommendations made that the new service level agreement be put in place and that there would be measures such as indications in the service level agreement to allow us to see what grants were being targeted.  I did not hear the Mr. McCarthy say anything like that.  What key performance indicators, KPIs, have been set in the individual contracts?  How will they be measured?  I want the service level agreement to see whether recommendations are being taken up or whether we are just wasting our time here.</p></speech>

I will take two local authorities.  Kerry has been in the news recently and there are a lot of good things happening there.  If we look at Kerry and Meath, there are twice as many staff in Kerry as in Meath and there are 100,000 more people in Meath.  There are historical reasons the staffing ratios are like that and I hope it will change at some point but there is not the same capacity around the country.  Some of the local authorities are quite threadbare when it comes to staff numbers.  When the officials talk about the local authorities, has there been any capacity review on the local authorities' ability to perform the function the Department is now requiring?  I think this is the second time it has been announced.</p></speech>

The functions in the Department are very different than they were straight after the general election.  There has been much more activity in childcare, for example, for which I am thankful.  The Department has had a very busy time with the mother and baby homes and then there has been the transfer of the international protection aspect from the Department of Justice.  We need to get an overview of Mr. McCarthy's staffing and how that breaks down because presumably it is compartmentalised within the Department.  Did the full international protection unit transfer over from Justice?  Was there a requirement for additional staff that were not provided?  What was the profile of that?</p></speech>

The immediate focus is on our need to meet the demand presenting day by day.

The idea that the owners of centres that are hosting refugees and operating direct provision services are not required to provide a tax clearance certificate when in some cases they are in receipt of millions of euros of taxpayers' money is utterly unacceptable and needs to be dealt with immediately.  That is also an issue for Revenue, in all fairness.  I just wanted to say that in response.</p> <p>  I want, in the limited time available, to get a better understanding.  When it comes to the projections of where this is going, I have considerable concerns about how it is being handled.  What appears to be the case, and tell me if I am wrong, is that hotels and nursing homes across the country will be turned into centres for direct provision if this is not managed properly.  Can that be ruled out?  Are there projections available in that regard?  Has there been communication to the Cabinet subcommittee on that issue?</p></speech>

We have good real-time data mapped by a geographic information system, GIS.  Those data tell us where people are located and they are shared across government to allow people to build an understanding of the associated service impacts and requirements.  We are aware of that.  We are conscious of the potential impact on areas.  We have, for example, deliberately not contracted further in an area where we feel the level of pressure on services may become too great.  It comes back to the ongoing engagement we have with local authorities to get their sense of where the pressure points might be.  It is something of which we are aware.</p></speech>

I spoke at the start about public cohesion and buy-in, which is essential for this to work.  The consequences of it not working are very serous for the political system and our democracy.  The people of this country have been extraordinarily generous and have worked diligently in many cases to assist.  That has happened at a local authority level.  Much work has been done within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  I am familiar with Youghal in my local area and will use it as an example.  The town has lost over 70% of the available tourist bed capacity in its local hotels.  The town has been described by the Government for years as being entirely reliant on the tourist industry.  Tourism is considered the future of the town.  In locations such as Youghal and other rural, coastal towns in Ireland, hotels have been not only given contracts but purchased by direct provision centre operators.  Does Mr. McCarthy not see the possibility of that not ending well in respect of public support?  Quite frankly, given the direction of travel over the coming months, I do not understand how we will be able to manage this.</p></speech>

We know exactly what the position is in that regard.  The intermediary must be tax compliant.  However, if an intermediary is contracting a premises, the operator of the premises may or may not be tax compliant.  We hope everyone is tax compliant.  I ask that our guests would put together a register of those.  Particularly if hotels and large venues are providing a range of services and there is a lot of State money involved, we want them to be tax compliant.  I ask for that reconciliation to be done.  This is not an argument.  The right thing is being done.  I understand that much of this had to happen quickly.  I get that.  People had to move fast and everybody was under a lot of pressure.  However, as things now start to bed in, I would ask for that check to be done.  Where an intermediary is perhaps arranging a number of venues, can we ensure those venues and their owners are tax compliant?  I ask Mr. McCarthy and Ms Baxter whether that can be done.  Let us imagine that Deputy Carthy is an intermediary and I own a hotel.  Deputy Carthy has arranged to provide services for &euro;500,000 for the year and I am getting &euro;400,000.  The intermediaries must get a profit margin because I presume they are registered with the Companies Registration Office.  Are they sole traders?  What are they?</p></speech>

An intermediary is likely getting 5%, 10%, 15% or more.  Is there a concern that the slice of State money to provide services that they are taking would drop the standards in the facilities?  If, for example, the &euro;500,000 is to provide services to a certain number of people and 10% or 20% of that is being taken by an intermediary, could it lead to a drop in the quality of services?</p></speech>

That is not to say we are not interested in other situations, but when it comes to something like significant disability, autism spectrum disorder or mental health issues, the expertise for primarily leading the care response involves a health service response usually supported by Tusla.  If it is a protective response, it is led by Tusla and sometimes supported by the HSE.  That is what the joint protocol is there for.  The Ombudsman for Children-----</p></speech>

It states that the services are not fit for purpose.  My office has a library and a list the length of my arm of services not being provided, and we are here discussing whether we will be able to cater for 200,000 refugees.  I do not understand.

The first is that we collect data from our funded agencies ourselves directly through the service level agreement we have with them. However, that is a challenge and a deficit for us because Benefacts pulled together data from a variety of sources, including their annual reports and so on.  Essentially, the gap removes part of our assurance and we have to try to continue to build that into our own system now.  However, our own system for commissioning is not yet what might be called a modern digital system that operates consistently across the country.  It is very variable, and there is no doubt but that it has taken away a part of the assurance on which we relied.</p></speech>

It was a good assurance, so there is a loss in that sense.  The internal audit functions for Tusla were provided up to this year by the HSE on an outsourced basis from where Tusla came from the HSE.  We have just recruited our own direct internal auditor and we will resource that person with a team.  There is no doubt but that the nature and complexity of our work, the volume of our funding and the amount we are discharging through third parties such as the community and voluntary sector and the 600 entities I mentioned require us now to reach a threshold of internal audit and assurance that is no longer suitable to have outsourced to the HSE.  We are literally this month appointing our own internal auditor.</p></speech>

The HSE felt that it needed to concentrate on internal audit for its own increasing needs and systems.</p><p>Ultimately, with an agency like Tusla, which had shared services with the HSE when it was set up in 2014, the complexity of governance requirements of public funding and the volumes we are using meant it just was not suitable any more.</p></speech>

This meant that instead of doing a sample internal audit, it was possible to choose the areas where something stood out.  Now that this information and data are no longer available, can that be replaced just by internal audit?  Will Tusla carry out sampling, for example?</p></speech>

The HSE internal audit and Tusla have increasingly used outsourced partners and accountancy firms to do risk-based audits in targeted, granular detail.  There is no point in saying Benefacts did not do anything.  It did and it was there for a reason and made a good contribution.  Ultimately, if we are to replace the part of the assurance we took from what Benefacts did, it will come from having a standard, digital, high-level information input system for each person or agency we fund and having that feed us much more data than we currently have in order that we can make the risk assessments and the benefits analysis the Deputy is talking about.</p></speech>

We need to know the number of intermediaries and who they are; the amount they have been paid; the proportion of that they received as opposed to the accommodation provider; the number of properties in each case; and the number of individuals accommodated via each of them.  We need to get a handle on this because these are the types of issues that can get out of hand.</p> <p>  If somebody seeking international protection is in a property sourced via an intermediary and makes a complaint about the conditions to the Department, what happens?</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, there is an inspection regime in respect of approved international protection accommodation and we have a more <i>ad hoc</i>inspections arrangement for the emergency accommodation we are procuring.</p></speech>

This is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  No. 2 concerns the national lottery fund for 2021.  This is a clear audit opinion.  Members will probably recall that there is a chapter in relation to the national lottery fund.  This may be of interest to members to examine.  No. 3 concerns the Regulator of the National Lottery.  These two are published together.  While this is a clear audit opinion, I draw the committee's attention to note No. 10 on pension provision.  This discloses the reasons why accumulated pension liabilities, totalling &euro;3.2 million, have not been recognised in the financial statement, and that the regulator is awaiting a decision of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about pension proposals submitted in 2015.  It has been ongoing for a number of years.  They have not finalised liability for accumulated pension entitlements.</p> <p>  No. 4 concerns the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for 2021, which is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  No. 5 concerns the local loans fund for 2021, which is a clear audit opinion.</p><p>The committee may want to note that it is a nil account; there is no activity on it.  The fund is now effectively dormant.  The final one is the land bond winding-up account for 2021.  There were no transactions in the year.  The balance in the fund is &euro;137,000.

On the Regulator of the National Lottery, I think we touched previously on this issue in respect of the pensions and that there is a liability of &euro;3.2 million in terms of pensions.  I presume that is accruing on an annual basis?</p></speech>

When the regulator was established, staff came in from other parts of the public service and they would have already had entitlements to pensions.  That is what the issue is, namely, whether the regulator should take on liability that had previously accrued in other occupations and in other employments.</p></speech>

So if someone transfers in to you, all of their service effectively comes with them.  If somebody transfers out, all of their service goes with them.  For a regulator, where it is effectively charging the national lottery fund for the costs of operating the regulator, an overhanging liability is a difficulty.  I think it is trying to resolve that, as to who is going to pay for the prior-accumulated pension liability.</p></speech>

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The following two correspondence items were held over from last week.  The first is No. R1497B from Mr. Paul O'Connell on behalf of Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 6 October 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising out of last week's meeting.  These are internal working documents and the Department has requested that they not be published.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this item for correspondence.</p></speech>

The minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the official response to the recommendations of this committee.  I raised this matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last week as the minute is not in line with the Department&rsquo;s own circular, that is, Circular 01/2011.  That circular provides that the minute should respond to every recommendation, stating whether that recommendation has been accepted or not and the reasons for same.  That has not been done in regard to any of the recommendations in our report.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media cites RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s independence under the Broadcasting Act but many of the recommendations are to the Department rather than RT&Eacute;, and are not directly addressed.</p><p>It is open to us to take the matter up with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We could also write to the Accounting Officer of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to request an official explanation of the poor quality of response.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  I will open the matter to the floor in order to discover how members wish to proceed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I flagged this for discussion today, and even last week.  Members will see that the response provided is totally inadequate.  I am not happy with the fact that the Department seems to be brushing away the recommendations of the committee.  I propose that we write to the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media about the matter.</p></speech>

We seem to be going around in circles on the National Maternity Hospital.  If we are going to learn lessons from that, the place to start is with the national children's hospital.  We are being stymied in our attempts to see the business case and so forth.  That is the main issue I would raise.</p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about learning lessons.  Every Department that comes before the committee is learning lessons from some previous debacle, yet new debacles are always beginning.  None of those is bigger than that relating to the national children's hospital.  At some point, someone - whether it is this committee or someone else - will need to look at how we got this so wrong on so many different levels such that the outlay to the taxpayer was far beyond what anybody would have dared suggest at the outset.  I have no doubt that one of the problems that will be identified is the level of secrecy and lack of transparency throughout the process.  In order for this committee to be vindicated, we need to continuously record our dissatisfaction with the way in which information is being withheld.  This correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform informs the committee that the Department of Health has stated that the information relating to costings is commercially sensitive.  I propose that we write back to the Department of Health again to express our view that the information should be provided to the committee and requesting that this should be done, if for no other reason than to ensure that it will be on the public record that the committee did everything to try to have throughout the process the accountability that has been sadly lacking.</p></speech>

The issue I am concerned about is that we were told that we are more than 70% of the way through this contract and there is no final price.  We do not even have a ballpark figure for the final price.  We have made numerous efforts in respect of this matter.  It is two years and three months since we started trying to shed some light on it.  If a person was three quarters of the way through building a house and still did not know the final price, it would not be a good place to be.  I am not too sure what you would tell the bank in such circumstances.  The bank in this case is of course Joe Public.  I suggest that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask whether it knows what will be the final cost.  We do not know; we are not being told.  As Deputy Carthy correctly stated, the letter dated 14 October 2022 indicates that in light of the fact that a commercially sensitive contract is in operation, any queries about final costs of the project should be directed to the Department of Health.  I propose that we write to Mr. Moloney to ask whether he knows and also write to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt.  Mr. Watt was the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when this contract for the national children's hospital was put in place.

We are not far from exhausting the money for the build cost, but the hospital is not yet built.  We are likely to see a Supplementary Estimate in respect of the final cost.  I imagine that will happen next year because that is when the money will run out.  How does that happen?  It will have to be estimated at that stage.

Having looked at similar projects abroad, there are two issues.  One is that the main infrastructure has now been built and there is a major issue regarding disputes between the contractors and the project team.  However, one of the issues that is out of the way relates to the substantial increase in building costs.  We are lucky that the main infrastructure was in place before we ended up with a major increase in costs.  If we had started this project last year, it would have increased by much more in a shorter timeframe.  The problem we have relates to the various issues under dispute.  My understanding from the previous discussion is that there are 700 or 800 issues and that these have been parked.  When will they be dealt with and when can we get an overview of the real cost of those disputed items?  When representatives from the Department were last before the committee, they more or less indicated that those items had been parked and that nothing will be done in respect of them for some time.  We need to get clarification about when those matters will be dealt with and an indication as to the timeframe relating to when we will get results in respect of those issues.  A substantial claim has been made but we will not know the extent of it until the Department starts to deal with the matters in question.</p></speech>

Deputy Burke mentioned that construction inflation has increased dramatically.</p><p>  We hope since most of the building work has been completed although the contract itself burdens the entire cost of any inflation over 4% on one side.  It is mind boggling how so many people looking at a contract could not see a danger in that   When we first raised it which is not that long ago only since 2020 and inflation had started to creep up at that point.  We were told by the Board that they did not envisage this coming into play at all, that we would reach 4% of construction inflation.  The figure of 4% sounds lovely, right now because we are into multiples of that.  An estimate from the Department in respect of how much that particular clause is going to actually cost in terms of construction inflation and hopefully Deputy Burke is right that most of the actual costs in terms of building materials had been incurred prior to the most recent taxes.</p><p> We hope that was since most of the building work had been completed, although the contract itself burdens the entire cost of any inflation over 4% on one side.

It was interesting that they had decided the project was going to take so much time and had actually built in 15% increased costs per annum as the project was developing.  They started their project in 2019 and it was a five year project.  The 15% increase per annum was a huge increase.  The project is also a children's hospital.  It is costing 3.6 billion Canadian dollars.  We are very lucky that we have got the main infrastructure built now and the question now is trying to control costs at this stage.</p></speech>

What happened here was that 4% in construction inflation was built into the original contract with a proviso that everything above that, regardless of what it was, would be borne by one side.  How it works with social housing projects, as we know, is that if costs go beyond what could have been envisaged, there will be a sharing of the burden.  There is no sharing of the burden in this instance.  It is all falling on the Irish taxpayers and that to me is mind-boggling.</p></speech>

It is dated 19 October 2022 and is providing information requested by the committee regarding the overall cost since 1997 of tribunals or commissions of investigation under the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Across two tribunals of inquiry and four commissions of investigation, we are approaching &euro;100 million in costs, with some costs yet to be settled, legal fees for third parties etc.  I assume that is what was being referred to in that case.  I propose to note and publish that item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have flagged the one in relation to the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Payments to Politicians and Related Matters.  That was established in September 1997 and to date, &euro;67 million has been paid out on that.  Is that concluded or are there other costs still to be settled in that case?  I do not know the answer to that.</p></speech>

There is a perception of a saving, by virtue of the fact that we do not have organisations like for example, the Corporate Enforcement Agency that has been set up, properly resourced.  It was guaranteed 16 members of the Garda but only has seven at the moment.  It still does not have its full complement.  It cannot do its work if it does not have the resources.  If we do not have organisations that can properly regulate and enforce, we will then end up paying in retrospect by way of inquiries.  We really have to grasp the nettle on this.</p> <p>  I have a previous response that I got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform going back to 2019 on this issue.  The cost of inquiries at the end of 2018 was &euro;457 million, almost half a billion euro, and it lists those costs down.  That is right across all Departments, where each would have been the parent Department, whereas this is exclusively related to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Some of them were included in this response.  I can look at the response this committee got in 2019 and at the one we are discussing at the moment.  The investigation into certain matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is down at &euro;3.5 million.  When I look at this reply that I got previously, it makes me wonder if it was the same inquiry.  I am not sure if there were two.  This one is about a tribunal of inquiry into certain garda&iacute; in Donegal.  That may well be a different one but that was &euro;68 million.  The point I am trying to make is that I am not sure whether we are getting a full overview with this.  There is a list here and we probably need to get that list from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the entire overview, if we are going to compare like with like, because some of the figures do not make sense.</p></speech>

The work may have been farmed out to private legal practices but surely we should have an idea of what is actually outstanding.  When a bill of costs comes in, someone within the Chief State Solicitor's office or whoever is dealing with it on the other side would have to deal with it.</p></speech>

It is not all like with like when it comes to looking at inquiries.  However, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, one, for example, was not under the commission of investigations heading.  There was bespoke legislation and we need to have a look at how that ended up being a tribunal behind closed doors, as opposed to a commission of investigation.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed. We do not want to be fobbed off on that one.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1527B from Mr. John Hogan, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 19 October and providing information we requested regarding the economic identity of Irish Water when it separated from Ervia.

I received a reply from the Department of Finance about the public side of it being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is quite a large account that requires auditing.  Somewhere in the region of &euro;1 billion was invested.  What additional resources would be put into the Comptroller and Auditor General's office in relation to a big account like that coming in?  Is that kind of thing planned when the legislation is being decided as part of a regulatory impact assessment?</p></speech>

The expectation is there will be two sets of auditors.  A lot of the work will be done by the commercial auditors, and then we will seek to rely on their work to the extent it is appropriate.  If we want to do additional work under a value for money, VFM, mandate that would be a resource we would provide ourselves.  If it looks like there will be a significant additional workload for us, then we will have to seek additional resources for that.</p></speech>

It will be of all of the financial statements of Irish Water.  However, to the extent that I am required to give an opinion on those as well, I will seek, in the interests of efficiency not to duplicate the work, to rely on the work the commercial auditors do.  I am entitled to do that as an auditor.  We do it in other circumstances, for example, in the universities.  They appoint auditors so we review their work programme and findings.  We draw our own conclusions.  If we feel there is additional work to do, then we undertake that ourselves.</p></speech>

No. 1528B is from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and it is dated 18 October.  This is a further update on our recommendations to the Department that we work to develop in-house expertise with regard to the national broadband project.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The second letter on the same subject is No. 1525C from Deputy Catherine Murphy, dated 19 October.  It is a proposal for the committee to make inquiries regarding the change of ownership in respect of the national broadband plan.  Does Deputy Murphy wish to come in on that?</p></speech>

The Department told us at the time it could not give us the information.  I do not see that there would be any reason we could not have full disclosure at this stage, a couple of weeks later.  That is what I am seeking from the Department.  There were things like clawbacks and shareholding.  I raised some of those specific issues with the Department and it was not able to respond because things had not concluded at that stage.</p></speech>

It would be interesting, given there will be substantial changes on the board and to clarify the day the departmental witnesses were here, to get figures for the breakdown of what the board may look like.  The other question is whether there will be any proceeds to the State.  I know some elements of the contract for the national broadband plan contained a piece that where the contract has been sold and there is a gain in that, there is a clawback for the State.  We might look for that to be clarified at this point as well.</p><p>One of the points I raised with the officials was whether there was a payment to-----</p></speech>

No. 1516C is from an individual and is dated 16 October 2022.  It is further correspondence to the committee regarding the social welfare appeals office and requests that the committee take further action as regards the further classification of certain workers.  The issues raised have been considered by the committee and the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  We have also provided the correspondent with a copy of our report on the classification of workers, whether employees, employers or contractors, as well as related correspondence.  We have advised that we will examine the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on the classification of workers for PRSI purposes with the Department of Social Protection.  That meeting is scheduled for 1 December.  I am open to members' suggestions.  I propose that we note the correspondence and proceed to examine the chapter in due course.</p></speech>

They are paid by the Department of Education but are regarded as self-employed.  Even though they are classified as self-employed, if they put money into a pension it is not tax-deductible.  They are having serious problems as regards what they can and cannot do.  While the money is paid to them to by the Department of Education and all their PAYE and PRSI is deducted by the Department, they are still regarded as self-employed.

We will note and publish No. 1516C.</p> <p>  No. 1522C, dated 19 October 2022, is from an individual and relates to the use of public funds to support Ukraine.  The correspondent takes the view that the State is participating in the war and is, therefore, breaching Article 28.3 of the Constitution which states "War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann."  This matter has been raised in the Houses and is one for the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The role of this committee is to examine related expenditure of the relevant State bodies once their accounts have been circulated.  I propose to advise the correspondent of that.  I have flagged up the issue.  The correspondent quotes the Constitution, on which I think all members have a handle.  The issue is whether it is the role of the committee to decide whether neutrality has been breached.  To substantiate his case, the correspondent supplied a copy of extracts of what he said were from a speech by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  I suggest we write to the Minister to ask for a response because the correspondent quotes him making certain statements on 29 April 2022 at an event in the John Fitzgerald Kennedy centre in Boston.  Is it agreed that we send the correspondence to the Minister seeking a response?  This is not really the role of the committee.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to define, make rules and decide on our position on neutrality and it is up to the Houses to interpret and define neutrality and decide whether we are going beyond it.  I heard part of a discussion this week in the D&aacute;il.  It would be useful to get clarity on that because funding is being provided, we want to be clear on what it is being used for.  The Minister is entitled to an opportunity to respond.  We have these quotations.  I was not familiar with the speech the Minister is quoted as having given on 29 April.  We will ask him for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Moving on to our work programme, next week is a non-sitting week due to the Hallowe'en bank holiday.  We will engage with Greyhound Racing Ireland on 10 November.  On 17 November, we will engage with the Department of Finance.  The regulator of the National Lottery will attend on 24 November.  On 1 December, we have two engagements.  The first is with the Department of Social Protection and the second will be on the operation of the National Lottery.  On 8 December, we will have the Office of the Revenue Commissioners before us.  The final engagement, on 15 December, is with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We have also agreed to engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the new year.  Are there any matters members wish to raise regarding the work programme?  No.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for the day.</p> <p>  The final matter on the public agenda is any other business.  Do members wish to raise any matters?  No.</p></speech>
