    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Savage" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018110600002#D00600"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to attend to brief the committee on the latest position on Brexit from the perspective of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I propose first to comment in overall terms on the main issues of concern that Brexit gives rise to from an agrifood and fisheries perspective, before referring to the sectoral support measures that the Department has put in place to date.  I will then refer briefly to the current state of play in the EU-UK negotiations, before outlining the preparedness activities in which the Department is currently engaged.</p> <p>  I should make clear that the whole-of-Government preparations for Brexit are being co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and that the key interlocutors for Ireland in the context of the negotiations are that Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is also the case that these negotiations are at a critical juncture and it is important that I do not say anything today that intrudes upon or has the potential to prejudice those negotiations in any way.</p> <p>  On Brexit and the implications for the agrifood and fisheries sectors, it almost goes without saying at this juncture that these are potentially very serious indeed.  Numerous studies, for example, by Teagasc, the Department of Finance and Copenhagen Economics, point to the particular exposure of the sector to the UK market and the potential economic impact of Brexit, whether this takes place in hard or soft form.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s analysis shows the agrifood sector to be the most exposed from both an export and import perspective.  Teagasc&rsquo;s research work points to very serious potential impacts on farm incomes.  The findings of Copenhagen Economics point to the significant proportion of the overall impact on Ireland&rsquo;s GDP that is likely to be accounted for by the agrifood sector.</p> <p>  We are talking about a highly export oriented sector, trading to approximately 180 countries worldwide.  The total value of our exports in 2017 came to &euro;13.6 billion, an increase of 74% compared with 2009.  The ambition for the sector, as outlined in Food Wise 2025, is to grow this figure to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  The United Kingdom remains the most important export destination, with some 38%, or &euro;5.2 billion worth, of total exports in 2017.  When we examine the exposure at subsectoral level, we see from the most recent figures that 48% of our beef exports, 21% of dairy exports, including 46% of cheddar cheese exports, more than 60% of prepared consumer foods exports and almost 100% of mushrooms go to the UK.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that trade is not all going in one direction.  Ireland was also the UK&rsquo;s largest export destination in 2017 for agrifood, with about &euro;4.1 billion, or almost 48%, of our imports across a wide range of product categories coming from the UK.  The close correlation between these export and import figures serves as a reminder of the tightly integrated nature of the Irish and UK agrifood sectors.  It also reminds us of the uniquely supportive trading environment that we enjoy, courtesy of the European Union&rsquo;s customs union and Single Market, which facilitates tariff and friction-free trade.</p> <p>  It is clear, therefore, that the best interests of the agrifood sectors in Ireland, and in the UK for that matter, lie in trading arrangements post-Brexit that are as close as possible to those that prevail currently.  That is what Ireland wants from the negotiations and it is also what the EU wants.  It is also clear, however, that the trading relationship cannot be the same outside of the Single Market and the customs union and that it will inevitably give rise to greater friction and higher costs along the supply chain than are currently the case.  In any discussion on the future relationship with the UK, we will work to keep these to a minimum.</p> <p>  A key challenge that could arise in a trade context post-Brexit is, therefore, the imposition of tariffs on Ireland-UK trade, which would have a particularly negative impact on the agrifood sector as this is the sector in which tariffs are highest.  Other significant challenges include potential divergence in regulations and standards and the imposition of import control and export certification requirements on animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, although the latter will depend on the requirements on which the UK may decide.</p> <p>  In the case of fisheries, the potential trade and other impacts are overshadowed by a very particular further set of challenges in the form of potential loss of access to UK waters, loss of quota share in all of our commercial fisheries and stock depletion in Irish waters as a result of increased activity by other EU vessels.   For example, on average 34% of Irish landings by volume are taken from UK waters and in the case of some species, such as mackerel and prawns, the proportions are much higher, at 64% and 42%, respectively.  It is imperative, therefore, that current access and sharing arrangements are maintained post-Brexit.</p> <p>  In overall terms, Ireland&rsquo;s key asks from an agrifood and fisheries perspective continue to be continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures; minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries; maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal; and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks.</p><p>The activities of the Department on Brexit have been multifaceted and underpinned by significant organisational changes.  Brexit is now the responsibility of a dedicated Brexit and international trade division, which co-ordinates all activity across the wide range of Department responsibilities.</p><p> An internal Brexit response committee, chaired at assistant secretary general level, and comprising all relevant Departmental divisions has been established.  All Brexit impact analysis as well as ongoing planning and preparedness activities have been carried out through this committee.</p><p> Stakeholder consultation is also a central component of the Department&rsquo;s response.  A national stakeholder consultative committee involving all agrifood and fisheries sectors' stakeholders, again chaired at assistant secretary general level and usually attended by the Minister and Secretary General, meets on a regular basis.  Indeed, it will meet for the tenth time on Thursday of this week.  Its work has been complemented and deepened by the Department&rsquo;s active participation in the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit process, as well as its hosting of sectoral focus groups which have assessed in detail the supply chain and logistical implications of Brexit for individual sub-sectors.</p><p> Brexit has been added as a standing item to the agenda of the Food Wise 2025 high level implementation committee, which is also due to meet to discuss the issue on Thursday of this week.</p><p> The Minister and the Department have also been engaging extensively with other EU member states and with the European institutions to ensure that the concerns of the agrifood and fisheries sectors are fully understood and are kept to the forefront of the EU agenda.  This has been happening in an informal way around regular meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers as well as through formal bilateral engagement by the Minister and officials with counterparts in European capitals and in Brussels.</p><p> The Department also works closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well as with a number of other Departments and agencies in the context of the whole-of-Government approach to Brexit that I mentioned earlier.</p><p> The most immediate impact of Brexit for the agrifood and fisheries sectors has been in the form of the difficulties caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro.  Much of the Minister's and the Department's focus has therefore been on ameliorating this impact through support measures aimed at improving competitiveness.  A second important dimension has been to intensify our efforts to support product and market diversification as we seek to reduce the sector's exposure to the UK market.</p><p> In budget 2017, the Minister addressed the competitiveness aspect through a range of measures which included a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the rural development and seafood development programmes.</p><p> A further series of dedicated measures was announced in budget 2018, amounting to a package of more than &euro;50 million.  This included additional funding for Bord Bia to support, for example, its market prioritisation initiative and for Teagasc to support development of the new national food innovation hub, as well as capital investment support for the food industry.  It also included a contribution to the joint Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, 40% of which is being made available to food businesses.</p><p> Furthermore, in his recent budget 2019 announcement, the Minister, Deputy Creed, outlined a &euro;78 million package for farmers, fishermen and food SMEs, and to cover additional costs related to Brexit.  This includes: &euro;44 million in direct aid to farmers through increased spending on areas of natural constraint, the introduction of a beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme, and additional funding for the horticulture sector; &euro;27 million in capital funding for the food industry through supports for competitiveness and innovation of &euro;13 million, further funding to progress the Teagasc food innovation hub mentioned earlier of &euro;6.6 million, support for artisan and micro food and beverage programmes of &euro;3 million, as well as an additional &euro;5 million in funding for Bord Bia which brings Bord Bia&rsquo;s total grant in aid to &euro;46.6 million, representing a 60% increase in funding for marketing and promotion of our food offering since 2014; and &euro;7 million to support the Department&rsquo;s Brexit preparedness work, including the commencement of a phased process of recruitment of additional staff to carry out the greatly increased volumes of import controls and, possibly, export certification arising from Brexit, as well as the provision of the necessary additional IT hardware and software.</p><p> The Minister also acknowledged the announcement in the budget by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, of a key Government Brexit response, the future growth loan scheme, which will be rolled out in 2019, and for which he had made provision of &euro;25 million in 2018.  The scheme will provide long-term, unsecured investment finance for farmers, fishermen, and small scale companies in the food and seafood sectors.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that the second dimension of this initial response has been to provide support for product and market diversification.  I have referred to the budgetary measures in this regard in the form of support for innovation and for Bord Bia&rsquo;s ongoing market diversification activities.  There has also been very extensive and practical complementary action taken by the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Department in this area.  We are continuing to work very closely with the agrifood industry to increase the sector&rsquo;s global footprint and to reduce its exposure to the UK market.</p><p> Trade missions are an essential part of this work.  In the last few days, the Minister, Deputy Creed, has returned from leading the first agrifood trade mission to Indonesia and Malaysia and in the last two years he has led similar, very successful missions to the Gulf region, China, Canada, the United States of America, Mexico, Japan and Korea.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has also been active in this regard and is, in fact, this week leading Irish food and seafood participation in major trade expos in Shanghai and Qingdao in China.</p><p> We are taking other direct, practical actions to support the sector&rsquo;s market diversification efforts, for example, through our seven point market access plan, which includes the allocation of more departmental resources to market access work, an online portal through which essential information across a wide range of markets can be centrally accessed, and the oversight of market access work by a high level committee chaired by an assistant secretary general.</p><p> Turning briefly to the current state of play in the EU-UK negotiations, it is probably an understatement to say that they are at a critical stage and that real challenges still remain.  As I already indicated, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not the lead Department in these negotiations but I can assure the members the Department is engaging closely, through the whole-of-Government structures, to ensure those involved in the negotiations are sensitised to the concerns of the agrifood and fisheries sectors.  I am confident that this is the case.</p><p> In the meantime, the preparedness planning being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is proceeding in accordance with recent Government decisions and in close consultation with other Departments and agencies, as per the whole-of-Government approach to Brexit.  The focus from our perspective is on the staffing, infrastructural and information technology requirements that will arise in the context of the implementation of import controls at ports and airports on an east-west basis under the so-called "central case" scenario.  This envisages no hard border on the island of Ireland, a transition period to the end of 2020, and an EU-UK free trade agreement from 1 January 2021, in accordance with stated UK commitments and red lines.  These requirements are significant, and will arise in respect of the import of live animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin from the UK into Ireland and the EU, once the UK has become a third country, the conditions for which are set out in EU legislation.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that budget 2019 included an allocation of &euro;7 million for the first phase in a process of recruitment of the necessary staff that will run until 2021, as well as for the provision of IT hardware and software.  The Department is also continuing to engage with the Office of Public Works and with other Departments and agencies in relation to the additional physical infrastructure that will be required at ports and airports to provide integrated solutions that will address the requirements of all these bodies.  It is also possible that there could be significant export certification requirements in respect of exports of agrifood and fisheries products to the UK post-Brexit.</p><p> To date and in its most recent published notice on this issue, the UK has indicated that it does not intend to impose export certification requirements.  However, it will require pre-notification of products of animal origin.  It is not clear at this juncture what pre-notification will involve.  The Department has taken a prudent approach by assuming that certification will be required, and has estimated the staffing and IT resources that may be needed to meet any requirements.</p><p> It is also worth pointing out the Department&rsquo;s extensive and ongoing input to the Government&rsquo;s recently launched communications campaign on preparedness, under the heading - Getting Ireland Brexit Ready.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, spoke at the first Brexit outreach event in Cork in early October and the Department and its agencies have facilitated break-out sessions in relation to agrifood and fisheries at all four of these events to date, including that held recently in the Convention Centre in Dublin, which was attended by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</p><p> Notwithstanding the current focus on preparation for the "central case" scenario, which envisages an orderly Brexit taking effect from January 2021, the Department is also considering the potential response that may be necessary in the event of a disorderly Brexit at the end of March 2019.  The focus in this regard will be on the arrangements that will be necessary to fulfil our legal obligations as efficiently as possible while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements.  Similar to the work already undertaken in relation to the "central case" scenario, the Department will be working closely with other Departments in making progress on these arrangements as required over the coming period.</p><p> For fisheries, the Minister&rsquo;s priority has been, and remains, to maintain existing levels of access to waters and resources.  However, in a worst case scenario of a disorderly departure in March 2019, those reciprocal arrangements could be endangered.  Such issues could not, of course, be dealt with in isolation from the overall scenario of a disorderly Brexit, and any measures taken would have to be carefully considered by ourselves in partnership with relevant member states, the task force and stakeholders.</p><p> In conclusion, I hope that I have given the members a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by the agrifood and fisheries sectors as a result of Brexit, as well as a good understanding of the wide breadth of the actions already taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and those that are ongoing.  I and my colleagues are happy to answer any questions the members may have.</p></speech>

When the word and the possibility of tariffs is mentioned it sends a shiver up one's spine.  The UK market, no matter what happens, is always going to be  a market of great importance to us as the UK is our nearest neighbour.  One sees the difficulty our beef business is in at the moment.  Some 48% of our exports are going to the UK.  When we get a few dry days the meat factories are able to cut the price of cattle.</p><p>What they will do regarding tariffs in a post-Brexit scenario is too frightening to contemplate.  One thing is certain, however.  Our beef industry, as we know it, will not survive a scenario where we have hindered access to the UK market.  There is no way our beef industry would be able to sustain any surcharge on our products getting onto UK shelves or into the UK food service industries.</p><p> The Fianna F&aacute;il members present met the Labour Party agricultural spokesman.  In terms of the green impact of all this, climate change is rightly at the centre of all agricultural discussions and many economic discussions.  Some people in the UK believe they can source their food from different parts of the globe and that this will not have no impact in the context of climate change.  This is something that must be put into the mix with respect to every scenario.  If the UK decides to import their food from half way across the world, be it lamb or butter from New Zealand or beef from South America, that will have an impact on climate change and an adverse impact on us.  While the UK has indicated that it will not have export certification, what will happen if standards start to deviate between the UK and the member states of the EU?  The latter probably happen over time with the UK being a non-EU country.  When we were trying to eradicate brucellosis, the standards that obtained in the Six Counties were different from those that operated in the Twenty-six Counties and that definitely delayed the eradication of brucellosis here.  That was just an animal health issue.  If standards deviate, how will we not need to have certification going both ways?</p><p> Regarding Food Wise 2025, with all the various challenges coming down the tracks in the context of Brexit, climate change, Mercosur, etc., it makes a mockery of matters to be even focusing on the targets laid out in that plan.  Farmers' incomes will definitely not be maintained if we try to reach those production targets.  I note from the witnesses' paper that there has been a huge increase exports from 2009 to 2017.  When it is set out in black and white, it can be seen that the increase in production and exports in this country has been massive.  Unfortunately, the primary producer is not experiencing such gain from that.</p><p> There has been much talk about trying to find alternative markets in a post-Brexit scenario.  No analysis has been carried out in respect of the fact that other major agricultural exporters in the EU will also be displaced by that development.   The Danes, the Dutch and even the Poles are major exporters to the UK.  If their access to the UK is hindered, they will be also be trying to find alternative markets.  The Danes are a major exporter of pigmeat to the UK market.  We are logically focusing on how much our products will be displaced but our European counterparts have considerable business with UK.  Has any analysis been done of the level of business that would be lost by the Danes, the Dutch and the Poles post-Brexit?  While the UK would be a major exporter of lamb to France and while there may be some opportunities in that market, there will generally be overwhelming minuses as regards the balance of imports and exports.  That is a matter of concern because those countries are very efficient producers.  If they are looking for alternative markets, it will make Bord Bia's task all the more difficult.</p><p> We have reduced our dependence on the beef sector to just under 50% but that taken a long number of years.  When I sat on the board of Bord Bia, much focus was placed on reducing that dependence.  While such dependence has been reduced, to further reduce it to, for example, 40% would probably involve a decade's work.  Therefore, it is not feasible in a short few months to find alternative markets.</p><p> The British will cite EU bureaucracy as one of their main reasons for exiting.  I note from the Mr. Savage's paper that the paperwork involved for certain individuals and the administrative cost will increases for businesses and the agrifood sector.  Once paperwork is required at points of entry and exit, it will add extra costs and there will be delays.  I saw a recent programme covering the Sweden-Norway border, which is a border we were told was working extremely efficiently but there were extremely long delays along that border.  We can expect a similar, if not worse, scenario.</p><p> A great deal of product is brought from the Six Countries to the South to be processed.  If we have quality assurance under all our various schemes and we operate them under the Twenty-six Counties banner here and if the UK operates different standards, how can such product from the North be brought to the South, processed and sold under our green label, whether it be under the Kerrygold brand, Origin Green or whatever?  If it coming from outside the EU, how can it be marketed under our umbrella if it has not been scrutinised to the same level and does not have to meet the same standards?  A great deal of product, especially on the meat and dairy side, is being brought to the South.  How can Lakeland Dairies, Glanbia or the other co-operatives that process Northern Ireland milk products, with milk possibly being the principal product, put the label Origin Green or Kerrygold on it when it comes from a country that operates standards that are different from the standards under which our product is produced?  We are asking many more questions than we are getting answers.  The whole scenario is frightening to contemplate but the key question is: how this will work in practical terms and how can we make maintain such access?</p></speech>

We are all aware of the issues with Brexit and the difficulties it poses particularly for our agrifood and fisheries sectors.  We need to get into some of the detail of that.  I am concerned about the issue of veterinary standards, particularly between the North and the South.  There is considerable movement of live animals and product across the Border.  What is our level of readiness in the context of two different standards applying and where will that end, so to speak?  How can we protect the very high-quality standards we have reached in order to be able to market our product within the EU?</p> <p>  One of the main objectives the UK is seeking if it leaves the EU is to be able to strike new trade deals around the world and import product from wherever.  How can we know there will not be leakage of that back in here?  That is one of the major concerns.  It relates to the Deputy Cahill's point regarding standards.  Britain has a population of more than 60 million and it has to get food from somewhere.  Currently, we are providing much of that food, particularly in certain categories, especially beef and dairy products.  It would probably take time for the UK to be able replace our products.  Has any assessment been carried out in respect of the timescale we face in that scenario?</p><p>Despite some key Brexiteers thinking they can strike a trade deal and have the ship arriving the following week with the product, in the real world it does not happen like that.  I would be interested to know because in any of these matters, if one as an idea of the timescale, at least one has an idea of how prepared we can be for it.</p><p> From speaking to hauliers, I am conscious that much of the product that moves we export to Britain but also when we are exporting to the Continent, much of it goes through Britain.  Will an arrangement be made?  For instance, if a consignment of foodstuff goes into a container, arrives in Britain, goes across Britain and on to the Continent, will there be some kind of free-pass mechanism for hauliers to be able to do that without checks in the knowledge that their product is not stopping in or being exported to Britain?</p><p> The big issue that faces the fishing sector is, as the officials have outlined, around access to waters.  What happens to British waters will mean that we will face another impact, that is, that all the Dutch, Belgian and Spanish boats that all fish in what will become UK waters will have to go somewhere else.  Clearly, the place where they will go, if they are to stay in the Atlantic, is into waters that would have been traditionally, prior to us becoming part of the Common Market, Irish territorial waters.  Will that put more pressure on us?  In that context, will a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy be required?  Will we need to look at that to see where we stand in respect of quota and everything else?  It will have a significant impact.  As the officials will be aware, many sectors, particularly the small fishing boats and the inland fisheries, are finding it difficult enough to survive, and if there is pressure put on their quota again, it would have a devastating effect on that industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018110600002#G00200"><p>I thank the officials for the detailed, comprehensive presentation.  We are grateful for that but we are probably being grossly unfair to the officials by asking them to engage in crystal ball gazing because it is extremely difficult to figure out what is going on, never mind what will happen when one of the major protagonists does not know what it wishes to achieve.  The British are unable to agree among themselves what they want.  It is difficult.  We can all be a bit flippant, but if one is playing a game and the other side does not know whether it is playing with the wind or against it, one cannot play.</p><p>The officials have set out what has going on at intergovernmental level, at departmental level and at EU level and nobody can claim that there is any ambiguity about our position, what we want and what is absolutely critical in terms of our red lines.  The EU clearly knows what is required.  It has been told often enough at various levels.  Mr. Barnier has been here, as have various other people.  They are clear in terms of there being no Border and various other matters, such as the common travel area.  All of that has been laid out.  We have debated that <i>ad nauseam</i>.  It is no use talking to ourselves.  We have to talk to those who will make decisions.  We are not in a position that we can compel anybody to do anything.  All we can do is make our arguments.  That is the problem.  As Deputy Cahill stated, we spoke to the British Labour Party spokesperson, Mr. Drew, MP.  He is a very bright fellow who knows exactly what goes on and is obviously hopeful, and we are all optimistic, but there is a difference between optimism and realism and that is what this will boil down to.</p><p>Have the officials any views - this is probably an unfair question and they can toss it away if they like - on the prospect of a significant extension of the transition phase which would allow the UK to negotiate those future trade agreements which we want to achieve?  When acting under pressure, sometimes a person is in a position where if he or she does not make concessions he or she looks to be the stubborn one.  Time is important.  In that context, I always go back to the Greenland example.  It took it three years and it had damn all interconnection and only a few hundred agreements.  We have many thousands of agreements with Britain and the EU.  In my view, it does not make sense.  If one wants to do it right, one would take seven to ten years.  I see the transition phase as being desperately important.  That will allow matters to continue with customs and free trade.  That may not suit certain Brexiteers who gave no thought, certainly, to the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland dimension.  I think they have admitted that or certainly they have been exposed in terms of their lack of knowledge of how important that is.</p><p>There must be concern about the possibility of a cheap food policy, to which my colleagues have alluded.  The UK always had an objective of doing something.  It may well be one of the stirring influences as to why it pursued this.  We have heard about and studied  the Brazilian forests that have been razed to permit agricultural animals to be fed in those areas and to bring in food so there is a double whammy there in terms of the carbon food print.  One can add to that the long distance the food has to travel and other issues in terms of the phytosanitary and veterinary regulatory framework on the environment which is of critical importance.  Indeed, as Deputy Martin Kenny alluded to, even the North-South dimension to that is critical.</p><p>In simple terms, we want no hard border on the island of Ireland and no obstacles on the east-west direction.  Of course, it is in the interests of the farming and agricultural sector that on which we are focused that there is the maximum level of access between the EU and the UK.</p><p>I note the Department has been involved in identifying and seeking out potentially profitable markets and opportunities.  The officials mentioned Indonesia.  Are we making any progress in that regard in Malaysia and various other places?  How successful has it been?  Agreements have been reached and various other advances made with some of them.  I suppose there are protocols to be put in place.  Are we any nearer to making inroads in regard to that?</p><p>As Deputy Cahill stated, agricultural products and by-products attract significant tariffs under the WTO, far greater than any other products.  The Deputy is right to start shivering when he hears the word &quot;tariff&quot; because it would be a significant punitive imposition.</p><p>I note the Brexit loan scheme was rolled out and evaluated by the Commission but, of course, its evaluation looked at the matter in terms of whether it constituted a state aid.  It is time that some of those Commission officials, many of whom are faceless bureaucrats, cop on.  They would want to start relaxing the rules a little.  Here is a situation not of our making and if the people, through the Oireachtas, try to help out industries that are being threatened by this new market environment, there should be something there.  Has any thought been given by the Department to the Mercosur threat in terms of a post-Brexit scenario and the impact that will have on trade policy in the future?</p></speech>

There is no point in me going over old water.  We all know how unique this situation is and how precarious the negotiations are.  In a nutshell, the words "Nobody knows" encapsulates it.  With that in mind, I will tease out further a few items in the report and I will ask for some indications.</p> <p>  I appreciate that in this situation we must prepare for every possible outcome.  With regard to preparedness, the officials seemed to focus their presentation on budgetary allocations.</p><p>I am not being critical but want to tease things out further.  The one budget allocation of which I am very aware is the 2018 low-interest Brexit preparedness loan but we have now learned that the first funds will not be drawn down until January 2019, only two months before the Brexit date.  What is the position with regard to the other budgetary expenditure areas?  If they are all in the same boat as that one, we are not going to be prepared.  I ask the witnesses to outline the Department's preparedness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>time rather than budgetary allocations or aspirational preparations.  How close are we to being ready to face whatever meets us at the end of March, particularly with regard to the possibility of a hard Brexit?  <br/><br/>The witnesses have referred to the losses that might be incurred by our fishermen in the event of a hard Brexit and an inability to access British waters.  At the same time, fishermen in the UK would lose their access to the greater European waters.  How are we preparing for that, in terms of policing our own waters, for example?  Has much thought or preparation been put into that?  <br/><br/>A lot of emphasis is being put on sourcing new markets as a way of getting us over the bridge.  Food Wise 2025 makes reference to increasing our exports by 50% from their 2017 levels but we will have to source a lot of additional markets to achieve that, even without Brexit.  How much work has been done on finding new markets because we would need to travel the world over to achieve the Food Wise targets, apart altogether from Brexit?<br/><br/>We are preparing for the worst while hoping for the best.  If we do get the best, namely a soft or good Brexit with which the Department and the agriculture sector is happy, if world markets do not read it as a good Brexit for Britain and the British economy and sterling takes another nosedive that will have a devastating effect in terms of us trying to hold onto our British markets.  Have preparations been made for that possibility?</p></speech>

A lot of work has been done to develop and build alliances around Europe to try to minimise the effect on the CAP budget.  Where are we in that regard at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Savage" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018110600002#H00300"><p>I will go through the questions in the order in which they were put and will defer to colleagues where appropriate.  In response to Deputy Cahill, the prospect of tariffs is both difficult and unwelcome.  As I said in my opening statement, in addition to the exposure of the sector to the UK market itself in terms of the volume of trade, we also face the likelihood of a further negative impact by virtue of the fact that the tariffs are highest in the agrifood sector.  That is an extra hurdle and an extra immediate impact that we will see in the event of tariffs becoming a reality, which is more likely to happen in the context of a hard Brexit.  These are difficulties that we have foreseen for some time and that is why we have said, in the context of our discussions with member states and with the EU institutions, that we want to have a situation in the future that is as close as possible to the current trading arrangements.  In terms of the future relationship, we want to see continued access to the UK market without tariffs and with minimal other impingements in terms of customs and administrative procedures.  Our preference is for a non-tariff outcome.  That has also been reflected in the EU's own negotiating guidelines.  The most recent guidelines from the Commission have set out the fact that when we look at what is known as the central case scenario, the Commission has undertaken to engage with the UK over the period as it evolves its position.  In terms of the red lines that are set out, the basis of a future relationship will be a free trade agreement, essentially.  There will be a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK and that is what the EU will be working on.  That agreement will be based on no tariffs or quantitative limits on products.  There is a realisation on everyone's part that ultimately, we do not want to have an outcome that will have a negative impact on trade.  We do not want to see the advent of what would be serious tariffs for the agrifood sector.  That is informing the approach and the Commission has taken the view that if we are going to operate on the basis of the red lines that have been set out by the UK, that confines us to a free trade agreement negotiation with no tariffs or quantitative limitations.  That is the broad framework of the negotiation arrangements at the moment.</p> <p>  The issues of the green impact, climate change and the UK seeking to import products from other parts of the world are key concerns.  The climate change impact can be viewed as a knock-on issue in terms of the outcome of the Brexit process.  We have been acutely aware of this issue in the context of our own engagement with the Commission on trade agreements with third countries and the EU 28.  In the context of products coming from distant markets, we are concerned with the impact of production processes and long-distance transport on emissions, particularly as our domestic production processes are relatively carbon efficient.  We are very aware of these issues and are focusing on minimising the risks from UK trade agreements with third countries.  That said, our primary focus is on the economic and regulatory impacts of products that are produced to different standards coming into the EU after Brexit.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked, in the context of export specifications, what will happen if standards deviate.  In such a scenario, there will be a need for greater controls in the movement of goods between the two jurisdictions.  On Brexit day plus one, the two blocs will be operating on the basis of the same regulatory environment, but if standards deviate over time that increases the risk of and potential need for import controls.  That is informing our position and we want to try to have arrangements in the future that are as close as possible to those prevailing currently.  That also feeds into the preparedness debate in terms of having the relevant structures in place for import controls and, potentially, export certification if the UK decides to go that route.  The UK has said in the past that it wants to have a common rule book in terms of how products will move back and forward between the UK and the EU but it qualified those remarks subsequently by referring to different kinds of regulatory alignment or divergence, depending on circumstances.  It might keep to alignment in the case of smoothing movement through borders but it might look for divergence in other areas.  Once we get into looking at divergence in other areas then we are talking about a greater need for control on movements between the two jurisdictions.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to Food Wise 2025 and whether the targets therein are relevant any more.  Some have argued that Brexit is a game changer and that Food Wise 2025 should be reconsidered in that context but the Department and the sector generally has made a deliberate decision not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  A wide range of actions are being implemented under Food Wise 2025, some of which are key and necessary in the context of our response to Brexit.</p><p>We will focus on those.  That is why the high level implementation committee is now looking at Brexit as a standard item on its agenda.  There is an increased focus on the kinds of follow-up measures that are necessary to deal with Brexit in the broader context of Food Wise 2025 being implemented.  It is not a case of saying the targets are not relevant anymore.  It is also worth pointing out in the context of Food Wise 2025 there is a focus on how we are doing things.  It is not so much about the headline targets.  In Food Harvest we talked a lot about targets for increasing production.  In Food Wise it is more about how we do things.  It is about sustainability underpinning everything we do.  It is about using human capital, focusing on competitiveness, developing markets and bringing innovation to bear on the sector so we can develop new products and generate new possibilities in new markets.  There is very much a focus on how to do things.  The gist of Food Wise is if we do all those things and apply all those principles and implement them effectively, there is no reason we cannot see growth projections of the kind we have said, which is &euro;19 billion in exports by 2025.  That is the right approach.  It is being done in conjunction with the sector.  There is a conscious effort to try to focus on the specific requirements we need to put into place in response to Brexit.</p><p> Alternative markets and other producers being displaced were mentioned and so was our own beef sector.  A question was asked about the impact on the broader European market of products from different member states being displaced as a result of Brexit.  It is true and it is a point we have emphasised in the context of our discussions with member states.  We have been doing a lot of work over the past 18 months to two years.  The Minister has met most of his colleagues formally in bilateral meetings in capitals and in informal Council meetings of agriculture Ministers.  We have stressed the point.  From an Irish perspective, it is not just about the bilateral trading relationship that each of the individual member states may have, particularly those in north-western Europe that have close trading relationships with the UK.  It is about the broader knock-on impact on markets generally and, from our point of view, on the European beef market.  We have 250,000 to 270,000 tonnes of beef going to the UK that will now look for another home.  If the first choice of another home is an EU member state, it will have a destabilising effect across the entire European market.  We have talked to other member states.  They have come to the realisation that it is something that affects their own sectors.  Poland exports a lot of poultry to the UK, and when we mention that to its representatives in the context of the beef market, they could see it is an issue that could give rise to concerns for them also.  There is a danger.  There is a shared appreciation among member states that it is a potential impact if we do not get the right outcome and if product is being diverted from the UK market.  That is why we have asked for the kind of outcome we have and why we have taken the approach of trying to achieve arrangements that are as close as possible to those that prevail.  </p><p> If one is looking at destabilisation or changes in the European market and if one looks at the efforts we have been making over the past number of years to try to develop other potential markets, our focus has been on non-EU markets.  There has been much attention focused on third countries in Asia, America, Canada, Mexico and other areas.  We are trying to follow up on EU trade agreements with Japan, Korea, Mexico and Canada.  We very much tried to develop those markets in response to and following up on progress that has been made by the Commission on free trade agreements.  Our focus is very much beyond Europe in terms of the possibilities and growth opportunities that are there.  It is very much a focus of Food Wise 2025 to try to reduce the potential impact on that front.  It is not done overnight and it requires quite a long investment of time and effort.  That effort is ongoing.  We are hopeful it can continue to bear fruit.  </p><p> In terms of costs to businesses and the sector, costs and delays at borders were referred to.  We are trying to keep the trading arrangements close to the current ones.  The point of doing that is to try to minimise the costs or delays that might be associated with the movement of goods.  Whatever trading arrangement there is in the future, it will not be the same as what we have now in the customs union and Single Market so there will be inevitable frictions that are not there at the moment.  All of our efforts are focused on trying to minimise those and bring about arrangements that are as close as possible to those that prevail.  </p><p> Processing and the movement of product from North to South was mentioned.  A question was asked about the difficulties if the EU operates different standards and what the difficulties or impediments might be in terms of North-South movement.  It came up again in another question.  In the context of the current state of the negotiations, we are very much focused on achieving and agreeing a backstop in the context of allowing the withdrawal agreement to take shape and move into the next phase.  The focus is on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  The discussions on the backstop are aimed at doing that.  We are operating on the basis there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland in accordance with the commitments the UK has already given.  That means we will have a common regulatory area on the island so the movement of product from North to South will continue as it does in the context of that common regulatory area being in place as a result of the backstop being in place.  In that context, if the backstop is working and if we have that common regulatory function, those issues do not arise with regard to frictions in terms of North-South movement.  </p><p> That covered a little bit of Deputy Kenny's question on veterinary standards North and South and animals and products going up and down and what will happen if there are different standards.  The reason for the focus on the backstop is to provide assurance on the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  If we have that and a common regulatory area in place, it avoids the divergence between the situations North and South.</p><p> Deputy Kenny also asked about the UK trade deals and the idea of leakage into the EU.  That happens on a couple of fronts.  There is the issue of the economic impact of trade deals that might be done with third countries with product coming in more competitively than might be the case in terms of Irish exports.  There is a second element which is if product is coming into the UK from third countries, it raises issues with regard to standards and controls that might be required in terms of UK trade with the rest of the EU.  The more we have products which may be produced to a different standard coming into the UK, the more divergence there is between the UK and the EU and us which then gives rise to the potential for further import controls.  It is a possibility.  That is why we have sought to have the minimisation of those customs and administrative procedures as well as minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.  </p><p> UK food deficiency was mentioned.  It will have to get it from somewhere.  There is an issue with how much time it will take for the UK to produce a product it is getting from Ireland or to get it from elsewhere.  I do not think any specific assessment has been done of precisely how long it might take or what the likely developments in that area will be.  At present, the UK is about 60% self-sufficient in food.  It is importing a lot of food from other countries, including Ireland.  As part of our approach, we are very committed to making sure the relationships we have in place in terms of trade with the UK continue after Brexit.  There will be changes regardless of what happens here.  Hopefully we will avoid tariffs and there will not be any limitations in terms of traded volumes.  We are also trying to minimise the other non-tariff related restrictions or frictions that might also arise.  We hope relationships continue.  There is a lot of work being done by Bord Bia and others on advising companies on how to maintain customer relationships with UK counterparts.  The continuation of those relationships will be much easier if we can achieve what we want here which is a tariff free and volume free trading arrangement into the future.  The prospects are much better if we can get that.</p><p> Hauliers were mentioned and how the land bridge to the EU might operate and what sorts of checks or facilitation there might be.  We are acutely aware of the land bridge issue.  It will potentially have a significant impact.  Many Irish agrifood exports to the EU are going via the UK land bridge.  There is good reason for that in terms of short shelf life and the perishability of products.  The journey times across the UK to those continental markets are much shorter using the land bridge than would be the case in the event of direct sea transfer.  It would be up to three times longer in some cases.  It is crucial to try to make sure the land bridge continues to function effectively.  There are two dimensions to that.  One is what we can do from an EU perspective in terms of facilitating the movement and smooth transit of goods at either end of that journey.</p><p>There is also the issue of how the journey of products across the United Kingdom will be facilitated.  We have been engaging with the Commission initially and other member states on how those arrangements might work.  Obviously, much will depend on what the United Kingdom does.  It has indicated its intention and is formally going through the process of joining the customs transit convention, or common transit convention, which allows for smoother, more electronically based movement of product across the UK between two member states.  The fact that it has committed to that arrangement means the prospects for limited intrusion or interference with product going across the landbridge are improved.  However, we will have to engage with the UK on how that will work.  From our point of view in the EU, we are looking at how we can facilitate product coming from other member states across the landbridge into Ireland at our ports here.  We are looking at arrangements that would facilitate that and the extent to which other member states could work along the same lines in terms of facilitating our exports across the landbridge.  It is a key issue from our point of view.  It is addressed in the exit negotiations because the European guidelines acknowledge the unique difficulties relating to the geographic location of Ireland.  It is being considered in that context and that is why it is under discussion.</p><p> On fisheries, Deputy Martin Kenny raised the issue of access to waters and the effect on Irish waters if that is lost.  I think the Deputy was referring to extra fishing or greater fishing effort being displaced into Irish waters.  He mentioned the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  We are acutely aware of the overall concerns relating to access to waters.  The Commission has been linking the issue of access to waters with the broader trade and future relationship negotiations.  That is what we will continue to do.  We will seek a solution through those overall discussions rather than allow the fisheries issue to be treated as a separate issue outside the negotiations.  We are aware of it.  Among the issues in question are access to waters, the sharing of fish stocks and the impact of increased fishing effort in Irish waters.  We are trying to avoid a negative outcome on those issues and to maintain the sharing arrangements currently in place.  Ms Kelly may comment further on this issue when I have finished my initial response.</p><p> Deputy Penrose asked what I agree may be an unfair question on the prospects for the extension of a transition period.  It is difficult to call at this stage.  We are operating in a very uncertain environment.  I would rather not comment on the prospects for an extension of a transition agreement.  It will depend on how the negotiations evolve in the coming weeks and months.  We hope that the transition period will be as long as is necessary to agree on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  As the Deputy stated, it can take a considerable period of time to agree trade agreements or arrangements.  We do not know how long it will take to agree this complex agreement because we are trying to disentangle one party from a trading arrangement and that has not been done before.  I do not know what are the prospects for an extension of the transition period.  We all hope that we can get things done in the time available to us.</p><p> Deputy Penrose also mentioned concerns in regard to cheap food policy and the effect on standards of imports from third countries.  I have responded on that key issue.  We want to avoid it because of its potential to intensify or increase the implications in terms of controls.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the Department and Ministers opening up markets and the success of trade missions.  There has been some progress recently in the development of markets as a follow-up to trade missions.  We combine political, business and economic components in trade missions.  Often, progress is facilitated by the high-level political contacts which are engaged in on trade missions.  For instance, developing political relationships is particularly important in China.  We have visited China frequently in recent years and that has helped us develop relationships which have led to trade possibilities.  The Chinese market opened for beef this year as a result of many years of engagement with the Chinese authorities as well as strategically placed trade missions to try to push those agendas forward at crucial times, particularly when there is a political dimension to the discussions.</p><p> A point I mentioned earlier and wish to emphasise is that we very consciously tailor and examine our trade missions in the context of European Commission engagement with various trading blocks and countries around the world.  The Commission is trying to push ahead with a more open trading agenda and develop possibilities and reduce market access obstacles in various markets.  We have tried to follow on from that.  In recent years, as members will have seen, trade agreements have been reached with Korea, Japan and Canada, as I mentioned.  We have followed up on those agreements.  Trade missions led by the Minister and involving a large number of agrifood companies have tried to establish partnerships with companies in those sectors of those economies to try to leverage what the Commission achieved in free trade agreements.  We have made a conscious effort to try to target the areas of potential.  In addition, a significant amount of money has been invested in Bord Bia in recent years to fund market development activities, particularly in the context of Brexit.  A Bord Bia study examined which markets we should prioritise in terms of potential across various sectors, including seafood, meat, dairy and prepared consumer foods.  It came back with a market prioritisation report which identified 15 key markets across each of those product categories where there is significant potential for us to get in and develop the markets.  It is now conducting a deeper dive into five key markets in each of those sectors on which we can focus a greater amount of resources to try to develop possibilities.  We are using the available data, the analysis and the research of Bord Bia, combined with what is going on at Commission level, and using those to target our trade mission destinations.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the issue of tariffs which I addressed in response to Deputy Cahill.</p><p> Deputy Penrose referred to the Mercosur threat.  We are taking it very seriously.  As members are aware, for many years we have been fighting any development on Mercosur, particularly an agreement or tariff rate cut on beef.  In the context of the Commission's work, we continue to emphasise the very serious implications Mercosur would have for the Irish and European beef sectors.  We remind the Commission and others not just of the threat that arises from Mercosur, but also the broader context of the cumulative impact of concessions that the EU has made or is considering across a range of trade areas and agreements in which it is currently involved.  We view Mercosur as a serious threat and continue to oppose it.  We continue to insist that it is taken account of in the negotiations.  As members are aware, there has been something of a hiatus in the negotiations recently, related to the Brazilian elections and other matters, but we continue to make that point in the context of the negotiations.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly addressed the issue of preparedness and budgetary allocations.  I think he asked about the &euro;25 million made available in budget 2018 and the impact of various measures.  As stated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that allocation has been incorporated in the future growth scheme that will come into place in early 2019.  It is a new product and arrangement which has backing from the European Investment Fund and is being operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  There have been several players and steps in the process of getting that product into place which are now coming together.  We expect it to be in place in early 2019.</p><p> On the direct impact of or follow-up on other schemes, the &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme announced in budget 2017 is now fully subscribed by farmers and others availing of the opportunities it provided.  In 2018, we had the joint &euro;300 million loan scheme run by our Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>That was launched formally in March of this year and it is in progress.  Companies are applying for loans as part of it and approvals are ongoing.  Effectively, we had a fully subscribed scheme from 2017.  There is an operational scheme in place processing loans for companies as a result of the 2018 allocation.  The &euro;25 million we talked about will come on stream as part of the future growth loan scheme in early 2019.</p><p> Reference was made to fisheries and to the United Kingdom losing access.  I covered this in an earlier answer.  Reference was made to policing or patrolling our own waters.  I might ask Ms Josephine Kelly to comment on that if she wants.  Again, it is a matter of the resources that we would require to deal with whatever happens as a result of Brexit.</p><p> On new markets, I was asked about Food Wise 2025,  the ambitions in this regard and the amount of emphasis we are putting on the programme.  I probably covered that in my earlier response.  We are putting a lot of effort into it.  There is a market prioritisation exercise by Bord Bia and there are trade missions.  I mentioned in my opening statement the fact that we now have a market access portal in the Department.  On the Department's website, companies and exporters can examine the requirements and issues they have to deal with in gaining access to different markets.  That is the practical follow-up we are doing in conjunction with some of the more high-profile stuff that occurs on trade missions.</p><p> On the query about a soft Brexit and whether a fall in the value of sterling, which could fall in any case, would have a big impact.  It may well have a big impact.  In the short term, we have been focusing in our base response on dealing with the impact of the fall in the value of sterling against the euro.  I do not know the extent of the fall or the impact after Brexit.  It may take time to see that impact but it is important that we be ready to try to respond to the sterling fluctuations in the same way as we have done over the past two years.  It difficult predict the currency movements.  One could argue a soft Brexit might have the opposite effect and strengthen sterling.  I do not know.  Markets might decide it is a good outcome from a UK perspective also, and it might have a limited or no impact.  We will have to see how this develops.  Our track record on responding to these kinds of changes is pretty strong.</p><p> The Chairman asked about the hole in the CAP budget and the position on that.  I have not been as closely in touch with my colleagues on the CAP side and the negotiations on the direction of the reform, or the multi-annual financial framework discussions.  There have been discussions on how the hole might be filled.  We and the Minister have indicated readiness to contribute more to the CAP budget, obviously in regard to securing future funding.  There is a debate on this ongoing at member state level in the context of the multi-annual financial framework.  I am not entirely sure about the current progress in that debate but our position on it is clear, certainly in terms of where we are going.</p></speech>

Many of the items have been covered, and I have read the comprehensive submission.  When I came in, Mr. Savage was responding to one of my colleagues on concerns raised about Food Wise 2025.  Is there a threat to it?  Mr. Savage acknowledged a serious threat from Mercosur, which has to be dealt with and which is ongoing.</p> <p>  I did not hear Mr. Savage mention anything about steps we might be required to take in regard to climate action.  This is very pressing.  We have a special committee at which delegates tell us we should be reducing the size of our national herd, etc.  It is a matter of having some interface between the two positions.  Is it correct that since Mr. Savage is dealing with an imminent and urgent situation as regards Brexit and its potential impact on agriculture and food trade, considerations on climate action and how it might have ramifications for beef production in particular are a luxury?  My question on Mercosur has already been asked.</p></speech>

I will not necessarily go back over those unless there was a specific question.  On Food Wise 2025, the point I was making was that it is not a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water.  Brexit is obviously a great challenge for the sector but we are still intent on applying the principles in Food Wise 2025 to the development and growth of the sector.  We still talking about applying the principles we talked about in terms of innovation, competitiveness and human capital and about underpinning these with sustainability.  Our focus will be on the actions necessary to deal with Brexit.  We are not talking about having a new strategy but just tailoring-----</p></speech>

I am not saying things cannot be worked through.  I am talking about demands coming from certain quarters in respect of agricultural production, including beef and dairy production.  Mr. Savage did not mention that whole blend.  The impact on Food Wise 2025 has often been asked about at this committee.</p></speech>

It is slightly outside my personal brief.  I am certainly focused on Brexit, its impact and what it means for the sector.  That is very much the focus in terms of the practical response also.  To make a general comment, I certainly do not agree that climate change considerations are somehow secondary and suddenly have been relegated in the context of how we envisage the development of the sector.  Individuals throughout the sector, and certainly officials in the Department and the Minister, are acutely aware of the challenges and the need to balance development plans for the sector with our climate action responsibilities.</p> <p>  Food Wise 2025 is underpinned at every turn by the need to ensure sustainability in the way we go about our food production.  That will continue to inform the process and what we are doing on the ground in terms of the development of the sector.  One could not say that climate change aspects have suddenly been relegated.  The climate change challenges still face us and we have to meet the two objectives.  We say very clearly, in the context of Food Wise 2025, that sustainability and development go hand in hand.  One cannot have one without the other.  One needs the economic development of the sector but it has to be underpinned by sustainability, not least because consumers all over the world are looking for assurance on the sustainability of our production methods and the extent to which we can stand over claims about our sustainability.  We understand that and the competition that exists between the two objectives.  We do not see the two as mutually exclusive because they have to go hand in hand.  The climate challenge is not being relegated in any way in our minds.  We are still doing a lot of work as a Department on trying to push that agenda forward.  Obviously, my concentration is on Brexit and its impact but it would not be fair to say we are relegating climate considerations while we focus purely on the Brexit response.</p></speech>

I am policy officer with BirdWatch Ireland and have a bachelor's degree in environmental science from NUIG and a master's degree in environmental biology from Utrecht University.  I have been working in environmental policy since 2012.  In a fisheries context I have been working on the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy for several years.  I sit on EU-level stakeholder forums such as the North Western Waters Advisory Council.<br/><br/>The EU&rsquo;s reformed Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, entered into force in January 2014.  The political agreement between the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament reflected the will of EU citizens that European fisheries policy needed radical reform.  This new dawn in EU fisheries policy was underpinned by overwhelming evidence and wide consensus that overfishing must end, and that the failure to do so would have grave consequences for the fishing industry, the marine environment and the food supply chain.  The announcement marked the culmination of a process which began in 2009 with extensive public consultations.<br/><br/>In practical terms ending overfishing really means that when decision makers like the Commission and fisheries Ministers agree the fishing limits for a given fish stock, the upper limit of fishing is set at a sustainable level advised by the best available scientific advice.  Typically, advice on fishing limits is supplied by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, a global organisation of 5,000 scientists from over 690 marine institutes in 20 member countries that develop science and advice to support the sustainable use of the oceans.  In an Irish context ICES works in tandem with staff from the Marine Institute to provide scientific advice on the management of fish stocks.<br/><br/>Within the CFP the upper point at which fishing limits must be set is called the maximum sustainable yield, MSY.  Maximum sustainable yield is the maximum yield or catch that can be taken from a fish stock over time without depleting the size of the fish population.  At this point the population can replace the fish which are taken from the stock.  Above this point more fish are removed than can be replaced and the size of the stock reduces over time.  This results in a smaller population, which means less fish for fishermen to catch.  The fewer fish there are the harder it becomes to find and catch them, reducing the profitability of fishing.  If a stock is overfished it may become severely depleted and may even collapse.<br/><br/>The ongoing recovery of sea cod in Irish waters is a positive example of how, when we take positive action to reduce fishing pressure, even severely depleted fish stocks can start to recover.  Sea cod in Irish waters has gone from having a catch advice of zero tonnes from 2000 to 2017 to catch advice of 695 tonnes in 2018.<br/><br/>Ending overfishing or ensuring that fishing limits are not greater than the maximum sustainable yield is not an environmental or conservation objective <i>per se</i>.  It is a fisheries management and economic objective which will secure the best economic, social and environmental outcomes for fishers and EU citizens.  This position is supported by the Irish programme for Government which states that the sea that surrounds our island is our greatest natural resource and that developing the potential of the blue economy will be a priority for the Government.  The implementation of the CFP, which the Government has recognised as forward looking and progressive, is seen as being integral to the realisation of this objective.  In line with the CFP the Government has committed to, &quot;setting quotas at Maximum Sustainable Yield and on a scientific basis, implementing the obligation to land, and an effective system of Regional decision making.&quot;<br/><br/>I will now deal with overfishing in the EU and the December AGRIFISH Council.  Within the CFP, Article 2.2 requires that fish stocks are restored to levels that can support the maximum sustainable yield, &quot;by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.&quot;  The EU has already failed to meet the 2015 deadline and with just over a year remaining before the 2020 deadline it is critical that the Irish Government follows scientific advice in upcoming negotiations.<br/><br/>Every December fisheries Ministers like Ireland&rsquo;s Minister, Deputy Creed, meet in Brussels to negotiate fishing limits for the north-east Atlantic for the year ahead.  According to the New Economics Foundation, NEF, which has analysed December Council decisions between 2001 and 2017, on average seven out of every ten fishing limits set by member states were above the limits advised by scientists.  While the percentage by which the levels of total allowable catch, TAC, were set above advice declined throughout this period, the proportion of TACs set above advice did not.<br/><br/>One of the NEF&rsquo;s conclusions was that &quot;Member States are the main drivers of overfishing, either because they are actively pushing for fishing limits to be set above scientific advice or they are failing to prevent it.&quot;  In its opinion recurring issues identified within past negotiations which drive overfishing include: a lack of transparency in the negotiations; decision making based on short-termism; effective lobbying from industry; and perverse competition between member states.<br/><br/>During last year&rsquo;s December Council fisheries Ministers continued to agree fishing limits for 2018 that were above the scientific advice.  Of the fishing limits analysed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, 44% were set exceeding the scientific advice.  This is, however, a reduction from 54% set exceeding advice in 2017 and 57% set exceeding advice in 2016.<br/><br/>Another report commissioned by the Pew Charitable Trusts shows that while the extent to which fish stocks are being overfished improved between 2013 and 2017, the number of overfished stocks remains too high.  This is in line with the findings of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, which found that while stock status has significantly improved in the north-east Atlantic, progress has slowed in the last few years and many stocks remain overfished and-or outside safe biological limits.  In its opinion the progress that has been achieved seems too slow to ensure that all stocks will be rebuilt to MSY by 2020.<br/><br/>Based on the NEF&rsquo;s assessments of EU December Councils between 2001 and 2017, it is clear that Ireland has historically played a negative role in the negotiations.  For 2018 Ireland was the country with the highest percentage of fishing quotas in excess of scientific advice.  Ireland was involved in decisions that allow fishing at 18% above maximum sustainable yield.  The United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed fishing limits at 15%, 8% and 8%, respectively, above advice.<br/><br/>The UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark were the worst offenders in terms of the total tonnage of fishing limits set above advice.  According to the NEF, Ministers representing these member states have received the largest quota increases above advice in terms of tonnes and are therefore the most responsible for impeding the transition to sustainable fisheries in the EU.</p><p>Ireland has negotiated a fishing quota for 2018 which is over 31,000 tonnes above scientific advice.  This now means that Ireland has received a total fishing quota of over 700,000 tonnes above scientific advice since 2001.  Ireland now must surely be considered among the worst offenders when it comes to the percentage of fishing limits set above scientific advice, having in the previous two years also ranked worst and joint worst.<br/><br/>As in previous years the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, celebrated the fact that he had been able to secure Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry the right to overfish in 2018, stating:</p><blockquote>The total &euro;152 million value of the whitefish quotas secured for the Irish fishing fleet amounts to an 8% increase in value from last year and a 3% increase in volume.  I am satisfied that this is a good and balanced result overall.</blockquote><p>Much of the economic debate relating to Common Fisheries Policy reform has in the past focused on the short-term economic cost of reducing fishing pressure and transitioning to maximum sustainable yield rather than on the economic benefits of reaching MSY.  This is clearly apparent in the Government's submissions to the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals on fishing opportunities over recent years.  The Government's economic arguments are based on the sustainability impact assessments prepared by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  These assessments only calculate the cost of quota reductions for the year ahead and fail to consider the medium to long term economic gains of achieving MSY.  This evidence, according to the New Economics Foundation, is methodologically weak as it omits cost reductions, quota uptake, and price elasticities. <br/><br/>Fish can be one of Ireland's and the EU&rsquo;s greatest renewable resources if managed correctly.  Aside from their innate value as living things and fundamental components of marine ecosystems, fish can provide multiple benefits to society in the form of food, revenue and jobs.  Overfishing results in smaller catches, lower revenues and fewer jobs.  As the World Bank has put it, &ldquo;biological overfishing has led to economic overfishing, which creates economic losses.&rdquo;  MSY, from an economic standpoint, must be the goal we strive for if we wish to achieve the point of greatest economic return.  Fishing at or below MSY levels which deliver sustainable catches is a precondition to landing more fish.  According to the World Bank, globally fisheries accrued an economic loss of about $83 billion in 2012, compared with what could have been generated by managing fisheries in line with scientific advice.  From an EU perspective it is estimated that in 2015, by failing to exploit fish stocks below MSY, the EU caused a total loss of 8.6 million tonnes of catch and &euro;7.1 billion in revenues over the previous five-year period.<br/><br/>The economic benefits relative to 2012-2014 of rebuilding EU fish stocks to MSY could provide Ireland with an additional 200,000 tonnes of fish landings annually.  This would generate an additional &euro;270 million in earnings, potentially supporting 2,200 new jobs.  Based on the Scientific, Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries most recent annual economic assessment of EU fisheries the revenue generated by fisheries in the north-east Atlantic in 2016 was estimated at &euro;2.66 billion, an increase of 8% from 2015, with the Irish fleet generating &euro;265 million.  The net profit generated by the EU fleet was estimated at &euro;417 million, an 84% increase on 2015.  The recovery of some fish stocks is one important factor in the positive outlook for the sector.  In this context the arguments which have been made in the past of the economic cost of transitioning to MSY are less convincing. <br/><br/>The positive outlook for the sector means that there can be no excuses in delaying our legal obligations. The economic benefits of rebuilding fish stocks will accrue even in the short-term due to the increased profitability of greater catches and the reduced costs of catching more abundant stocks.  Now is an ideal time to take the steps necessary to achieve compliance with the CFP.  The sooner we transition to MSY the sooner we can enjoy the economic benefits.  2018 will be a critical year for the CFP.  Given that the 2020 deadline to end overfishing is just over a year away, this year&rsquo;s upcoming fisheries negotiations will play a critical role in realising the goals of the CFP.<br/><br/>Every two years EU fisheries Ministers negotiate the total allowable catches for deep sea stocks.  This November the TACs for 2019 and 2020 will be agreed.  In effect, this means that this November's negotiation will be the CFP&rsquo;s deadline for these stocks.  Ireland&rsquo;s main interest in the November Council is achieving quota for deep sea fish so that we can trade it with France and Spain in exchange for other fish quota.  Ireland receives quota for five deep sea species and six different stocks.  Of these stocks four have been overfished for many years and one has zero catch advice for 2019-20.  Fishing for orange roughy is prohibited since the collapse of the stock in 2002.  The Irish fishing industry does not target deep sea fish stocks. The Government needs to set deep sea fishing limits in line with scientific advice in November for 2019 and 2020.  The failure to do so will ensure that the EU will fail to meet its 2020 objective to end overfishing a year out from the deadline. <br/><br/>Every year in December EU fisheries Ministers set the TACs for the majority of commercial EU fish species.  Last year, 124 TAC decisions were made or confirmed at this meeting. These negotiations are not public; only their outcomes are.  This lack of transparency means that Ministers are not on the hook when they ignore scientific advice and give priority to short-term interests that risk the health of fish stocks.  The Government must negotiate fishing limits for 2019 which are compatible with achieving the CFP&rsquo;s 2020 deadline.  BirdWatch Ireland asks that the members of the committee raise these concerns with the Minister when he presents the Government's sustainability impact assessment of the EU Commission proposal this November.</p></speech>

My knowledge of this issue was severely lacking until I met him a month or six weeks ago.  He has presented a very detailed and comprehensive paper to us.  It is very thought-provoking, and he expresses a lot of knowledge of the topic.  We thank him for that.</p> <p>  Some of the points made by Mr. Kelly are at odds with what we understood to be the position.  I am old enough to remember Mark Clinton and Michael O'Kennedy as Ministers for agriculture.  Their job was to come home with the beef, to use a euphemism, and if they did not they were slated at domestic level.  It was a triumph if they came home with allowances for increases in catch and potential catches and agreements on the price of milk which might amount to two pence per gallon at the time.  </p> <p>  I do not want to misquote Mr. Kelly.  Have we ignored well formulated scientific advice over a long period of time?  Have we acted contrary to that advice?  Have we failed to comply with our legal obligations?  We are generally brought before the European Court of Justice, ECJ, if that is the case, or alternatively an infringement procedure of some description is initiated at EU level by the Commission or another body.    </p> <p>  Is the witness suggesting that the measures, in the context of economic arguments prepared by BIM which were based on the sustainability impact assessment, are not sufficient or are deficient, and are in fact unbalanced because they fail to take into account the counter-arguments on sustainability the witness has made?  He has said that the greater the level of sustainability achieved the better the opportunity for fishermen to harvest more fish and achieve a greater output, resulting in an increased income.  I may well be misinterpreting the witness; if I am he can correct me.  </p> <p>  Is it the case, as Mr. Kelly has argued, that the Government has breached its commitments on MSY in the CFP?  I have no degree of expertise in this area, so I ask Mr. Kelly to forgive me for asking questions he may think are irrelevant or simple.  Do I understand it that the MSY is, in effect, a very good management tool that could lead to a significant increase in income for fishermen, as opposed to the current system?  While it appears that there has been some improvement in TAC over the last five years, how much more does Mr. Kelly believe can be achieved?  What should the Minister do when setting the TAC?</p><p>What can the Department do to assess the TACs?  Mr. Kelly said November is the critical month and that is why he is here.  He is concerned about the lack of transparency in how the TACs are set and the deliberative process in which the Department engages in achieving them.  He wants to see how they are formulated in respect of the overall CFP and, in particular, how they relate to the MSY.  Am I correct in saying there is a correlation between the two?   What questions should we raise with the Minister when he comes before the committee to present the sustainability impact assessment?</p></speech>

As a nation and an island, how does Ireland compare with other member states on breaches of the maximum sustainable yields?  It might be somewhat ironic that a politician is asking this question, but how is it the case that the Minister negotiated an increase with the same body that sets the maximum sustainable yield?  On the one hand, this organisation sets the 2020 target, yet our Minister can negotiate an increase in our yield which breaches the aforementioned target.  As I said, I accept that a politician is asking the question and perhaps it should be the other way around, but I am interested in Mr. Kelly's opinion as someone who has studied the matter extensively.</p></speech>

As Deputy Penrose said, the Minister attends meetings of the committee every November and is due to attend on 27 November on this matter.  As Mr. Kelly rightly pointed out in his detailed presentation, unless there was significant improvement in the quota achieved, it was seen as a defeat, which seems to be completely at odds with what he is saying here and what we were told over time.  When the Minister and his officials appear at the end of November, we need to ask clear and specific questions on this issue.  Will Mr. Kelly highlight some of them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Kelly" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018110600002#O00400"><p>I am not used to this format but I will try to remember all the questions members asked.  Deputy Penrose made a statement relating to the old approach, that is, the highly political approach to negotiations.  He used the term, "bringing home the bacon", which is still the predominant approach as far as I can see.  Member states, the European Parliament and the Commission collectively worked through CFP reform.  There was overwhelming public pressure from EU citizens to see an end to overfishing.  The 2015 deadline and the final 2020 deadline to end overfishing were set.</p> <p>  As a result of that initial public pressure, there was an improvement in the situation, with a lower level of overfishing in 2012.  Directly after the CFP was agreed, however, there was an increase in the level of overfishing, although this has come down to below the 2012 figures in the past two years.  That reflects the role the public played in 2012, the pressure that was put on decision makers to end overfishing and the subsequent fall back into past behaviour.  The Minister felt under pressure to deliver the quota for the industry and was probably under pressure from other political parties if he did not deliver that, which was definitely one of the driving factors.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Kelly" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018110600002#O00600"><p>Having sat with the Minister and representatives from the industry in Clonakilty, and having sat on advisory councils with the industry, I have found that the general approach is to maintain or increase our level of catch.  All stakeholders would agree that getting to MSY is beneficial to everyone.  While we would say that over the past few years we needed to make progressive incremental gains, when it comes to the accounts being done at the end of the year in November or December, there is a tendency to slip back into that short-termism.  The BIM sustainability impact assessment was mentioned.  That reflects the predominant approach where BIM will look at the Commission's proposal.  The Commission will reflect on the scientific advice that ICES has supplied, which might recommend a decrease in the amount of fish that can be caught for some stocks, depending on the health of the stock, and for others an increase, depending on fluctuations in the population.  The Commission will bring forward a proposal which BIM and the Government will consider.  The cost of the reductions for the year ahead will then be presented to the Oireachtas committee.  There is not a calculation, therefore, of what the benefits will be over a two, five or ten year period if we were to follow the scientific advice.</p> <p>  We have raised this matter with BIM and the Department for a number of years.  It is a major oversight and it severely hinders the narrative of the discussion.  In my presentation, I tried to steer away from birds or some of the more ecological arguments one might expect from an organisation such as BirdWatch Ireland.  I focused on the economics because this should not be a negative outlook.  Rather, it is an overwhelmingly positive opportunity for us to grow our blue economy.  At this year's SeaFest, I noted the Minister presented the Government's objectives, which, like Food Wise 2025, were focused on increasing the profitability of Ireland's aquaculture sector.  We would like to see that kind of approach taken to improving the sustainability of our fisheries or wild fish populations.  Based on some of the figures we put forward, there is a potential for an increase of 2,200 jobs in our coastal communities, many of which are in marginal areas without many other opportunities, unfortunately.  We feel that perspective should definitely be taken but, unfortunately, it has not been taken.</p> <p>  Some other points were made about the legal obligations and whether I was implying that Ireland is failing to live up to them, which is a serious issue.  My point was that based on what we can see from the decisions that are being made, Ireland seems to be playing a particularly negative role.  It consistently performs worse than the EU average in the number of stocks with which we are involved that are above scientific advice.  Looking at the trajectory of where that leaves us heading towards 2020, it appears we are heading for a situation where, collectively, the member states will not reach the 2020 target.  Given Ireland's major role in this development, we should be accountable and that is what I am asking of the Oireachtas joint committee.  It should be highlighted with the Minister that the November Council is the 2020 deadline because there will not be another negotiation before 2020.  If the Minister suggests we should not follow scientific advice, he should make clear what are the long-term economic arguments for taking that position and what are the political implications for Ireland of coming to the table with the attitude that we will not be legally compliant.</p> <p>  Similarly, in the case of the December Council, the negotiations that will take place in December of this year and again in December 2019 will bring us up to the 2020 deadline.  While the deadline may seem to be some time away, there will be only two meetings in Brussels beforehand and considerable progress remains to be made.  In recent years, we have met departmental officials and have always made clear that we are sympathetic to the position in which the Minister finds himself.  We are not asking for a guillotine approach such as was taken in 2015 when all the stocks were in MSY.  We have always argued for a clear plan that makes clear we are heading in the direction of having all stocks in MSY by 2020.</p><p>I focused a good deal on setting the fishing limits at the maximum sustainable yield, MSY, but also on being more cautious or even on being more positive at setting them below the MSY.  In doing that effectively we would leave more fish in the population and our stocks should increase over time.  If our stocks are increasing over time and getting back to historical levels that would have massive positive impacts not only on the ecosystem but on our fisheries.</p></speech>

It is a new direction that we have not been brought previously.  It is something we will have to take up with the Minister directly.  Mr. Kelly said that he has met Department officials on a regular basis.  What reaction did he get from them in this respect?</p></speech>

We meet the Department staff in Clonakilty several times a year.  We also meet staff in the Marine Institute quarterly.  I met the Minister several times last year and I also met him just the other week.  The reaction from him and his staff is that they understand what we are asking them to do but they have a different approach.  They believe they are getting there incrementally.  We believe, based on the evidence, that we are not making the necessary progress and the old habits of the short-termism and the political realities are hindering the progress.  There should be much greater focus on the opportunities.  If the Department was to come before the Oireachtas committee today and present figures of increased profitability and jobs to the value of just under &euro;300 million for any sector, I believe there would be excitement.  Bord Bia would have national campaigns and I am sure booklets would be printed.  That is the approach that we believe the Department should take regarding the MSY and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that online safety has become one of the most significant challenges facing Irish society and, arguably, one of the most significant child protection issues of our time.  We face major challenges.  Many people, particularly parents, are concerned about what is happening in that regard.  It is hard to blame them for that when one reads reports of predatory behaviour, harmful material and online bullying.  This is an issue which legislators cannot ignore and must face up to.  A policy and educational response - along with strong regulation and a statutory office with real powers and teeth - is required.  It is generally accepted in most policy areas that self-regulation is no regulation.  The Internet and online safety are not particularly different in that regard.   Some providers have good regulatory mechanisms but others have none.  Legislation is needed to ensure that all providers step up to the mark and provide appropriate safeguards.  Among the primary proposed functions of the commissioner are to promote digital safety for all and to support and encourage the implementation of measures to improve digital safety, including oversight, regulation and a timely and efficient procedure for the removal of harmful digital communications.</p> <p>  I welcome the representatives from the various organisations, the Department and industry.  I note the commentary by organisations and industry on the Bill.  I welcome the fact that, at a previous meeting, Ms Sweeney and her colleague from Facebook, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Cummiskey, stated that they are not opposed to the idea of a digital safety commissioner and that they see great benefit in a single office having the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts to promote digital safety.  That view is widely shared, but we need to work collaboratively and constructively on the detail of what is involved.  I approach these engagements with an open mind in the context of amendments.  I am not precious in that regard.  I will work with the committee, departmental officials or representatives of industry or civil society organisations to improve the Bill in any way possible.</p> <p>  A key point raised at the committee's most recent meeting - and which may be raised again today - relates to the need for a definition of "harmful communications".  It may be appropriate for the definition to be provided by the office of the digital safety commissioner.  It should not be left to providers to define it.  On balance, as there is a legal requirement to be in compliance with sections 4 and 5, it would be appropriate to provide a definition.  I am developing a draft definition, which will be needed.  We should look to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which provide a description of a category of existing and proposed offences.  I do not propose to introduce amendments to make such offences criminal offences under the Bill.  However, those are the types of behaviours we must seek to address.</p> <p>  I will be making a submission to the committee and the Minister to inform the drafting of the scrutiny report.  I suggest that other interested bodies should also consider doing so in order to allow the committee to evaluate all viewpoints in advance of drafting its report and the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.</p><p> The issue of freedom of expression has also been raised.  I acknowledged this in my comments on the previous occasion.  It is correct that we must proceed very carefully.  Freedom of expression is a value we all treasure and is essential to a functioning democracy.  I do not believe, however, that this is a reason to prevent us proceeding.  It is not an absolute right, especially where harmful communications are damaging, hurtful or, in some circumstances, illegal.  There is a consensus.  We cannot simply allow self-regulation to be the only approach.  We need to show vision and be ambitious and imaginative.  In view of the fact that this has been done in other common law jurisdictions, there is no reason for not doing the same here.  We need to do it.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, expressed his preliminary views on the Bill at the committee&rsquo;s meeting on 25 October.  He outlined his view that if the Oireachtas is to pass a law in this area, it must ensure that it is robust, effective, and proportionate and that it properly meets the public policy need to protect children online.  The Minister has asked the Department to consider the Private Members&rsquo; Bill in detail.  He also asked the Attorney General for urgent advice on a range of legal issues which the draft legislation presents.</p> <p>   As members are aware, the action plan for online safety, which was published by the Taoiseach on 11 July, contains 25 actions to be implemented or substantially progressed by the six Departments involved by the end of 2019.  Since the publication of the plan, an interdepartmental sponsors&rsquo; group, chaired by the Department of Education and Skills, with membership from the other five Departments, has been established.  That group will report to the relevant Cabinet committee on progress in implementing these commitments.</p> <p>  The National Advisory Council for Online Safety has also been established.  Its secretariat is provided by my Department.  The first meeting of the council was held on 4 October and the next meeting will be held in the coming weeks.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has succeeded the Deputy Kyne, who is now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, as chairman of the council.  The committee may also be interested to note that the council has established two sub-groups, the first to consider the role of the council in relation to guidance material, and the second to consider the council&rsquo;s role in relation to research.  A wide range of organisations have accepted the Government&rsquo;s invitation to be members of the council, including the four other organisations represented at this meeting, as well as other bodies representing  parents and older people, academic experts, and State bodies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Data Protection Commission and the Ombudsman for Children.</p> <p>  It is envisaged that the council will publish a report on its work to date to coincide with Safer Internet Day in February.  This will, in subsequent years, will become the council's annual report.  The overall focus of the action plan for online safety is to identify and deliver the activities that can be delivered over a period of 12 to 18 months and that will have the greatest impact on online safety for all our citizens, especially children.  Action 18 of the plan commits the Government, and specifically my Department, as well as the Departments of Justice and Equality and Business Enterprise and Innovation, to work with this committee to explore the issues arising in respect of this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues which the committee may wish to consider in the context of its scrutiny, a number of which were referenced by the Minister on 25 October, some of which I will now outline.  There is an absence of a definition of harmful digital communications.  It will be important to define what illegal offences will come within scope; whether the definition would also include harmful but not illegal communications, and, if so, of what nature.  Another issue is the definition of a digital service undertaking which appears to encompass a very wide range of undertakings, some of which may pose little or no risk in respect of harmful communications.  In the context of illegal content, would the Data Protection Commissioner have the power to seek the take-down of such material without consulting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  In the case of harmful but legal content, are there enforcement issues arising given that under the e-commerce directive 2000, notice and take down requirements relate only to the take-down of illegal content?  Is the enforcement mechanism envisaged for the take-down of harmful content by an undertaking located outside the State appropriate given that the speed of take-down would likely be the key outcome sought in such cases?</p> <p>  It may be helpful for the committee to be aware of some additional developments in the regulation of online content at European level.  It is expected that the final text of the revised audiovisual media services directive will be published shortly, with a requirement that it be implemented by member states within 21 months.</p><p>The original audiovisual media services directive, which was agreed in 2010, established the framework for regulating traditional television and on-demand services such as RT&Eacute; Player and Netflix.  While there are many aspects of the revision which will be of interest to the committee, of particular relevance to today's discussion are the new provisions that will apply to video-sharing platform services.  Aspects of services such as YouTube are likely to fall within the scope of these provisions.  The revised directive will require member states to introduce, by means of co-regulation, a system to ensure that these services have measures in place in order that minors will be protected from audiovisual content, including advertising, which may impair their physical, mental or moral development and that the general public will be protected from audiovisual content, including advertising, containing incitement to violence or hatred and from such content, including advertising, the dissemination of which is a criminal offence under Union law.  The latter covers terrorism-related offences, child sexual abuse material offences and offences of racism and xenophobia.</p><p> Ireland will be required to appoint a national regulatory authority which will monitor and ensure that video-sharing platforms have appropriate measures in place to meet the goals I have outlined.  Among the measures which may be appropriate are age-verification and parental controls.  This presents an alternative approach to the regulation of harmful online content, albeit only for video-sharing platforms.  The Department intends to commence a public consultation on Ireland's approach to the implementation of the revised directive before the end of this year.</p></speech>

We welcome the drafting of legislation to establish an office of digital safety commissioner and look forward to its progress.</p> <p>  Online safety is the child protection issue of our day.  I would like to share a typical example of a Childline case with the committee.  A 15 year old female contacted Childline's web chat service.  She stated that she sent nude pictures of herself to her boyfriend and that when they broke up, he sent them to his friends.  Now her friends and people in school are talking about her and calling her vile names.  She feels really embarrassed, stupid and ashamed.  She feels very hurt and betrayed by her ex-boyfriend.  She did not think that he would do such a thing.  She is terrified that her parents will find out and is scared about how they might react, especially her dad because he is so strict.  She is so upset that she wants to kill herself.  This example illustrates the fear and isolation children feel when something they do online goes horribly wrong and they perceive that the situation is out of their control to manage.</p> <p>  The ISPCC has been pleased to see the Houses of the Oireachtas take seriously the issue of online safety, with a significant increase in activity in Departments in the past year.  We would like to take this opportunity too, to acknowledge the work of the Office for Internet Safety and Webwise and the work they do with limited resources.  These structures need to be better resourced to make them more effective and for every parent, child and teacher in the country to become aware of them and embrace their resources and expertise.</p> <p>  The ISPCC broadly welcomed the publication of the Government's first action plan for online safety last July, particularly its provisions in respect of enhanced education measures and proposed law reform.  However, the ISPCC expressed its disappointment at the time that the action plan fell short of a commitment to statutory regulation.  Not long after the launch of the action plan, and indeed in recent times, the public has been presented with stark examples of self-regulation failing.  It is our experience that these failures can impact negatively on children and that there are positive actions that Ireland can take to better protect children online.  Notwithstanding the commitment to self-regulation in the action plan, and perhaps to reflect the fast-changing nature of this space, we were delighted to hear the comments of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, at the committee's detailed scrutiny stage where he stated it was time to move beyond self-regulation and highlighted the need for a regulatory body in the online space.</p> <p>  In 2016, the ISPCC carried out an internal case review of its Childline service and front-line services on the prevalence of online safety issues in our work.  The findings of this review, in conjunction with cases in the external environment, led to online safety being an integral part of our policy work, in turn giving us a clear mandate to advocate for change in this area.  In February 2017, the ISPCC made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and shared its experiences regarding online safety issues.  These issues included access and exposure to inappropriate content, online grooming and cyberbullying.</p><p>Harmful communications among children can be compounded by the fact that they are children and perhaps do not realise the reach their actions can have online.  We are in no doubt that online safety is a major issue for children and young people in Ireland.<br/><br/>In 2005 we launched the first text-based support service for children in Ireland.  We have seen a shift to our online and text service over the last decade, and we are in the final stages of development of a new online service.  The ISPCC has seen the use of its Childline online services jump from just under 4,000 conversations in 2007 to just under 30,000 conversations in 2017.  We know that children want us to be online, and to be more accessible to them in the spaces they inhabit.  Through listening to and engaging with more than 1,000 children a day on our Childline service we have been able to spot trends over the years and raise these issues in the media and with policy-makers and legislators.  Over the past two decades in particular we have seen how children&rsquo;s technological lives are becoming increasingly embedded in their lives as a whole.  The online-offline distinction for children is an unfamiliar concept.  Utilising technology and being online are no longer an add-on; it is how and where they live their lives. <br/><br/>Children make up one third of all Internet users globally.  One in two users in the developed world is a child.  Their participation and protection rights in the digital environment are widely supported across EU laws and policies.  Irish policy sets out ambitions for all Irish citizens to be connected and online.  ICT is broadly available and its use encouraged in many schools.  The Government&rsquo;s action plan for online safety recognises that children&rsquo;s specific vulnerability warrants greater protection.  The Net Children Go Mobile<i></i>report of 2015 found that one in five children in Ireland reported being bothered by something they saw on the Internet in the past.  The Internet was not created with children as users in mind, but they use it.  We know this, and we all have a role to play in keeping them safe online.  Therefore, it is imperative we recognise the need for a regulatory body, with a digital safety commissioner or equivalent, to champion children&rsquo;s online safety and seek remedies for them when they are unable to do so themselves. <br/><br/><b></b>The issue of defining harmful communications has been raised at the various stages of debate on this Bill thus far.  It is important that a definition is created to reflect the examples of harmful communications referred to in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report and elsewhere, and not be overly broad so as to render the definition unworkable and, in effect, useless.<br/><br/>While some of the suggested work of a digital safety commissioner is being carried out across other Departments and structures, we feel there is merit in co-ordinating this work in order to maximise its efforts and impacts for all concerned, under an office of the digital safety commissioner, or equivalent. <br/><br/>Children have a right to be protected, and this protection extends to being online.  Being online is the public space where children frequent the most.  They converse with their friends there, keep in touch with family there and shop there.  It is their go-to place for information, and, like any public space, it should afford them similar safety protections. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alex Cooney" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018110600002#K00200"><p>CyberSafeIreland is the children&rsquo;s charity for online safety in Ireland.  We set up in 2015 and since then we have spoken to 14,000 children and to thousands of parents and teachers about staying safe online.  We also gather data on an ongoing basis which enables us to monitor trends and usage and to highlight risks.  We recently launched our annual report and published the data that we had gathered over the last academic year, based on responses from more than 5,000 children aged between eight and 13.  Some 68% of these children owned a smartphone and 70% were signed up to social media and messaging apps, despite age restrictions of at least 13 on all such services.  In short, the use of online services was pervasive among this cohort of children.  Our report further highlighted that many primary school teachers are seeing the consequence of children&rsquo;s online use in the classroom with 62% of teachers having dealt with online safety incidents over the last academic year.  More than a third of teachers had dealt with between two and five incidents last year.  Some of these incidences involved the uploading and sharing of harmful and upsetting material, including intimate images.</p> <p>  I am providing this data as a context to our position on the digital safety commissioner.  We believe that a digital safety commissioner will offer a level of co-ordination and oversight that we currently do not have in Ireland.  It will furthermore introduce a level of accountability by helping to ensure that social media companies are timely and responsive in their removal of any harmful material and consistent in their application of safeguards by providing monitoring, oversight and reporting on their performance in this regard.</p><p>As a charity that is often approached for help by parents, teachers and those working with vulnerable children, we are more aware than many of the reality of when things go wrong online, when harmful or upsetting content is either not removed or not removed quickly enough.  We also know that self-regulation means that online service providers get to be judge and jury in cases of troublesome and sometimes controversial content.  This is where a digital safety commissioner could play an important role in the review of materials and decision-making in respect of take-down procedures.</p><p> The Bill also proposes the introduction of a code of practice, which would mean that there would be greater consistency across platforms.  The office would also have an education and research remit and would offer an important level of co-ordination in these areas.  It is important to recognise that many of the leading social media platforms, including Facebook and Google, have worked consistently to improve safeguards on their platforms and have also provided some useful educational resources.  It is incredibly important that they continue to prioritise safeguarding practice and design into the future.  However, we need to go one step further by ensuring that all platforms are held to the same high standards and that there is a regulatory body that can provide oversight and step into the breach when needed.</p><p> In any discussion about a proposed digital safety commissioner, it is helpful to consider the precedents.  The Australian Office of the eSafety Commissioner was set up in 2016 as a result of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.  While this office is still new - and it is too early to fully assess its effectiveness - commentators such as Matthew Rimmer, professor of intellectual property and innovation law at Queensland University of Technology, think that it offers value and addresses "genuine child safety issues in the digital environment which haven&rsquo;t been well dealt with by governments or IT companies or the community".  The Australian Parliament's legal and constitutional affairs references committee also acknowledged the importance of this office in its review of laws relating to cyberbullying earlier this year.  It urged the Government to ensure that it was given appropriate levels of resources to carry out its mandate effectively.</p><p> While the UK does not have the equivalent of a digital safety commissioner, it is in the process of developing a new Internet safety strategy which will be introduced before the end of the year and which outlines some similar plans in terms of regulation.  The UK Government published the results of its public consultation on its Green Paper in May and one of the findings from the consultation was that users, including children, felt powerless to address safety issues online and there was insufficient oversight of technology companies, as well as a lack of transparency on their part.  The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, outlined plans to introduce a social media code of practice and transparency reporting as part of its digital charter and this may well become a legislative requirement in due course.</p><p> Given Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, it is important to consider what is happening at a European level in order to put these proposals into the appropriate context.  In July, the Council of Europe made some recommendations to its member states regarding children&rsquo;s rights in the digital environment.  The recommendations acknowledge the importance of children being able to access the online world and include a wide range of measures and proposals around children&rsquo;s rights but also measures to protect them, including ensuring in-built safety by design, privacy by design and privacy by default as guiding principles for products and services, particularly those used by children.  The recommendations also recognise that children, and those who care for them, need guidance and education.  The document states that digital literacy education should be included in the basic education curriculum from the earliest years, taking into account children&rsquo;s evolving capacities.  While the recommendations are wide-ranging in nature and there is not the space to touch on all points here, I would like to highlight one other piece relating to them, namely, the need to identify and establish competent bodies with the responsibility and authority to implement actions in a timely and efficient manner, and that such bodies should be adequately resourced both in terms of funding and staffing.</p><p> The proposal for an office for a digital safety commissioner seems to offer several opportunities to meet the standards set out in the Council of Europe recommendations, although it could go further than the current proposals and include reference to the ethical and safe design of any new apps and games, as recommended by the Council of Europe.  We would also like an explicit reference to the need to embed digital literacy into the curriculum to be reflected in the Bill.  We must equip young people with the skills and know-how to navigate the online world in a safe and responsible manner.  Education is an important part of any prevention strategy and the need for digital literacy to be taught in schools is recognised in both the UK strategy and European Council recommendations.  The Bill includes many significant measures and, with some additions, it could provide a strong basis for our national strategy for dealing with online safety well into the future.</p></speech>

I will give a brief overview because I have been before the committee on a few previous occasions when I provided more lengthy explanations of our approach to safety.</p><p>Every day, more than 1.4 billion people around the world use Facebook.  They post everything from photos and status updates to live videos in many different languages.  Deciding what stays up and what comes down involves hard judgment calls on complex issues ranging from bullying and hate speech to harassment.  It is why we developed our community standards with input from outside experts, including academics, non-governmental organisations, NGOs and governments around the world.  Our community standards have been publicly available for many years and in April of this year, we published the more detailed internal guidelines used by our review teams to enforce them for the first time.  We decided to publish these internal guidelines for two reasons.  First, the guidelines aim to help people understand where we draw the line on nuanced issues.  Second, providing this detail makes it easier for everyone, including experts in different fields, to give us feedback in order that we can improve the guidelines, and the decisions we make, over time.<br/><br/>We also have a safety advisory board, which comprises leading Internet safety organisations on child abuse, domestic violence and Internet safety for children and women.  Facebook consults these organisations on issues related to online safety and keeping our community safe.<br/><br/>For the content review process, we use a combination of artificial intelligence and reports from people to identify posts, pictures or other content that may violate our community standards.  These reports are reviewed by our community operations team, who work 24/7 in over 50 languages all around the world.<br/><br/>This year, we have doubled the number of people working on our safety and security teams to 20,000.  This includes more than 7,500 content reviewers specifically.  We are also investing heavily in new technologyto help deal with problematic content on Facebook more effectively.  For example, we use technology to assist in sending reports to reviewers with the right expertise to cut out duplicate reports and to help detect and remove known terrorist propaganda and child sexual abuse images before they have been reported.  Last month, we also announced thatwe have been increasingly using artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect child nudity and previously unknown examples of child sexual exploitation imagery.  Content review on this scale has never been done, as there has never been a platform where so many people communicate in so many languages across so many countries and cultures, but we very much recognise the responsibility we have to get this right.<br/><br/>I am here today in the context of the committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Members will recall that I gave an outline of our thoughts on this topic at the 1 August hearing I attended but I am happy to be here again today as the committee considers the Bill in detail.  We understand the motivation behind the establishment of a digital safety commissioner, particularly the appeal of having an independent, statutory body that is authorised to adjudicate in cases where there is disagreement between a platform and an affected user about what constitutes a harmful communication, or to provide a path to appeal for an affected user where we have, in error, failed to uphold our own policies.  We also acknowledge the Bill's efforts to ensure its scope is not overly broad, in that an appeal to the digital safety commissioner can only be made by individuals where the specified communication concerns him or her. <br/><br/>We very much see the benefit in having a single office with the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts on the promotion of digital safety throughout communities, much of which has been captured in the Government's Action Plan for Online Safety.  It is only through this multi-pronged approach, of which education is critical, that we can begin to see positive changes in how people engage and protect themselves online. <br/><br/>In its 2016 report the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in addressing the nature of harmful communications, stated the following:</p><blockquote>While there is no single agreed definition of bullying or of cyberbullying, the well-accepted definitions include the most serious form of harmful communications, such as ... so-called &ldquo;revenge porn&rdquo;; intimidating and threatening messages, whether directed at private persons or public figures; harassment; stalking; and non-consensual taking and communication of intimate images ...</blockquote><p>We agree with the LRC with respect to all of these types of communication, a very stark example of which was given by Mr. John Church in his opening statement.  The sharing of non-consensual intimate images, harassment, stalking and threatening messages are all egregious forms of harmful communication and are banned both by our community standards and, in some cases, the law.  We fully support the commission's proposals to create new criminal offences to tackle non-consensual sharing of intimate images and online harassment where those offences are clearly defined and practicable for a digital environment.  We have also taken steps to step up how we tackle non-consensual sharing of intimate images that are shared on our own platform, more information on which can be found online and with respect to which I have shared the link with the committee in our opening statement.  <br/><br/>However, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined in his remarks today and previously, the proposed Bill is currently unclear as to what precisely constitutes a harmful communication.</p><p>There is no definition included in the draft Bill but it does appear from the draft that this concept is intended to be broader than content that is clearly criminal in nature, much of which has been touched on.  The exact parameters are left undefined, which could lead to uncertainty and unpredictability.  I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's remarks about the need to include a definition.  We welcome the opportunity to work with him on that if that is possible.  Previously, on 25 October, he mentioned that he felt that there was a need for legal certainty and we very much welcome that.<br/><br/>As the LTC stated in 2016, the Internet:</p><blockquote>enables individuals to contribute to, and shape debates on important political and social issues and within states with a repressive regime the Internet can be a particularly valuable means of allowing people to have their voices heard.  Freedom of expression is therefore the lifeblood of the Internet and needs to be protected.  </blockquote><p>The report continues:</p><blockquote>...balancing the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy is a challenging task, particularly in the digital and online context.  Proposing heavy-handed law-based measures intended to provide a remedy for victims of harmful digital communications has the potential to interfere with freedom of expression unjustifiably, and impact on the open and democratic nature of information sharing online which is the internet&rsquo;s greatest strength.</blockquote><p>I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is alive to these issues and has referenced these in his earlier contribution.<br/><br/>I will shorten my contribution because the committee is under pressure and I will finish by pointing out that Facebook has put community standards in place for the reason that we want our community to feel safe and secure when they use our platform.  We are committed to the removal of content that breaches those standards, and we are keen to continue to engage with this committee and others as the Bill moves into the next phase in the legislative process.  <br/><br/>I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I work with Google in Ireland as public policy and government relations manager, based in our Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Dublin. I am joined by my colleague, Ms Rachel Madden, who works as a senior public policy analyst, focusing on online safety and based in our San Francisco office but hailing from Dublin.  Ms Madden's remit is global and she works closely with our product team and I am delighted she is able to join us.</p> <p>  Google welcomes the committee&rsquo;s efforts to engage with stakeholders in its consideration of the Bill.  We appreciate this opportunity to outline our views on a number of the issues raised in the Bill which we feel merit deeper consideration by the committee.</p> <p>  Before I address these issues specifically, it might be helpful to outline Google&rsquo;s actions and approach to safety online.  Google believes deeply in technology&rsquo;s ability to unlock creativity and engagement.  We also believe that technology companies have a responsibility to their users; that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online; and that all users should be empowered to manage online risks and make safe choices.  We work hard behind the scenes to ensure that our users have as positive as possible an online experience as possible.  Our approach to online safety and well-being falls into three main themes: strong community guidelines; technological innovation; and working in partnership. </p> <p>  We are a company fundamentally committed to access to information, yet our community guidelines and content policies offer clear rules on what we do not allow on our platforms.  These often go above and beyond what is in the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world who work 24 hours a day to ensure violations of our guidelines are acted upon.</p> <p>  On technological innovation, Google has aimed to be the industry leader in creating and developing products and tools which help protect and empower our users, and we will continue to invest the resources necessary to ensure families can make safety choices that are right for them.</p> <p>  We developed YouTube Kids to offer an alternative YouTube specifically designed for young children.  It provides a restricted version of YouTube for families with built in timers, no public comments, no option to upload content and the ability for parents to block or allow access to specific channels or videos.  Last year, we launched Family Link, which enables parents to create a Google account for their child and then helps them set and tailor the digital ground rules that work for their children including on-screen time, device bedtimes and approving or blocking specific apps or functions like the camera.  Ireland was the first country outside of the US in which we launched Family Link and it has since been rolled out in 170 countries.  </p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Madden, will be happy to speak more about these online safety products we have developed.  At Google, collaboration has been key to ensuring our products and services offer families a positive and secure experience online.</p><p>That is why we work regularly with NGOs, Government and industry partners to empower parents and children with the tools and skills they need to make the most of the Internet.  Companies like Google have a responsibility to ensure not only that products and services offer a great user experience but that we work with a wide range of stakeholders and industry partners to creatively and effectively raise awareness, offer support on how to navigate technology responsibility and share technological solutions to tackle some of the toughest problems we face.  Google has invested considerable resources in these efforts and has thousands of employees across the companies working in this regard.  More detail on each of these teams is included in the written submission to the committee which has been circulated.  The submission also includes views and suggestions on the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill which are drawn from this overall approach as well as from our knowledge and experience of the practical implications associated with these issues.  We are also happy to provide a more detailed written submission if that is considered appropriate.</p><p> In the time available, however, I can set out briefly some of the points we believe the committee should take into consideration.  In doing so, I echo some of the things other witnesses have mentioned already.  Google welcomes the recognition of the need for ongoing awareness and education on harmful digital content.  We support an approach which includes national initiatives to educate Internet users on what it means to be a responsible online citizen, the resources and tools available to protect their privacy online and how to deal with and report cyberbullying, inappropriate content and online abuse.  Google also welcomes the consideration of additional measures by Government to address the posting online of videos or images with embarrassing and intimate content, often referred to as "revenge porn".  This amounts to an egregious invasion of an individual's privacy as other witnesses have already said.  It is essential that any new legal framework in Ireland reflects and is consistent with the laws governing online services in the EU, in particular the e-commerce directive.  In particular, we highlight the need for national legislation to reflect the notice and take-down procedure specifically envisaged in the e-commerce directive at articles 12 to 14 together with the prohibition on imposing general monitoring obligations contained in article 15.</p><p> I will not repeat the point on the need for a definition of "harmful communication" which was made by every other witness except to say that we agree that a clear definition would provide legal clarity for all parties.  We welcome Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's comments in that regard.  The delineation of responsibility between the digital safety commissioner and the Data Protection Commissioner merits deeper consideration as the Bill progresses, in particular in light of the Data Protection Commissioner's responsibility for dealing with complaints by individuals related to their data protection and privacy rights under the GDPR.  As a general point, we ask the committee to ensure that any legislation is future-proofed by making it as technology and platform neutral as possible.  I will finish there except to ask the committee to take those points on board as it continues its deliberations on the Bill.  The suggested changes would make the legislation more effective and increase clarity in its application.  I thank the committee for its time. </p></speech>

That goes for all witnesses as we progress through our discussions on the Bill.  Any input in writing would be very welcome.  I will start by asking a number of questions and then open questioning to members of the committee.  Witnesses might want to note the questions.</p> <p>  I note to the departmental witnesses that one of the issues raised last week by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was the need to be conscious of the nexus between the ministerial responsibility and the role of the digital safety commissioner.  Are the witnesses in a position to elaborate on that?  My understanding of what the Minister said was that he is there to put forward policy and to ensure it is delivered which would not be the role of a statutory body.  I might be mistaken but perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on it.  Has the Department had an opportunity to review Australia's Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015?  Has there been any engagement with the Department's Australian counterpart as I understand the legislation there is working well?  Common law issues arise in that jurisdiction which may be similar to issues arising here.  Will the Attorney General's evidence be made available to the committee in respect of its work on this legislation?</p> <p>  I turn to the witnesses from Facebook.  Facebook has said previously that it is broadly supportive in principle of the creation of a digital safety commissioner role and we welcome that.  There are some issues around the definition of "extraterritorial" and the effect of that on the legislation.  What has Facebook's engagement with Australia's eSafety Commissioner been or are the witnesses in a position to expand on that today?  How is the process working?</p><p>It seems to be working very well.  There is very little conflict.  I heard an interview with the Australian digital safety commissioner in which she said that her engagement with social media platforms has been very good and quite effective, to the point that fines are not always needed.  I do not think she has ever used fines.  Her engagement with social media platforms has been very positive.  I would welcome the views of the representatives of Facebook on the company's interaction with the Australian setup.</p><p> I thank Mr. Meade of Google for his comments.  I ask him to expand on his request for the Bill to be as platform-neutral and technology-neutral as possible.</p><p> Do the witnesses from the ISPCC have a breakdown of the most common complaints?  Can they provide any figures for the complaints which are coming before them?  Do the complaints relate to cyberbullying?  It would be useful for the committee to get a breakdown.</p><p> The need to define what constitutes "harmful communication" has been a common thread throughout this discussion.  I appreciate that it would be difficult for the witnesses to formulate a definition here.  The committee would welcome any assistance that the witnesses who are in attendance today could provide with regard to the definition as we move forward with this legislation.</p><p> When Ms Cooney spoke on behalf of CyberSafeIreland, she referred to "the ethical and safe design of any new apps" and to "digital literacy".  I would be concerned that if this legislation is too broad - if the digital safety commissioner has too broad a role and too wide a remit - it may be less effective.  It might be preferable to limit our endeavours in this regard to the areas of online content focused on in this legislation.  A narrow focus is needed, certainly initially.  If we need to build on that remit in future years, that could be done.  I would be cautious about extending the remit in case it becomes too wide because it would not be effective in such circumstances.</p><p> I would like to get the witnesses' views on that.  I have also asked for their views on what constitutes "harmful communication" and for any data or information that might be available to them in this regard and could be provided to the committee.  After they have responded to my questions, I will bring in Deputies Stanley and Lawless.</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Quill, will answer the Chairman's questions about engagement and cover off the Australian e-commissioner angle.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has rightly said, the role of the Minister and the Department is to look at the policy context at national and European levels.  Our job is to set legislation in a broad policy context.  There are many examples of areas in which external implementation bodies have been established.  There is a great deal of European legislation.  Reference has been made to the audiovisual media services directive, which is coming down the tracks for us.  When that is finalised at the end of this month, our job will be to consult on the online safety aspects of the directive and on the co-regulation of video-sharing platforms.  We will look at what the Commission has set out and we will work with the Minister to figure how that will be transposed.</p> <p>  I will set out the choices here.  We must choose to have either secondary or primary legislation.  We have to decide what the national regulatory authority will be.  We have not made up our minds on that.  We will have to speak to the Minister.  He will make that decision.  That will be an important component of this process.  We will also have to decide how we will transpose the requirements of the regulation.  That is broadly how we will do things in this area.</p> <p>  Many speakers have alluded to the fact that there are many players in the area of online safety.  The Department of Justice and Equality has a role in respect of any content that relates to terrorism.  It manages the transpositions in that area.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a role in respect of e-commerce.  The online world is fairly complicated.  The broad policy context is certainly put in place by Government Departments.</p> <p>  I can tell the Chairman in response to her second question that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who is still relatively new in the job, asked us to write to the Office of the Attorney General to get its advice on certain aspects of the Bill.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has recognised, some of it is quite complicated.  We have sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on aspects of the Bill that have been mentioned, including the definition of a "digital service undertaking".</p><p>We have considered how it interacts with the e-commerce directive and how matters involving entities outside the State would be enforced.  We have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General in that regard but will have to ask it whether such advice could be shared as matters such as legal privilege must be considered.  We are happy to ascertain whether the advice may be shared and will revert to the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

The e-commerce directive 2000 sets out the limitations on legal liability that apply to digital service undertakings.  As Ms Cronin pointed out, that is an issue on which we have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  It must be recognised that there are differences in the legal framework which may impact on the capacity of an office in this jurisdiction to operate in the same way as a similar office in Australia.  That is probably the key element to bear in mind when considering the system in operation there.  In addition, aspects of the Australian office for digital safety focus solely on children rather than the broader focus on all citizens - while recognising the particular vulnerability of children - as proposed in the Bill.  In particular, legal liability is an issue that needs further reflection and examination.</p></speech>

Ms Quill is correct insofar as the last update I received stated that the commissioner there has never used her official powers, although there is much consultation and ongoing work with the platforms.  When I last spoke to my colleague on this issue, I knew of early anecdotal evidence to suggest that the office was not necessarily operating in the way one might have anticipated.  For example, some reports regarded hacked accounts rather than specific instances of harmful communication.  In other instances, complaints were not first reported to the platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook in our case.  Rather, the affected user went directly to the commissioner.  Obviously, we would still work with the office on such complaints but the system there was not necessarily working as envisaged.  The numbers there were quite low in its first year.  I do not know the numbers for 2017, but they probably reflect how it played out in 2016.  That said, there is ongoing interaction between my organisation and the commissioner there.</p></speech>

I do not suggest that the Bill is running the risk of being too technology-specific.  It is important to bear in mind that when framing regulation one looks at existing practices and industry players and how technology is used.  However, by its nature, technology changes.  If we were discussing legislation such as this three or four years ago, issues such as the use of ephemeral content available through Snapchat and other apps which involves content that disappears after a time might not have been considered.  That is very much a general point.  I am not suggesting that any specific provision of the Bill will limit its usefulness in the future.  However, when considering regulation in this area, ideally one would have a framework that will stand the test of time.  I ask the committee to bear that in mind.</p></speech>

The ISPCC has identified some trends in this area.  We run Childline, a confidential listening service, which will probably answer approximately 1,200 calls today from children under the age of 18.  Approximately 6,000 of the 350,000 calls received by Childline last year related to online bullying.  We very often deal with the issues caused by bullying in general and our categorisation deals with behavioural issues as well as issues such as domestic abuse, sexual abuse, body image, online abuse and other bullying.</p><p>It causes us to look at our statistics and how we categorise it.  If one considers the use of our online platform, last year we had just less than 30,000 conversations compared to just under 4,000 ten years ago.  This is going to become an issue and I believe we will have to look at how we categorise conversations.  When one looks at trends, we often use Childline figures but we also consult our child support workers in the community who do one-to-one counselling therapeutic interventions.  We also have voluntary children's advisory committees set up.  In those latter two areas we see a bigger rise, which is not fully reflected in our numbers.</p><p> The Chairman also asked about harmful communications and definitions.  My colleague, Ms Jennings, will elaborate on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Jennings" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018110600002#R00200"><p>On defining harmful communications, and the exercise that is before the committee, we would refer to the consultation the Law Reform Commission had with the young people and the different themes, issues and behaviours that they identified as harmful.  The Law Reform Commission brought that information, along with the extended consultations it had, and it looked at issues such as the taking and distribution of an intimate images without consent, the setting up of false accounts to cause or intend to cause harm, and stalking or actions that would cause alarm, distress and harm.  As Mr. Church said earlier, we would encourage the committee to create a definition that is not overly broad and which is workable.  In Australia, the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 pertains to cyberbullying but it also has quite a niche definition that covers material that is seriously threatening, seriously intimidating, seriously harassing or seriously humiliating.  New Zealand has a Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015.  New Zealand does not have an entity such as our Digital Protection Commissioner.  It has an approved agency called Netsafe.  The New Zealand legislation looks communications principles, including where a digital communication should not be threatening, intimidating or menacing, and should not be used to harass an individual.  There are several other principles also and I believe they would be a good starting point when looking to create a definition of harmful communications.</p></speech>

The Australian model has education as part of the remit, which is worth knowing, and that function is used.  The office does awareness raising with parents, produces resources and so on.  That mandate is there.  The focus was just on children and cyberbullying, but in 2018 it has been extended it to all Australians.  It is increasing its mandate, which is one of the observations that has been made as time has gone on.  It has also been suggested that increased resources be made available to the office.  I believe it has dealt with some 500 cases to date.</p></speech>

There is a feeling and a view being propagated out there that the Internet has empowered everybody now that we can connect with people all over the world.  According to Facebook there are 1.4 billion users on Facebook daily.  I believe the Internet has had a hugely disempowering effect in some ways.  CyberSafeIreland highlighted the UK survey where adults and children felt powerless to address online safety issues.</p><p>If they are powerless to address their own safety they are seriously disempowered.  It is useful that Ms Cooney highlighted that and the insufficient oversight today.  The example given by the ISPCC of the 15 year old girl is shocking.  That is a life and death issue because she feels she wants to kill herself.  Facebook and Google talk about their online communities.  There are no communities of 1.4 billion people.  Communities are a different entity and it is a misuse of the word by Facebook and Google.  In real communities we know, unfortunately, of cases like this where lives have been taken over issues such as revenge pornography and bullying of young people online.  That is the context for the important Bill that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has brought forward.  </p><p> Google highlighted the importance of education and said that it alone could solve the problem of online bullying.  That is what it seems to indicate in its presentation.  Education of itself will not stop somebody who wants to misuse the Internet.  That is a huge challenge for Google and Facebook and for us as legislators to deal with.  Will the witnesses from Google address that issue in more depth because stating that education alone could deal with this does not do justice to or deal properly with this?  We will need strict criteria and legislation and means of enforcing that.  </p><p> Facebook says it has 1.4 billion users every day.  On the last occasion it was here, in August if I remember correctly, it stated that it has 20,000 people moderating what is online.  I was surprised by that number but it shows the extent of the problem, the challenge and difficulty of trying to moderate what appears on the platform.  Does this show the witnesses that this problem is nearly impossible to deal with?  That is probably one of the biggest challenges facing the company, us as legislators and governments around the world.  Does that highlight the need for direct State intervention?</p><p> In its presentation Facebook highlighted the need for freedom of expression.  As somebody who campaigned against section 31 of the Broadcasting Act 1960 throughout the 1980s and 1990s which was repealed by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Michael D. Higgins, one of the best things he ever did, I do not think we want to limit freedom of expression too much.  A line, however, has to be drawn around safety and what should be allowed.  Do the witnesses from Facebook and Google believe that it should be left to private companies and corporate entities to define what should be tolerated in terms of freedom of expression or is it for government bodies to do that? </p><p> The Law Reform Commission's definition of offences refers to pornography, intimidating and threatening messages whether directed at public figures or private individuals, harassment, stalking or non-consensual taking and communication of intimate images.</p><p>What role should Facebook and Google have in addressing the issue of fake news and the spread of misinformation about individuals?  Politicians have been targeted with this type of misinformation in the past, and, in some cases, it has had detrimental effects.  Such misinformation included false accusations against public figures.  Should that be included in the definition of "harmful material"?  </p><p> The Department mentioned that certain minimum standards would be set.  As a member state of the European Union should we be entitled to add to that and threaten more stringent regulations?  Does the Department feel that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill is in any way counter to EU law, and if so in what way?  </p><p> My final question is for Facebook or the Department.  Who should fund the office of the digital safety commissioner?</p></speech>

We are trying to emphasise, in our approach to online safety and in the collaborative work we do, that there is no silver bullet to prevent bullying or any other online safety issue.  We are highlighting the importance of education.  Most witnesses will probably agree that educating and empowering users is one of the key planks of any strategy for online safety.  I did not want to give the impression that we believe that education alone can solve the issue of online bullying or any other online safety issue, which is why I laid out the different themes we address in our approach to online safety.  Education and empowerment fall under our work in partnership with other organisations.  I also highlighted our technological innovation in terms of the tools we have sought to put in the hands of users and families.  We also have community guidelines, and I will ask my colleague, Ms Madden, to talk about those.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is one solution for these complex issues.  We firmly believe that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online, and we have strong policies in place on certain platforms, such as YouTube, to address bullying and harassment.  We do not allow abusive videos or comments on our platform.  Beneath every video and beside every comment on YouTube there is a "flagging" option which allows anyone to report content for review.  Facebook has teams based around the world, working 24-7 to analyse these reports, and if content violates our policies it will be removed.  We also work in partnership with other organisations.  We have a trusted flagger programme, involving individual members of the YouTube community - I apologise for using that phrase because I know some people do not like it - non-profit organisations and Government agencies.  These non-profit organisations are often experts in certain areas and are helpful in notifying us of content that might violate our policies on bullying or other areas.  We will quickly remove that content when we are made aware of it.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that it is a big challenge because content review has never been done on this scale.  On the need for direct State intervention, we receive millions of reports every week and if the State were asked to step in and do what we, Google and others do, it would be challenging to say the least.</p><p> There was a question on freedom of expression and whether it should be for Facebook to determine what should be left up and what should be taken down.  That is an important part of the conversation.  As Ms Quill said, we operate within the e-commerce directive in the area of illegal content and if we are made aware of illegal content on our platform, we have to act expeditiously to remove it.  In other jurisdictions it is different, such as in Germany where the NetzDG Act covers illegal hate speech.  In Ireland, it is left to us to discover what is illegal and many people have an issue with being left in a quasi-judicial position in this respect.  We have a short period to determine what is illegal and there is a tendency to err on the side of caution, given the exposure companies have if they do not remove the content over time.  If there is legal exposure for companies for pushing the boundaries on what constitutes freedom of expression, we could end up with the mass removal of perfectly legal content which may offend, shock or disturb but is not necessarily illegal.</p><p> On false accusations against public figures, we were part of the high-level working group on false news convened by the European Commission over the summer.  This issue has travelled some distance since then and the focus now is more on electoral integrity.  We have made a number of commitments as part of that and the Commissioner, Vra Jourov&aacute; announced the agreed outputs in mid-October.  We have undertaken to introduce additional tools with respect to electoral integrity this side of the European elections and we are working hard on this, which is in addition to the tool for viewing ads which we rolled out in April.  This allows one to see any advertisement which an advertiser is running at the same time and addresses the idea of dark-outs.</p><p> If false accusations against public figures ever drift into defamatory territory, a clear process is in place.  We have a dedicated reporting forum, as does Google, which is used to report defamation, which we know can be damaging.  It is separate to reporting through our normal reporting channels, which are attached to every piece of content on the platform.  We take this seriously.</p><p> Another question was on who should fund the office.  I suspect that if it was funded by us it would attract criticism.</p></speech>

Ms Quill will address the European Union requirements.  One of the witnesses from Google mentioned the education aspect.  A collaborative approach has been taken across Government in respect of the action plan for online safety because of the nature of the latter.  There are a number of actions in the education sphere that are the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills, with timelines for when they are to be delivered.  It is a broad plan comprising, as one would expect, many actions being sought by that Department.</p> <p>  In terms of some of the points that were raised about revenge porn, there is a Private Member's Bill, which was not opposed by Government and which is before the justice committee - although I am sure where it stands - that examines some issues such as stalking, non-consensual distribution of intimate images or the taking and distribution of intimate images without consent.  That probably covers some of the areas raised  by a representative from the  ISPCC.  I will ask Ms Quill to address the European Union requirements.</p></speech>

There would not be anything preventing national law in this area but it would have to respect the European framework and the Irish legal framework.  One of the issues on which we have sought clarity from the Attorney General's office is in respect of the Irish legal framework with respect, for example, to whether a body such as the proposed office of the digital safety commissioner could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction as a matter of general principle where there is not a universally accepted principle of international law.  In other words, in the case of something in respect of which there is not an international or a European norm, can the State reasonably impose its jurisdiction on a body that is established outside the State?  That would be one aspect to bear in mind in this regard.</p> <p>  In terms of adding extra national measures, we can do that but they would have to abide, as Ms Sweeney and others mentioned, by the European framework relating to the e-commerce directive.  If content is illegal, it is provided for under that mechanism.  If somebody brings to the attention of a platform a matter relating to illegal content, that platform has an obligation to take down the content.  If a matter is not illegal but might be considered to be harmful in some way - issues relating to cyberbullying might fall into that category in some instances whereby, for example, children are bullying each other online but that may be extremely harmful content, for example, revenge porn or whatever, that might be categorised as criminal in nature - it is tricker to deal with precisely because it is not a criminal matter.  It may be harmful but it is trickier to deal with because there is not a universally accepted definition and it is not provided for under the e-commerce legislation.</p><p>If the definition as set out in this Bill sticks to criminal acts that are provided for, or are going to be provided for, it is probably on clearer legal ground than if it is going into less clear territory.  We will have more insights when we get legal advice back from the Attorney General's office.</p></speech>

This is one of three pieces of legislation to be dealt with in this Oireachtas term.  I congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on proposing, drafting and bringing it forward.  Deputy Howlin has a Bill on harmful offences and I have my Bill on social media regulation, on which some of the witnesses have been in attendance already and some are due to come before us in the near future.  There has been a focus on the online space in this Oireachtas which is welcome.  It is fast-moving and has been said already, some of the hearings that we had during the summer are almost obsolete now because of the events that have happened and moved on so quickly where steps have been taken both voluntarily and otherwise by the main stakeholders which is good to see.</p> <p>  It is a fast-moving space and one feature that those three pieces of legislation have in common is that they all relate to attempts at regulation.  We probably all agree - although the witnesses may not - that self-regulation is not desirable or ideal.  While it is welcome that attempts have been made at different times, it is always stronger if an independent third party body can try to impose that regulation.</p> <p>  On the specifics of the Bill, it looks  good, where I have read through it a number of times, as well as having followed the Second Stage debate.  Some of the feedback from today and previously goes to the heart of definitions and the devil is in the detail.  The trick with drafting is always to get it precise enough that it can be enforced but broad enough, as Mr. Meade has said, to be technology-agnostic or platform-agnostic, in order that it can be long-lived and robust enough that, in five or ten years time, it can still be applicable.  </p> <p>  There has been a lot of talk about the definition of harmful communications.  It is probably one of the main definitions that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has indicated he may want to draft or fine tune as we move towards the next Stages.</p> <p>  One interesting matter that also got a mention in the submissions to the Law Reform Commission's reports and in previous studies in this area - the commission's principal report on this issue was in early 2016, I believe, to which I made a submission - was section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  This is what we call the classic harassment, which is what we might call the pre-Internet harassment.  This would be the old stalking offence of knocking on someone's door or sending them postcards or harassing in more traditional ways.</p> <p>  There is a school of thought legally that section 10 could apply to the Internet as well.  The stumbling block to date has been that the offence or activity must be repeated to bring it under the definition of section 10.  Making a phone call or knocking on somebody's front door in a one-off action may not qualify in the traditional world.  Doing it ten times or 100 times would qualify.  There is a school of thought that says the nature of the Internet is something that is shared, so anything could be posted once, but it could be shared 100 if not 1,000 or 100,000 times.  That might bring it under the definition of section 10, which would mean the action was repeated which might be sufficient to bring a prosecution as it stands.</p> <p>  My first question is whether any of the witnesses has a view of this as to the existing legislation like section 10 of Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act or other legislation that may be out there, and are these sufficient or adequate?  Has the DPP or any other agency brought charges of this nature to date?  Have these types of issues come before the courts or received a sanction and, if so, under what legislation?  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' expertise.  If these issues have not arisen then what governance is in place?  Is it the case that there is a vacuum of governance?  If the existing legislation does not apply or has not led to any charges, what exactly is controlling the Internet space at the moment?  If the answer is nothing then that is very worrying but is all the more reason we need to accelerate this Bill and others like it.</p> <p>  Moving on and staying with the Bill, it is very positive, strong and a very good idea.  One thing that it does not appear to do is to create new offences.  This may be deliberate.</p><p>Deputy Howlin's Bill creates some offences.  Perhaps the legislation can be dovetailed so that the offences in other legislation would come under it.  In terms of sanctions, there has to be a carrot and a stick.  While there is provision in the Bill to seek an injunction in the Circuit Court, which is useful, the Data Protection Commissioner has powers to bring prosecutions in court as does the Companies Registration Office.  Perhaps that is something to be considered in Committee Stage amendments, if we get to that point.  There are many examples of statutory agencies which can bring a non-Garda prosecution.  Different Departments have similar powers.  I might come up with some amendments in that regard myself, but I could also work with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It might be worth adding to it.  On the carrot and stick approach, the concept is that the digital safety commissioner role would not only involve enforcement but would also provide an independent and objective agency in debates like the one on the digital age of consent which raged a couple of months ago and which I do propose to reopen today.  It got quite controversial at times.  An external agency unconnected to any of the platforms or to any political party would have the status to make recommendations on issues like that.  It would receive a good hearing and get good traction across the board.  There is a great opportunity, as envisaged in the Bill, for the commissioner to perform that advocacy and expert role, which would be useful.</p><p> To recap, I ask about legislation.  There is a question mark over section 10 and whether it could be applied at the moment.  Are there existing legislative provisions which apply?  If not, are we in a total vacuum?  What is the current legislative framework around these kinds of offences, if they even exist at the moment, and whether they can be prosecuted?  What has been the experience to date?</p></speech>

We can bring section 10 to its attention, as referred to by the Deputy, and ask if it feels that is relevant.  We will get a response there.  The question of the DPP is perhaps more properly a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department is in the space of illegal digital content.  I do not have the answer to be honest.  We have gone to the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of the Bill and await its advice.  However, we did not ask about offences or sanctions.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire can discuss that.</p></speech>

We supported that Bill.  Section 10 is out of date and needs to be updated because it does not take account of the very significant changes which have happened.  In relation to offences, Deputy Howlin's Bill and mine had their origins in the LRC paper published in early 2016.  In drafting the legislation on foot of the proposals of the commission, I was conscious of the fact that this is a specific proposal to establish an office and provide it with a remit.  While I am open-minded about it, I am not sure this Bill is a suitable place to update section 10, notwithstanding my support for the principle of updating the law on criminal offences and on creating new offences.  However, doing so in this Bill might complicate the work of establishing an office, providing it with a remit, and creating codes of practice and national minimum digital safety standards.  While I am open-minded, my initial view is that introducing criminal offences in the Bill would enter into the area of creating criminal justice legislation.  As such, our work could become complicated.</p> <p>  The argument is also relevant to the view I take on the definition of "harmful communication".  I spoke on last occasion we met about what that might involve.  I outlined that in general it would include distribution or publication of an intimate image of another person taken without consent, or threatening to do so; taking or distribution or publication of an intimate image of another without consent; distribution or publication of intimate material where it seriously interferes with privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other person; the distribution or publication of a threatening, false, indecent or obscene message to or about another person for the purpose of causing alarm, distress or harm to the other person, or where it is done persistently; and persistently communicating with a person in circumstances in which it seriously interferes with the other person's privacy or which cause alarm, distress or harm and any other inchoate behaviours related to the same.</p><p>I am working on the drafting with regard to how it would be structured.  We should be looking at behaviours.  I take on board the point made about consistency with the e-commerce directive.  When we ask the commissioner to take down material, we should outline to him or her, and the providers, the behaviours.  We should not ask them to adjudicate at the point of takedown on whether something is illegal because there are behaviours that are close to the line.  They might have to be removed quickly and for the person involved to get redress.  We should look at behaviours rather than seek to state that certain matters are illegal and that the illegal content should be removed.  They are required to do that anyway under the e-commerce directive.  We should target behaviours.  I agree with the point made about an independent external agency.  It is important and it is the principle on which we are all largely agreed.  I made the point at the previous committee meeting that the organisation is constantly in communication with the providers and platforms but it also receives complaints when they are unhappy with how the providers and platforms are addressing matters.  They will be the first to know of the changes in abuse and harassment and all these harmful communications.  They will be in a strong position to advise Government on any future criminal justice or policy approaches for example in the Department of Education and Skills.  All of that kind of stuff changes.  The curriculum might change with the NCCA.  It would be in a strong position to do that.</p></speech>

It is probably something they would be aware of.  Have any charges been brought under section 10?  Have the platforms been involved, not necessarily as a defendant but perhaps as a third party?  Have any of the platforms been in the court?  Are they aware of any existing legislation in an Irish context being used in this area to date?</p></speech>

I am not aware but I would have to check.  My understanding is there is a view that section 10 applies online but it has not been tested in many instances.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, I think it was the ambition of the LRC, with its draft Bill which Deputy Howlin has moved forward, to make it more explicit.  As I said earlier, we would be supportive of it where it is clearly defined and practical for the digital environment.  That is where one has to ask what harassment is because there are very different views on what the threshold is for different individuals.  Platforms would need very clear guidance on where that line is drawn so they would have legal certainty.</p></speech>

I do not have specific cases that were before the court.  As I said in my opening statement, our view is that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online.  Similarly, if there are offences that are clearly defined and which apply offline we support ensuring there is a corresponding offence online.  We support the spirit of ensuring that if there is an offence of harassment that it also apply online.  If there are any particular gaps in that, we think it would be worthwhile addressing.</p> <p>  In terms of cases before the courts, we have procedures for law enforcement to engage with us when it comes to gathering evidence for offences and so on.  I can provide some more information on that at a later date if the committee wishes.  If there is a clear offence, we can co-operate to help prosecution.</p></speech>

Mr. Church gave the horrific example of the young girl whose images were shared by a former boyfriend.  It is shocking.</p><p>There is wider concern that during this ten-year increase in the demand for online services, there has also been a significant increase in the incidence of depression and other psychological problems among our young people.  A lot of reports I read, and I must admit I have spent the past hour frantically reading as much as I could on the Internet via my own device, show a correlation between the increasing levels of depression, anxiety and other mental health difficulties among young people and the increase in the time young people are online.  The harm might not come just from the obvious graphic terrible example but in all sorts of subtle ways, such as exclusion or other mechanisms that affect mental health.  Do the witnesses make this direct connection?  Everything I have read from the various psychology sources shows an increasing level of depression, anxiety and mental health problems, particularly among young girls it would seem, so that we can make the correlation with the increased use of online services particularly on mobile phones.</p><p> Things have developed a lot recently with the passing last month by the European Parliament of the revision of the audiovisual media services directive.  I presume it is a foregone conclusion and that the Council will approve it before Christmas.  I understand that approximately 80% of all online content is video.  Did Ms Cronin state in her contribution that we are looking for regulatory bodies to manage some of this?  Given that the BAI is involved in the audiovisual media regulatory environment, and given that the report from the European Parliament had similar issues of concern to what we have here and it very strongly focused on the effect of online media services on young children, if we are looking for an institutional body to house regulation, the BAI might be suitable.  We could look at the Data Protection Commissioner or creating an new agency but the BAI might be best placed, given that it is so versed in audiovisual media.  What is the difference between online media and broadcast media?  For young people the vast majority is online.  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.</p><p> I am keen to hear from the companies on last month's report of the European Parliament.  Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the report call for the use of encryption and much greater parental control mechanisms to protect young children.  Paragraph 21 states personal data of minors processed in the framework of technical child protection measures should not be used for commercial purposes.  Does this not call into question the companies' entire commercial approach in the processing of minor's data in particular?  It must change.  As Tim Berners-Lee said yesterday, the companies are damaging the Internet and causing a threat to it and all the immense benefits it brings, and their commercial model must change.  How can the companies live up to the direction from the European Parliament in the new audiovisual media services directive if they do not know with absolute certainty the age of the child being dealt with?  We have heard in previous evidence that the current mechanisms they have in place clearly do not do this and the companies cannot tell if a child is 13, 15, 16 or eight.  They can say they do but they do not have effective commercial mechanisms to do it.  Does the new directive mean they must set in place new mechanisms to guarantee knowing the age of the minors who are on their networks so they can live by the commitment not to use the data for commercial purposes?  How can they do this if they do not know whether the person is a minor?  In this regard, Ms Cronin said age verification looks like one of the key new regulatory requirements we will see.</p><p>I do not have the exact wording but if I read her submission correctly the inclusion of age verification may well be one of the new regulatory measures we will seek to put in place.  I would welcome that, given the evidence Mr. Church and others have presented here on the health implications of the use of some of these services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Church" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018110600002#AA00200"><p>I will respond first.  The short answer is that there is no research to prove that correlation.  However, as I said earlier, we take many calls every day.  It is 1.05 p.m. now and Childline has probably received over 500 calls today.  I am only three months in the job so I am new to this and much of my time was spent listening and shadowing some of the calls.  I only relayed one case example today but there are hundreds.  What we are seeing, as well as from talking to the volunteers online, are behaviours that are causing significant issues for the child.  As the Deputy described, they are subtle things such as exclusion by not being invited to a party or not being part of a WhatsApp group, which in effect is bullying.  I mentioned earlier that we will have to start considering how we should categorise those calls.  If a child mentions in a confidential call that he or she is subject to online bullying, that is categorised as online bullying but far more conversations we are having with children every day are about issues they are having relating to online issues.  We would certainly love to see far more research around that and whether it is a correlation.  Intuitively, I would agree with the Deputy but there is no research that I know of to show that.</p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are seeing a slight decrease in telephone calls.  Incidentally, it is young boys who are calling online, which is interesting.  One would tend to think it would be girls calling because they are sometimes better at conversing, but the boys appear to find the online calls a great source of support.  We are seeing a switch from calls to online chat and this has forced us to upgrade our online platform, which we are launching next week.  With the launch of that platform we can get into many more in-depth conversations and that is when we will start gathering a great deal of research around this.</p></speech>

There is a clear dynamic.  I spoke to a principal yesterday in preparation for anti-bullying week next week and he said that in the ten years he has been a principal the change has been stark.  Obviously, in the early years as a principal he was dealing with bullying but the amount of online instances he now has to deal with is just incredible.  That has an impact on the schools each day.  As our survey showed, teachers are dealing with this in the classroom all the time.  Anecdotally, therefore, there is good evidence.</p> <p>  A survey published in the UK this year found that girls who were using social media at ten years of age for an hour a day are far more likely to have social and emotional problems at 15 years of age.  That was a five year longitudinal study, so some evidence is starting to emerge.  The children we are talking to are all in primary school and they largely value popularity over privacy.  They do not really understand the ramifications of sharing all sorts of things such as dick pictures, intimate images and children being told to kill themselves because of the colour of their skin or because of the way they look.  There is a great deal of harmful communication and the online-offline balance - how one treats people in real life versus how one treats them online - is not well understood.  That is why we keep returning to the education piece.</p></speech>

As he said it will either be a new one or an existing one.  Clearly the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is in the frame for that.  Because this is such a new area, we in the Department are taking the opportunity to travel and meet with many other member states to get a sense of their approach.  It is a big area.  The audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive will clearly be of particular significance to Ireland because of the platforms we have here.  We are therefore keen to learn from other member states about how they are managing.  We met with representatives from the UK, which I know is about to depart.  We will also be going to the Nordic countries.  We really want to go very broadly on this to make sure that we get it right because how to regulate this space is a very significant decision.</p><p> On age verification, the directive itself refers to protecting minors and the general public from certain audiovisual content and about protecting the general public from content, including advertising, the dissemination of which is a criminal offence.  These offences are terrorist-related offences, child sexual abuse material offences, and offences of racism and xenophobia.  The model proposed in the directive is one of co-regulation between the platforms and a regulatory body.  Part of that means that we will have to look at age verification and parental controls, because the Deputy is right, the directive does refer to minors.  We have 21 months to transpose the directive so we really are going to be very thorough in how we do this and we will try and get it-----</p></speech>

There is not a huge amount of research on the well-being front.  We recently commissioned some in the UK through a think tank called Demos.  One of the main findings coming out of that research and other research is that it is less about the amount of time than about what is done with that time.  Passive scrolling of content can be damaging in some cases whereas meaningful interactions can actually boost a sense of well-being.  There is, however, a dearth of research in the area and we are trying to address that.  It can be seen that Instagram in particular has a very strong focus on well-being.  It has a whole section dedicated to it.  It has introduced certain tools to help one limit one's screen time and to keep track of what one is doing.  Apple has a report which one might see flash up on one's phone if one uses an iPhone.  This report gives one a sense of how many notifications and how much screen time on average one has had per day.  Facebook is also looking to roll out tools based on time spent online and well-being.  I had thought that they would be rolled out by now.  We are waiting for confirmation of when that will happen but it is something we are thinking about.</p> <p>  I must admit that I do not know which European Parliament report the Deputy was referring to.</p></speech>

We are actually meeting with the BAI on Thursday, even though it is a little early for that.  It asked if we would meet so that we could start to get a handle on some of the challenges ahead if it does end up in that situation.  The guidance that will follow the actual directive in terms of determining the principal purpose of a service when it comes to video-sharing platforms should be issued sometime towards the end of the year.  A lot of this will only take shape when those guidelines come out.</p> <p>  The issue of age verification is a challenge.  It is something I have talked about here before.  One change that came about on our side on foot of the "Dispatches" programme, which the Deputy will recall we were before the committee to talk about on 1 August, is that prior to "Dispatches" we used to act with respect to underage accounts when we received a report - and I would encourage everyone here to report to us if they know of anyone under 13 who is using Instagram or Facebook because we will take action - whereas now, if we have any reason to believe that the user is underage, we will checkpoint that account.  This means that the person must provide identification to regain access.</p><p> There was a question about advertising and our commercial model.  Those under 18 years of age are protected from certain types of advertisements on Facebook and advertisements for gambling, alcohol, certain health products such as diet pills and dating apps will not be surfaced to them in their newsfeeds.  I take the wider point about the commercial model.  In general, it is an advertisement-funded free service and it does not give me much wriggle room to make concessions in respect of the model today.</p></speech>

As Mr. Meade mentioned, last year we launched Family Link whereby a parent can stay in the loop while his or her child uses his or her device or accesses his or her Google account.  The parent can set digital ground rules and screen-time rules, such as a bedtime rule or daily device limits, and a parent can manage the apps their children can download, as well as restrict websites and so on.  We prohibit personalised advertisements for users who have accounts managed with Family Link and the same is true in the case of YouTube Kids, our product for young people who want to use YouTube.  We have other restricting policies in which there are no advertisements for food and beverages or for health and beauty products.  Any advertisers using Google services cannot specifically target anyone under the age of 18.</p></speech>

That is a very important issue and something we think about a lot internally.  We want to strike the right balance whereby we can confirm someone's age but without asking him or her for additional information, such as a copy of his or her passport or Government identification.  If a person aged under 16 tries to set up a Google account, we will ask him or her to get his or her parent to use Family Link.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire certainly has his finger on the pulse.  The issue of definition will be the deciding factor in the context of the Bill and we will need to see the Deputy's work on that aspect at some point.  The criteria are very important and, while he provided a brief outline, I would welcome the text when it is ready because it will give us the basis on how to move forward and guide us as to how implementable the Bill will be.  Future-proofing will also be a major issue because the Bill will need some longevity.  We have seen dramatic changes in the industry in the past three or four years and I am sure there will be more changes in the years to come.  How will we frame it to make sure it is future-proofed?</p> <p>  Ms Quill referred to the issue of European legislation versus national legislation.  Can the Department provide an up-to-date view on how domestic legislation will affect a global giant based in Ireland?  If the Bill is enacted, will it be for the 4 million people of Ireland or given that a company might have its European headquarters here, will we be policing that company's entire European network?</p><p>Are we going to be stuck with legislation which will look to solve an Irish issue?  Unfortunately the global content will still play a part.  How can we police the global content?   We all have friends from all over the world.  How will this interaction happen?  If one posts something in another jurisdiction and then travel to this jurisdiction, who polices that content?  Is it policed in the place where it was posted or where it was received?  How does that all tie together?  We are operating as a global entity.  </p><p> I have mentioned the advertisements we see on Facebook and Google at this time of the year.  Now that Halloween is over, Christmas advertisements have started to spring up on my iPad, which my daughters use on a regular basis.  The advertisements are about Christmas shopping, Santa Claus and so on.  Is that the market the companies are targeting?  I am referring particularly to Google Kids, which is very popular in my household, and similar websites.  Is there a major drive for commercial gain from that platform through the children using it?  The first 30 seconds of whatever they watch is going to be an advertisement about something.  Is that an issue that must be addressed?  It is quite pervasive.  The shopping list for Santa is done already because of those advertisements.  Is that a big issue we should look at and address?  Do the witnesses feel that that kind of information should be screened?</p></speech>

European legislation applies throughout the European Union.  For example, we will regulate Facebook and Google, insofar as they fall within that directive, for all content throughout Europe because those companies are established here.  However, the digital safety commissioner Bill is national legislation.  If content impacts on an Irish citizen but the company involved is not established in Ireland there are real concerns about how, or if, it could be brought within the scope of this legislation.  We have sought advice on this matter from the Attorney General, because extra-territoriality is a factor.  Irish law may not reach into that area for those companies.  Unless Europe legislated for something similar to a digital safety commissioner, it will have no reach under this legislation.  Europe is moving more in that direction in terms of criminal and illegal content - a new terrorism regulation is being discussed at the moment - but it has not begun discussions about content of this nature.  There are certainly extra-territoriality issues to be considered in respect of this Bill, and a discussion to be had as to how far it can or should apply under Irish law.</p></speech>

The value of this process is that it allows for discussion and for the teasing out of those issues.  The committee will get a draft, and I repeat to any of the organisations that are here or that are listening in that it would be valuable to hear their views on what the definition should be or any ideas they have about the specific drafting.</p><p>The point regarding its future-proofing is important.  That is the reason this legislation is largely focused on the principles, procedures, structures and so on rather than necessarily going into specific technologies or forms of communication with respect to defining - as we have to do - what is harmful communication and also in terms of the harm that it does.  The legislation will have to be revised at later Stages, as in the case of any legislation, but it outlines the framework and principles well.</p><p> Regarding the point on jurisdiction, as I addressed it substantially at the previous committee meeting, I will not go over the full text of what I stated on that occasion.  The extra-territorial effect of this Bill is not particularly radical.  It is limited to situations where the communication affects an Irish person ordinarily resident in the State and the means of communication used in connection with such harmful communication is within the control of an undertaking or company established under the law of the State or where such harmful communications affect an Irish person ordinarily resident in the State where the means of communication are within the control of an undertaking established under the law of another state and where a court established in this State would have jurisdiction to give notice of service in that respect.  This Bill is not particularly out of line with other legislation in place in this jurisdiction in terms of its extra-territorial effect, and I can send the Senator correspondence on that.  </p><p> Undertakings would have certificates of compliance if they are compliant with sections 4 and 5.  It would be desirable for any significant platform undertaking to be seen to be complaint and that users, and particularly parents, would be aware that it was compliant.  If an undertaking is based outside this jurisdiction and it wants people in Ireland to use it, it will have to develop standards to reach the level of a certificate of compliance.  It would be possible to give notice and to initiate proceedings.  Some difficulties probably need to be sorted out but process involved in attaining a certificate of compliance is a value in that regard.</p></speech>

I was in Dundrum on Sunday and saw all the Christmas decorations, and thought the season is here.</p> <p>  Most of our services are ad-supported.  We made the decision to offer YouTube Kids as a free app so that everybody could have access to it.  As I mentioned, we have stricter advertisement policies but there are content creators who invest a good deal of money and time in trying to develop the spun and educational content.  We have to find a way to fund them.  In Ireland, there is YouTube Premium,  which I believe is approximately &euro;11.99 per month.  That carries over to YouTube Kids, so one can get a non-advertisement version of YouTube Kids under a subscription service.  These are important questions and we are trying to strike the right balance with the policies we have developed for YouTube Kids while also being able to offer the app to as many people as possible.</p></speech>

It refers to the 1 August hearing of the committee.  I want to correct the record on one matter.  It is a small issue.  I do not know if it will be of major concern to the committee but at one point in time when Deputy Dooley was asking us about training materials being used at our outsource partner, CPL, for the training of content reviewers, we had been given to understand that the PowerPoint decks that were being used had been changed.  As part of the investigation we have carried out in that interim period, we are now clear that they were not changed.</p><p>It was hard to figure out the context of some of the material that was being shown in the programme because we did not have the before and after story.  That was an example that had come up in the course of somebody's work and they were taking a second look at it as a team.  It was not part of the normal training materials that had been produced.  I just wanted to make sure that this was corrected on the record, because we did give the impression that it had been changed and that was not the case.</p></speech>

The committee was invited to attend a meeting last Wednesday with officials and the Minister.  Myself and Deputy Thomas Byrne were pleased to attend that meeting.  It was a useful.  It is also important we have the opportunity to engage and discuss some of the issues here.</p><p>The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement.  That will be followed by an engagement with members of the committee.  Before we begin, I wish to draw everyone's attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  I call the Minister, Deputy McHugh.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an t-&aacute;bhar seo iontach t&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute;im ag d&uacute;il go m&oacute;r leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht le baill den choiste.  I appreciate the opportunity to update the committee today on the structural assessments undertaken in 42 schools constructed by Western Building Systems and the next steps to be taken by the Department of Education and Skills.  I am joined by the head of the planning and building division, Mr. Hubert Loftus.  I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for their help and positive suggestions throughout this process.</p> <p>  We have tried to keep the members of the committee informed and have been in regular contact with the clerk and members.  We also invited members to a briefing last week in Tullamore, where the Department's management of this challenging situation was co-ordinated.  Three Department teams focused on operations, communications and interim accommodation.  They worked intensively over the past two weeks to co-ordinate the full programme of structural assessments and the implementation of precautionary measures.  They also worked to provide support to schools as required in respect of interim accommodation needs and to ensure progress was communicated to schools and the public.</p> <p>  Getting to where we are today has only been possible thanks to the collective efforts of parents, school principals, patrons, boards of management and Department officials as well as the project managers, structural engineers and contractors who pulled out all the stops to facilitate the reopening of schools this week.  I acknowledge the disruption and inconvenience caused to pupils and parents over the last number of weeks and the impact this has had on parents' life and work.  I am conscious that there has been a particularly heavy burden on school principals.  They have been dealing with the operational impacts of the assessments and related precautionary measures.  I thank them in particular for their ongoing co-operation.</p> <p>  The outcome of all 42 structural assessments, including the full list of schools requiring precautionary measures, was published on 1 November.  The summary of the current situation is as follows.  There were 19 schools fully cleared to open this week without any precautionary works.  A further 19 schools were enabled to open in full following external precautionary measures in the form of a fence around a building, or part of a building, and protective decking at all entrances and exits.  Three schools, two in Tyrrelstown and one in Lucan, are being enabled to open, initially at ground floor level only, following the implementation of both internal engineering solutions and external precautionary measures.</p> <p>  Following a meeting between Department officials and school authorities in Tyrrelstown yesterday, additional work is continuing to address some of the operational impacts of the precautionary measures and other logistical issues such as traffic management.  All parties are working towards the reopening of the Tyrrelstown school, initially at ground floor level only with other classes accommodated off-site.  Finally, one building on this list, phase one of Ardgillan community college, remains closed.  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, ETB, has made arrangements for the displaced classes to be accommodated, including through the use of a shared community centre and facilities at another school.</p> <p>  It is important to underline our priority over the mid-term break was to ensure that the structural assessments were conducted and any precautionary measures implemented to ensure safe occupancy this week.  We will be moving as quickly as possible to the next phase.  That is to initiate more detailed structural investigations at all the 42 schools and, following on from that, to implement the permanent remediation works required.  We cannot give a precise timeframe at this time for the duration of precautionary measures or the implementation of permanent works.</p> <p>  That will depend on the outcome of the next phase of the investigations.  Every effort, however, will be made to keep the duration of temporary measures to a minimum.  We fully intend to pursue Western Building Systems through all contractual and legal channels for the cost of the precautionary measures and the remediation work, where required.  It is also our intention, at the appropriate time, to initiative a programme-level review of the Department's design and build programme to include aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight.  The review will look at aspects both pre- and post-implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014.  The results of the more detailed structural assessments at Western Building Systems' constructed schools will be necessary to inform this review.  I am happy to take questions or listen to comments.</p></speech>

I encouraged him to do that when I met him last week and I still encourage him to do that.  It is very important.  I previously expressed concerns that it seems to have taken three years simply to issue proceedings in court in regard to issues with fire safety certificates.  I am concerned about that as well the Statute of Limitations and time limits.  Will the Minister also be pursuing the other professionals involved?  I refer to architects, those who completed certificates of compliance and those who acted on the Department's behalf as well.  Will the Minister be dealing with other people?</p> <p>  At this committee last year, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, decided very suddenly to start to appoint clerks of works on Department school building projects.  Will the Minister give us an update as to how that scheme has been rolled out by the Department?  Are there clerks of works at every major building project which the Department is overseeing at the moment?  Will the Minister also let me know the cost of the fire safety audits that seem to have taken place at the start of this?  They were announced last year.</p> <p>  Outside of Western Building Systems, in regard to other schools where there are applications for emergency works, are there many outstanding applications at the moment that concern fire safety and are there many that concern structural issues?  I refer to those in the Department now.  I also want to ask about the certificates of completion.  I want the Minister to be as clear as possible as to what their purpose is from the Department's point of view, whether before or after 2014.  As I understand it, in certificates of substantial completion, it is the case that the Department, as the purchaser, relies on certificates of compliance that have been issued.  There is also, however, a defects list that the Department would have engaged people to complete.  Is the Minister satisfied with the work done on behalf of the Department in dealing with those defects?</p> <p>  I am not sure how useful this is, but a package of documents came into my possession today and it included certificates of substantial completion for many of the schools.  Somebody sent me the snag list from a number of years ago for Ardgillan college.  I hope the Minister can answer this question.  There were some issues there.  Toilets, latch way harnesses, toilet roll holders, fire extinguishers, boiler houses and gas meter cages were some of the items listed.</p><p>They are relatively minor items, apart from the fire safety equipment.  Is the Minister dissatisfied by the fact that major issues were not revealed at that time in terms of who the Department employed to deal with the defects or would he say these major defects simply would not be part of this particular process?</p><p> Is the Department engaging with local authorities, which are the building control authorities, on proceedings they might issue?  Is any local authority investigating this matter to the Minister's knowledge?  As I understand it, breaches of building control regulations carry fines and potential prison sentences.  Is this something the Minister has pursued with the Department, particularly in the context of Ardgillan community college and whether it is possible within the time limits set out in building control regulations?  The truth is that what was discovered at Ardgillan community college sent a shiver down the nation's spine last week.  There is no doubt about that.  The same applies to some of the other schools.  Quite honestly, the same applies to any school where remedial works had to be carried out.  It implies a breach of building control regulations and does imply criminal sanction.  Is this something into which the Minister has looked?  I might come back with some follow-up questions.  I have asked some major questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  Needless to say, the entire scenario is very worrying for parents and school communities.  In September 2017, fire safety audits were announced for schools.  Have these been carried out for all of the schools built by Western Building Systems?  If so, when were they carried out, by whom and what were the results?  Were the schools sent the reports relating to these audits?  When the announcement in this regard was made in 2017, we were told it would take four months to complete the fire safety audits for 25 schools.  How can entire structural audits be done in less than two weeks?  Why would it take four months to do a fire safety check on these schools?</p> <p>  In 2017, as Deputy Thomas Byrne stated, the previous Minister indicated that the Department would proceed to appoint a clerk of works for building project commissions.  Has this happened?  Does the proposal to appoint a clerk of works to school projects mean that neither the Minister nor his predecessor have faith in the building control system to deliver safe quality schools?  This is particularly worrying because some of these schools were constructed under the revised 2014 building regulations regime.  If there is no faith in the building regulations does this mean other Departments should follow suit?  What about the Department of Health?  Should a clerk of works be appointed for all major health projects, such as that relating to the new children's hospital?  How far-reaching should this be if the Department does not have faith in school building projects?</p> <p>  With regard to the recent structural audits and the 19 schools that have reopened with external fencing in place, what are the risks being addressed by this fencing?  Why was it determined that the schools were nonetheless safe?  As Deputy Thomas Byrne asked, has any of the parties given an undertaking to the Department that it will pay for the works to be done?  What is the estimated cost?  I presume Western Building Systems will certainly not be carrying out any of the remedial works.  Will the Minister clarify the position?</p> <p>  What contingency plans were put in place prior to the fire audits in order to provide alternative arrangements for schools if something were to be discovered?  I presume contingency plans have been put in place for the structural audits and I presume something was in place in the event of a fire safety audit requiring closure.  In the instances where the closure of a school is affecting other community facilities, such as in Tyrrelstown, is there a contingency plan or other arrangements for the communities there?  They are really suffering.  We all saw the news reports last week regarding the basketball team.  What is being put in place to help other community events in areas that have little or no free space?  For how long will the community centre will be shut?</p> <p>  When the Minister's predecessor came before the committee last September, we asked about the rules for disallowing contractors to tender.  He indicated that one of the rules relates to grave professional misconduct.  Does this mean that Western Building Systems cannot tender, particularly as what happened in this instance certainly constitutes grave professional misconduct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#C00400"><p>There has been enormous consternation and devastation in the local community for the past two weeks.  Notwithstanding efforts by the Government and the officials of the Department, we have total disruption in two fine schools where the teachers are completely dedicated to the children.  I was there again yesterday viewing the temporary works.  These were lovely schools and they are now surrounded by very ugly scaffolding that I assume will be boxed off for the safety of the children because otherwise it would be quite dangerous.  What were beautiful buildings in terms of appearance and experience, notwithstanding snag lists, will only be in partial use.  How long does the Minister expect the partial use of the ground floors to continue?  Does he have an estimate of when St. Luke's national school and Tyrrelstown Educate Together will reopen?  When it was announced two weeks ago, I was speaking to teachers with tears in their eyes because they were so devastated at the disruption.  Does the Minister have a plan as to how to put in place a full recovery and compensation for the schools so they will be able to catch up with what they have missed?</p> <p>  Has the Minister considered initiating an inquiry into what exactly happened, perhaps involving somebody from a buildings background, whether an architect or a structural engineer, and perhaps a senior barrister?  We spend a great deal on schools.  These buildings were constructed in lovely communities in Tyrrelstown and Hollystown, which have great pride in the two schools.  I want the Minister to be aware of this because some of the media commentary has not acknowledged how great these two schools, their staff, the parents and the entire communities have been.  There will have to be an inquiry.  Will the Minister commit to one?  There are all sorts of rumours circulating.  Some people say that it was spotted because of fire safety issues following the examinations ordered after the Grenfell Tower fire.  Will the Minister enlighten us on this?</p> <p>  Is the Minister aware that the two schools and the community centre between provide early education and after-school care services?  In a huge number of cases in the area, one or both parents in families work.  They have been left in a considerable state of disruption regarding their arrangements for after-school care whereby they are relying on their employers to be kind and to take what has happened into account.  They may have one child going to school and a toddler going to the preschool under the early childhood care and education scheme.</p> <p>  Will the Minister give us an indication of what will be the cost of the remedial works?  Has he considered asking by the end of the year for a special allocation from the Government through a Supplementary Estimate to meet the cost of these works?</p><p>From my experience, I believe a Supplementary Estimate will be necessary.  Without it, the Minister will delay further what had become a quite delayed schools building programme during the tenure of his predecessor.  The whole process has slowed down.  For instance, in my area a new community college that opened just last year, Edmund Rice College, is hosted by the neighbouring school, Le Ch&eacute;ile.  We have no idea where it will find its permanent home.  Very little information is being provided to the large community in Dublin 15.  The large number of children there are totally dependent on quality education and quality teachers.  The teachers in the area are fabulous but the Minister needs to commit in a positive way to giving considerable reassurance to them and the community.  These teachers are skilled educators who are totally committed to the children.  Can the Minister make it clear that everything they have lost will be made up for and that he will be seeking a Supplementary Estimate in order that the rest of the schools building programme, not only in Dublin West but also throughout Ireland, may be continued?  We are all aware of projects in our constituencies.</p><p> Either before or after he has commissioned a report, can the Minister state, from the Department's point of view, what is involved technically in standing down a particular contractor where there have been problems as serious as those in question?  Does it ultimately have to go to court?  Is the Minister or Department in a position to make executive decisions on the really serious questions that have arisen regarding some of the works carried out by the builders in question?</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to respond.</p></speech>

There will be specific questions I will not be in a position to answer but I will be happy to obtain the information sought.  If there are elements I miss out on, Mr. Hubert Loftus will be more familiar with them and their history.</p> <p>  Let me deal first with the issues raised by Deputy Thomas Byrne.  I agree with him that a number of players are involved; it is not just the contractor.  It is very much set out in the building control legislation that there is a weight of responsibility on those concerned, be it designers, architects or contractors.  We will pursue every possible channel to ensure that whatever costs exist at a remedial level can be met. We will also pursue any disruption costs as best we can.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the 2017 clerk of works.  Since 2017, every single school has a clerk of works.  Even though there is a clerk of works on site, he or she does not have ultimate responsibility for certifying work.  The clerk of works is not looking down the cavity wall to ensure the wall ties are in.  This goes back to vigilance, supervision and the question of where responsibility lies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#D00400"><p>What is the clerk of works doing if he or she is not checking that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#D00500"><p>The clerk of works is ensuring the work continues.  Obviously, there is vigilance.  If there is a good clerk of works on site, he or she will be taking photographs and doing all the necessary work.  In the past two years, I was speaking to the clerk of works on a school project in Donegal.  He was telling me that every day he was on site he was taking photographs and being vigilant.  The work can be done at clerk of works level but the clerk of works is not responsible for certification.  It is still a matter of self-certification from the point of view of the contractor, designer or architect.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin made a suggestion on learnings from the investigation.  Deputy Burton asked whether there will be an inquiry.  There has to be an inquiry, in whatever form.  I will be happy to pursue this to determine what we can learn from it, even regarding the period after 2014.  The Deputy also asked about the certificates of completion and compliance.  At every stage, responsibility for compliance rests with the contractor of the design team.  This is where responsibility for the certification of compliance lies.  Certification of completion occurs when the project is completed within a certain period.  The Department has a role in that regard.</p> <p>  We all heard about Ardgillan college and its defects at the same time.  Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to the fire assessment, boiler house and toilets.  At no time were any of the fire safety assessments pointing to structural issues.  In Ardgillan, a fire safety assessment concerning the cavity wall resulted in officials from the Department being alerted.  They put a team in place to explore further whether there are structural issues.  At no time during all the fire assessments was there any indication that there were defects, such as the lack of wall ties or the inner timber relief not being joined properly to the steel structure.  The weaknesses came to my attention and that of the Department only when the wall opening in Ardgillan happened on the Friday in question.</p></speech>

Would the Department have expected them to check the most serious issues and not just items such as toilet roll holders?  One of the items on the snag list was to finish the painting of gas pipes.  Are those concerned not considering more serious issues?</p></speech>

The structural issues identified were within the cavity.  The building is closed up when the snag list is produced.  The snag list has more to do with the operational elements.</p> <p>  With regard to the clerk of works, the arrangement applies to all the major projects since 2017.  It involves an additional strengthening of procedures when the fire safety programme was initiated in 2017.</p></speech>

In this case, the Department got a project management company, mechanical, electrical, lighting and energy consultants, and a leading firm of architects.  Therefore, quite detailed inspections were done of Ardgillan college by the Department before the money was issued, yet it did not discover the problems.  Mr. Loftus is really telling me it was not its job to discover the most serious problems that could possibly exist, namely, the structural and fire safety problems.</p></speech>

I contacted the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, on many occasions about having clerks of works on site.  Particularly with traditional parish schools, as opposed to some of the new schools, one is relying on the chairman of the board, somebody on the board with some building knowledge and a couple of others to be the building committee.  The principal is also involved.  The principal may or may not have knowledge about, a taste for or interest in a building proposal.  Consider the level of responsibility that still applies.</p><p>I have a few friends in Dublin West who are on committees for certain schools that are being built, refurbished and so on.  To be honest, it is an incredible burden on them.  Will the Minister outline a little further what the clerks of works are doing?  I am sure he knows from his experience in County Donegal the burden placed on those in the schools governance structure in running effectively a &euro;5 million to &euro;12 million project.  It is more than lay-people can often take on, but, in fairness to them, they do.</p></speech>

Since 2017, they have all had a clerk of works.  The clerk of works is not necessarily the professional - the architect or engineer - but someone with a knowledge of and background in building.  In layman's terms, his or her role is to be the eyes and ears of the employer's representative on the ground to hear about and see things and report back if any issue of concern arises or on how the building project is being delivered.  It is an additional resource which we have put in place automatically for all large-scale projects since 2017.  It was done in the context of the issues that had arisen in terms of fire safety and we saw it as an important additional measure.  The programme level review we envisage for the design and build programme will see how the clerk of works element put in place in 2017 and the strengthening of procedures help the situation and what added value they bring.</p></speech>

That was our immediate priority.  Separately we have initiated legal proceedings against Western Building Systems in the context of fire safety measures.  All of the structural issues that have come through, including building controls, will feed into our engagement with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#E01400"><p>I agree with Deputy Catherine Martin that it has created a lot of worry and concern and been a body blow to individual communities that were very much part and parcel of ensuring the school projects came to fruition in the first place.  I agree completely with her assertion that it is a worrying time, but safety has been at the heart of our deliberations.  I remember that when the problem first emerged, we were faced with two issues, the first of which was ensuring the safety of the staff and pupils.  The second was trying to ensure continuity in the education of the children in the classroom.  They were our two main foci in the past two weeks.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the decision made in September 2017.  That matter has been cleared up.  There has been a clerk of works for all major building projects since 2017.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many WBS schools had been assessed.  Of the 55 schools, I think reports on 51 have been forwarded to the Department.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the regime post-2014.  There are four schools.  There is a three school campus in Ashbourne, as well as Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maude in Tallaght.  There is concern about the external walls in these schools that has to be backed up with evidence and engineering assessments.  </p> <p>  The next phase involves the 19 schools identified in which, for example, there is the potential absence of wall ties but in which there is no immediate or imminent danger.  We will be pursuing an intensive and comprehensive programme of works to assess the extent of the problems in these schools and ensure they will be rectified.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about external fencing and the making of payments.  At this stage, as far as I am aware, there is no indication of payments being made by WBS.  The estimation of cost will be based on the extent and nature of the works required.  We are trying to evaluate and assess the extent of the works required in all 42 schools.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced fire audits and asked is there was correlation between them and structural assessments.  While there could be issues with doorstops and and doors not opening properly, that never is an indication that there are structural issues within the cavity walls.  While all of the fire assessments were being carried out, at no stage were structural weaknesses identified until the opening of the walls at Ardgillan community college on the Friday afternoon.</p></speech>

Are there contingency arrangements in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#E01600"><p>I presume the Department was liaising at every stage with fire safety personnel.  Mr. Loftus might come in on what happened before I was <i>in situ</i>, but I know that, once the concern about a potential structural weakness emerged in late August, a team and a programme of work were set in place.  The potential concern emerged in Tyrrelstown.  Because Ardgillan community college was being assessed through a different fire safety stream and was not part of the 55 schools, it was decided to make it part of that assessment process.  That is how we ended up in this place.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned community facilities.  Obviously, a lot of disruption is being caused in the communities affected.  For example, basketball teams are looking for facilities.  The community building in Tyrrelstown is open again.  The ground floor is open in Tyrrelstown and also in Lucan.  Within a matter of weeks we needed to have strengthening and support work done on the first floor.  We will also need strengthening and support work done on the second floor in both schools in Tyrrelstown to ensure the disruption will not continue.  It will be done in within a matter of weeks.  When can the work be done?  It will have to be done at weekends.  It cannot be done when the students are on site in a learning environment.  We will have to figure out a way to ensure the strengthening and support work on the first and second floors will be completed.</p><p>The Deputy talked about how grave professional misconduct was dealt with in legislation.  Obviously, we are taking the matter very seriously, which is why I have met the Attorney General.  The Department's legal team is in contact with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and we will pursue every possible channel to ensure we get justice, not just from the point of view of the taxpayer but also for the communities affected.</p></speech>

As he mentioned, self-certification is the issue.  We are seeing the same issue in apartments.  Experts are saying it does not work.  Therefore, the Government needs to revisit the issue.</p><p>Regarding the major projects, what about an extension to a school or a PE hall?  Do they get that extra layer of oversight structurally?  The Minister referred to the external fencing.  I asked what risk is being addressed with that external fencing and how those schools are nonetheless safe.  I presume Western Building Systems will not be carrying out any of the remedial work.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#F00200"><p>That is correct.  The reason there are precautionary measures is that there is an ultra cautious approach to the 19 schools.  Initial assessments are that there is a suspicion of a lack of wall ties.  There is no immediate danger but the judgment was made that there is an issue with structural weakness.  For example, there is a three school campus in Ashbourne and the total length of the fence is 3 km.  That gives an indication of the extent of the work that took place and the type of logistical exercise involved over the bank holiday weekend.  It is to reassure the parents who are sending their children to these 19 schools.  I spoke to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, this morning and two of his boys are attending one of the schools in Macroom.  Its external walls are raising a concern about a potential absence of wall ties.  However, until we get a full evaluation and assessment of the extent of the problem we have taken the ultra precautionary measure of putting fencing around these schools.</p> <p>  It is ultra cautious on my part.  From day one I was on the same hymn sheet as my officials about safety so we are taking this ultra cautious approach.  The extent of the problem in some of these schools is not the same.  Some will need more work than others.  In fact, in one school it is only one gable wall but we have taken the precautionary approach of having the fencing around all 19 schools.  The two Tyrrelstown schools and Eiscir Riada in Lucan have internal and external issues and that is why that approach has been taken.  Ardgillan is in a different position and we have closed down that building.  Phase 1 was built in 2009.  Phase 2 was built in 2015 and it does not have any structural issues and that is why that school is operating since yesterday morning.  Eiscir Riada in Lucan is in the same situation as Tyrrelstown.  It opened yesterday morning for the junior students to attend.</p> <p>  That is not to say that the concerns are different in different schools.  The Tyrrelstown's boards of management and principals took a decision because of the logistics of moving children to different settings.  They took the cautious and safety approach which was the right decision.  They wanted the extra time to reassure parents.  Parents will be afforded an opportunity tomorrow to visit Tyrrelstown and meet the engineers from PUNCH Consulting Engineers, departmental officials and the staff so they are reassured before they send their children back on Thursday morning.</p></speech>

One of the aspects of the programme level review the Department intends to undertake will be looking at the pre-BCAR and post-BCAR element.  At this point we have erred on the side of caution and taken a precautionary approach with the external fencing that covers the Ashbourne projects and the Tallaght project, which are post-BCAR.  It is only when we get into more detailed investigations that we will see whether there is more substance to any issues in those schools.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned major projects such as extensions and PE halls.  If they are of the scale that is a major project on our building programme they would have a clerk of works as well.</p></speech>

This is an area where I want to ensure we have proper procedures and vigilance in place.  I have been comparing it with Northern Ireland and the UK.  They have a heavily resourced building control unit in their local authorities.  Obviously then it is a question of Exchequer funding because if one tries to replicate that model it is down to resources.  Having found myself in this position so new in the job I believe we must examine every way in which we can have more vigilance.  Families today are wondering what happened and what went wrong so we owe it to them and to the taxpayer to ensure that happens.  There are plenty of structural engineers so one of the issues I will be examining as part of this overall review is whether we can have a more systematic approach to having that type of vigilance in place as well.  Again, it is a question of resourcing.  These are the issues we have to grapple with.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton talked about the disruption.  Yes, it is not great to be looking at scaffolding first thing in the morning when one goes to school.  She will appreciate that the decision I and the Department were faced with was about safety.  Young people are adaptable and interested in learning so they will be taking note of the process going on around them, whether it is internal or external.  I went to Tyrrelstown and met the two principals and members of the boards of management.  The Deputy is right that they are beautiful buildings from the outside, and parents had confidence that they were okay on the inside as well.  That trust was broken and-----</p></speech>

How we do that is the foremost question on our minds.</p> <p>  I answered the question about the partial use of the ground floor.  We are expecting to move onto the first and second floors in a matter of weeks.  Eiscir Riada in Lucan is a two-storey building so we will be seeking to do that on the first floor and also to do the first and second floors in both schools in Tyrrelstown.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about full recovery and compensation.  She also mentioned loss but I do not know if she was referring to teaching time or compensation for the cost of remedial work.</p></speech>

There has been a huge disruption to the education schedule of the teachers in the two schools.  Will arrangements be made to compensate for that?  My other question was whether the Minister will be seeking a Supplementary Estimate.  There is the disruption to the education side of the schools but it is also to the childcare and sports facilities.  Happily, the community centre does not appear to be affected.</p></speech>

We do not even have a costing for the temporary remedial work over the last two weeks.  Obviously, I will have to deal with that.  I will also be talking to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, about treating this as an extreme measure.  I am treating it as a very extreme measure.  At the same time our first port of call is accountability and culpability and we will be following up through the appropriate channels in that regard.  Until I know exactly what this will cost I am not in a position to go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to seek extra money.</p><p>We will initiate an inquiry and it is our intention to initiate this programme-level review of the Department's design and build programme at the appropriate time.  It will look at whether rapid response to building is the right way to build.  It will include procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight.  We have to look at everything.  We owe the people nothing less.  </p><p> Deputy Burton spoke about the community and the pride in the two schools.  I picked that up on the ground in Tyrrelstown.  There is disappointment on one hand but on the other hand, it is about how we move forward because my duty of care is to ensure those two schools get the adequate response to ensure they will be part of that community for a long time, be it Lucan, Tyrrelstown or any other part of the country.  </p><p> The Grenfell Tower fire was mentioned.  Let us be honest; this fire happened in June 2017.  These assessments of the 55 schools came in September 2017.  Obviously, there was a lot of triggering here.  The Grenfell Tower fire brought a lot of focus not just to this Department but other Departments.  Once those 55 assessments were complete, there was a triggering of the suspicion in late August 2018 that fast-tracked putting a team in place to check out the schools in Tyrrelstown and Ardgillan. </p><p> We do not yet know the cost of remedial works.  We must wait and see what the figure is.  A question was asked about the standing down of a contractor.  We are having conversations with the Attorney General regarding many matters, one of which is future contracts.  </p></speech>

We have not had to go looking for this information so the fact that the Minister has been proactive and has provided us with information along the way has been helpful.  As the Minister is aware, my daughter is in Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maude, which has fencing on the outside of the building.  I listened to what Deputy Thomas Byrne said about the small snag tests.  When they first moved into that school, my daughter ended up locked in a toilet as the handles were falling off bathroom doors within a few weeks of the school opening.  This does not seem too serious.  Obviously, she had to be rescued by the caretaker, which was not nice for her, but a worst-case scenario would have been if there was something structurally wrong with the building or a fire happened when she was locked in the bathroom.  I know this is going to the extreme but there are situations where these things happen and it is quite worrying both for schools and in terms of building standards relating to apartments and it opens up a wider conversation.</p> <p>  Perhaps I do not understand it properly but could the Minister explain the tender process?  Are we going with the cheapest providers?  What is in place from the Department and what expertise exists within the Department in respect of going through the tender process in terms of quality assurance and oversight to ensure we choose a company that will do an adequate job?  So many schools are affected in one way or another.  It does not just affect one or two and it is not just a mishap.  It has happened so consistently that there is no way that there was not something in the contractor's reputation in terms of cutting corners before it was taken on as a contractor by the Department.  It is obvious in so many schools that the contractor did not meet standards and comply with building regulations.  </p> <p>  I am curious about the role of the clerk of works, which only came in during 2017.  What was the motivation for bringing in a clerk of works?  Was there a suspicion at that stage that we would need a clerk of works that did not exist previously in the other schools?  Who had oversight of these schools prior to 2017?  What expertise existed in the Department to engage throughout the building process and not just when the building providers were on site?  What type of engagement happened back and forth throughout the process?  </p> <p>  Did the Department just accept self-declaration or was it proactive in making sure the checks on the schools were done?  Obviously, they were not done if this many issues with them have arisen.  Consequently, it seems like the Department was almost absent throughout the entire building process if nothing was picked up in terms of having expertise on the ground?  </p> <p>  The Minister responded to Deputy Thomas Byrne about snags and schools that have already been built.  What work was carried out on the schools in the past few weeks that raised suspicion?  Could the Minister talk me through how the Department comes to know there is a lack of wall ties or a structural issue?  What tests are carried at that point to reveal that?  Does it not make sense that as part of an overall snag test, those rigorous tests are carried out before a school even opens?  </p> <p>  External stuff involves wall ties, which the Minister mentioned a few times.  I do not understand the severity of what has gone wrong in the schools that have had to close.  What exactly is wrong?  What level of negligence took place in the building of those schools?  </p> <p>  We talk about lessons learned.  I know it is early in the process but what does the Minister regard as obvious in terms of making sure this never happens again, particularly in a place with a significant number of children?  How do we stop this from happening again?  What needs to happen to remove the reliance on self-certification?  What type of expertise exists in Mr. Loftus's division, which concerns planning and building?  Are there architects there?  Who in that Department has the expertise to oversee the building of schools?  </p></speech>

No school in my constituency in either county has been affected so I have not had the same contact with parents as other members of the committee and Deputies here.  Not so long ago, there was an issue with tools being downed in the case of schools built through public private partnerships.  As we now face issues relating to contractors, it shines a light on what happens when we start privatising stuff.  The State needs to play a much larger role in building schools, which are so important because young children attend them on a daily basis.</p> <p>  My main focus, on which Senator Ruane also touched, is how we make sure this does not happen again.  I think the State needs to play a much larger role.  In respect of the clerk of works not having the authority to certify, the buck should stop with somebody from the Department.  While the Department can go after the contractors all it likes, these contractors can close down and operate under a new business name two or three weeks later.  As they do it to their workers all the time, there is no reason why they would not do it to the State.  The Department could be tied into a legal battle for a very long time only to get nothing out of it.  Consequently, the most significant lesson we need to learn is how we prevent this from happening again.  There are many schools that are either in the middle of a new school build or have been given the go-ahead and tendering is happening.  These are not buildings that were there for 80 or 90 years with no work done on them.  Many of them are very new so if this work was done properly, problems should not occur.  </p> <p>  Who is liaising with the parents?  Some people may be in a really difficult situation if the school is closed because there is nowhere for their children to go.  Many people cannot take time off work.  It may cost them their jobs.  In particular, there is a lot of pressure on someone parenting alone.  Is there a contact person in the Department who can give parents information?  While I am not dealing directly with parents in this regard, what usually happens in such situations is people say they cannot get any information.  Hopefully, that is not the case here but I wonder about that.</p><p> My last point concerns schools in general and cases in which they sometimes apply for the summer works or minor works funding.  Schools can often apply year after year and may not qualify.  The Department needs to be a little more proactive in looking at schools that might not fail a health and safety check and which might be safe for kids to attend but which are in a very bad state of repair.  We all know schools in our areas that are in such a position.  Rather than seeing them develop safety concerns, we need to look at some of these grants.  I refer, for example, to people looking for extensions, applying every year for funding and for some reason being told either they have it but there is a delay or they will not get it for the year in question.  While there technically might not be safety issues at such schools, there may be issues of too many kids in the school, an over-reliance on prefabs, very bad facilities and so on.  This shines a light on the more general issue of the conditions of our schools and that we need to try to keep them up to a certain standard.  It comes back to resources but if we want a good education system with quality education and so on, kids must be taught in appropriate buildings.</p></speech>

I think many people out there will be scratching their heads in disbelief.  We do not have a building control unit.  The Minister has mentioned Northern Ireland, which does.  We just have the builder's word that everything is okay.  We have found out in recent days or weeks about something as simple as wall ties in the case of the Tyrrelstown schools.  I was talking earlier to someone who asked how much they would even cost.  They cost a minuscule amount.  It seems to me that what happened is that the Department hired a company that officially had 45 people working for it and had a turnover of &pound;39 million in 2016, &pound;18.6 million of which came directly from taxpayers in the Republic of Ireland and went into the pockets of the company.  Only 45 workers were building 20 schools, modular homes and God knows what else.  This is not the Minister's personal fault; clearly, it started with Fianna F&aacute;il in 2008, when the banks were being bailed out and there was pressure to get schools built in suburban areas that were growing rapidly and to do so as quickly and as cheaply as possible, given the austerity that reigned.  Ministers at that time boasted of 30% savings, rubbing their hands as if this were great.  A 30% saving on the normal quotations must mean corners are cut.  For the sake of money and profit, the lives of children and adults in these schools have been put at risk, including my daughter's.  She sat in two of the affected schools, I believe, because the Powerstown prefab was also one.  What people want to know is whether we will have accountability for any of this or whether this will just be fixed up.  We have this committee meeting and, apparently, we will be allowed to ask some questions tomorrow - of the Minister for Education and Skills, I hope.  I mean no offence to Deputy McHugh, but the Minister for Education and Skills has said he signed off on these buildings with Western Building Systems, or so the company tells us, so he must answer for that.</p></speech>

I have huge sympathy for them.  Everyone wants to get this resolved.  We held a meeting about the matter last week, to which I thought no one would come because they felt it was being addressed, but about 80 parents came.  People's overriding feeling was one of fear of sending their five and six year old kids back into the ground floor of the school because, not surprisingly, they have a complete lack of trust, having been told this was all okay.  What safety measures are in place that are different from those in place when the Department shut down the school two weeks ago?  Will the Department call the Garda and ask it to investigate this?  Will there be a criminal investigation?  Surely it is a crime to build shoddy buildings, notwithstanding the absolute joke that is the planning laws we have in this country, given the craven connection and relationship between certain political parties and developers.  It must still be a crime to build a building without putting in wall ties.  I was making a point about how cheap they are.  Presumably, what happens is that one is under pressure, has, say, ten workers on a job when there should be 20 and therefore, instead of putting in the wall ties in each section, puts them in perhaps only in every third section.  This is presumably the kind of pressure that builds up in companies like these, that is, bottom feeder companies.  We will say nothing today of the revenue of which the State has been deprived because of the consistent policy of the Department of Education and Skills of employing usually Northern Ireland-based companies that come in, bring in their workers, who are forced into positions of bogus self-employment, in vans and drive them back home.  This has happened with loads of other companies, not just this one.  We have raised it tonnes of times here and now we are seeing the safety implications of such an operation.</p> <p>  I want to ask specifically about Western Building Systems.  If the fire safety issues in Rush and Lusk were discovered in October 2015, why did Western Building Systems continue a month later to build the rapid-build houses in Poppintree?  In 2017 it was building schools in Firhouse.  Is it still building schools now, by the way?  I am sure the Department has stopped all that in light of what has happened, but why did the Government not take action at the point at which fire safety issues were discovered?  Could it not have investigated all the schools three years ago, rather than in October 2018, when the first signs of problems were showing?</p> <p>  Lastly, I was talking to a building worker who told me he and other building workers have been trying to blow the lid and be whistleblowers on these bogus self-employment building contractors for a good few years now because they have worked in those companies and see how they operate.  There has been no interest in this in the Parliament, but these workers went to a meeting in the offices of the Department of Education and Skills and raised all these issues in Western Building Systems and they were literally turfed out the door.  I can get the dates of those meetings, but is the Minister aware of this?  Can he look back in the diaries in Tullamore and see if this was the case?  If it is the case, that should also be part of the investigation that takes place.</p></speech>

This would become an issue if there were a fire.  That is where people's concerns are.  The standard of the building is paramount.</p><p>I have been picking up bits of anecdotal information from public representatives about minor issues, such as doors jamming, but if one has minor issues in any building, it is something that one must take seriously and on which one must follow through.  Obviously, the point at which one is aware there is a structural assessment required or a suspicion of concern is when one moves into a completely different space, as we did on Friday fortnight last.</p><p> I will let Mr. Loftus go into the detail on tendering process, the quality assurance and oversight.  The tendering process, etendering, is outside the political process.  It applies not only in Ireland, but in Northern Ireland and in Europe.  That is our tendering system.  Considering that 19 out of the 42 schools that needed external works did not have the same trend as Ardgillan, Tyrrelstown and Lucan, the different trends are alarming.  Corners were cut, for example, in Ardgillan, and one would question what were the reasons.  Was it time?  The Deputy is correct.  Wall ties certainly will not cost much.  It goes down also to people's pride in their work.  Many of the buildings in this country that are used as educational buildings are over 100 years old.  Old colleges that were built to standards and regulations at that time are still standing and here we are talking about schools that were built in the past ten years.  That bit is not leaving my head.  This is something we all take seriously.</p><p> I was asked what triggered the appointment of the 2017 clerk of works.  I assume it was the Grenfell fire but Mr. Loftus might add to that.  It would have been the assessment work that was carried out on the other schools.</p><p> On engagement back and forth, I was asked about self-certification of schools.  This is the space that we need to bring this conversation into now.  Are we happy with the type of oversight with regard to self-certification?  Even in the private sector, most builds have experienced an average extra cost of 18% because of the new rules brought in in 2014.  The extra costs are due to delays.  There are delays because designers are taking their work really seriously.  They are sitting down with the contractor and stating they will not move to the next stage until they ensure that everything is done properly.  For instance, they may not move until they have a meeting with the fire officer on-site the following week, and where it turns out that they cannot get him that week, they might get him the following week.  This is delaying projects, and that is correct.  If that is happening in the private sector, as I am picking up anecdotally, it must be happening across the board as well.  It is something we must be conscious of.</p><p> Mr. Loftus might talk about the snags issue after the completion of a project as well.  There is obviously a default period after signing over and getting payment.</p><p> I was asked what went wrong in Ardgillan.  Senator Ruane mentioned the word, "negligence".  According to my information, it was simple things, such as the inside timber leaf not being adjoined to the sealed structure, the timber leaf on the inside not sitting properly on the concrete in the right place, and wooden nails going down through the concrete when one would only assume that these should be bolts.  The Senator encapsulated it by using the word, "negligence".  That is why that phase 1 building from 2009 was closed down in its entirety.  That building was separate and as for that trend in Ardgillan, the same level of negligence did not appear elsewhere.  That is not in any way justifying the different weaknesses in the other buildings.</p><p> As for lessons learned for the future, this committee will play a role in how we move into the new space of providing greater vigilance and oversight to ensure that this does not happen again.  Deputy Funchion rightly pointed out the lessons learned on the PPP buildings.  We have schools half-finished and a company went wallop.  There are subcontractors who are owed money and now we must re-tender.  Due to time lost, there will be extra money involved.  Once again, it beings a negative to something which should be a complete positive for communities.</p><p> As for the State playing a bigger role, the State does not have the resources for complete oversight.  From where does one take the responsibility?  The legislation, both pre-2014 and post-2014, places the responsibility on the contractor and on the designer-architect.  It is specific.  It applied the whole way through the past ten years.  That did not happen.  I do not believe anyway that we should move to a situation where the State becomes responsible for oversight in its entirety.  We must place responsibility.  That is why we need to ensure that we follow up through all the legal channels to ensure culpability, responsibility and accountability.  I have said that publicly from day one.  I will continue to do so.  That is the least I can do from the point of view of both taxpayers and the communities concerned.</p><p> I was asked who was liaising with the parents.  What we did straight away was set up a communications unit, through an intervention by Deputy Thomas Byrne.  We were working on whether we should go directly to the parents and how would we communicate this news.  Then I visited the principal in Tyrrelstown who told me that there were 46 different nationalities in that school and that some of the parents may have difficulties on the communications side.  These were the challenges.  What was decided was - I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for his intervention - that the communications unit in Tullamore would communicate directly with the schools, that is, with the principal and the teams there.  As information came through, the principals fed it back to the parents in their respective communities.</p></speech>

There were 42 schools.  I am not saying it affected 42 constituencies but it impacted on approximately 30.  That will give the committee a sense of the magnitude.</p> <p>  Councillors were ringing the Department.  Concerned citizens were ringing me.  A former principal in Tyrrelstown was ringing me.  Everybody was trying to give their help.  It all helped and they all fed into the solution.  Communications is a two-way street.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the dedicated team in Tullamore who worked on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday of the bank holiday weekend.  When I visited, all I could see were empty packets of biscuits.  I do not think the dietary conditions were great.</p></speech>

The construction companies mobilised 250 workers over a long weekend.  They felt there was a duty on their part to come forward and try to address this situation as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Funchion also asked about minor works for primary schools and summer works.</p><p>We will be in a position to announce the summer works before Christmas and we are pushing hard to get the minor works announced before Christmas as well.  I will commit to that.  We need a longer run-in, for which several Opposition colleagues have been calling.  We will commit to starting the application process for the 2020 summer works early next year in order that schools can do a bit of forward planning.  Members do not need me to tell them that principals have a lot going on.  The last thing they need is to be given an award of funding in May or June of that summer, which then has to go out to tender.  It just does not make sense.  </p><p> Deputy Coppinger raised a few issues around building control.  She made the point that the cost of wall ties is minuscule.  Let us have a conversation about rapid build.  A lot these builds were completed in 24 to 26 weeks.  Today there is a demand for housing and there is a demand for rapid build in that sector as well.  Let us look at the enormity of the challenge.  I do not believe that reducing the timescale of a build is a negative if it is done right, if the workmanship is right and if there is proper attention to detail and oversight.  It is a question of oversight and how we can fill that gap. </p><p> Deputy Coppinger mentioned the Garda.  At this stage I have not made contact with the Garda but I reiterate what was already said at committee today.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 specify that sanctions are not limited to fines.  They include imprisonment.  There is culpability and I will certainly continue to be very vigilant and-----</p></speech>

I am determined to find out who is culpable and where the responsibility lies.  Obviously that will be a job for my legal team, the team in the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO, and the Attorney General.  The 2014 regulations are very clear that the sanctions are not just fines; they also include imprisonment.  There must be culpability and an effort to bring culpability and accountability to bear.</p> <p>  Mention was made of Northern Ireland companies in general.  I certainly will not tar all companies with the same brush.  A lot of Northern Ireland companies do good work in the South.  The work of Western Building Systems, WBS, in Rush was mentioned.  I will let Mr. Loftus answer on the assessment carried out in 2015.  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised this in the D&aacute;il the week before last.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about ongoing WBS projects.  Yes, there are such projects, namely, a temporary building in Sandymount and a build in Wicklow.  We are faced with a decision on whether to stop those projects or add more vigilance and oversight while they are ongoing.  Obviously we have made the decision to go with the later option.  The projects should continue to completion.  We are in direct contact with the Attorney General and the CSSO in regard to future contracts but we did think about that question.  We looked at what the implications would be if those projects were stopped and we felt the negative would outweigh the positive.  However, extra oversight is in place.  </p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger also mentioned whistleblowers.  If she has any evidence or if there is evidence within the Department, I am happy to pursue it. </p></speech>

I will pick up on some others.  I am happy to provide a briefing to clarify how tender processes are done for the information of the committee.  The motivation for the clerk of works essentially arose from the Grenfell fire and concerns about fire safety.  To provide additional assurance, we made the decision in 2017 to put a clerk of works in place for all major projects.</p> <p>  As for actions taken in the past few weeks to be able to see this, bearing in mind snagging and things like that, I note that the building is closed up.  We did opening-up works on the internal plasterboard and opened up areas within the buildings to look into the cavities, see what the issues were and satisfy ourselves on any concerns around structural safety.  That took place in all of the schools.  The outcome was the various categorisations we published on our website, either where nothing of concern was identified or where we thought it appropriate to put in place precautionary measures.  Our approach was to err on the side of caution.  </p></speech>

They had experience from the opening-up works in Tyrrelstown and work in St. Luke's national school and Ardgillan community college.  That experience and knowledge of where precisely to open up a building was applied to the other opening-up works.  It is a risk-based approach.  Ultimately there will be more investigations to determine the required long-term solutions.</p></speech>

I apologise to the Minister as I will have to run in order to ask a parliamentary question so I may not be here for his reply.  However, I will look at the transcript afterwards.</p><p>I want to deal with the issue of accountability and the extent of the Department's interest in warnings that were given.  Problems might have been apparent to the Department much sooner.  First, let us remember that this has come out because several of the schools were repeatedly blocked by the Department in efforts to get building control reports.  That is what they claimed last year when this came up.  Several schools said they were looking for the reports on building control because they had concerns about fire safety and were repeatedly blocked by the Department.  That would suggest to me that the Department, the Government or the Minister did not want to know.  They wanted to say they had delivered all these schools and did not want anyone to mess up the good-news story by letting it out that there were massive problems with them.  When I questioned the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, in this committee, he said there were minor problems.  Then there were delays and we had to prod early last year.  We had been promised that the fire safety audit would be done by January of this year but by March, only one school had been checked.  Then a story was printed in <i>The Irish Times</i>and things began to move along.  There is evidence of foot-dragging and not taking this seriously, and all of that needs to be investigated. </p><p>One of the issues I raised in September last year, tipped off by building workers to whom I will come back in my questions, concerned a college of further education built by Western Building Systems in north Dublin, which I understand was closed down in 2014.  That college, a scandal in itself, is still sitting there empty.  Why was it closed down?  I understand there was subsequently legal action taken by the Office of Public Works, OPW.  Was a red flag not raised when the OPW had to close the school and initiate legal action against WBS in 2014?  Was this not a warning that there was a problem with these guys and that everything else they do should be examined?</p><p>We need answers.  I do not know if the details of the case are <i>sub judice</i>but we need to know everything that we possibly can.  Was this not a warning to the Department?  Without going into too much detail, did the issues relate to structural defects in the College of Further Education building in Whitehall?  If so, why did alarm bells not immediately ring in the context of Western Business Systems?<br/><br/>As Deputy Coppinger alluded to, whistleblowers in the building industry have prodded us to raise issues they have outlined - not just in the context of the schools programme but also regarding building sites generally - to us and to the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  When the latter was Minister for Education and Skills, people went to the trouble of joining his branch of the Labour Party in Ringsend.  Some even did so before Labour got into government in anticipation of him becoming Minister.  People repeatedly attended branch meetings in the succeeding years and warned him that the schools building programme was like the wild west due to the fact that there was no oversight, bogus subcontractors were used and there was rampant bogus self-employment.  Building workers from Dublin or the south could not get jobs on these building sites.  People would laugh at anyone who tried to do so.  Gangs of workers who were bogus self-employed were brought down from the North.<br/><br/>I have been told - perhaps the Minister can confirm it is not true - that many of the contractors had stopped paying for wall ties prior to this.  That may answer the mystery as to the lack of wall ties.  The ties themselves are cheap.  Previously, bricklayers and building workers were paid for the ties but, as part of cutbacks, their employers stopped paying them for the ties.  However, the tie is the most elementary thing that stops a wall coming apart.  One does not have a wall if one does not use a wall tie.  It is really elementary and the employers stopped paying the workers for wall ties.<br/><br/>Building workers and officials met the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and Department officials in Tullamore and at the head office of the Department of Education and Skills on Marlborough Street in 2012 or 2013.  They told him that the schools building programme was like the wild west due to a complete lack of oversight and control.  At all of these meetings they just met a brick wall from the Department.</p></speech>

I understood Deputy Boyd Barrett to be a fair person but he has not got his history correct here.  It may be that the official who is present will recall that the investigation was initiated - in my own case because I met a number of people.

I am glad the Minister has clarified that he will seek accountability and find the individuals who are culpable.  What we have become aware of in recent weeks has been very upsetting.  It has also been devastating for 42 school communities.  The Department has handled the issue well in terms of communications.  It also put together teams to carry out checks and rechecks.  It deployed a group of 250 workers to check all of the schools.  I commend it on doing so.</p> <p>  The Minister must deal with a legacy issue.  I wonder how the various issues were allowed to build up.  This matter has caused great concern among members and among people in the school communities.  Some 42 schools are involved, four of which are located in my constituency.  I was contacted by representatives of another school that was not built by Western Building Systems.  The people told me that they had a lot of issues with their school and found the Department sadly lacking in terms of following up in respect of them.  The people took the initiative to engage an independent engineer to examine the issues.  He was shocked by what he discovered and found the Department unhelpful.  The people managed to get the builders back on site and the school is now 100%.</p> <p>  It is good that we are going to have the clerk of works back before the committee.  I am not sure when the cut-off point was but we did not have the clerk of works in on this issue.  It would make sense that the clerk of works would be an engineer and that he or she would be a resident engineer as opposed to a clerk of works, particularly in the context of checking all of the issues that impact on the safety of children and staff.</p> <p>  I want to ask a few specific questions.  The Minister referred to the lessons learned and the need for more oversight, with which we all agree.  I remain unclear as to who was responsible for signing off the work and whether departmental officials were involved and if they were suitably qualified.  It is key that we be given such information.</p> <p>  I was surprised to hear that there is no estimated cost for the remedial works at this point.  I accept that checking, rechecking and remediation work had to be prioritised.  It would be useful if the Minister supplied us with an estimated cost and, subsequently, the supplementary costs for which I have no doubt he will be supported.  Will attempts be made to recover the costs through insurance claims, from Western Building Systems, or from engineers who signed off on these projects?  Even though engineers had signed off on a project in Millfield, Newbridge, County Kildare, which is in my constituency, there was no culpability afterwards.  People should be held accountable.  Thankfully, the project at Ardgillan was an outlier in terms of defects.  The defects at Millfield were not as bad as anything discovered at Ardgillan.</p> <p>  Western Building Systems should be precluded from future tenders as a result of what we have learned.  Representatives of the company have stated that they were not given enough time on site to carry out structural evaluations.  We must discover why they were not afforded enough time.  I have more questions but they have already been answered.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister and Mr. Loftus to answer the questions posed and to respond to the issues raised by myself and Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018110600002#L03600"><p>I shall first respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He raised a lot of issues and made a number of allegations.  His comments highlight the fact that questions need to be answered.  However, people need to be in a position to defend themselves.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned whistleblowers.  I would be interested in hearing any information or seeing any evidence anyone might have.  Accountability was mentioned and it was suggested that schools were being blocked repeatedly by the Department.  I have no knowledge of that, but if he has any information around that I am happy to listen to and to look at that.</p><p> The issue of Whitehall College of Further Education, a building built in 2006 under the auspices of the OPW, was mentioned.  The Deputy is correct to say it was vacated in 2014 due to certain issues that arose.  The reason there was no knock-on impact on the school was that it was a completely different type of build.  It was a prefabricated building.  That building, however, must be included in any investigation or review that comes out of this, even though it was under the umbrella of a different Department.  We can learn lessons from it.  </p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett has said he will read the transcripts.  He said he picked up a lot of evidence from conversations with a couple of workers.  The more evidence we have as we carry out this review, the better. </p><p> Deputy Thomas Byrne asked whether there was a specific warning about WBS from certain engineers.  I do not have any information in that regard.  As far as I am aware that was not the case.  </p><p> The Chairman mentioned the four schools affected in her constituency.  I thank her for coming to Tullamore with Deputy Thomas Byrne for the briefing session.  Communication goes both ways, and we learned from her visit as well.  </p><p> Mr. Loftus will tell us who was the party responsible for signing off on the work but as far as I am concerned, the certification of compliance is the responsibility of the contractor on site and the designer on site.  There is a role for the Department in certification of completion but it does not take consideration of certification of compliance at the moment.  Mr. Loftus might be able to elaborate on that a little more.  </p><p> The reason we do not have a cost for the remedial work is that time was not available to us even to plan out the works.  I mentioned the three-school campus at Ashbourne, which required 3 km of fencing.  Scaffolding was still being sourced on Sunday at one of the Cork schools.  Remedial work is continuing at the school in Tyrrelstown to bring it up to the satisfaction of the board of management and to address safety issues there.  As soon as we get that figure, I will ensure that it is presented publically.  Insurance, culpability and accountability were mentioned.  I am looking at all possible avenues which might redeem costs for the remedial work.  It must also be noted that there is a big job ahead of us now, and we will have to do a comprehensive and complete assessment for the 42 schools in order that we can find the best solution, which will involve a tendering process.  That process will cost money and the implementation of that solution will cost money but these school communities have been wronged and I will find out who wronged them.  Whatever needs to be fixed I am prepared to fix it; I am making that my responsibility.  I have been in the Department of Education and Skills for only a short while but the officials with whom I have worked closely in recent weeks on this issue are very attentive.  Everything I needed and everything I have asked of them in terms of communication and the putting together of a team to find alternative accommodation at short notice has been done.  The biggest response on this issue came from the community.  The community response was enormous; it stood up to the challenge.  Education and training boards, ETBs, different schools and different school patron bodies came forward with space and with solutions.  The contractors also came forward with ideas.  There were many solutions proposed.  The 42 schools were able to open last Monday as a result.  Tyrrelstown wanted to do its own robust analysis of the logistics to ensure that the bus transfers were okay and that there was adequate supervision when young children were dropped off at school.  The response at a community, school and education sectoral level has been second to none.  Universities offered space as well.  I thank everyone involved in that regard.    </p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned more links to the Department.  I have been head of the planning and building division for one year and to my knowledge, nothing of this scale has come to the Department before.  In terms of the fire safety assessment reports the Deputy referenced, some were published in 2017 following a freedom of information Information Commissioner ruling.  Since then, and as part of the learning experience, the Department put protocols in place whereby as fire safety reports are carried out, they are automatically provided to the school, the patron and the fire officer.  We then put in place a programme management team to follow through on the works and the issues arising from them in order that any remedial issues could be addressed.  The Minister referenced the Whitehall case, which was a different type of construction.  It was a temporary building and consequently, the issues there are not directly related.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett also referenced the former Minister for Education and Skills, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and issues around audits.  It predated my time in the Department but that Minister put in place a programme of audits and checks that were followed through on.  I can arrange for that to be followed through for the information of the committee.  </p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne made a point in respect of Engineers Ireland.  We were not aware of the issue he raised.  As for certification and clarity, it is very clear in a design and build project that the contractor has a legal responsibility for sign-off on certification.  For clarity on this issue, and as a sample, the Department published on its website the certificates that were signed by WBS.  In my view, it is crystal clear.  </p></speech>

I thank the Minister and Mr. Loftus.  We must be mindful of the school communities and the extra burden of work placed on school principals and boards of management, who really stepped up to the plate.  They have done incredible work to ensure that the school communities are safe.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving me the opportunity to address them.  I have provided a summary of my career to date, with particular reference to the five years to 30 September 2018, during which I acted as chairperson of the governing body of Letterkenny Institute of Technology which is known as LYIT.  I have been involved in the financial sphere since graduating from UCD in 1974 with a degree in economics.  Having spent 16 years with the Revenue Commissioners, the last of which was as district inspector of taxes for County Donegal, in 1989 I commenced a taxation and financial consultancy business which continues to this day.  I remind the committee that the Revenue Commissioners have given me eight more days to get in all of the tax returns, given that the deadline date is 14 November.  Working with my 65 colleagues in Revenue's office gave me great experience of people management and highlighted the importance of leadership attributes such as empathy, time management, the art of listening, judgment evaluation and decisive decision-making.  </p> <p>  Having been distant from the education sector for a considerable time, my appointment to the challenging position of LYIT chairperson required a considerable learning curve at a time when the country was in the throes of recession and funding for education or anything else was hardly extant.  However, my prior financial experience stood to me in those difficult years when the college's reserves were dissipating rapidly and a red line in the sand had to be grappled with.  The reality at the time was that our institute, which is based on campuses in Letterkenny and Killybegs, was going to run out of money in the short term.  Reserves are never limitless.  Thankfully, matters have improved and funding has become available, particularly for the Killybegs campus, for which some &euro;3 million has been approved, to be drawn down over four years.  LYIT is the first institute to come out of deficit following the crash.  Growth in student numbers has also had a positive impact on our financial viability.  In the past five years total student numbers have grown by 24%, from 3,493 to 4,316, with the part-time cohort showing a significant increase of 94%, from 626 to 1,215 today.  The non-EU international student numbers have grown from one five years ago to 135 today.  They come mainly from India, Malaysia and China, among other places.</p> <p>  LYIT has many exciting projects in the pipeline, including a &euro;20 million public private partnership project which is to commence in 2020.  Submissions have been made under the rural regeneration fund to the Department of Rural and Community Development for an ocean innovation centre in Killybegs, while a joint application involving LYIT, Donegal ETB, Donegal County Council and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s has been made to the climate action fund.  An application involving LYIT, the University of Ulster and Queens University has also been made under the INTERREG programme for a share of the &euro;30 million available.</p> <p>  Our greatest challenge in the short term is achieving technological university status in partnership with Sligo Institute of Technology and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT.  Last month funding of &euro;1.8 million was secured to progress the application of the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, CUA.  Work is ongoing to satisfy the criteria set out in Chapter 9 of the Technological Universities Act 2018, under section 28(1)(a) of which, LYIT already satisfies the 30% test, with a figure of 51% confirmed.  Work is continuing in assessing the current position on the criteria set out in section 28(1)(b) and (c) and a report will be concluded by the CUA project manager by the end of November.</p> <p>  Our collaboration north of the Border continues.  Last April the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, announced the establishment of a cross-Border further and higher education cluster involving LYIT, the Ulster University, the North West Regional College and Donegal ETB.  The initiative has recently secured funding from the Higher Education Authority to enhance its activity and continue its work in the context of implementation of the national development plan.</p> <p>  This year the institute has come through an institutional review carried out by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  It involved QQI personnel meeting staff, students, governing body members and external shareholders from industry and other spheres of public life.  QQI is processing our application for approval of a level 10 course in computing and success is anticipated by the end of the year.  A similar application will be made in 2019 for the school of business, which will obviously have an impact in meeting the criteria to achieve TU status.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the dedication and fortitude of all LYIT staff, together with governing body members and sub-committees, in pursuing the best interests of the college during its very difficult recent history.</p></speech>

Was it all HEA and departmental funding or was it from non-EU students or for research and development?  What is the breakdown in that regard?</p></speech>

The position is that, with our five year development plan, the campus in Killybegs will not wash its own face, that is, it will not cover the costs associated with it.  For the campus in Letterkenny, the position is positive, but, obviously, while the funds can be used to offset the deficit in Killybegs, they are not sufficient.  In the next couple of years we will have &euro;750,000 per annum which will help to balance the books, but we will have to look for more funding in that regard.  In the intervening period the growth in student numbers, in particular, the number of international students, has had a significant impact.  That is where we are concentrating to bring in additional revenue.</p></speech>

This committee has been awaiting a technical report from the Department which we have not yet received.  It is as if people are wishing it would all go away.  What would Mr. Moloney like to see happen in being able to put LYIT in a position where both campuses will be functioning and the situation progressing, rather than simply being maintained?</p></speech>

It is almost two and a half years since the Cassells report was published, yet it is still sitting on the sidelines.  I know that the new Minister for Education and Skills has not had time to consider it, given the ongoing construction issues.  However, the former Minister said it would not be looked at until 2019.  Perhaps it might be kicked even further into touch.  It feels as if it is another report that will gather dust.  There are three aspects that concern how third level education should be funded.  I would like to see a situation where all students from all walks of life - we can mention the programme for access to higher education, PATH, in that context - would be able to access third level education without fees, but, of course, from where would the money come?</p></speech>

As Senator Ruane pointed out, we felt an economic evaluation was needed of the impact on students and their families and the State.  That is the report we are awaiting before we issue our final recommendations.</p></speech>

As someone who comes from that neck of the woods, I am familiar with it.  From an economic perspective, apart from anything else, I know that it has been a serious bonus to Letterkenny and the wider area.</p> <p>  I have several questions.  How many students are on the campus in Letterkenny?</p><p>Where does Mr. Moloney see the growth areas for the college?  He mentioned technical university status.  What role does he see it playing in the development of the facility?  What does he believe is the growth area for employment?  Does he feel the institute's need will be the economic activity in the Donegal and Sligo catchment area?  I am sure Letterkenny is no different to other towns whereby housing is becoming an issue for students.  How significant an issue is it?  Does Mr. Moloney feel institutes of technology such as that in Letterkenny could have a greater role to play, rather than having students leave the town on a Sunday evening on a bus to Dublin, with their parents trying to fund them?</p></speech>

The number of full-time and part-time students on campus is 4,316.  With regard to accommodation, believe it or not, there is not an accommodation issue with the campuses in Letterkenny or Killybegs.  This comes from the student representatives themselves on the governing body.  I have asked them specifically whether there is a problem with accommodation.  Of the 4,316 students, 75% are Donegal-domiciled.  This makes a major difference.  It is different from the situation we find in Dublin, Galway or Cork where accommodation is under pressure.</p> <p>  The full employment factor creates pressure on increasing student numbers.  We have seen growth and been successful in collaboration with local industry and local businesses on part-time distance learning courses geared towards what the employer wants.  They have an input into how the courses are formed.  We target the larger employers most and bring potential employers on board.  We ask them what type of people they need to fulfil their staff complement.  They are active in designing the courses and allow their employees off work to do the courses on a part-time basis and make it easier for them.  There is a dividend at the end of the day because there are bonuses for the company if it ends up with better educated employees.</p></speech>

He mentioned the Connacht-Ulster alliance.  How is it progressing?  What is LyIT's relationship with the institutes of technology in Sligo and Mayo?  How is it being progressed?  Does the institute of technology have many people doing online courses?  Mr. Moloney mentioned foreign students residing in Donegal.</p></speech>

To answer the question on the Connacht-Ulster alliance, the North-South collaboration was formed quite a number of years.  Brexit has raised a couple of questions on where we can go from here but there is certainly a guarantee that the fee structure of courses at LyIT on which there are students from the North will not change until they complete their courses.  With regard to what will happen after Brexit, and what form it will take, I am afraid we are all still looking towards the heavens.</p> <p>  With regard to the Connacht-Ulster alliance, the registrars, presidents and financial controllers have monthly meetings.  On top of this, the chairmen have also met on a number of occasions.  For my part, there is a little hiatus at present because my authorisation to act as chairman finished on 30 September and I did not hear until 25 October that I was to have designate title until such date as I am approved, if I am approved.  I am not assuming anything in this regard.  I would like this hiatus to cease so we get back on track.  Any vacuum will delay the process of the Connacht-Ulster alliance.  There is a lot of work to be done.  There is a lot of negotiation to be done and a lot of trust to be built up among the three partners to bring it to the stage where we can make a technological university application.</p></speech>

Online is an area we must improve.  It is similar to the other matrices involved in achieving technical university status, in terms of the 4% of students moving to masters from research.  We are on that road but we are certainly not there yet.  With regard to 90% of full-time academic staff being at masters level or higher, we are still on the road.  There will be analysis by the end of this month on exactly where we are and then we will see where we go from there.  Planning will be required.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for and regulate termination of pregnancy.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Harris, and his officials to the meeting.  As there is a larger number of amendments, I suggest we take frequent breaks regarding our consideration of the Bill.  It is now 11 a.m. and I propose we take a break at 1.30 p.m. for lunch.  This committee room is booked for the day, therefore, we have plenty of time.</p> <p>  There are a number of amendments and a number of groupings of amendments.  The list of the groupings have been circulated to members and they can consider those groupings.  Four amendments have been ruled out of order, namely, amendments Nos. 165, 167, 168 and 171.</p></speech>

The first is in the names of Deputies Wallace, Clare Daly, Joan Collins and O'Reilly.  It is proposed to discuss together amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 41 and 176 to 180, inclusive, as they are related.  Amendment No. 2 is a physical alternative to amendment No. 1.  Amendments Nos. 177 to 180, inclusive, are physical alternatives to amendment No. 176.  Amendments Nos. 178 to 180, inclusive, are physical alternatives to amendment No. 177 so amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 41 and 176 to 180, inclusive, will be discussed together.</p></speech>

More importantly, it does not reflect the importance of the referendum vote that took place on 25 May.  This should be about access because that is what people voted for on 25 May.  As I said on Second Stage, the only reference to access in the Bill is in the offences section.  I do not think people voted for access to be an offence.  They voted for access because they want women to be in a position to avail of access.  The amendment will not materially change a word that comes after it but it will show the intention of the legislation and its purpose, which is to ensure that women have access to terminations.  I am interested to hear any arguments against it because, as is the case with all of my amendments - and I might as well say this at the outset - I believe it is very reasoned, fair, balanced and proportionate.  On 25 May, people voted for access.  They did not vote for access to be included only in the offences section.</p></speech>

I understand what they are trying to do.  I also voted for access.  We all voted for access to a service that is not currently available to women who have to travel as a result.  I include in that regard the nine women who will travel and the three women who will access the abortion pill today.  Those of us who voted to repeal the eighth amendment in such large numbers voted for access and I fully accept that.  The Bill is entirely about access.  It is about ensuring that, within the regulated parameters the Oireachtas put in place and published in a general scheme before the referendum was held, access to the relevant services can now be facilitated.  That is the very reason we are trying to pass the Bill, which will enable women to have access to termination of pregnancy services in a safe manner in their own communities and free of charge as part of the universal Irish public health service.  The key provisions of the Bill are the same as those of the draft general scheme that was published prior to the referendum and the updated scheme published in July.</p> <p>  The legislation provides for terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman or where there is a condition present that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth, and without specific indication up to 12 weeks.  The Title to the Bill has been drafted to reflect the language used in the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018, which amended the Constitution in order that provision may be made in law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill we are debating is the means by which the Oireachtas will now use its new constitutional authority under the provision.  Using the language of the new Article 40.3.3&deg; in the legislation that seeks to give effect to the provision provides the necessary consistency and clarity in our law.  Similarly, the Long Title has also been worded by the drafters to reflect the provisions and the purpose of the Bill.  This is a technical legal Title.  I accept that Deputy O'Reilly has said quite simply that she does not envisage it in any way changing the substance of the Bill.  I very much accept that argument.  I appreciate her intention in trying to change the wording but to do so would not be in line with the legal requirements and the advice I have received on the importance of keeping the Title to the Bill consistent with the wording in the Constitution.</p></speech>

I will reflect on the point Deputy Joan Collins has made.  My only concern relates to not wanting to put wording in the legislation which, from her perspective and mine, would be an accurate reflection of what the people voted for but which would not tally with or match that contained in the Constitution.  I need to take very seriously the legal advice available to me.  None of us wants to do anything that would accidentally undermine the legal certainty of the legislation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 refers to inserting the word "abortion" into the Bill.  We had quite a lengthy debate on this matter on Second Stage and people made the point that the Bill is about providing abortion in Ireland and asked why that word is not included in the Bill.  The word "abortion" is not in the Constitution either.  When the Oireachtas decided on the wording it wished to include in the Constitution, it decided- and then the people ultimately decided - to use the phrase "termination of pregnancy".  The legal advice available to me is that we need to align the wording in our legislation with that contained in the Constitution.  If we were to include the word "abortion", the time to do so was when we were amending the Constitution.  Providing absolute clarity and consistency between the words in the Constitution and those in the legislation is the legal advice available to me that I feel is important to share with the committee.  Obviously, the Bill will provide access to abortion services in Ireland that are not available today and that certainly would not have been available so long as the eighth amendment remained in the Constitution.</p> <p>  The wording and the definition have also been considered from a medical perspective and this is also important.  These are not just legal arguments, although the legal arguments from my perspective are deemed to be strong.  It is also about ensuring clarity for medical practitioners practising the field.  To define "termination of pregnancy" in any way other than as currently done in the Bill could have implications for obstetric practice.  To be very clear, the purpose of the legislation is not to regulate obstetric practice.  That is a much broader discussion.  It is simply to make sure that we regulate the provision of the termination of pregnancy.</p> <p>  In the context of references to ending pregnancy, on not all occasions that an abortion takes place is a pregnancy being ended because, of course, there can be multiple births.  We can have a situation where there are twins involved.  For a number of reasons, this wording has been considered very carefully.  The phrase "termination of pregnancy" matches the wording in the Constitution.  We have engaged with medical practitioners in respect of the wording, which provides them with a degree of certainty that other formulations might not provide in terms of multiple births.</p></speech>

It was not on the ballot paper and that is fine.</p><p>However, the use of language regarding termination of pregnancy in amendment No. 1 is continued, with the addition of the word "access".  I am struggling to understand why access cannot be part of it.  I accept the Minister's arguments - I do not necessarily like them - but it is about the inclusion of the word access.  Based on everything the Minister said, I thought by the end he would agree with me because everything he has said indicates that this is about access.  I honestly do not see why it cannot include it.  I do not want to put words in the Minister's mouth, but if I hear what he says correctly, there is not an outright refusal on the inclusion of the word access.  Is it possible for us to look at that or is it the case that he is saying flat out no to all of them?  I just want to be clear for myself.</p></speech>

Once again, without wanting to be pedantic, but I suppose it is a pedantic area, the wording also refers to access to healthcare by women seeking termination which is a very important discussion but one which is much broader one than what this Bill is trying to do.  All that this Bill is trying to do, landmark that it is, is to regulate access to termination of pregnancy, it is not about the wider access to healthcare.  The Deputy will find something that will happen a lot over today and tomorrow is that instinctively I will agree with what she wants to do - and I agree with the points Deputy Joan Collins made - but I must be very careful that I follow the legal advice available to me.  I am happy to look at it further and engage with members further on it between now and Report Stage, and I am happy to share information with the committee as to how my officials have arrived at that conclusion.  However, that is the solid advice available to me.</p></speech>

It is important that we see what the lawyers are advising the Minister on.</p> <p>  The word "abortion" being eliminated from the law is an obfuscation and a deliberate ignoring of what is going on here.  We should call a spade a spade, and that is why we put it in as an amendment.  I would be very interested to see the legal advice that states that cannot be mentioned, rather we talk about the termination of pregnancy and what the justification of that is.  </p> <p>  The question of access to healthcare is fundamentally what this Bill is about and not saying so does not recognise access to abortion as part of the overall package of healthcare of a woman or pregnant person during her life as a potential mother.  That needs to go in.  Most important, I want to see the legal advice.   </p></speech>

I am more than happy to arrange for a briefing for all members of the committee between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  I have many conversations with people in terms of advice but I am happy for the members to also have conversations with them.</p> <p>  I am certainly not hiding the reality of this Bill.  This Bill will open up access to a range of abortion services in this country that our women need, deserve and have been denied for far too long under the eighth amendment.  That is what this Bill will do.  It means that the women who travel today, in many cases, will be able to access abortions in their own communities, from their own health service and as part of the universal health service, that is to say they will not have to pay for it.  There is no hidden agenda there.  However, when I have had conversations with some women, particularly on fatal foetal abnormalities, the sensitivity of language is important.  Some of these pregnancies were terminated.  Different people who have been through different experiences have a different perspective on the wording we use but there is no disputing at all what this Bill is endeavouring to do.  However, the word "abortion" is not in the Constitution.  We passed the wording termination of pregnancy and all I am trying to do is ensure that the law that we pass aligns with that wording because, God knows, there have been far too many grey areas in this whole area of law for far too long, which has resulted in an awful lot of pain, misery and court challenges.  </p></speech>

Deviation from that may lead us into a situation whereby we, the committee and the Oireachtas, may well be accused of not adhering to the lines set down by the people in the referendum.  There are various pros and cons and merit and demerit to the amendments.  What if it transpired that we now propose to deviate from what we told the people in the public heads of Bill?  People had an opportunity to vote on this matter, they did so and came to a resounding decision.  It is important that they did so on the basis of the information put before them.  We should stick to the text as it is, as closely as possible, and should it transpire at a later stage that somebody said that it does not affect what we are trying to do, then we can examine it.</p> <p>  The word "regulation" is important.  It was already part of the text of the referendum.  If we change that now, in three or four days, we could find ourselves with a totally different Bill from the one to which people gave tentative approval in the referendum.  I stand by what the referendum indicated and the published heads of Bill at that time.</p></speech>

We will return to the issue of trans inclusivity later, but there is the question of putting pregnant woman rather than person in the Title of the Bill itself.  The other problematic issue is the provision of offences in respect of the intentional ending of the life of foetus, and this being the priority and focus of what an abortion is, and this dubious idea of ending life.  I will not go on about it but I wanted to raise that it is problematic that it is framed as offences rather than relating to healthcare, which was what was highlighted in the referendum.</p></speech>

I am trying to read all of them quickly and they seem to deal with two different specific issues.  They are related to trans inclusivity and the language surrounding it or the definition of a medical practitioner.  I am desperately trying to read all of them to see whether there is something else included.  It is strange to group them together because they are very different.  Many of them repeat the same thing and propose to change the same words.</p></speech>

My note on the grouping sees it, as Deputy Coppinger does, as the amendments having three themes.  The definition of a medical practitioner is dealt with in amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  The bulk of the amendments in the grouping deal with the definition of a woman and, as Deputy Coppinger rightly said, largely have the same policy objective of including the words "and pregnant person" with the word "woman".  Another four of the amendments are related to the definition of "termination of pregnancy".  Even though it looks like the group includes a huge number of amendments, the overwhelming majority are related to the issue of trans inclusivity.</p></speech>

The World Health Organization tells us that abortion care in early pregnancy can be provided at primary care level by a range of health workers, including nurses and midwives.  I believe that as the service gets up and running, it will be expanded.  A great nurse prescribing programme is in place and many nurses and midwives have contacted me to say they are very interested in ensuring they can be part of service delivery.  If we are discussing primary care, we should be mindful of what the World Health Organization states on the matter.</p></speech>

While I appreciate that the intention of the amendments may be to facilitate access to the procedure for women or ensure greater availability of healthcare professionals to provide the service, I cannot agree to their inclusion in the Bill at this time.  However, we will come to an amendment in my name - there are others that have been tabled by colleagues - that refers to a review of the legislation.</p></speech>

I hope that by the time we pass the legislation, it will include a review clause.  Including such a clause is prudent.  We will have different views on the timeline for a review, but we are starting a service that has not been provided in this country before.  We all know the legacy.  From a patient safety perspective, it is essential that in establishing a new or expanded service we provide for the highest possible standard of care from its initiation.</p> <p>  There is very limited access to termination of pregnancy in this country, which overwhelmingly is delivered in the hospital setting by a consultant obstetrician, a highly experienced, qualified medical person.  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill does restrict the provision of the service to medical practitioners but on much expanded grounds.  It also expands the definition of medical practitioners who may be involved to all those registered on the Medical Council's register of medical practitioners.  Therefore, in the legislation we are expanding the range of doctors who may be involved.</p> <p>  From an international perspective, it is not an unusual requirement.  In Europe France, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany require a doctor to be involved in carrying out the procedure, but the Deputy is correct, there are other countries where that is not the case.  I do not disagree with her fundamental point that there are other countries where other healthcare professionals are involved.  However, at this stage of the legislation and in trying to embed a service and ensure we will have adequate numbers of doctors signed-up to get it up and running, medical practitioners are the most appropriate personnel to deliver the service.  Whereas in the future it may be possible to contemplate allowing termination of pregnancy services to be delivered by medical personnel other than medical practitioners, it is my considered view at this time that we are taking initial and significant steps towards expanding services and that the most appropriate personnel to deliver the service are medical practitioners.  Where the Deputy and I differ is that the Deputy would like to give the Minister of the day the power to do this without recourse to the Oireachtas.  I propose that the Minister of the day have the power, through the review clause which I hope will be passed by the committee later today.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendments on this occasion.</p></speech>

However, potentially allowing a future Minister to permit literally anyone in the health service to carry out an abortion is not fair.  Women deserve the best medical care and the best people should provide the service.  There was a reference made to me not caring for women, but if we were to go ahead with this and allow anyone in the health service to do it, it would be a great mistake.</p></speech>

They were faced with a binary question.  The Minister is correct when he clarifies that the people voted on the deletion of the eighth amendment.  That is also the view of Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy and the Referendum Commission.</p><p>A doctor-led service was central to the advocation of repeal by the Minister and others.  A Google search would reveal a couple of hundred examples of it having been repeatedly stated that this would be a doctor-led service.  Last night, I spoke to a midwife about this issue.  She stated that there has been no consultation with midwives regarding the provision of abortion in Ireland.  If we were to go down that route, it would be logical and good governance and legislative practice that people would be consulted before being tasked with a role.  Indeed, the lack of consultation with doctors is also a difficulty.  Approximately 650 doctors have stated that they wanted to have proper consultation on this issue before the legislation proceeded.  On that basis, it would be better not to widen the range of medical professionals who can provide this particular service.  Issues regarding patient safety and medical insurance have also been flagged.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that the amendment aims to provide for the the health service to decide when and where we expand the services such that women have access to them, rather than waiting for future legislation to so do.  It is not saying that we will do it tomorrow, next week, in two months' time or in a year's time but it allows for a future model whereby nurses and midwives could undertake specialist training and develop an equal competence with doctors to take responsibility for aspects of abortion care in non-complex cases.  The WHO recommends broader access to the provision of abortion services.  This is an important amendment.  The Minister stated that there would be a review.  Would the Minister be happy for this aspect to dealt with in that review?</p></speech>

We are calling for it to be expanded to other professionals within the health system.  Such a practice is not unusual.  The point is that we are innovating and bringing in legislation that should be state-of-the-art and up to date.  For example, in France and other countries, midwives participate in abortions.  Scientific research has proven that one does not need a doctor in order to have an abortion.  Some ten people a day leave the country to procure an abortion but up to five others use abortion pills obtained through telemedicine sites.  We have heard testimony in that regard and I will not repeat the points that were made.  It is important because we need to emphasise that abortion is one of the simplest medical procedures.  Those who oppose it make out that that is not the case.  However, as members are aware, the majority of abortions take place in the first trimester.  Research has proven that abortions carried out using an abortion pill obtained through a telemedicine site and supervised by a doctor are as safe as other types of abortion even though the woman is not directly examined by a doctor.  The WHO has given its backing to that view.  That is important because we are bringing in legislation which is introducing levels of barriers and bureaucracy that may not be needed.  Some members who have spoken to the amendment are opposed to this aspect being broadened because they want to make out that abortion is harrowing and very complex.  However, all those who study these matters know that having an abortion is safer than having a baby.  It would be preferable for the Bill to be in line with what has been scientifically proven, which is that a competent midwife or other health practitioner should be permitted to perform abortions.  The five people in Ireland who will take an abortion pill in their bedrooms today will be carrying out a DIY abortion with advice from a doctor based in the Netherlands or another part of the world.  We do not need to over-complicate this.  Of course, we agree that the procedure should be carried out under the auspices of our health service.  Everybody should be able to go to their own doctor but that does not mean that a doctor must be present for the abortion.  I have often gone to a doctor's surgery and been seen by a nurse.  We should recognise that that is best practice worldwide.</p></speech>

It was suggested that enabling nurses and midwives to do what many of them are trained to do, which is to prescribe, would somehow be dangerous.  I do not agree.  Although I do not want to put words in his mouth, I assume that even if he rejects the amendment the Minister would not agree with that either.  Nurses and midwives very safely and competently deliver healthcare in a range of settings.  Our amendment does not seek to expand the provision of the service to nurses and midwives by tomorrow morning.  We are trying to make available the option for that to be done because they are a group of front-line healthcare professionals who feel that they have been left out of this debate to some extent.  It is about expanding the service once it is bedded in and ensuring that anyone who can competently provide a service that women need is empowered to provide that service.  It would not necessarily happen overnight but I am conscious that such practitioners are being precluded from providing such services.  The amendment aims to make that option available.  As I stated, Midwives for Choice and the Midwives Association of Ireland have made very comprehensive submissions which, along with the WHO documentation, could inform the discussion and deliberations between now and Report Stage.  We do not argue that it should not be a GP-led service initially, but are trying to ensure there are no barriers to nurse prescribers providing the service once it is rolled out and more embedded.</p></speech>

Although I would be very supportive in the future of prescribing midwives and clinical pharmacists being involved in the provision of service, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is correct that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment envisaged the provision of services being GP-led.  However, if a review can be agreed upon, that provision of services by other healthcare practitioners could be considered at that stage.  We are trying to provide access for women to termination of pregnancy services in the safest way possible.  In order to embed the service initially and deliver it in a safe way, it would be preferable to deal with one group of medical professionals who are governed by the Irish Medical Council.  Work on the guidelines is ongoing in partnership with the professional medical colleges.  It would over-complicate the matter to involve other healthcare professionals in the provision of services at this time but that could be reconsidered in a review.</p></speech>

In bringing forward the legislation, I am very conscious that we are doing exactly what we said we would do.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is correct that from a legal point of view people voted to repeal the eighth amendment and insert the new wording in the Constitution.  I have heard him say it many times.  However, the people did so in the knowledge that if they voted "Yes" and the amendment was passed, the Government would bring forward the legislation outlined in the general scheme I published in March and updated in July.  That resulted in the Bill I published in September.</p><p>I have tried at each stage not to deviate in any fundamental way from the heads of the Bill.  It was to be - and, God almighty, we must have all said it countless times - a doctor-led service and it was to be about women and their doctors.  I am purposely seeking a review clause in the legislation as a result of looking at other jurisdictions where legislators thought all they needed to do was pass a Bill and that they had dealt with the issue forever.  For us to do that would be a dereliction of our duty.  It is appropriate that we return to the issue and make sure the legislation continues to be in line with best international practice.  That is what a review clause will accomplish.  </p><p> I appreciate Deputy Coppinger's point about the safety of an abortion and about not needing a doctor.  We see value in moving from a point where a woman, in the privacy of her home in a lonely situation, is ordering a pill online and taking it to one where a woman, like any citizen in this country, has the benefit of engagement with her doctor and can have all the information and facts presented to her and all of her care needs met.  </p><p> On this occasion I am not in a position to accept the amendments.  I am happy to further engage between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

At this stage, after some considerable time, we have come through debate which was long and difficult for many people throughout the country, including health professionals.  We discussed this issue in the run up to the referendum wherein we referred to a GP-led service.  The reason for that was to ensure the highest level of medical expertise was made available at the earliest stage to a woman who might be in a crisis pregnancy or who had concerns about the pregnancy in whatever shape or form.  We should remain true to that.  We should not run off in different directions at this stage, improving what we said at the time.  We did not say it so we cannot afford to uphold it.  It would be a retrograde step to do it at this stage.  We should stand by what we said when we spoke about it prior to the referendum.  We told people what we were going to do and we did it in good faith.  While there might be various reasons put forward at a later stage about how it can be improved, they are for a later stage and not for now.  We have reached a position where we are introducing regulations in respect of at-home terminations where there were no regulations whatsoever previously.  We should stick to our guns and remain as we said we were going to do.  I disagree with the amendments.</p></speech>

Abortion is a serious issue.  From my perspective, there are two individuals involved.  In most countries that provide for abortions, women die from legal abortions.  It needs to be put on the record.  Patient safety is important.  If people want to change it, it will be possible to change it in the D&aacute;il in future years.  Before we do that, we should consult all the people in the health sector to understand their perspectives on it rather than legislating for it now.</p></speech>

A GP-led service is a service where one rings up and makes an appointment at one's GP clinic.  As we move towards Sl&aacute;intecare, and hopefully we will, it will mostly be in primary care centres located in communities.  It could also be in an IFPA clinic or a Well Woman Centre.  The GP is the person with whom one makes the appointment but one might need a cervical smear, injection, flu jab or some kind of diabetes check-up and one will often see the nurse.  The practitioner runs the clinic and the nurse may deliver the service.  The GP still leads the clinical service but another practitioner carries out the administration of the service one has attended for.  We all get smears taken by nurses by and large and not by doctors but it is done in a doctor's clinic.  I understand, and I think the public understood, that a GP-led service will not necessarily mean one must see the GP.  I would have thought the Minister and the Department would welcome the broadening of that definition given the crisis in GP services.  There is a drastic shortage of GPs.  We also have nurses in clinics who can do this work.  Midwives work in Well Woman Centres and for the IFPA.  It is sensible to extend the definition now and not later so women can have access to abortion.  Otherwise we will narrow access because we cannot get ready access to GPs for normal things like the need for antibiotics.</p></speech>

When one is pregnant, which is obviously much more serious, one often sees a nurse.  I hardly ever saw a doctor.  Perhaps people do not understand that is how GP-led services work.  People should not make out that there will be a big change from the current regime.  In 1967 when the Abortion Act was being drafted in Britain, a provision relating to two doctors was inserted.  That is not necessary now because things have moved on so much.  With the abortion pill we knew it would be much more simple.  I will refer to the phrase "surgical abortion".  It is not surgery; it is just a vacuum.  The reason I mention it is other abortions such as late term abortions are much more complicated for health reasons and for other reasons but they are a minority.  We are introducing a new law.</p> <p>  I will make one comment about the nature of the referendum debate.  It is bad form if people used arguments in the referendum debate that were not necessary and if they over complicated the issues.  That might have happened.  It was made clear in the committee, and we knew from testimony, that the abortion pill could be administered by a lot more than a doctor.   This is not a breach of faith in the context of what people voted on.  </p></speech>

It reduces the level and standard of care that people expected when they voted to repeal the eighth amendment and put it in our hands to decide.  I believe we should make haste slowly.  GPs were mentioned.  The 1967 Act in the UK provided for two GPs.  We have to tread carefully and ensure it does not widen the scope.  A significant number of GPs have difficulty with the issue as have many midwives and people who contacted me.  We need to make haste slowly.</p></speech>

With a GP-led service, the GP would be in charge. Even if one is sent to the nurse, the GP would know what is going on.  I disagree with Deputy Coppinger.  Abortion is a big thing and can go very wrong, like anything else.  It needs to be supervised by a GP because the people voted for a GP-led service.</p></speech>

Nurses and midwives will have a role in caring for women in our health service accessing these services, as they do today,.  There is no question in that regard.  The 24-7 helpline, which I imagine will be the first point of call for many women in crisis, will be operated by nurses and midwives.  I do not wish my comments to be misrepresented but nurses and midwives will have a role to play.  Nurses and midwives just like doctors will have a right to conscientiously object which in and of itself is a recognition that they have a role to play in the care of the woman.  The question comes back to the carrying out of the procedure.  It is right and proper that my Department should keep these matters under review.  It is right and proper that we do not do what was done in the UK, which is just pass legislation and leave it sitting on the Statute Book for years when other countries have more modern systems.  We should review this legislation in a period of years.</p><p>We should embed what we said we would do and monitor closely how it works.  A large amount of work is being done by the medical colleges, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in drawing up the model of care and care pathways.  They are doing excellent work, and it is appropriate that they are doing that work and we are not.</p><p> This clear pathway needs to be agreed and embedded.  I believe this to be the appropriate way to go, but I am happy to keep this issue under review.  I recognise Deputy O'Reilly's points about nurse prescribers.  In line with what I believe was the spirit of the all-party committee's report and what we said during the referendum, the most straightforward and logical thing to do is to have a doctor-led service where the doctor has to carry out the procedure.  The nurse and midwife will have a role, as they do excellently on a daily basis elsewhere in our health service in terms of the care and well-being of the woman.</p><p> It would not be a good idea to accept these amendments.  Taking Deputy O'Reilly's suggestion, I will review the submissions received from those two excellent organisations, which played a large role in advocating for change and looking after women's interests.</p></speech>

The definition proposed in the legislation reintroduces the language of the eighth amendment.  No matter one's view or what side one was on, the people made how they felt about the eighth amendment clear, in that they wanted it gone.  It is now gone, so I do not see why we should be replicating its language in this legislation.</p></speech>

As I outlined when discussing the first grouping, Deputies have proposed changing the definition of "termination of pregnancy" contained in the Bill to include the use of the term "abortion" or to refer instead to the ending of pregnancy using a medical or surgical procedure.</p> <p>  On the language used in the Bill, the 36th amendment of the Constitution inserted a new Article 40.3.3o, which reads: "Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy."  This Bill is the means by which the Oireachtas exercises its new constitutional authority.  In this way, the Oireachtas is carrying out the will of the people as expressed in the result of the referendum.  Using the language of the new article in the legislation seeks to give effect to the provisions and provides clarity and consistency in our law.  By referring to "termination of pregnancy" rather than "abortion", the Bill seeks to maintain that consistency and avoid any potential doubt or unintended legal consequence that could flow from departing from that language.</p> <p>  This is not just a legal argument, although my legal concerns about changing the language are real and genuine.  The wording of the definition has also been considered from a medical perspective with a view to ensuring clarity for medical practitioners practising in this field.  I will reference a letter signed by many doctors that I know was sent to the committee last night.  It makes a number of constructive suggestions about how to improve the legislation.  I am sure that we will get to those.  In section 2, it specifically states that the proposal in the published amendments to change the definition of "termination of pregnancy" from ending the life of the foetus to ending the pregnancy further reduces the clarity on the medical and surgical procedures that will be able to be legally practised by specialists.  While I understand the good intention of the amendment, it is the view of the legal experts advising me and the view of the medical experts advising all of us that "end a pregnancy" does not provide the clarity for which our doctors are asking.  In my conversations with medical practitioners, I have not been asked to change this definition because they believe it provides them with clarity.</p> <p>  I detested the language of the eighth amendment as well.  That is why I was delighted to join with Deputy O'Reilly and others in asking the people of Ireland to remove the eighth amendment.  Its language was the language of the unborn.  It was not about rights, as the foetus has rights.  Rather, it was about the rights of the unborn equalling the rights of the woman.  The word "unborn" is different to the word "foetus" and "foetus" is a medical term.</p> <p>  The people of Ireland voted.  The Deputy is right, in that we will all endeavour to interpret and put our slants on how they voted, but we know that they voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  However, we also know that they voted to regulate the area.  As the Supreme Court suggested there would be, there are still protections for the life of the foetus.  The Bill is the only legislation in which reference to that life is made at all.</p><p>We all need to remember that outside of the circumstances regulated for in this Bill, the destruction of the life of the foetus will still be illegal, and, in my view should be.  There are broad parameters for women in crisis pregnancies under the four headings.  Reference to the life of the foetus is appropriate from a medical and legal point of view in respect of the balancing of rights.  It is different from the language of the eighth amendment, which provided for an equal right to life of the unborn.  While Deputies are doing this for a good reason and we are all eager to get this right and to make sure that we move away from the language of stigma that has dominated discussions in this area for 35 years, we have to take seriously both the medical and legal advice on amending this definition.</p></speech>

The reference, "to end the life of a foetus" is probably one of the most important in the legislation and it is the reason it is contentious for many people and their views.  It is a sobering reference for sure.  It is also scientifically true because we are talking about two individual living human beings, according to science.  It is dangerous to move away from science when it comes to the definitions used in these Bills, which will make it more complex, difficult and have unforeseen consequences down the road.  I oppose the deletion of that reference.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate language to insert and we are pulling the language of the eighth amendment into the legislation.  However, the Minister has laid out the legal and medical advice.  If the constitutional lawyers, drafters and medics are telling us that this is what is needed to make the legislation legally and medically robust, and critically provide much needed clarity to the doctors, then so be it.  I, therefore, do not support amending the provision for those reasons.  It is a pity that other language that could have been equally robust legally, and provided as much clarity could not have been found.  Unfortunately, it does still sound like we are pulling some of the language into the legislation.  The Minister has laid out a reasonable medical and legal argument for why we, unfortunately, need to keep it as it is.  This exact language was in the heads of the Bill.  Of course we will all have different views as to what the people of Ireland voted for.  There is no different view as to what the heads of the Bill were because they are black and white and this language is in the heads of the Bill as well.</p></speech>

I take on board what the Minister said about the legal advice.  I am concerned about the language here.  We have spoken a number of times this morning about respecting the will expressed by the people in May.  In keeping with that sense, we must constantly focus on who is the person at the centre of all of this, which is the woman.  The people voted for the woman to be placed at the centre and she is the person who is capable of carrying a pregnancy.  When a woman is pregnant she is not carrying a life, as such, but carrying a pregnancy.  Everywhere the legislation states "to end the life of a foetus", I have proposed that we change the words to "end a pregnancy" because the language is too foetus-centric or focused on the foetus rather than the woman or person carrying the pregnancy.  A woman may have a pregnancy and wish to end it.  She does not have a life that she wishes to end.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Donnelly's reference to the carrying over of language from the past into this legislation.  I am most concerned about that, notwithstanding the medical and legal advice that the Minister has received.  We can go around the houses forever, and we have done previously, defining when life begins and never agree.   I imagine that we would all agree when pregnancy begins.  Everyone can have different feelings about when life begins but we cannot have legislation based on feelings.  I accept what the Minister has said but I am uncomfortable with the language.  We should be able to reserve the right to have meetings with officials in the Department, law experts and medical people and consider the matter when we debate Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  If this matter cannot be changed then, so be it.  There is a general feeling, having listened to people here who spoke in favour of these amendments, that the language is negative and is not woman-centred.</p></speech>

I fully respect the decision of the voters who voted on the abortion referendum last May.  It was a very hard fought campaign for all involved.  The electorate decided to vote for change and it is now up to the Oireachtas to deal with same.  Over the next number of days I will listen to some amendments.</p> <p>  I oppose amendment No. 7 because it is an attempt to water down the definition for a termination by removing the phrase "a medical procedure which is intended to end the life of a foetus".</p></speech>

The short answer is "Yes".  Every formula of words has been examined in consultation with the Attorney General, my own officials and legal advisers in my Department.  The reason that I am satisfied with this language is the medical community is largely satisfied with it.  In a letter to all of us, which was sent to me this morning and, I think, sent to the committee last night, 24 maternal foetal medicine specialists, convened at the behest of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, which very much welcomed the introduction of this Bill, have come to us with a number of amendments.  They are critical of something in the legislation so there will be arguments on this that I will have to address later.  They asked us in their letter not to amend the definition from ending the life of the foetus to ending the pregnancy.  Long after we have passed this legislation, there will be obstetricians and gynaecologists in maternity hospitals.  They have been asking all of us - and they ask the people - to let them get on with their job and have clarity.  They are asking us not to change the wording because, in their words, "it further reduces clarity on the medical and surgical procedures".  This is not necessarily about my opinion or my view of the world.  Some of them, whom I know all of us hold in the highest regard, have asked us not to do this because they are worried that it will lessen the clarity.  As a committee, we have to reflect on that.  I am more than happy, as are my officials, to engage with members on this between now and Report Stage but I take seriously what they say.  I also take seriously the legal advice on changing it.</p> <p>  Everybody has worked hard, as did the cross-party committee and the Citizens' Assembly, on how this should be addressed, how to achieve the right wording, how to make sure it is legally watertight, and how to make sure it works.  I am just worried about reopening the debate on the definition when this has appeared in general schemes and been debated at length but I get what members are trying to do.</p> <p>  I would also make the practical point about ending a pregnancy.  There will be women, particularly in the space of fatal foetal abnormalities, who will have twins and they will not end their pregnancy.  The advice available to me is that there are multiple births.  It is not always the case that a woman who accesses an abortion is ending her pregnancy or that a woman who has a termination is ending her pregnancy.  It may be that one of the foetuses is unviable or both. This is a complicated area, which is why I am reluctant to deviate, but I am more than happy to engage with members between now and Report Stage, and to make officials available to engage with them as well.</p></speech>

I note the position in regard to twins.  The definition of abortion laid out by the Citizens' Assembly is that the intention is to deliberately enter a procedure which will terminate the life of the foetus or the unborn or whatever the case may be.  However, the support for that harsh language was not evident at the time we discussed those things during the course of the hearings of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  That is why we need to be a little bit sensitive to the issues that affect women.  During the course of the committee hearings we came across several cases of women who were unsure, uncertain, isolated, alone and fearful of what the implications were.  In some cases, it may be a greater assurance to women in those circumstances to have less terminal language, no pun intended language.  By stating what is legally acceptable and legally advised, it may well be that a woman or a girl in certain circumstances may not feel she has the entitlement, the support or is happy and free to proceed in the way she wants to.  Let us remember also that we spent a great deal of time during the committee hearings on the topic of counselling and the need to be supportive and helpful to the girl or woman who finds herself in a position where she feels she has to seek a termination.  Notwithstanding all the other points made, these points should be borne in mind.</p></speech>

It is not the best definition in the world.  I would have thought that "pregnancy" would be more all encompassing.</p> <p>  There has been a suggestion by a couple of people who are against abortion that we are somewhat trying to sanitise the procedure by taking the word "foetus" out.  I am thrilled the word "foetus" is being used by these people because all we heard during the debate was the "child".  We were trying to get a more scientific definition that there are stages in a pregnancy, sometimes it is a foetus, sometimes it is an embryo, sometimes it is a zygote and sometimes it is a child.  It is nothing to do with sanitising the process but trying to find the best definition and I think that is what people are genuinely doing.</p></speech>

I am not speaking for other people but, to varying degrees, a view has been expressed by the members that the language is not satisfactory.  Is there a sense that the Minister is amenable to further discussions and potentially revisiting that language?  The Minister can hear from the points made the difficulty we have with the language.  Nobody wants to see the language of stigma and so on replicated but there is a view here that language is problematic.  I am loath to withdraw amendment No. 7 unless I get some comfort that the language used will be revisited.  The language used is not inclusive.  I read the same correspondence the Minister read, but there is also correspondence that will counter that.  We have to read all the correspondence and come to our own view.  I have formed the view that the language as written is not satisfactory and not in keeping with the way to make the legislation more progressive and less stigmatising.</p> <p>  Will the Minister confirm that he is amenable to revisiting that language - this does not necessarily mean we will get agreement - between now and Report Stage?</p></speech>

To my mind there is an issue with amendment No. 7 in that the word "abortion" is in it and we heard this morning that there is a constitutional issue there.  I would like to be able to support the amendment if a vote was called but obviously my preference is for amendment No. 9, which I tabled.  I think we could park all four amendments, Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, if we could get an agreement that we could revisit the language.  It is universally accepted by those proposing this group of amendments that the language is not appropriate.  I have spoken to the Minister about this but I am exceptionally uncomfortable with termination of pregnancy being defined as the ending of the life of a foetus.  It is a departure from the essence of the evidence produced by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.</p> <p>  I have not read that correspondence from the 24 doctors to which the Minister referred.  I would like to see it from all angles.  We are all focused on getting the best possible definition that does not leave women stigmatised and that women, and nobody else, are at the centre.</p></speech>

However, I would not necessarily agree with some of the amendments because of legal issues.  The real issue is that this is not women-centric and the language is hurtful.  It is not what the people who have spoken to me expect.  Based on the themes raised in the discourse, I hope the Minister will find a mechanism to change the language.</p> <p>  Members got similar letters to the one the Minister received from the doctors this morning.  The Minister needs to look again at this between Committee and Report Stages in order that he can, in some way, embrace the views expressed by members on desensitising the language and making it more woman-centric.  Otherwise, there will be votes.</p></speech>

I agree that we should not be legislating on the basis of feelings but we should not be legislating on the basis of euphemisms either.  We need to be able to accept the advice of science and medicine as regards to when the life of an unborn child starts.  In fairness, there are many on the pro-choice side who will have a view and accept it is a life as well.  I would be uncomfortable with regard to deleting the medical and scientific evidence.</p></speech>

These are the 24 doctors who make up the maternal foetal medical specialist group who are drawing up the clinical guidelines and the care pathways for women.  I am not going to change language to give language that would be nicer to have, if that language means that women cannot have the service.  That is the difficulty.  We all want language that is destigmatising but we must ensure that in changing the language we are not stopping the doctors doing what they want and have asked us for so many decades to do, which is to give them clarity.</p><p>They have said to us that this wording would cause them to have less clarity.  That is what they said to us this morning.  We have a job to do in passing legislation while they have a job to do in preparing the clinical guidelines.  We need to be careful that we are both respectful of those roles and that they dovetail.  I have had good engagement with Deputy O'Connell on this and I fully agree with what she wants to do and why she wants to get there.  I am fully supportive of that as I am of Deputy O'Reilly and the others who tabled these amendments but I just need to be extraordinarily careful.  Everyone wants us to be careful that we do not end up accidentally providing less clarity for our medics, who say in a letter to the committee, not to me, that this would be the unintended consequence of the proposed amendments.  I suggest that we engage between now and Report Stage with my officials and with the legal experts and that I would also further engage with Dr. Peter Boylan as the clinical adviser, and that we would have an honest appraisal of the situation.  I do not want to create false optimism or suggest that I think it would be easy to come up with a formula that would provide that legal and medical clarity but I am more than happy to try it.</p></speech>

It is not at all that I as a Minister am against more inclusive language.  We can have as many votes as we want on these amendments.  The reality is no-one in this room will provide medical care for these women, with the exception, perhaps, of the Chairman.  The people who will provide medical care for women will be the professionals in the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists who sent this letter.  We have to take it seriously, alongside the legal advice we have had.  We have to make sure that our language mirrors what the Constitution says so that there is no legal challenge but we also have to make sure that the legislation is operable.</p> <p>  There are other suggestions in this letter that the committee members have all seen that I am going to have to reflect on between now and Report Stage to improve the legislation as well.  It is not just about these amendments.  This group of medics has views on many areas.  There is an onus on us when they make us aware of these views to respond accordingly.</p></speech>

I do not want to suggest anything would have unintended consequences or cause problems for the medical experts and I agree that this has to be operable.  When we received all the amendments the other day, I applied a basic principle of looking at them with two points in mind, namely, who we are doing it for and who we are doing it to.  I tried to apply a principle that the woman was central to all of it and that is why I am concerned about this.  However, I accept the body of evidence supporting where the Minister is coming from.  I recognise that he has no desire to put in complicated, chilling language or anything that would be offensive.  I would be happy to be part of those discussions leading up to Report Stage, along with my colleagues, to get some clarity on this issue.</p></speech>

It is clear that members of the LGBT community were very much part of the referendum campaign.  They were our allies and I do not want to be seen to abandon people at this point in the proceedings.  We have to be alert to the realities of the people who are going to use the service.  I do not hold with some of the other amendments that go through the Bill line by line and propose amending every single reference.  However, I support the concept of one all-encompassing amendment that makes it clear that when we say &quot;woman&quot;, we mean any person that can be pregnant.  We will have the debate but we are going back to the issue of inclusive language.  To be modern and forward thinking, we need to be in a position to use language that is as inclusive as we can make it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#O03600"><p>I am speaking to amendment No. 12 but they are both similar.  This is an important question.  The Government itself is bringing in reviews of the Gender Recognition Act yet we are proposing legislation today that does not recognise transgender people.  This is not just cosmetic.  There is fear among trans people that they will be excluded should they go to their doctor.  I will give the Minister an example of something that has come up with a transgender person I know who has not physically transitioned but has changed their gender legally.  They used to play a sport and were told they could no longer play that sport in their former gender even though physically they were the same.  The reason I mention this is that it shows that the legal definition of our gender is critical, not just what we are physically.  Last Saturday, I met a group of transgender people and they also raised this.</p> <p>  I am finding it hard to understand how the Government has gone as far as this point because the issue was flagged during the summer.  We keep hearing these vague references to legal advice saying we have to do this but we have not been given the explanation as to why the legal advice cannot move with the times in 2018.  It just seems strange given that the Government is also bringing in something progressive in the introduction of non-binary as a gender.  LGBT and non-binary people played a sterling, lead role in this referendum.  Young people who are non-binary and LGBT people were at the forefront on the ground of this campaign.  They may not have been featured in the debates or at the large official events - lots of us were not at any of those - but people on the ground were the ones who led this, particularly young people.</p><p>It is a bit of a smack in the face.  I ask the Minister to please accept the amendments.  The best definition is important and not just for transgender people.  The definition of a pregnant person should be anyone who can become pregnant.  I also have a fear that the word "woman" could be used to prevent somebody who is a girl in legal terms from having an abortion as well.  It would cover all those aspects.  If the Minister wishes to include "woman" and "pregnant person", that would be fine, and I am not overly concerned about that.  This is something that is really exercising people and there is much fear because of it.  We must recognise the amendment and there should be a vote on it.</p></speech>

I want it to be trans-inclusive.  I want a very clear message to go out from these Houses that this legislation is inclusive of transgender people.  There would be unintended consequences to this, and Deputy Coppinger has correctly asked me to explain what those are.  I will do that now.  I suggest that either with a delegation of the health committee or without such a delegation I meet a representative group of trans people to discuss this with them between now and Report Stage.  I also suggest amending the explanatory memorandum to the legislation to make it very clear that the legislation is inclusive.  The legislation is inclusive but as our President said very recently, words matter, and I get that.  When we put in words, we do not want to have unintended consequences that would entirely accidentally cause potential adverse consequences for trans people in accessing other services.</p><p>I very much and sincerely share the Deputy's aims and views on this but I cannot accept the proposed amendments.  The definition of &quot;woman&quot; in the Bill means a female person of any age.  It has always been my Department's policy position that a biologically female individual identifying as a male should enjoy the same rights as a woman for the purpose of this legislation.  That is the policy intention and we should be very clear that nobody needs to change the Department's policy intention.  It is the policy intention of this legislation, me as Minister and my Department.  Section 18(<i>b</i>) of the Interpretation Act 2005 is of pivotal importance in ensuring that rights contained in legislation of a gendered nature apply seamlessly to trans people.  It provides:</p><blockquote>(i) A word importing the masculine gender should be read as also importing the feminine gender;<br /><br />(ii) In an Act passed on or after 22 December 1993, and in a statutory instrument made after that date, a word importing the feminine gender shall be read as also importing the masculine gender;</blockquote> <p>The Constitution, the Statute Book and statutory instruments contain many gendered provisions; somebody told me there are more than 600 from relatively recent years.  These are often in the context of providing protection to women in connection with pregnancy, childbirth or the elimination of gender-based discrimination.  Cumulatively, these sources contain hundreds of specific references to women and each of these references to &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;women&quot; seamlessly include trans men where appropriate in the context by virtue of the operation of section 18(<i>b</i>) of the Interpretation Act.</p><p>Section 18 of that Act and its effective operation are of particular importance to trans men in the context of pregnancy, childbirth, related employed rights and entitlements, maternity leave etc. under the Health Acts.  These statutes all refer repeatedly to women, mothers and motherhood without making specific reference to others to whom it is appropriate they would apply.  Whether they should is a much broader piece of work but as of today there are many pieces of legislation that mention &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;motherhood&quot; that apply seamlessly to trans men.  It is vital they do to enable access to some services.  With the Interpretation Act, trans men are in a legally effective way included in the scope of the legislation without the need for intervening legislation.  That was the purpose of the Interpretation Act of 2005.</p><p>The proposal to define &quot;woman&quot; in this Bill to include a person whose preferred gender has been recognised via the 2005 Act would be a departure from the established and, it is fair to say, highly effective practice that ensures trans men can access services through legislation.  My Department has received advice on this and I have spoken directly with legal advisers on the matter.  It indicates that to define &quot;woman&quot; in the Bill would create significant risk, which is what I am worried about, that would have the potential to cast real doubt on other gendered provisions in other pieces of legislation.  It could open the possibility of somebody arguing that, by implication, references to women or other gendered references in the Statute Book did not appropriately include trans people.  This would be an obvious unintended consequence that nobody here would wish for.</p><p>There is a broader aspect to this and my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is addressing the review of the Gender Recognition Act 2015, as Deputy Coppinger correctly mentioned.  That review is ongoing and there will be a review clause in this piece of legislation.  I will explicitly ensure that this is very clear in the explanatory memorandum, which would not have a legal consequence but would make it very clear to people that this legislation is trans-inclusive.  The legislation is today trans-inclusive and there is no legal doubt about that.  I take the point that words matter and the Deputy wants it to be very clear that the Act will be inclusive.  I would love to be in a position to say today that we will include &quot;pregnant person&quot; in the definition.  None of us has the luxury of doing so while ignoring the legal advice indicating that I would be causing a problem for trans men in doing so if they are to continue accessing other services that they can correctly access today.  That is the risk.</p><p>I am happy to engage between now and Report Stage with Deputies Coppinger, O'Reilly and other Deputies who have raised this.  I am happy to further tease out what I have articulated and meet the representative groups, which would be important.  I want them and the people of Ireland to know - nobody should be in any doubt - that this legislation is inclusive in its provisions for trans men.  Unfortunately, what seems like a relatively simple thing in a legislative process could have unintended consequences.  It is for those reasons and with a very heavy heart that I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#P00300"><p>I welcome the Minister's comments but I support Deputy O'Reilly's amendment.  It sounds like many of us are on the same page in what we want to achieve and the 2005 Act is clearly very important.  I want to press this a little more.  One of the great problems with the eighth amendment was that it caused confusion for doctors.  There were several issues with it but one was that it caused confusion and a lack of clarity.  That is what the doctors told us.  I am concerned that if we do not amend this legislation, that same lack of clarity could be reproduced here.  We have not reached the sections yet but sections 5 or 6 relate to offences and there is still a reference to a 14-year jail term for straying outside the provisions of this legislation.  Doctors, nurses, midwives and everybody involved with termination of pregnancy services will be taking this deadly seriously and ensuring they are protected, as well as the pregnant people.</p> <p>  The Minister, having access to departmental advice and the Attorney General's office, can have a conversation with us about the matter referencing the 2005 Act and therefore seeing this as okay.  A GP in a surgery or an obstetrician or gynaecologist in an acute setting will not have that knowledge.  They will have the Bill, which references a pregnant woman, and they could be dealing with a trans man.  They could be dealing with a pregnant person who not only identifies as being male but who has been legally recognised as male and has an Irish passport stating that he is male, despite being pregnant.  The question is whether we are creating confusion in such circumstances for the doctor.  He or she may look at it and think that if he or she gets it wrong, he or she could be going to jail for 14 years.  The doctor would not want to get it wrong.  He or she might not know what the 2005 Act states but there is reference to "pregnant woman" in this legislation.  The patient in question may be a man, defined and identifying as a man with a passport that indicates he is male.  What would the doctor do?  My concern is there would be confusion.</p> <p>  I am supportive of the amendments.  Such circumstances may be at the margin.  The 2005 Act was highly progressive but we have moved on 13 years and other things have happened.  There has been recognition of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people, as well as gay marriage and rights.  I support the amendments but I take in good faith the comments of the Minister.  He is not pushing against the spirit of the amendments.  I would like the Minister to address if he could the points I raised.</p><p>My concern is that a doctor will read the legislation, which will say "pregnant woman", and be unsure what to do.  We have seen that sort of confusion in the past with the eighth amendment, leading to some tragic outcomes.</p></speech>

This issue is of considerable concern to the trans community.  I welcome the Minister telling the committee that he is willing to meet to explain the matter.  Perhaps we can get legal advice about the interpretation of the 2005 Act and how it affects the legislation.  I made a specific point on this on Second Stage.  As has been said, doctors may face a great deal of confusion and it is crucial that what and whom the Act covers is clear.</p></speech>

As a layperson and non-lawyer, this was the first thing I wanted to do and it seemed to make perfect sense.  I wondered why one would not want to do it.  When we looked at it in much more detail from a legal perspective, I was told by much greater minds than mine that it was not so straightforward and there could be that unintended consequence.</p> <p>  I would certainly meet a representative group, members of the health committee or both between now and Report Stage.  There is zero policy difference between the Deputies and me on this matter and I want to provide for it too, but I am told I cannot do so legally.  Deputy Donnelly correctly said that the world has moved on considerably from what was definitely progressive legislation in 2005, but the world is a different and, in my view, better place in its understanding of these matters now, which indicates the broader work that must be done and that is being led by my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to review the Gender Recognition Act in its totality, which I know is under way.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly made a separate point about clarity.  To return to our conversation earlier, there is nobody in this room or the Oireachtas who wishes to cause any confusion or lack of clarity for any doctor.  We wanted to move beyond that and I will talk to Dr. Boylan in the context of the clinical guidelines.  I fully take Deputy Donnelly's point but I hope it is not the law that doctors pick up but rather the clinical guidelines.  I will ask Dr. Boylan whether this should be included in the clinical guidelines to be certain that this legislation relates to trans people.  I fully accept that one would not want there to be any confusion in the medical community.  </p> <p>  I will look at the explanatory memo.  I do not know about other members of the committee but when many of us, myself included, read legislation, the first thing we tend to read is the explanatory memo to learn what the Bill is about and what it tries to achieve.  That tends to be the accessible way of reading and understanding legislation.  For all of us, and I am sure for the public at large, the explanatory memo is usually the first point of reference.  I have just talked to officials here about possibly amending the explanatory memo between now and Report Stage because, as I said, we all want to do this and none of us wishes to do it in such a way that there would be an unintended consequence.</p></speech>

I feel somewhat conflicted because this is an important issue and any time it is raised we receive this answer about legal advice to which we are not privy.  I know the Minister is giving us a brief outline but it is still unclear.  The gist of what he said was that if we insert "pregnant person" it could leave open the potential for somebody to take a legal challenge against other laws which do not take the same approach.  I am not a legal person but I find that hard to believe and I do not get it.  The scenario that Deputy Donnelly and I outlined is more likely, where somebody who has legally transitioned to being a trans man, but who could become pregnant, could go to his doctor and have that experience.  The Minister is in a Government that says it will do these things for trans people, but surely with all the legal brains that we have something could have been done.  The Minister says some provision will be made in the explanatory memo and the clinical guidelines.</p></speech>

One often hears wild claims, such as during the debate on repealing the eighth amendment, and, therefore, I am not fully convinced.</p></speech>

I do not wish to ignore the legal advice that suggests that people could take challenges that could cause difficulties for people.  None of us wants that to happen.  Through my speaking points, I shared the totality of the advice I received and there is nothing I am keeping from the committee in that regard.  This was one of the suggestions that I genuinely, and naively, thought we could surely just do, that is, insert "and pregnant person".  I am duty bound, however, to share with the committee the potential unintended consequences of that.</p> <p>  In good faith, I propose to the committee that I will make available to it officials and legal advisers in the Department to outline the potential unintended consequences, as they have done to me, that I will meet the representative groups, either with a delegation of this committee or not, to alter the explanatory memo, and that I will talk to Dr. Boylan about the clinical guidelines.  I cannot put anything in the guidelines myself and no one would want me to.  Deputies Donnelly and O'Reilly are entirely right that the guidelines are one area where we do not want any lack of clarity for trans men.  I hope to be allowed to do those things and work with the committee on them, and the Deputies will certainly have the right to revisit this issue on Report Stage, as will I if I identify a way of making progress on it.</p></speech>

I share the concern expressed by Deputy Donnelly about a doctor sitting in a surgery, looking at the law and wondering what is allowed and what the risks are.  It is a serious issue.  We have the right to revisit this but in the meantime members of the trans community themselves need to be central to the debate because they are the ones who will be affected or not by this legislation.  One of the unintended, or possibly intended, consequences could be that there will be fabulously inclusive legislation, which would be wonderful.  We want to ensure it does not discriminate against any group and that we have the opportunity to say that, notwithstanding what happened in 2005,13 years later we have moved on and the legislation should reflect that.</p> <p>  If we are moving to the business end of proceedings I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 11 on the basis of commitments given by the Minister and of engagement with members of the trans community.</p></speech>

Recent research carried out by Am&aacute;rach showed the majority of taxpayers were opposed to funding abortion; indeed, 44% of those opposed were &quot;Yes&quot; voters.  At a time when our health service is creaking at the seams, with September figures indicating 8,000 people were on trolleys, 718,000 people waiting to be seen or treated by a doctor and children having to wait 18 months for scoliosis treatment, the injection of &euro;12 million as a starting point for elective abortion services is unacceptable.  As an elected representative, I have to highlight my constituents' concerns. I will be bringing this amendment to Report Stage. </p></speech>

To put forward the idea that only someone whose life is at risk should have their termination paid for while that of any other person would not is cruel.  Bringing this down to brass tacks, this would include Savita.  Savita did not have an abortion because her life was not deemed to be at risk, it was "only her health".  Under this amendment, she should not have benefited in any way.  This and another stream of amendments have angered people over the weekend.  </p> <p>  On the general issue of cost, we could decide not to fund abortions and continue to send people abroad and ignore reality.  Could I, however, just make a case for how we will save money?  I was thinking about this over the weekend.  The cost of having an abortion if, for example, one travels to the UK is anything from &euro;1,000.  That money will now be in the pockets of working class and ordinary women.  That is a really important saving for them and their families because, contrary to what the anti-abortion crowd thinks, the majority of people who have abortions are actually mothers already.  They have other people in their families to look after.  We are not going to rehearse the referendum - we won it - but I am struck by the cruelty of some of these amendments.  People will have money in their pockets that they would not have if we continued to export them.  I look on this as one of the biggest victories for ordinary women in a long time in this country and make no apology for that.  The idea that any person who needed an abortion on health or other grounds would be deprived is cruel.  Recently, a relative of mine who was pregnant with twins with a fatal foetal abnormality had to have an abortion.  If Deputy Nolan is suggesting for one minute that that should not be paid for, she would really need to examine her whole humanity. </p></speech>

Recently I met a woman who has a gynaecological problem and has been on waiting list for two years.  She has a problem with terminations being paid for by the taxpayer even though she campaigned for a "Yes" vote.  Will Deputy Nolan include fatal foetal abnormality in the exceptions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#W00200"><p>Before I get into the substance of what Deputy Nolan is trying to do, the amendment is tabled to the wrong section of the Bill.  This section has nothing to do with eligibility.  That is section 25, which deals with the amendment to the Health Act.  This section is in every piece of legislation.  It allows the Minister of the day to administer the Bill.  Funnily enough, I will not be involved in the termination of services.  That will be done through the medical profession and through the eligibility section of the legislation, which is section 25.</p> <p>  To give the Deputy guidance, if she wants to do what she wants to do, and I will get onto the problem I have with that in a moment, she should be amending section 25 that deals with the Health Act and not this section of the Bill, which is a standard section in every Bill that comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Even if the amendment did what the Deputy wanted to do and was accepted it would not achieve what she is endeavouring to achieve.  For the Deputy's considerations on Report Stage, this is not the correct place in the Bill.  The correct place is the eligibility section, which is section 25.  This is the first flaw in the amendment.  Then there is the sheer humanity flaw in terms of why the Deputy wants me to ask hospitals to send bills to women who have had fatal foetal abnormalities in our maternity hospitals or to a woman who has been in a car crash and has almost died and has a serious risk to her health.  Why should I not care for these women in our hospitals today?</p> <p>  Here is some breaking news.  Women are taxpayers.  This is about providing services for women, so when we talk about taxpayers it is not a clear and distinct group of people that is different from the group of people who will benefit from the legislation.  Women are taxpayers and the people voted overwhelmingly for this legislation.  I thought it was the policy of the party of which the Deputy was a member, it is the policy of most people in the Oireachtas and it is certainly the policy of Sl&aacute;intecare, to which I believe almost all of us have all signed up, that we will move towards universality.  As we bring in new services usually in the House I get into significant difficulty if I am not providing it on a universal basis and if I decide cost is a barrier.  Should I send women who have been raped a bill?</p></speech>

I do not get Deputy Nolan's problem with it.  I get that she is very sincere and I respect her right to have her view on abortion.  She and I disagree on it and that is fine, and she has every right to hold her view, but I do not get why she has a difficulty with the Irish health service providing support.  The idea of equating this with trolleys is a crass political attack on me.  I will come in here and debate my record on health any time with any person, and I look forward to doing so, but this is a crass political attack.  Approximately 80% of these procedures will be carried out in the community.  None of these women will be on trolleys or in hospital beds.  They will visit their GP or a family planning association.  I am not re-running the referendum either, but most of the women in this country who find themselves in crisis will be seen in primary care.  They will be nowhere near hospital trolleys or hospital beds.  Those who will be in a hospital setting will often be in some of the most tragic situations.  They will have a wanted pregnancy.  Perhaps they will have been told the baby they desperately wanted has only half a head.  I do not understand the Deputy's difficulty.</p> <p>  I really resent the phrase "elective abortion" because it goes back to the cheap connotation of abortion on demand.  No woman I have ever met has said that she really wants an abortion.  I do not know whether the Deputy has met any and perhaps she will tell us about them.  These are people in extraordinarily difficult situations.  It is not for Deputy Nolan or me to judge them.  Thank God, the people of this country decided in their wisdom it is not for any of us to judge them.  This legislation is about looking after them and caring for them in our own country.  We should be moving towards a universal health service.  This is my policy position and my ethical position.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan fundamentally disagrees with the outcome of the referendum.  I am sure she respects it and she respects democracy and that the people voted in favour of it.  I accept some people voted against it and that is fine.  Think of it from a practical point of view.  If the idea here was that people voted by an overwhelming majority to repeal the eighth amendment and make these services available in our country at last, if we decide we are going to start charging people for the service cost will remain a barrier.  The young woman will use the Internet and access the pill without any doctor or medical support.  What the Deputy is trying to do here is to subvert the will of the people, which is to make sure women do not need to travel in these circumstances.</p> <p>  On a practical level the amendment is in the wrong place but that is for the Deputy to decide.  If she wants to stop me doing this she needs to amend section 25 of the legislation that allows us to do this.  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked where eligibility appears in the heads of the Bill.  Eligibility was not dealt with in the heads of the Bill and I accept this.  It is a policy decision I made.  I very much made it in line with what I felt were the views of the majority of the Oireachtas and the people.  That is my sense and the people can judge me on this decision.  Obviously it will come to an Oireachtas vote.  This is about the service being free, safe and legal.  If it is not free it will be legal but it will not be safe because women in vulnerable situations will have to travel and women in vulnerable situations will not seek medical consultation.  Whatever Deputy Nolan's view on termination, and I accept we have different views and I am respectful of this, if she found that a woman in her life was in crisis she would want that woman to have access to medical professionals.  Regardless of the Deputy's view, and we have different views on this, if that woman is going to proceed with an abortion surely the Deputy would want to know it will happen in an environment that is safe, regulated and overseen by medical professionals.  This is why I want to make sure that if women make that decision they can access the service.</p> <p>  We already have the maternity and infant care scheme.  Pregnant women in the country today access free medical care.  As the Chairman knows, it is a very successful scheme.  I accept the Deputies here want to expand it further and I welcome this discussion and debate.  Expectant mothers can already access their family doctor and the hospital obstetrician.  It is a universal service and has nothing to do with means or whether people have a medical card.  What the Deputy is asking me to do is discriminatory.  She is asking me to state that, if two pregnant women are sitting in the waiting room of their doctor's surgery, because she approves of one of those women's choices she can have the service free but because she dislikes her choice the other woman must pay.  Both pregnant women are deserving of access to the Irish healthcare system.  The only difference is one woman is making a decision the Deputy does not approve of.  Quite frankly, whether the Deputy or I approve of it is not the issue, it is the woman's choice.  I will not discriminate where the only difference between two women is their choice.  I will not say one pays for the doctor and the other does not.  That would be entirely discriminatory.  We already have a scheme that cares for pregnant women that is universal and provides free access.  All we are simply doing is stating the same fundamental policy principles should apply to all women regardless of their choice.  The Deputy has a different view.</p></speech>

I support free healthcare 100% - there is no doubt about it.  Obviously, my definition of "healthcare" is where we save lives, not end them, and this Bill is about ending lives, as such.  Of the population, 34% voted against the referendum and approximately 20% of people who voted "Yes" do not agree with this Bill.  Those people are entitled to representation.  Words such as "cruel" and "barbaric" have been used regarding some of our amendments.  Those types of word seek to close down rather than foster debate.  We have done well so far today in terms of having a good debate without any rancour or difficulty, and we should try to continue in that way.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that this should be a woman's choice and we should not discriminate between choices, but the Bill discriminates against women's choices all over the place.  It limits choice.  There are many instances in which the Minister believes a 14-year penalty should be applied as regards the choice of a woman.  He cannot pretend where choice is concerned.  The Bill does not allow for late-term abortions, for example.  That choice is prevented.  Unless the situation is made exactly the same as it is in Britain, there will always be someone who travels.  That is the truth of the matter.  I imagine that most of the people on the pro-choice side would agree on this point.  There will be women travelling after this Bill.</p></speech>

I was surprised by the backlash on the street.  When the Bill was discussed initially, I did not expect people to be annoyed.  However, they raised with me the point that 2,500 kids could not get access to mental health services.  There is a question of humanity involved in that as well.  We have a portion of money to be spent in our health services to deal with issues affecting people.  Obviously, many feel that there is a prioritisation, in that money is being found in this space but is not being found for the 750,000 people on health waiting lists or the record 9,000 in October's trolley count.  There is a question in people's minds regarding the prioritisation of money for abortion services instead of other health services of which people have considerable need.  That is my view of this Bill.</p> <p>  We should do our best.  It is a pity that Deputy Coppinger is not present, as she used the word "cruel".  It is impossible for some people not to find difficulty with the language being used because this is such a difficult space, but we should at least allow for honest debate and not try to close it down.  </p></speech>

The Sl&aacute;intecare policy is one of universal access and reducing barriers and costs.  I do not want to rerun committee or referendum work, but we heard extensive evidence of women in situations of domestic violence who might not have been able to access funds.  This is about compassion and women and not stigmatising.  It is also about having a mature and informed approach.</p> <p>  I wish to touch on an issue.  I have heard many times about the 33.4% of people who voted "No".  Conversely, one could argue that we did not allow the person who came second in the recent presidential election to occupy the &Aacute;ras for one fifth of the time.  We can get into a back and forth if members want, but it would not be helpful.  From a legislator's point of view, any triaging of women and deciding who is deserving of healthcare is regressive, judgmental, moralistic, discriminatory and contrary to what we sought to achieve in the first place.</p></speech>

Now it is &euro;50 million, emergency intervention excluded.  We have a funding crisis in our health service.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister is scaring the public to use their money, which means that some of these abortions may not be urgent or necessary.  Under the Minister's watch, we have record hospital waiting lists, the CervicalCheck scandal and the resignation of the head of the HSE.  The people of Ireland did not intent to have elective abortions rather than emergency abortions funded out of the public purse.  If commercial abortion clinics moved to Ireland, would the Irish people then be funding their abortion profits?</p> <p>  Am&aacute;rach Research conducted a survey of 1,000 people in August 2018.  Of that number, 59% opposed taxpayers funding abortions and 41% were in favour.  Interestingly, 44% of "Yes" voters were opposed to taxpayers funding abortions.  Please, Minister, stop scaring the public to use their money.</p></speech>

However, it is perfectly legitimate of any Member of the Oireachtas to query and debate which health services should be free.  For those of us who believe that termination of pregnancy services should be free, it is incumbent upon us to make the case.</p> <p>  Some of the criticism of the amendment is technically incorrect, in that it excludes sections 10 and 11.  According to it, in cases of early pregnancy and fatal foetal abnormality, which are sections 12 and 13, payment would be required and, in the cases of sections 10 and 11, which are risk to the life or health of the mother, payment would not be required.</p> <p>  I would like to speak to the sections that are not exempted by the amendment, starting with section 13 on early pregnancy.  If a woman had to pay for medical services and drugs provided in the case of early pregnancy, could that create a financial barrier to accessing health services?  It most definitely would.  A woman would have to attend a GP, which would cost &euro;50 or &euro;60, pay for drugs - I do not imagine they would be cheap - and then return to a GP, which would cost another &euro;50 or &euro;60.  She may have complications or require follow-up.  She could end up paying in the realm of hundreds of euro.  That potential cost creates a financial barrier to accessing healthcare services for women.  The Minister made an important point.  The unintended consequence of this is that women who cannot afford several hundred euro can afford to go online-----</p></speech>

For those reasons, termination of early pregnancy under section 13 must be free because we are trying to provide this service to everyone.</p> <p>  The next section that is not exempted relates to fatal foetal abnormalities.  Perhaps this was a drafting error.</p><p>I would find it unconscionable that any pregnant woman faced with a fatal foetal abnormality at the end of all of the medical care that she needs could be faced with a bill.  Let us think about this.  One is talking about GP fees, hospital visits, surgical fees, specialist fees, and after-care because a woman could be in hospitals for days or weeks.  Were this amendment to be passed we would have a situation in Ireland where a pregnant woman faced with the tragedy of a fatal foetal abnormality could be faced with a massive bill of not just thousands of euro but tens of thousands of euro.  That, to me, would be utterly unconscionable.  Maybe it was not meant in the drafting but, as this amendment is tabled, that is what it would do.</p><p> I spoke to the Minister about the following during Second Stage and there are amendments later so I will not go into the details now.  It would be a perverse situation in our country for the termination of pregnancy services would be free but contraception to reduce crisis pregnancy and other maternity services not to be free.  I have tabled amendments, some of which have been ruled out of order, to discuss the issue that all contraception should be free.  Indeed, there is highly effective longer-acting contraception that can cost hundreds of euro which, again, is another barrier.  That cost should be removed.  Although Dr. Noel Browne brought in a groundbreaking policy called the mother and child scheme, and he was pursued after his political career and destroyed by the Catholic Church for doing so, all of maternity care is not free.  For example, there are some drugs for nausea and there are costs that can be incurred by pregnant women that we will talk about later.  In terms of the amendment leading to the racking up of potential costs of hundreds of euro during early pregnancy and charging anyone for any medical care for fatal foetal abnormality, both of those would be wrong.  It is for those reasons that I believe the amendment should be opposed.        </p></speech>

It would be a travesty, having regard to the debate that has taken place in this country over the past year, in particular, both in the Citizens' Assembly and in the special committee, if it were to emerge at this stage that we were to frustrate what was intended by withdrawing the financial support.  I note the case for competing demands.  There are always competing demands in the health, housing and educational services.  Having regard to the debate that took place, this demand is regarded by many in this country as a very serious demand.  It is no harm to remember that if we were to say to people, "Well, okay, if you can afford to have all of these things done privately then that is your own business but for those of you who can't we are very sorry about that but you cannot avail of the services", it would apply even in the most extreme circumstances or in the case of Savita Halappanavar and similar cases.  It would be a terrible tragedy if we were to allow ourselves to go down that road.</p> <p>  An opinion poll indicates that 44% of the people who voted "Yes" were opposed to public funding of the service.  I do not know how it was intended to fund the service in the first place since the general impression was that we are going to have a universal service eventually.  The idea was to protect the health and lives of women, and I mean the health leading to the lives of women.  It was deemed necessary to do that, as a matter of some considerable urgency, and the people very overwhelmingly came forward to make their decision.  I remind the House again that they made their decision on the basis of the information prevailing at the time - the information that was used by the committee and for the debates of the Citizens' Assembly - all of which was important.  </p> <p>  It would be unconstitutional if we were to introduce an amendment that rendered the provisions of the legislation being proposed unavailable to a large sector of the female population.  It would be morally wrong to go down that road.  There are lots of competing demands but a woman whose life is in danger is a competing demand as well.  One can say hard cases make bad law.  I contend that a lack of law does not make for good cases or a good ending in such situations.  I am strongly of the view that the people intended that the proposals would be funded in the normal way, as part of the health service.  To strip part of that out at this stage and do otherwise would be a travesty.  </p></speech>

I urge the Deputy who proposed the amendment to consider the case of pregnant rape victims who live in direct provision, and tease out the potential consequences and hurt caused.  The majority of people have spoken, we know the results of the referendum and there is going to be legislation.  It is open to us to ensure that the services are available to a maximum number of women.  Indeed, it is open to some people to draw a line down the centre and say that the women who can afford it can access a full range of healthcare and those who cannot can get to the back of the bus or whatever.  My party opposes this regrettable amendment.

Given that we are re-running the debate of the referendum now, which may be repeated as we go through these amendments, I would like all of us to be aware that there is a job of work to be done for the women and the pregnant people of this country.  We made a commitment to them.  If we are going to keep re-running the debate we will do a complete disservice to the entire health service in Ireland, particularly in terms of women.</p> <p>  Interestingly, the amendment has not been ruled out of order.  If it suggested that it could be unconstitutional and flies in the face of the spirit of the eighth amendment or, in removing the eighth amendment, that it is morally wrong and regrettable, then how was this amendment left in yet two amendments that called for the extension of services to people in Northern Ireland were ruled out of order?  The refusal to extend the service to women who live fewer than 90 miles up the road should be more part of our debate about inclusivity rather than rehashing the long and tough debates that we have had for months and years in this country.  This amendment should have been ruled out of order and the other two amendments allowed in.  </p></speech>

Pregnant women in Ireland can visit their GP free of charge six times during their first pregnancy and five times during their second pregnancy.  Women with diabetes and other conditions can visit more often.  The amendment proposes to charge a certain subset of pregnant women because the Deputy does not like their decision.  Pregnant women can access their GP free of charge today and what is proposed in the Bill is not a radical departure but the proposed amendment tries to discriminate against some women because some members do not like the decision they are making.  I thought Ireland had moved to a better place in that regard.<br/><br/>The proposed allocation for this service is &euro;12 million and I have been asked whether this money could be allocated to meet other needs.  If the message is not to invest anything in women's healthcare until every other need has been solved, that is like asking women to go to the back of the queue.  The sum of &euro;12 million represents 0.0007% of the &euro;17 billion health budget in 2019.  It cost 0.0007% to care for women in this country.  Let us not try to suggest that this is overly generous or <i>flaithi&uacute;lach</i><i></i>after 35 years of neglect.</p></speech>

The pro-life Deputies have tabled 16 out of the 180 amendments.  We are looking for a deviation 16 times and the others are pro-choice deviations.  If we stuck to the Bill, we would not be here at this stage.  There is an opportunity for respectful opposition.  If opposition is deleted, we will have a worse Bill.  We need to test the Bill rigorously at all stages.</p> <p>  I have sympathy for Deputy Nolan's amendment.  It does not relate to serious threats to the health of the mother or to the life of the mother in any way.  Deputy Donnelly mentioned this point, but Deputy Durkan ignored the voice.  Those two sections of the Bill are not covered by this amendment.</p> <p>  There are many people who like myself have a conscientious objection to the issue of abortion.  Freedom of conscience is an important element of our society and people feel that their taxes are going to pay for an operation which in their heart and soul they radically oppose.  That is one of the reasons for the amendment.  As I said earlier, I was surprised by the level of opposition to this element on the street when I met and talked to people.  As Deputy Durkan said, there is an opportunity cost, if one pays &euro;12 million for this service, that &euro;12 million is not available for emergency scoliosis operations.</p></speech>

That is the reality.  The Deputy spoke about saving money but people have saved money from this.

The Minister shall be responsible for the provision and regulation of abortion care to the highest attainable standards.<br /><br />(2) Access to abortion care, including to related sexual and reproductive healthcare before and after an abortion, shall not be impeded on discriminatory grounds, including on grounds of race, sex, religion, national or ethnic origin, marital or family status, immigration status, sexual orientation, age, or other social status.<br /><br />(3) In making any decision under this Act, or in providing medical care and services under this Act, the provisions of the Act shall be interpreted in the manner most favourable to achieving positive health outcomes for the pregnant woman, and to the protection of her rights.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>The purpose of the amendment is to protect women and to ensure that abortion services, as part of a broad range of health services, deliver for women.  The addition of this provision would bring Ireland into line with the prevailing trend of recently reformed abortion laws and, in particular, with countries that have had the same national conversation that we did over the past number of years, including Spain and Portugal, two countries that we referenced as part of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  It would make clear that women who seek abortion must not be subject to discrimination.  It is a relatively simple amendment. </p></speech>

The entire purpose of the referendum and this enabling Bill is to give access that does not currently exist and subsequently as we have just debated.  We have further enhanced access by making sure it will not be discriminatory, as it will be free and universal and part of the public health service.  Everything we are doing in this Bill is about access and ensuring universal access albeit within, as Deputy T&oacute;bin rightly reminds me, the regulated environment that we are deciding to make this provision legal.</p> <p>  I understand the concerns that prompted the proposed amendments but I am responsible for ensuring access to termination of pregnancy in accordance with the terms set out in the Bill and, therefore, there is no need for this to be restated in the Bill.  We are trying to keep the Bill as clear and concise as possible.</p> <p>  Regarding subsection (2) of the proposed amendment, the Equal Status Acts, 2000 to 2015, prohibit discrimination in the provision of services, including health services on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion and membership of the Traveller community.  Our laws ensure that there cannot be discrimination on those grounds.</p> <p>  Finally, on the proposal that the legislation be interpreted in a way that is most favourable to achieving positive health outcomes for pregnant woman, medical practitioners, the personnel with responsibility for providing medical care, are obliged to act in a patient's best interest at all times.  The Medical Council's guide to professional conduct and ethics for registering medical practitioners of 2016 makes it clear that a medical practitioner's duty is to act in the best interests of patients and to advocate on their behalf.  The council is the regulator and gets to enforce that.  I appreciate the Deputies care for those who will have access to services under the legislation.  I assure them, as I have on many occasions, that in drafting the legislation, it was genuinely my priority to ensure that it closely mirrored what the Oireachtas committed us to do and what we told the people we would do and ensure terminations are provided in a medically safe and regulated service.  I believe the Bill achieves this and I do not see the need to restate it.  Inserting additional words in the legislation could inadvertently add to confusion.</p></speech>

We feel that the criminal aspect of this should not be brought into a Bill.  We campaigned to have the criminal aspect of the eighth amendment repealed through referendum.  We are directed by the Irish Family Planning Association on this as well.  UN experts and agencies consistently call for the full realisation of sexual and reproductive rights including access to safe, legal abortion.  This includes the UN treaty monitoring bodies.  We feel there should be nothing in the Bill that criminalises a woman for accessing abortion services.  If a woman goes to a doctor in the ninth or tenth week and cannot access the pill, for example, and has to go somewhere else, is that criminalising the woman?  This has to be clarified.  We are calling for those provisions to be taken out of the legislation.</p></speech>

First, the woman seeking the abortion is never criminalised.  We are following through on the recommendation of the all-party committee that the woman seeking the abortion is never criminalised.  There is decriminalisation in that respect.</p> <p>  Perhaps we have different views on this, but if something is legal in certain circumstances it obviously needs to be illegal in other circumstances or else it is effectively legal in all circumstances.  This Bill does provide restrictions; its title refers to the "regulation of termination of pregnancy".  We can argue and debate, though I think the question was largely settled, that the grounds put forward are the grounds on which it is legal.  On other grounds beyond that, it is illegal.  If I were to delete the offences section in its entirety, there would be no offences for breaking that law, which I think could actually leave women in vulnerable positions.  In the area of illegal abortions, how could we protect women?  What about forced abortions or instances of coercion?</p> <p>  I want to say at this stage, because it is very much related to the amendments we are discussing, that I would like to work with colleagues and am already working with the Office of the Attorney General to move the offences section in the Bill.  A number of colleagues, including Deputies Joan Collins, Clare Daly, O&rsquo;Connell and others referred on Second Stage to the fact that the offences section is the first thing to hit people when they pick up the Bill.  That is not the policy intention.  It is due to a drafting precedent or template; that is where offences sections generally happen to be placed in legislation.  While not all Bills or Acts are picked up and read all that often, this might be one that is.  This legislation is about providing access to regulated termination of pregnancy services.  We are going to see if we can bring forward amendments on Report Stage to locate the offences section in a more appropriate part of the Bill so it is not the first thing a reader sees.</p> <p>  Section 5 sets out the substantive offences under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 and provides that it shall be an offence for a person by any means whatsoever to intentionally end the life of the foetus otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  I remember that I was asked lots of times during the referendum campaign, as I am sure many Deputies were, whether the foetus has any rights.  Of course, the reality is that it does.  Outside the terms of this Bill, it is still illegal to destroy the foetus.  I know words in this area are emotive but I am using the word "foetus" because it is the medically appropriate word.  It will still be an offence to end the life of a foetus outside of these terms.  It would be inconsistent to say it was an offence yet to have no offence in the Bill. </p> <p>  Officials from my Department and the Office of the Attorney General did consider how to phrase that because a number of people raised the issue and indeed it came up earlier in our debate.  However, the key consideration in drafting any legislation must be to ensure that the intent of the law is as clear and unambiguous as possible.  In this case, this formulation was put forward after considerable thought and discussion.  It is the clearest formulation possible for the offence and I would be very nervous, for the reasons I outlined earlier in terms of legal and medical clarity, about moving away from it.</p> <p>  Under section 5 it is also an offence to prescribe, administer, supply or procure any drugs, instruments, apparatus or other thing which is intended to be used with the intent of ending the life of a foetus or being reckless about whether it might be used for that purpose.  I repeat that these provisions do not apply to a pregnant woman who has ended or attempted to end her own pregnancy.  This Oireachtas was quite clear in wanting to move beyond the criminalisation of the woman.  It is an offence for a person to procure a termination for a pregnant woman outside the provisions of the Bill.</p> <p> There needs to be a reasonable conversation in this area.  If we are at long last providing a way of accessing free, safe and legal medically supervised abortion, we need our law to be encouraging people to use the free, safe, legal and regulated abortion services.  When people ask what if a mother or sister does this for her daughter or friend, I would respond that we need everybody to be using the legal, safe, regulated service.  If there were no offences in this Bill, we would be saying it was kind of all right to continue to order the pill off the Internet.  It was a decisive factor in the campaign and in the committee&rsquo;s deliberations that the procuring of illegal abortion pills was a cause of concern.  It was certainly one of the reasons people gave in many of the conversations I had the length and breadth of the country for deciding to vote for change.  We need to be very careful; it would be highly irresponsible for me as Minister for Health to stand over a situation which could result in damage to a woman&rsquo;s health or even pose a risk to her life and for me to say there was no offence for that.  We are not having an offence for the woman but it would be highly unusual for there to be no offence at all.  I would not in any other area allow for unregulated medication from unknown sources for another person to proceed unchecked.  If a person ordered pain killers on the Internet for a friend who had a pain in their chest, rather than going to the doctor, I would be rightly criticised for not trying to stamp out the illegal use of that medication and not encouraging its safe, regulated use.  God forbid, if something went wrong, people would be asking serious questions about the Oireachtas and the Minister of the day in terms of why they did not think they needed to regulate.</p><p>I realise that some people want to change the name of the Bill, but its Title currently contains the word regulation.  We are regulating; we are saying in certain circumstances that it is legal, and we are also saying that in other circumstances it is not legal.  I understand that feelings run very high on this issue because there is a real chilling effect from the eighth amendment, from the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, and a sense that doctors and women will be fearful whether this will happen.  We want to move beyond that - I do too - but a termination of pregnancy is a medical procedure, it involves medical treatment and it is best carried out by medical practitioners in a safe and regulated medical environment.  If I have said it once, I have said a million times, as have many others in this room, that this is about women and their doctors.  Therefore the Bill must be about ensuring that the law is directing and supporting the provision of service in that direction.  Yes, there are penalties in the Bill, I know that there are concerns about some of the penalties.  I am happy to hear the committee's view on that and, indeed, work with the committee on this between now and Report Stage because there is no font of all wisdom on this, nor am I claiming to be it, so I am happy to work with colleagues.  However, it is worth pointing out that the specific sentence to be applied is a matter for the court.  People tend to refer to the higher end of the spectrum, the phrase "up to" is also in the Bill, but it is essential to ensure that a potential penalty does reflect the seriousness of a crime.  We could be talking about serious and violent attacks on women in some situations.  I am not deliberately picking the most extreme situation, but we do need to ensure that what is on our Statute Book gets the balance right, that if there is a violent attack on a woman and her autonomy and well-being that that is a suitably high offence.  </p><p> There are many examples, and in the interests of time I do not intend to go through them all now, of where a maximum penalty is in legislation but is very rarely applied.  The maximum penalty in Ireland under section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Thefts and Frauds Offences) Act is life imprisonment for robbery but that does not mean that everybody who robs something ends up in prison for life, far from it.  It is about trying to ensure that within our statutes, there is an ability if a woman is violently attacked to impose a hefty sentence.  It is in no way about trying to penalise women, in fact it is the opposite, we are not criminalising women.  It is about ensuring that when the Oireachtas provides for a service that is free, safe, legally and regulated, that that is the service that we support and encourage and that we collectively try to end the use of services outside of that safe space, namely, the unregulated use of medication.  I cannot think of another example as Minister for Health where I would, or the members would ask me to, turn a blind eye or ignore the use of unregulated medication, although I am not saying that is what anyone here is trying to do.  I expect there will be a great deal to discuss on this matter between now and Report Stage but again, I am not the font of all wisdom and am happy to work with the committee to ensure that we get this right.  I will try to move the offences to a more appropriate section of the Bill, which would be important.  It is not as simple as I had thought but it is doable and I want to do it, and, in fact, we will do it.  However, while I fully understand what Deputy Joan Collins is doing in proposing the deletion of the offence altogether and the motives behind that, there would be an unintended consequence that would leave some women vulnerable. </p></speech>

I was struck by a couple of things.  Looking at the whole journey we made over the course of the eighth amendment committee hearings, one thing that was consistent throughout every session was the issue of criminalisation and the need to decriminalise.  I listened carefully to the Minister's remarks.  Every one of us is in favour of best medical practice.  Nobody wants rogue operators, everyone wants things to be carried out properly.  That is the same for abortion as a medical procedure as it is for every other medical practice. The committee recommended that all criminal sanctions that apply to women and girls should be lifted and that has been done, but the committee also recommended that doctors acting within the law within a clinical context should be decriminalised.  I do not think that the way the legislation is drafted, in the absence of our amendment, actually achieves that.  The Minister says that feelings are running high on this, but I am not sure they are.  That is looking at it the wrong way around.  We must look at this issue in the context of where we have come from and the chilling environment in which medical practitioners have traditionally operated.  The concern is that this wording has taken the wording of the very restrictive Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, maintained the sanction, albeit for medical practitioners, and it is completely unnecessary.  What we are saying is that the delivery of abortion must certainly be regulated but it should be regulated in the same manner as other medical procedures.  Therefore anybody who operates outside the law should be subject to normal criminal sanction, which they would be.  If a doctor removes someone's leg against their will or incarcerates them against their will, that person is open to criminal proceedings, on the one hand, and also to medical disciplinary proceedings.  Over the many months worth of deliberations that we had in the committee we said that this was a normal healthcare provision and that doctors should be enabled to carry out their medical judgement in a medical setting in the same environment that they would any other procedure.  Particularly given where we have come from in this State let us be clear, the likelihood of people trying to catch out doctors or make the legislation unworkable, something that is not in the interests of women or doctors, we do not need clauses in the legislation that would assist that happening.  Full decriminalisation was a consistent theme at those committee hearings and anything less leaves us open to having the legislation undermined.  It goes against the spirit of everything because consistently all the international and Irish studies show that in order to be compliant with international human rights, we should go for full decriminalisation.  The amendment is necessary in that regard.  By not accepting this amendment, we leave ourselves open to health providers being dissuaded from providing the best care to their patients than they otherwise would because they have this sitting on their backs.  It is probably the key part of this committee's discussion in coming days.  I strongly support the amendment and will press it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#BB00900"><p>I support the amendment.  We have also put down amendments opposing sections 5 and 6.  What is the purpose of criminalising abortion?  Presumably, it is to prevent people from carrying out dangerous abortions or charging people vast sums, which would be an incentive to work outside this Act.  However, what is being proposed is free and universal access so the danger of that happening is not likely.  There are two reasons this is wrong.  Its chilling effect on doctors has been noted, but while the Minister does not intend to punish women or pregnant people themselves, he will also punish somebody who helps somebody have an abortion outside of the Act.  Let us consider what that might mean in practice.  Take a person whose doctor tells them they have gone past the 12 week period - we will not get into how they estimate the 12 week period, because that might not be 12 weeks gestation - that person is faced with going abroad or accessing abortion pills from safe websites such as <i>Women On Web </i>that is currently used.</p><p>If at 13 weeks someone helps a friend, sister or daughter to have an abortion using medical abortion pills from the <i>Women on Web</i>site, which is an internationally recognised group of which there are also others, that person could be criminalised.  It has happened in Northern Ireland where a mother was prosecuted for helping her own daughter.  This is not preposterous.  It would actually be safe to have an abortion at 13 weeks using a medical abortion pill which can be used up to 14 weeks.  However, this would criminalise someone for doing that.  The British Medical Association has just voted, I think for the first time, to decriminalise abortion in Britain where it remains a criminal offence outside the regulations.  Doctors have also made that call in approximately 44 other countries.  People are citing the great levels of support they have, but polls show that the majority of people do not think it should be a criminal offence.  I echo that on the committee, this was not just about criminalising the person, it was about decriminalisation.  I agree completely that it should be an offence dealt with under medical regulations.  It can be done that way.  However, criminalising doctors, potentially, will definitely put some people's health at risk where there is uncertainty about serious harm.  There will be other cases that might be very dodgy too.</p></speech>

It looms darkly over all of this.  We favour removing the entire section on offences.  It may well have a great deal to do with how we define the legislation.  That is why we feel the Title is important with the reference to the regulation of women's health.  Let us say that we were regulating men's health, would we have to insert that it would be illegal and subject to 14 years imprisonment to force a man to have a vasectomy, which relates to his reproductive health?  One would not as that is already governed by legislation covering offences against the person, including grievous bodily harm and others.  Likewise, there is other legislation to cover the case where a woman is forced against her will by a nasty lunatic or dangerous person to have an abortion.  That legislation already deals with violence against the person and includes hefty sentences.  We are trying here to regulate for abortion, whether the Minister agrees to call a spade a spade.  As such, this should not be included as it provides for an offence of carrying out a procedure where that offence is already covered by other legislation dealing with violent acts against individuals.  I refer the Minister to the last debate and Deputy Nolan's amendment on making people pay for the services.  The Minister said himself that forcing women to pay for the pill meant making them go to the Internet.  Quite correctly, he opposed that.  If we can create a legislative framework around the regulation of women's health and the provision of full, free, safe and legal access to abortion, the need to go online will not need to be covered by the section.  We would like to see it removed entirely.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that most abortions are related to socio-economic issues and we should focus on resolving those issues.  It was stated that abortion was safe, but the Bill itself states that abortion is the ending of a life.  Safety and the ending of a life do not equal each other.  This is one of the most radical amendments for which one could provide because it will, by default, allow for abortion by failing to disincentivise it in a whole range of other circumstances.  Part of the argument before the referendum was that if one takes the right to life out of the Constitution, the issue becomes fluid with regard to where it ends up.  This amendment is confirmation of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.650" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#CC00400"><p>I have proposed a number of amendments to the section, the first of which seeks to put women at the heart of the legislation to ensure the choices they make are central to it.  The use of language like "to intentionally end the life of a foetus" rather than to say "terminate a pregnancy" or, indeed, to use the word "abortion", which we seldom see or hear in this debate we have about abortion, represents a failure to confront language and deal with it.  The eighth amendment is the protection of life legislation being perpetuated all over again.  I am hopeful the amendments I suggest will be accepted.</p> <p>  My second amendment on the section focuses on offences.  I have tried to ensure that medical practitioners as well as those acting with the explicit permission of the pregnant person are excluded from all offences.  We need to assure medical professionals that if they act in good faith, there will be no sanction which inhibits them in their work.  If we fail explicitly to protect doctors, the chilling effect, about which we heard at length, not just at the committee on the eighth amendment but in the Citizens' Assembly and in the course of the referendum debate, will continue.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 26 seeks to ensure that where a pregnant person explicitly requests someone to help obtain abortion pills from the Internet or another source, that person will not be guilty of an offence.  We have seen the situation in the North, which was referred to earlier, where a woman was helped by her mother and now everyone involved is under investigation.  That is not what we want to see as part of this legislation.  We must remove the reference to a sentence of 14 years.  This is an echo of the eighth amendment and the protection of life during pregnancy legislation which we all want to see gone.  It is important to protect doctors by removing the chilling effect and to ensure that where a doctor acts in good faith, he or she is immune from criminal sanction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#CC00500"><p>My personal view is in direct conflict with my view of what the people have voted for on this.  Personally, I oppose strongly the section, which feels completely over the top.  It has a chilling effect, as we know.  Points have been made around no such penalty of 14 years ever having been suggested for men's reproductive health and, indeed, medical malpractice and so on is already covered in other legislation.  On a personal level, to frame legislation which carries a 14 year sentence is wrong.  However, what is in the legislation is almost word for word what is in the heads of the Bill.  If a mistake was made, it was to bring such punitive sanctions into the heads of the Bill, including that 14 year sentence.  However, it was brought in and it was in the heads of the Bill.  The Minister and I knocked on many doors in Wicklow.  My experience of talking to voters was that a material number who intended to vote "Yes" were doing so in the clear knowledge that this section existed.  An example which will be discussed later is the whole idea of disability and other matters not being permitted as grounds for termination of pregnancy.  As explained, disability is not allowable, including intellectual and physical disability and other syndromes.</p><p>The reason that is not allowable is because of these sections.  On a democratic imperative, it is absolutely clear to me that a reasonable number of "Yes" voters were voting with a clear understanding that this would be in the legislation.  The provision is pretty much transcribed word for word from the heads of the Bill.  I wish it had not been in the heads of the Bill.  I do not agree with it personally but in my opinion I am following a principle that basically says that if it is in the heads of the Bill, whether I agree with it or not, it is in the legislation.  For that reason I will not be supporting the deletion of the subsections we are talking about.</p></speech>

Then Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke and the gist of what he said - and I ask him to correct me if I am misrepresenting what he said - is that it states in the Bill that the termination of pregnancy is ending the life of a foetus.  Some people are using that definition today, with which many of us had an issue at the outset, to support this.  This is the consequence of that definition.</p> <p>  If we come to an agreement between now and Report Stage on the definition that will reflect the wording I propose in amendments Nos. 17 and 20, that will change the definition.  </p> <p>  Regarding the front-loading of the offences, I proposed that in my amendments but I was informed by the Bills Office that it cannot come from a committee member, that the reordering of a Bill has to be done by the Minister and the Bills Office.  I think the Bill will be legislation that will be referred to and picked up and if it is humanly possible to reorder it, I would like it reordered.</p> <p>  There is also a chronological issue in that we should be moving through the gestation period of pregnancy as opposed to hopping from fatal foetal back to early pregnancy as I think there is a natural progression through pregnancy.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Donnelly because he made clear the connection between what was in the heads of the Bill before the referendum and what we are doing now.  Again many raised the issues of what could happen.  Deputy Coppinger, who has left the room, referred to abortion pills which are safe up to 14 weeks.  Yes, they are licensed for use up to 14 weeks, but between ten and 14 weeks, to the best of my knowledge, their use must be under the supervision of a doctor.  One could have a very complicated situation if, for example,  a mother ordered abortion pills for her 14 year old child who is pregnant with twins.  Were she to give them at 16 weeks, we would have a very dangerous situation.  I would not like to have any involvement in a situation where that 14 year old girl would bleed out for whatever reason.  This all goes back to our discussion on access, cost and barriers because these are the issues that would cause people difficulties.</p> <p>  I will not be supporting amendment No. 16 because we had said what we were going to do before the referendum.  I believe there are difficulties and very dangerous consequences if the provision in section 5(1) is not included.</p> <p>  We have to be very conscious of the arguments that are used and how it relates back to that element of life in the definition at the outset.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#DD00500"><p>This has been a useful debate.  I am looking at the report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which called on the Minister to amend the law.  It states:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the law be amended to provide that(a) surgical terminations may only be legally carried out in a hospital setting [which we have done and]<br /><br />(b) medical terminations may only be provided for through the licencing of medications for that purpose and prescribed by a qualified practitioner acting in good faith.</blockquote> <p>We have done that.  It also states &quot;The Committee further recommends that where terminations occur in such circumstances ... no criminal sanctions should apply.&quot;  That is the case and there is no criminal sanction to a doctor operating in those circumstances, in good faith.  I believe we are in agreement that in all cases &quot;where a woman procures or seeks to procure an abortion for herself, the law should provide that, regardless of circumstances, she is not guilty of an offence&quot;.  I believe those four tests that were outlined by the all-party committee have been met in the legislation.</p><p>Deputy Donnelly rightly pointed out, and I agree with this point, regardless of our personal opinions, we had to put forward a general scheme of a Bill that we believed encapsulated the greatest majority.  We cannot all be looking into our hearts, guessing what the people of Ireland thought and perhaps we got some calls right and some calls not right, but this was the legislation that we largely put before the people, when we published the general scheme in March and the updated scheme in July after the referendum and when we published the Bill in September.</p><p>I think Deputy O'Connell is right to point out, particularly with her professional background, that there are risks.  I refer to her phrase, &quot;dangerous consequences&quot;, to operating outside of the legal framework and that is something that none of us can stand over.  There is a reason that we have set out matters and the reason is not just a moral or policy one.  There are reasons that outside the periods set out in the Bill, in certain circumstances it could be dangerous and we cannot stand over that.</p><p>We have come a long way.  All sanctions for women and girls have been removed.  There is no sanction for a doctor operating within the law.  We have purposely tried to word the law in such a way that it is not Members or the Minister for Health deciding what is the appropriate call for the doctor.  In some cases, it is the decision of one doctor, in other cases it is the decision of two doctors in their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith.  This language is empowering the doctor, to try to remove the chilling effect in order that the doctor does not have to dust down a copy of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann or the legislation or ask him or herself what do the politicians want him or her to do in the circumstances.  There are parameters in place that trust a doctor's clinical judgment and give a doctor's clinical judgment the protection of a decision based on their reasonable opinion and in good faith, which I think is important.  </p><p>Let us also remember that this is not just about medical practitioners.  Deputy Clare Daly raised the issue of someone removing one's leg illegally but we do not have a law about the removal of legs.  We do, however, have a law about the regulation of termination of pregnancy and when one is putting in place a law, one is obligated to put into law what is legal and what is not.  What I do not wish to do - the Oireachtas can do what it wishes - is deviate substantially from what we promised the people we would do.  Again one can argue whether that was right or wrong but we said to the people we will allow abortion to be legal, regulated and safe in these very specific circumstances.  I also said many times, as did many members, that outside of these circumstances it will continue to be illegal.  Deputy Donnelly gave a very honest appraisal of the situation.  Many people voted &quot;Yes&quot; in the knowledge that was the case, knowing the grounds on which they could vote &quot;Yes&quot; and support abortion happening, but in the knowledge that disability is not a ground and with limits beyond a certain period or beyond viability.  There needs to a legal and an illegal piece to this debate or otherwise we have gone significantly beyond what the aforementioned committee and its cross-party members committed to doing.</p><p>There is also another point.  The foetus has protection outside of these circumstances.  Abortion in Ireland will be legal under these heads and in these circumstances but there will be protection for the foetus outside of those circumstances and if one removes section 5, there will be nowhere on the Statute Book where there is protection for the foetus.  I genuinely do not think the Irish people voted for that.  They voted for a very broad range of parameters, whereby termination would be allow, but they did not vote for termination in every single circumstance and they did not vote for termination not to be regulated and they not vote for there not to be a legality and an illegality in respect of these situations.</p><p>The people and the Government support the idea that the woman or girl should never be criminalised.  </p><p> I am glad that Deputy O'Connell also made the point that the language in the Bill must be consistent.  It cannot be that the Bill states in one section "end the pregnancy", in another "end the life of the foetus" and in another uses the word "abortion".  If we do that, we will do a significant disservice to doctors and women because there will not be legal consistency.  Deputy O'Connell asked whether that definition would apply if it had been changed earlier.  The short answer is "Yes" because there must be consistency in the wording in all parts of the Bill.  The harder question is whether we can come up with a formula of words that meets the needs of the medical community in operating the Act with legal consistency, but that is our job between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am happy to engage with and meet Deputies and to make officials available as we prepare for Report Stage and try to improve this section.  There is a sense from the contributions that we can improve the section.  What I do not intend to do, however, is deviate from the fundamental grounds on which abortion is legal in Ireland to a new set of grounds on which the people did not vote.  I know they did not vote on the wording but they voted with knowledge of the general scheme.  I am endeavouring to get that balance right but also to ensure we make provisions to protect women in circumstances where there may be forced abortions and where women may be intimidated or forced into having illegal terminations of pregnancy in much more dangerous circumstances.  There could be a situation, for example, of domestic or sexual abuse where a vulnerable woman or young person could be coerced into agreeing an illegal termination of pregnancy without any medical assistance, perhaps for sinister reasons.  There is a need to protect women from these difficult situations.  I am happy to engage with people on whether we have got the balance right but this is how I am approaching the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#EE00400"><p>I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister when he says the Department has attempted to remove the chilling effect in balancing this legislation.  It has not achieved that objective, however, and I do not agree that the committee's suggestions were adhered to.  I accept the Minister's point about the legislation giving a protection to medical practitioners or providers who operate in good faith within the law and who have a reasonable opinion, but that is just a defence.  It still leaves them open to the possibility of a malicious prosecution, for example, or an allegation against them by people who want to be devious with this legislation.</p> <p>  Abortion should be fully decriminalised because there is ample medical regulation and other legislation in place to deal with people who break the law.  The Minister said that people did not vote for abortion in all circumstances, which is fully accepted.   The amendment we are putting forward does not alter that situation, nor does it say that abortion should not be regulated.  Rather, it says there should not be a specified criminal sanction in the legislation.  It does not throw out all the other stuff.  </p> <p>  I take issue with the points made by Deputy Donnelly, who said the criminalisation factor is included in order that terminations will not be carried out on the grounds of disability.  That is not the case and the law does not provide for terminations on the grounds of disability.  We are talking about a criminal sanction for breach of the law, where someone who breaks the law is still open to sanction.  In the circumstances the Minister outlined, such as a forced or coerced abortion, without the specific criminalisation provision in the legislation the medical practitioner involved would still be open to prosecution for a criminal offence such as assault causing serious harm or whatever, not to mention being open to severe disciplinary proceedings and possibly being disbarred from being a medical practitioner because he or she carried out a medical procedure against the law.  A specific criminal sanction is not needed, therefore.  Perhaps the voters in Wicklow are highly astute and have read every document.</p></speech>

I am quite sure many of the voters in my constituency are incredibly sophisticated but I can guarantee I did not meet one person who said he or she was voting for the heads of the Bill because it provides for a 14 year criminal sanction.  It is just not true.  All the evidence from the studies carried out suggests that even people who strongly object to abortion, and who believe they themselves would never have one, do not believe a woman or any medical practitioner acting in good faith should be penalised.  That is not an opinion that is common only in Ireland but abroad also.</p> <p>  The problem with the wording "good faith" is that it might be a defence but it leaves the practitioner open to prosecution.  Given the background to this issue, there will be a slight barrier to access, and we all believe access is extremely important.  A criminal sanction is not needed to protect the foetus.  The foetus has rights, which grow as the gestational period progresses.  After the 12 weeks, the foetus has considerable protection.  A criminal sanction does not need to be specified for the foetus to have that protection and nor are the words "ending the life of the foetus" required to provide that protection.  I strongly agree that Deputy O'Connell's wording is preferable.  I am not saying that the Government has not tried to strike a balance but it has erred too far in the other direction.  </p> <p>  The Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, made good points in its observations that the only basis for having a specific criminal sanction is if there is a demonstrable public interest therein which would identify potential harm done to women that cannot be dealt with in the normal medical regulation and criminal justice system.  There is enough protection in the criminal justice system and medical regulation to do what we want to do without giving doctors, nurses or whomever at a later date that extra headache.  In fairness, the IFPA made the point well that if the Government believes there is something that causes potential harm to women, it should be listed as a potential offence and dealt with rather than being left vague in this context.  </p> <p>  While I recognise what the Minister says, he has not achieved the balance of what the Oireachtas committee recommended.  We were not referring to protection from a potential legal action but rather to the international community's recommendation of full decriminalisation.  It is necessary, especially when one considers our history on this issue.  I do not mean to be derogatory but some of the points made by Deputies are not really relevant to whether there is a criminal sanction in this section.</p></speech>

There was a discussion earlier about the definition of "ending the life of a foetus", and the committee received medical correspondence today from 24 members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which has drawn up the clinical guidelines, to say that changing the wording would provide them with less clarity.  I have committed to engaging with the institute before Report Stage, but at the moment the medical and legal advice I have received is that this is the language that provides the best clarity, not only for lawyers but also doctors.  We will relocate the offences section, which I know has not been the substance of this conversation but which was an important part of the Second Stage debate.  I will make available to the committee my officials and legal advisers to see if we can further explore the issue of offences before Report Stage.  It is a delicate balance and we need to try to get it right.</p></speech>

We are back to the wording and the previous discussion.  I am concerned about the use of the words "aid, abet, counsel or procure" in section 5(4).  The use of the words "aid" and "abet" is alarming.  I may be incorrect but my interpretation is that someone who counsels a pregnant woman and recommends a termination in a conversation could be given a 14 year jail sentence for trying to get somebody to have an abortion, even when the woman does not take that advice and a termination does not take place.  I would like to have that clarified.</p> <p>  We are back to the language of criminalising and negativity, which is to approach the issue from the wrong angle.  The use of the term "procure a pregnant woman" is not ideal.  We need to work on the language to ensure it is fit for purpose.  I have an issue with terms such as aiding and abetting and counselling and the 14 year sentence provided.  We do not want women to be terrorised into silence.  We want this to be about access and women.  I am uncomfortable with the language used here and if we got rid of it, as per my amendment, the section would be more palatable.</p></speech>

We are bringing in a range of heads that provide opportunities for women to safely, legally and freely access abortion services up to 12 weeks without specific indication.  I will make a point that may not be for the debate on the Bill but is part of discussions taking place in other rooms in respect of clinical guidelines, public communications to women about services and where to access them, the 24-7 helpline and so on.  As a country, we should be able to move into an era in which, far from women being silenced as the Deputy alluded to, it will be a normal part of the public health service to have accessible information on abortion from medical professionals, not just in the hospital or community setting but also on a 24-7 helpline.</p> <p>  I very much get what the Deputy is trying to do here.  The language, which is based on legal advice, is endeavouring to ensure that we provide protection in cases of forced abortion or intimidation of a woman, where somebody is encouraged to use an illegal service rather than the legal and safe service.  I take the point about the language and I am committed to working with the Deputy to see if we can make progress.</p></speech>

We have already had a number of discussions today on a number of issues, including the future-proofing of legislation, medical developments and best international practice.  It seems to it would be wholly irresponsible for us as legislators to pass legislation on such an important issue to do with women's health and not keep it under review on the basis that our job is done.  It is good practice to keep legislation under review.  It is not uncommon.  The Data Protection Act of this year, for example, makes provision for a review to be carried out, as do the Gender Recognition Act, the Charities Act and the Disability Act.  Review clauses are also commonly included in European legislation.  The European Parliament is strongly committed to the concept of better law-making.  In this regard, it talks about the better law-making template, particularly the effective use of <i>ex post</i>evaluation throughout the legislative cycle.  Although provision for a review clause was not included in the original legislation, I am conscious that several members of this committee and the Oireachtas have proposals in this regard.  I hope there will be significant agreement that the inclusion of a review clause in the Bill would facilitate monitoring, including monitoring of the impact, operation and effectiveness of the legislation, in addition to monitoring of the delivery of services.  I propose to amend Part 1 one of the Bill to provide that the Minister shall, not later than five years after the commencement of the Act, carry out a review of its operation.</p><p>A number of members have other amendments to different sections, with references to a shorter period.  I ask that the committee consider passing this amendment but I am open to amending the time period on Report Stage.  To be very honest, I feel two years is probably too short.  I see references to two years.  It is too short simply because we are going to put new services in place in 2019 that need to bed down.  There are already many monitor and review notifications.  One could nearly be reviewing the legislation without all the information.  Perhaps one could argue five years is a little too long.  I am not wholly set on it but I have pitched the period at five years for the moment.  I ask the committee members to enable me to insert this review clause in the legislation.  I would be happy on Report Stage to engage in a discussion on the appropriate period for the review.  As I said, this arrangement is included in many Acts.  It would be a mistake not to include it.  It would also enable us, as legislators, to ensure that a number of the issues members raised today can be monitored.  It would allow us to address issues or challenges that arise in the review period.  I commend the amendment to the committee.</p></speech>

It should be conducted either in line with the views of or in conjunction with the members of the health committee at the time, whoever they may be.  The Minister has acknowledged that five years might be little long.  There is a proposal for two years.  We could settle on two and a half years.</p></speech>

There is a bit of scope in this regard but there should most definitely be a review.  It has to be based on the collection of data, and the data collected have to be more meaningful than those currently collected.  They have to give us proper evidence as to where issues arise, if they exist.  It must be determined whether they affect a particular demographic.  That information has to be available to us.</p></speech>

A debate will occur on whether the period should be five years, four years or three years.  The period needs to be sufficiently long to allow for the evaluation of the efficacy of the legislation or its lack thereof.  It should be short enough to allow us to react in time without letting too much happen that should not happen.  It would also give an opportunity to the Minister, Department and Opposition to monitor what has happened over a reasonable period.  There is not much sense in monitoring something over six months; one is hardly likely to get a worthwhile result at that stage.</p> <p>  It is important not to paint ourselves into a corner by specifying two years, three years, four years or five years; rather, it is a matter of evaluating how the legislation is working and determining what issues have arisen in the time involved.  If it should transpire that, sooner than five years, four years or otherwise, something obvious needs to be done in regard to the legislation, the amendment would give an opportunity to all involved in this regard.</p></speech>

In Britain, far more information is collected than is proposed in this Bill.  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly in that the more data and information that exist, the easier the policy development in the future.  It will result in better insight into how exactly the legislation is working.  There is a weakness, however, in having a review without the necessary data.  Britain has had a good record on the collection of data.  It is neither a pro-choice amendment nor a pro-life amendment; it is just a collection-of-data amendment.  That would be more useful.</p></speech>

The standard period is five years for most legislation.  The question is whether this Bill is different and whether there is greater urgency to see how this goes.  I certainly believe there is.  This is highly sensitive legislation.  There are very serious concerns raised by doctors, the institutes and all sorts of people.  It is not about being more liberal or conservative; this is a particularly sensitive issue.  Therefore, I am happy to support the amendment now but I would like the Minister to let us know whether he will resubmit it on Report Stage and perhaps reduce the period to two or three years.  With this legislation, five years is too long to wait.</p></speech>

Firstly, I welcome the fact that, even from a wide range of perspectives on the substantive issue, Deputies see the benefit of having a review clause.  I believe that is the responsible thing to do and it is what the women and doctors of this country deserve.</p> <p>  I should have stated the obvious at the outset.  Of course legislation can be reviewed at any time.  It is not the position that the legislation cannot be reviewed for five years.  Any Member can bring forward any legislation or motion at any time.  Moreover, the Minister of the day can make decisions at any time.  This is the constitutional authority we now have through the decision made by the people.  The difference is that we are including the word "shall".  It will not be discretionary for the Minister of the day or ultimately for the Oireachtas.  The review will be a legal requirement on the Minister of the day.</p> <p>  One of the Deputies correctly asked how it would work.  That is an important question.  It is about data &ndash; I agree with that &ndash; but it is about more than data.  It will also be about talking to people who have been providing services, including those consulting and visiting the front line.  It will be a comprehensive evaluation of the law, data and operations as well as how it is all operating and whether it is operating satisfactorily.  It will be external and independent.  It will not be an in-house job, if I may call it that.  We would commission someone external and independent to carry out detailed research, which would then be published.</p> <p>  I welcome Deputy O'Reilly's suggestion that the Joint Committee on Health should be involved.  That seems sensible.  I appeal to Deputies to pass this amendment now but, operating on the basis of the collective wisdom of this committee, I will amend it on Report Stage to insert "3 years" rather than "5 years".  I will give that commitment to Deputies today, but I would still like to put in the review clause on Committee Stage.  I will reduce the timeframe from five years to three years on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

That is the intention.  Already there are several clauses in the legislation that will produce yearly reports, collection of data and notifications to the Minister.  There will be a regular flow of information coming to the Department of Health.  I or my successors will make available that information to the Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on Health.</p> <p>  This is more about the structured review that shall take place.  It is not at the discretion of any Minister &ndash; it must take place.  Let us consider best international experience.  I remember during the referendum debate &ndash; we are not going to reopen that debate now &ndash; many people were suggesting that we look to the UK.  Many people against the proposal kept referencing the UK.  I and others kept saying that the UK was not a good example because the UK has old legislation that has not been reviewed in years.  Others places were doing it better from a woman-centred point of view and from a doctor's point of view.  The point is to ensure we do not fall into that trap.  We can ensure we continue to have legislation that is operational so that if our doctors have views on how to make things better, then they have an opportunity to put forward those views.  It is a little like what they have said today in writing to the health committee.  It is not simply a review of the legislation.  It is specifically a review of the operation of the Act.  It is not a review of the fundamental principles of the legislation.  It is really about how the Act is being operated beyond Leinster House.</p></speech>

The next two or three groupings are really important.  They are going to speak to much of the subsequent sections, including sections 9 to 13, inclusive.  My sense is that they are over-grouped.  The Minister has shared his sub-groupings.  I have gone through them all and they actually make perfect sense.  For example, under the fourth group amendments Nos. 34 to 40, inclusive, are all to be discussed together.  Under the groupings the Minister has shared three different things are going on.  One class concerns the definition of "health", to which amendments Nos. 34 and 35 relate.  Another class concerns the period of 28 days, which is the subject of amendment No. 36.  This is linked to amendment No. 70, which I have tabled.  Amendments Nos. 37 to 40, inclusive, relate to viability.</p> <p>  It is a decision for the committee but we should avoid confusion.  These are separate issues.  Would it make sense to discuss the amendments relating to the definition of "health" first?  We could follow that by discussing those relating to the period of 28 days and follow that, in turn, by discussing those relating to viability, as per the groupings.</p></speech>

The definition we are including for &quot;health&quot; includes the definition according to the World Health Organization 2012 safe abortion guidance.  The WHO makes it clear that policy should aim to promote and protect the overall health of women.  The amendment is in line with that definition.  The idea is that health includes complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</p><p>This is something we discussed during the all-party committee proceedings.  If we were to put that wording into the legislation, then it would be a clear signal that we are moving away from a criminal law situation to a health-focused and women-centred approach.  It would go a long way to removing the chilling stuff.  I believe it would be a positive and well-backed proposal.</p></speech>

The definition of "health", as the Deputy has correctly said, means physical or mental health.  One of the things we were trying to do in defining health was to be absolutely clear that, contrary to what we heard from some during the referendum campaign, mental health is health and mental health is equally important to physical health.  The reason we defined health was for the avoidance of doubt.  We were keen to ensure that it did not refer only to physical health given some of the worrying commentary we heard about mental health for many years in these Houses and elsewhere.</p> <p>  The definition in the proposed amendment, as Deputy Daly rightly said, refers to complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.  I take the point that this corresponds to the World Health Organization definition.  However, I have a concern that the concept of social well-being is too nebulous for the purposes of the legislation.  Again, let us go back to the conversations members had at the all-party committee.  The committee sought to ensure that termination was available where there was serious risk or risk of serious harm to the health or to the life of the woman.  That committee wanted to be absolutely certain that the definition included mental health.  That committee also made a decision to exclude &ndash; I do not have the exactly wording from the committee report before me &ndash; socioeconomic grounds and so on.  My concern is that while the definition is well-intentioned - it is absolutely the World Health Organization definition - it is broader than what the Oireachtas committee charged me with doing in terms of defining health as physical health and mental health but not extending to social well-being.  The committee used certain wording in the report.</p></speech>

I did not agree with the outcome but to use the outcome of that vote is unfair and it conflates two quite separate things.</p></speech>

We debated this matter at considerable length during the all-party committee's hearings and it has been a particularly moot point in discussions on the issue in recent years.  We were accused of being frivolous in some ways in allowing abortions to take place where they were not necessary.</p> <p>  We need to keep two points in mind.  First, a pregnant woman may suffer from a mental condition that leads to a serious impact on her health and well-being.  Second, she may suffer from a medical condition that is likely to have the same impact.  Both cases need to be borne in mind and we must try to cater for the eventualities.  For example, there are certain conditions that, while seemingly harmless initially, are not harmless if they are ignored.  It is important that they not be ignored.</p> <p>  The committee removed the question of socio-economic grounds as a basis for abortion.  That was the right thing to do.  It was in response to comparisons being made with jurisdictions where there was such ready access that people made the point - I am not referring to committee members, but to people throughout the country - that going a bridge too far might not necessarily be in the best interests of the proposed legislation that would arise as a result of the referendum or of its potential for success.</p> <p>  Even to this day, there are people who dismiss mental health as a basis for concern, but that is not true.  It has been proven to be a basis.  Similarly, there are people who strongly contend that a medical condition, including a pre-existing one, is not really a matter for concern and will be dealt with in the normal course of events.  That is not true either.  There have been several instances of women's pre-existing conditions accelerating at a particular stage of their pregnancies.  This puts the lives of those women, including some who already have children, in danger.  It was felt at the time that we needed to recognise the threat to the woman's life in such circumstances and make strong provision for it in a way that did not take a simple - this is a long phraseology - or frivolous "Will I or won't I" approach.  That would never be the case.  All of the evidence presented to us during the course of those hearings indicated that the women concerned, including those who had had an abortion, had not been frivolous about it.  Some research suggests that abortions were done on different grounds, but they were able to put forward at the hearings the strong view that they did not choose a termination lightly.  They thought about it and had considerable qualms of conscience about it.  It was at that stage that we concentrated to a significant extent on the degree to which supportive counselling would be available.  That still has to be the case.  The supportive element that comes from the third party is needed.</p> <p>  It is appropriate that we record at this stage the need to address the issue, which is already proposed in the legislation, and that it was never intended to be a simple or frivolous issue.  This is a serious issue affecting the lives of pregnant women who, because we in our legislative role might fail to recognise their vulnerability, find themselves in a difficult situation and have to make a serious decision in order to protect their own lives and ensure they do not leave their families behind.</p></speech>

We need to return to this matter, but I will not push the amendment to a vote.  I stand over the points I made and echo those made by Deputy Smith.  This is not just about socio-economic reasons and is not defined as such.  It is a WHO definition and is proposed in the context of what we are supposed to be doing, namely, promoting and protecting women's health.  Well-being is not just the absence of a physical ailment or defined mental illness - it is also defined by a person's broader circumstances.  That needs to be taken into account.</p></speech>

People can probably meet somewhere in the middle.  For example, perhaps the amendment could read, "means a state of complete physical and mental well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity", with the word "social" removed.  Perhaps that could be a happy compromise for consideration on Report Stage.  I agree that the provision should go beyond physical and mental health and include well-being, although I understand the Minister's point of view about the issue around social well-being.</p></speech>

There will be doctors meeting in other rooms trying to put together the clinical guidelines on how to interpret whatever legislation we pass.  We want our doctors to follow the clinical guidelines of their medical colleges rather than the textual lines of our legislation.  I am happy to reflect on this matter, but we have to be conscious of how doctors and the wider medical community would respond to and interpret such a definition and what difference, if any, they believed it could make.  As well as this being a legislative issue, it is also a clinical one, as clinicians will make these decisions.</p> <p>  We must remember that this only becomes an issue beyond 12 weeks.  Up to 12 weeks, no specific indication is required.  This section of the legislation deals with a serious risk to the woman's health.  We were clear in trying to define that as including mental health and making that definition beyond reproach.  I believe we are all largely happy with that.  Apart from accepting that the amendment's provision is the WHO's definition, what difference would it make when a clinician is trying to interpret it, if any?  I will take clinicians' counsel on this as well.</p></speech>

She might recall that when we published the general scheme in March, we defined this as "shortly after birth".  I think we all understood the policy intention - as a policymaker, I certainly did - that this was to ensure that the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities could be dealt with in our country and that arguments put forward by groups such as Terminations for Medical Reasons, TFMR, could be addressed.  Those of us who campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote very clearly and determinedly argued that there is a distinct difference between this and a disability.  I felt there was an effort on the part of some to muddy those waters.  We are talking about fatal foetal abnormalities, which is not the medical or legal phrase but it is the way that we all understand what is involved.  To have that, there must be a specified end period.  When I met clinicians - mainly after the referendum - and legal advisers in the Office of the Attorney General, it was clear that there were two periods from which to choose from a policy perspective, namely, the perinatal period or the neonatal period, that is the seven days or 28 days.  I opted for the 28-day period.</p> <p>  I do not wish to speak for the Deputy, but I think this is from where she and others may be coming, namely, how can one know with absolute certainty that it is within 28 days and how a doctor might interpret that?  This is the key question that a number of us are trying to address.  I would answer by saying that the legislation includes the phrase &ldquo;in the reasonable opinion of&rdquo; and was formed in good faith.  These are clinical decisions and I am not going to do anything in legislation - nor is the Deputy asking me to - which means that I, as Minister, or we, as legislators, would prescriptively decide that.  However, I need to provide a period for guidance for our doctors.  We are saying that if, in his or her reasoned opinion, a doctor believes a baby which it is at this stage is not viable and would not live outside the womb for 28 days, it will be legal to provide termination services.</p> <p>  I genuinely do not believe that it is Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith&rsquo;s intention.  However, I am concerned that if there a specific period were not stipulated, we would have a very peculiar situation because we would be saying that this is only for fatal foetal abnormalities but also that it is for fatal foetal abnormalities that may not be that fatal.  We would be getting into a broader range of conditions.  I promised the people that disability would not be a ground &ndash; I am not suggesting that is the Deputy intention &ndash; but my worry is that this might be an unintended consequence.  We must provide our doctors with clarity.  I have not received any information to the contrary from any doctors, masters or clinicians to the effect that they are unhappy with this period.  On the contrary, this is a welcome clarification which was provided in the July general scheme but which was not in the March general scheme.  That is from where I am coming.</p></speech>

We have dealt with many amendments in respect of which the Minister referred to the legislation and the medical guidelines and how they must marry with or complement each other.  My point is that this should be a medical guideline rather than something dealt with in legislation.  I am not against medics having advice or guidance available to them or that their science would inform them, far from it.  However, it should not be in legislation because by putting it there risks the outcome in respect of which the Minister argued previously, namely, the criminalisation of medical practitioners who breach the provisions of the Bill.  This should not be in the legislative instrument, it should be a medical guideline.</p></speech>

The reason I am including this is to provide much wanted and sought after clarification for the medical community and also legal clarity.  The scheme I published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 28 March required certification of a &ldquo;condition affecting a foetus that is likely to lead to the death of a foetus either before birth or shortly after birth&rdquo;.  Doctors understand what constitutes a neonatal period but they do not understand with as much clarity, nor should they, what &ldquo;shortly after birth&rdquo; means.  They wanted a sense from us as legislators as to what is the period in question, which is the neonatal period.  I take the point made by Deputy Smith, and I do so seriously.  It returns to the reference to the chilling effect and so on.  I do not believe that there is any chilling effect here, nor do I believe that medics think that either, although I am open to correction because the phrase &ldquo;in the reasonable opinion of&rdquo; is used.  We are trusting the clinician to make the decision that it is appropriate to terminate.  We are trusting his or her medical, clinical opinion and that of a colleague in this situation because the opinion of two doctors will be required.</p> <p>  Another thing that we have not discussed much, but which is obvious, is the judgment of the mother.  We are talking about three adults, namely, the mother, in a much wanted pregnancy with the devastating news of a fatal foetal abnormality, and two doctors, all believing in the reasonable opinion that this is the appropriate course of action.  I do not want to go on too long, but the neonatal period of 28 days is a term that is understood in the medical community and welcomed by it, as opposed to &ldquo;shortly after&rdquo;, which are the types words that we can use here.</p> <p>  I am sure the Deputy is in touch with clinicians but I am happy for her to seek guidance.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to forget that I referred to it and let us talk about the substantive argument, namely, that this should be a clinical guideline and not a legislative provision.</p></speech>

Furthermore, in conversations I had with medics, including senior members of the profession, they welcomed and sought greater clarity in our legislation.  They must have their guidelines but these must be based on and anchored in the law.  Their view and mine is that &ldquo;shortly after&rdquo; is too vague to provide that anchor.  That is where it came from.  It may be that between now and Report Stage, people will come forward with contrary views but I feel strongly that this is an appropriate period, that it provides legal certainty where &ldquo;shortly after&rdquo; did not, that it does not provide a substantive difference to what we aimed to achieve and that it provides a period - the neonatal period - that medics understand.</p></speech>

I tabled amendment No. 70, which could be grouped with this.  The issue of fatal foetal abnormalities and this 28-day period arises twice - in the definition and in section 12.  I have sought to do in that section what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is seeking to do in the definition section.  I think the Minister has got this wrong.  I would like him to accept the amendments with a view to returning and potentially tightening up the position on Report Stage.  I understand that is a big thing to ask of any Minister but I will explain why I am making my request.</p> <p>  The Minister explained that the 28 days is the neonatal term and a length of time very well understood by medical practitioners.  However, the stipulation of 28 days will inevitably put doctors in an impossible situation.  What the legislation is going to state is that in a case where a fatal foetal abnormality is present and where the doctor involved believes the foetus will die before or shortly after birth - that is what was stated in the heads of the Bill originally - he or she will be obliged to make a decision.  If the doctor believes that the baby will live for less than 28 days, he or she will be operating within the law, and will be legally protected, and may terminate the pregnancy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.776" nospeaker="true" time="11:00:00" ><p>If one believes the baby will live for 29 days or longer, one is no longer protected by the law and will be looking at sections 5 and 6.  These sections suggest that if one gets that wrong, a prison sentence of up to 14 years may apply.  That is an impossible situation to put any doctor in.</p><p>Where I agree fully with the Minister is on the need for absolute clarity for medics, including midwives, nurses, doctors and parents.  The place for that is surely the guidelines, which are reviewable and within the remit of the medical world.  I suggest the Minister could bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the presence of a fatal foetal condition.  That would allow the woman, or parents, and the doctor to talk about that.  They could decide case-by-case on the best way to proceed.  While the Minister is not trying to act incorrectly, he has got this one wrong.  The real application of this as the legislation begins to reach into medical decision-making and operating theatres will be wrong.  If 28 days is what medical practitioners want and is what the institutes are suggesting, that is great.  In that case, let them or us put that in the appropriate guidelines.  Putting it in the law, however, removes the protection of the law once the medical practitioner gets it wrong.  It will mean medical practitioners will err very much on the side of safety.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 36 and to accept my amendment No. 70, which does the same thing to the actual section.  I ask him to do so on the very clear understanding that he will come back on Report Stage with a view to placing the matter within the remit of guidelines and doing whatever else needs to be done to provide clarity and to avoid this very dangerous and impossible timeline or call for a practitioner to make in certain circumstances.</p></speech>

Perhaps the ones I am talking to are not the same as to ones to whom the Minister is speaking and perhaps we should swap over.  It makes more sense for the definition to be in the guidelines rather than in legislation.  The wording should be changed to say "will be provided for in the definitions and the terms will be provided for in the guidelines rather than in legislation".  As 28 days is a set period inclusive of a set number of minutes, going over that may put a doctor in a situation in which he or she is risking his or her licence to practice.  That is what we meant by a chilling effect when we spoke earlier.  It refers to cases where a doctor wants to act in good faith and has reasonably formed an opinion.  While I appreciate fully that doctors are looking for certainty, codifying this in legislation is not the answer.  It is better provided for in the guidelines.</p></speech>

I see a very clear logic in the 28 days.  I see what the Minister is trying to do to give effect to the wishes of the population that abortion would be provided in circumstances of fatal foetal abnormality but not in cases of disability.  The problem and the basis of our argument here is not the 28 days, which everyone agrees provides the clarity sought and is medically recognised as a neonatal period, it is that it is being provided for in legislation which includes a criminal sanction.  The discussion we are having here is the best argument I have heard for the removal, as I recommended earlier, of all vestiges of that criminal sanction from this legislation.  In that context, no one would have a problem with putting this forward in this way.  As was said, there is good faith, 28 days is recognised and we all know what we are talking about, but if someone errs in good faith on either side of that, no one will put one in prison for 14 years.</p></speech>

I see completely where the Minister is coming from.  The 28 day period is a sort of line in the sand.  We heard a lot of evidence at the committee about the complexity of fatal foetal abnormality.  It may not involve only one serious neural tube defect such as anencephaly, which is an obvious fatal foetal abnormality.  One could have a number of genetic and physical conditions overlapping and we could not legislate for every permutation.  We had those discussions at the committee on the eighth amendment.  I remember Fergal Malone speaking about viability at 500 g and twin pregnancies and all of that.  I can understand why this is here.  We need to get the best legal advice on it as we do not want to end up in the following situation.  If a woman has a fatal foetal diagnosis at her 23-week scan and that diagnosis is of a 100% fatal prognosis due to anencephaly combined with heart defects, and the family decides to go through with the pregnancy, it might happen that the child is born and survives for 29 days.  It could happen.  I am concerned, therefore, about defining the time period.  Could the people who advised that this was a fatal abnormality be sued because the baby lived 29 days?  What if the mother has the discussion with the doctor?  Do we have to bring the father into it?  We have to be very careful.  As a result of the committee's proceedings and while we will never cure anencephaly, I am against prescribing anything overly restrictive in legislation, especially with advances in other fields.  I acknowledge that the Minister has considered this and that his intentions on 28 days are completely honourable and on the side of the removal of the eighth, but we need to ensure we do the right thing and avoid unintended consequences again.</p></speech>

However, there are other unintended consequences.  If the opinion is that the baby is likely to survive beyond 28 days but only for 30 or 31 days, we do not want to force women to look for a review of such a decision as permitted by the legislation.  If a doctor says his or her opinion is that a fatal foetal abnormality is present but the survival period is likely to exceed the 28 days, it is open to the woman to seek a review.  We do not want to re-traumatise women either by making them look for reviews of these decisions.  While I understand the need for some sort of timeframe, I do not know that primary legislation is the best place for it.  While the Minister needs some sort of guidelines, guidelines should be in guidelines not primary legislation.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  Whereas the parents were told the child would not survive past two or three days, the child actually lived for 11 weeks and was given a Christian name and a Christian burial.  Doctors are not right all the time, and it is important that that be put on the record.  This is a case in which the child lived for 11 weeks and the parents were told it would not live past two days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#PP00300"><p>To take Deputy Grealish's point, this goes back to choice.  Different women and their partners will make different decisions in different cases.  The tragedy in Ireland at present is that the State will support and protect those who make one choice and send those who make the other to Liverpool.  That is what we are trying to end here.  As Minister, I brought forward the general scheme in March that tried to define this as "shortly".  That was clearly my preference.  The legal and medical advice on the 28-day period is very clear to me.  I am therefore not taking this decision lightly but, rather, on the advice of legal and medical minds that I highly respect.</p> <p>  I get the point as to whether it is better just to put this in clinical guidelines and I, too, have asked these questions.  The law of the land will always trump clinical guidelines, and I have no doubt but that people will challenge this legislation or endeavour to do so.  If "shortly after" is a vague term, I worry about family division on issues and about people in court deciding to define "shortly after".  Nothing in clinical guidelines will prevent this, so we must provide the legal clarity in which medics anchor their guidelines.  I was asked by them to do so, and that is what we are trying to do.  We have provided for maximum flexibility for clinicians here, as is appropriate.  We are not saying it must be within 28 days; rather, it is a matter of it being in their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith, that it is within 28 days.  We need to remember - and I appreciate Deputy Clare Daly's comments in this regard - that this is about fatal foetal abnormalities, not foetal abnormalities.  For it not to be about foetal abnormalities, there must be reference to a period of time.  That is what I am endeavouring to do here.  While I am sure I get many things wrong, this is a proposal on which I come to the committee with a very strong basis of both legal and medical opinion.  Because the matter of fatal foetal abnormalities is such a sensitive one for Deputy Donnelly, me and everyone else on this committee, we all want to get it right.  I am therefore absolutely happy and would very much welcome the chance to engage with Deputy Donnelly and others on this between now and Report Stage.  I am absolutely happy to be proved wrong on this, but my very strong view is that the phrase "shortly after" will provide far too much grey area and therefore, potentially, far too much pain.  That is where we are coming from in this regard.  If the phrase "shortly after" would have worked, I would not have amended the general scheme I published in March.</p></speech>

The words "shortly after" do not appear in it.  What the amendment states is "to delete "either before, or within 28 days of, birth"" from the sentence containing the words "likely to lead to the death of a foetus".  The words "shortly after" do not come into it.  The Minister is using those words; I am not.</p></speech>

The Minister is having it both ways in what he argues.  He says the Bill must be prescriptive on exactly 28 days and no more, yet there is a 14-year sentence for any medical practitioner breaking the legislation.  It is not right for the Minister to try to have this both ways.  If he wants to be prescriptive, as Deputy Clare Daly said, about the period afterwards, he cannot tie the hands of the medical practitioners to such a degree that he keeps that chill factor on their backs, the monkey on their backs.  That is my argument.  I am not saying he cannot.  He can do many things that I do not think he should do but he can do a lot more than the rest of us.  I ask him to consider seriously leaving this within the medical guidelines rather than in primary legislation.  If he is saying he has both medical and legal advice on this, again, we ask him to share it for us to see, please.</p></speech>

I think we are all trying to ensure we get the best legislation we can and achieve what the Oireachtas committee tried to achieve and what the general scheme ultimately, in my view, tried to achieve.  I would be happy, when I brief members of the health committee as to why this was the rationale, to do so with the experts I have.  Deputy Smith would argue that by putting this in, I am tying the hands of medical practitioners.  I very respectfully argue that by not putting it in, the advice to me is that one would be accidentally tying their hands.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.793" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#PP01000"><p>Let us break this down.  We are talking about legal and medical advice.  We need to look at section 12, "Condition likely to lead to death of foetus", subsection (1), which states: "A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section where 2 medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is present a condition affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before, or within 28 days of, birth."  This subsection is what we are talking about.</p> <p>  Because of the sections concerning offences, the Bill is structured to state that termination of pregnancy is illegal, with a long potential prison sentence, except in the circumstances referred to, and this is one of those circumstances.  Therefore, if we include this in the legislation rather than in the guidelines, any doctor making this call, sitting with a couple and telling them the foetus will not survive but, rather, will die either in the womb or shortly after birth must certify this and sign his or her name to it.  The couple then ask more precisely how long the foetus will live and the doctor saying he or she does not know, that it could be three days, 15 days or 30 days.  Every single case then gets written up and sent to Deputy Harris or whomever the Minister of the day is.  The doctor must be able to stand by the fact that the baby, if delivered, will die within 28 days.  In many cases the doctor will not be able to make that call.  He or she will know that there is a fatal foetal condition present, that the baby will die within days or weeks of birth, but will not be able to say, "Yes, I can certify that it will be within 28 days."  That is the legal position that this creates.</p> <p>  The two points the Minister makes are based on the medical advice and the legal advice he has.  I do not know what medical personnel he has spoken to but I suggest that their advice is that we need clarity.  I doubt they are saying to anyone that the 28 days must be in the legislation rather than in guidelines.  What they are probably saying is that they need to know if the provision states "shortly after birth" or "within 28 days".  The issue of what they are saying can be dealt with by putting the 28-day provision in the guidelines.  I doubt medical practitioners, including obstetricians, are saying they need the provision in the primary legislation.  Perhaps they are.</p> <p>  The second point is the legal point.  The Minister says he has legal advice that he must give an exact time period.  If that legal advice is from the Attorney General, my understanding is he cannot share it with us as one cannot share the Attorney General's advice.  I have been trying to get that advice during my eight years in the D&aacute;il and the position is always "Sorry, but the Attorney General's advice is privileged."  Therefore, if the advice from which the Minister quotes is from the Attorney General's office, which it must be, he is prohibited from sharing that advice with us.  The point of this committee is for us to tease out the legalities of legislation.  I accept in good faith that the Minister has advice from the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The purpose of Committee Stage is for him to explain to us the legal implications of the legislation.  Will he tell us, then, regarding the legalities of the Bill, and given that the 28-day provision can be put into the guidelines, the legal problem with taking that provision out of the legislation?</p></speech>

One cannot hand out the Attorney General's advice or letters containing that advice.  In my time as Minister for Health, on every single occasion I have been asked to share the Attorney General's advice I have done so by way of speeches in the D&aacute;il or <i>pr&eacute;cis</i>papers that I had circulated in advance of the wording to all Opposition spokespeople on health.  I am happy to do likewise when, I would suggest, members of the health committee meet me and officials either this week or early next week, depending on when this item of business is concluded.</p><p>The very clear advice was that anything that did not have a specific time period was too vague and therefore was subject to challenge.</p></speech>

That is how clinicians interpret the law but if we do not provide them with the clarity in the law, then there is a problem.  I am not referring to Deputy Donnelly here when I say that we might find ourselves crossing over into the role of being both politicians and obstetricians.  The obstetricians know what they are at here.  They know what the neonatal period is and they make these clinical judgments all of the time.  They have written a letter to all of us today in which they highlight the areas of this legislation with which they have difficulty.  Deputies will note that they are not talking about people swapping doctors and so forth.  The letter is from doctors involved in drawing up the clinical guidelines from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Physicians, including masters of our maternity hospitals.  They are not flagging this area as being one of concern.  They are flagging a number of areas of the Bill as problematic but not this area.  I can tell the Deputy, based on my conversations with them, that they have asked for certainty.  Deputy Donnelly is correct that they have not said that we should put in "28 days" or "7 days" but they have said that we should put in a definite time period-----</p></speech>

I accept that this amendment is different but it was my intention to insert "shortly after birth" to allow the clinicians to understand and interpret that.  However, the feedback I got from the medical community and the Attorney General was that this was too vague and that we should specify a time period.  There is a thin line here that we need to get right and the neonatal period is an understandable time period.  If we start going beyond the neonatal period, are we moving beyond fatal foetal into foetal abnormality?  That is where we are trying to get to.  I accept that there are people to whom we would all like to speak about this issue who could help cast greater light on it for us.  If there is a better way of doing this, I am more than happy to do it.  However, I am coming to Committee Stage today with a very clear view that clinical leaders in this area, those drawing up the clinical guidelines, are finding that clarity on the time period in the legislation helpful.  I will go back to them and will share with Deputy Donnelly what they impart to me and if it is anything to the contrary, I am more than happy to revisit this.</p></speech>

The other wording which was proposed - I cannot remember who it came from - had legal input, as far as I remember and was that there was a fatal foetal condition "present".  Was there an issue with that wording?</p></speech>

I am not certain but my gut instinct is that the likely legal advice would be that it would still require a defined time period but I will certainly inquire further on that.</p></speech>

We are all trying to get to the same place but are coming at it from different directions.  We are all trying to make sure that doctors are empowered to know what they can and cannot do.  My approach to this is that it is of greater assistance to doctors if they know the time period.  In terms of the difference between 28 days and 29 days, as was mentioned by someone earlier, these are not exact sciences but are personal tragedies.  That is why we are saying, "in your reasonable opinion", knowing that we are talking about people who make these clinical calls already on a daily basis.  I should point out that these are doctors who are not unfamiliar with making these calls today.  The only difference is that today they are referring people to Liverpool.  They are making the calls, making the diagnoses and having these conversations already.  They are genuinely familiar with the time periods and with the concept of a fatal foetal abnormality and with the neonatal period.  The only difference under this legislation is that they will be able to then provide the service here rather than abroad.  In that sense, it is not a new departure for them, in terms of the diagnosis piece and the conversations with families piece.  It is the service piece that is new.  I am more than happy to engage on it further and I am not being stubborn for any reason other than my concern that if we take it out, we could accidentally cause a lack of clarity rather than what Deputies Donnelly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Clare Daly and others want to do, which is to assist doctors.  That is not the feedback I have been getting.</p></speech>

I cannot repeat his reply verbatim but I remember he referred to "two doctors", "reasonable opinion" and "good faith".  What way is this issue dealt with in other countries?  Have any other countries referred to "28 days" or "29 days" in their legislation?  This is important because I remember this being a significant topic for discussion.  There was discussion around this taking longer than anticipated and about mothers being very distraught because of what they had been told 16 weeks earlier and so on.  I understand the Minister's approach and support him but I am concerned about the emergence of this, about a definite line in the sand after which, as Deputy Daly has said, the 14 year period kicks in.  It seems to me to be wrong, the way this is all folding together and is, in my view, contrary to what we did on 25 May.  We have to work with it but I distinctly remember Dr. Peter Thompson, a consultant in foetal medicine at Birmingham Women's Hospital, speaking extensively on this subject.</p></speech>

It said - as members of this committee are saying now - that it did not want to include foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in a death before or shortly after birth.  I hope I am not misrepresenting anyone but the only question being asked here, which is valid, is whether it is appropriate, legally robust and clinically certain enough to cover this in the guidelines.</p></speech>

We have been through the movie in this country so many times.  Even over the summer months so much time was wasted.  We should have been dealing with this but cases were brought before the courts on very spurious grounds.  We do not want any spurious grounds that will allow for court cases or the suing of the State or the Minister.  Now is the time to tidy up our act, not after it happens.</p><p>I am just reminding everybody that there are sinister and unwelcome elements.  The Minister spoke about good faith, all the experience they have and so on, but it is too nebulous.  We need to be tight about these matters, particularly where there is a risk to the medical practitioners, the choice a woman makes, etc.  That is the reason I find this wording very loose.</p></speech>

It is to take the definition of &quot;viability&quot; out of the definitions section and moving it into the only section where it is actually used.

I am seeking this change because I was approached by quite a number of people who are very concerned about disability and other reasons for which people might seek terminations.  It hinges on viability and the fact that a termination is possible up to the point where there is a viable foetus and a potentially viable early birth.  There are three issues involved.  The first is a simple drafting issue, which is dealt with via the amendment.  The amendment simply states that we should take the definition of "viability", word for word, and move it to section 10.  In that way, when people read the conditions under which a termination is possible, they will state, first, that there is a risk to the life or serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, second, that the foetus has not reached viability - the meaning in this regard is outlined in the section - and, third, that it is appropriate to carry out the termination in order to avert the risks to life and health.</p> <p>  In terms of where I believe there may be an error in the drafting, the definition of "viability" in section 9 states, ""viability" means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner ...".  However, section 10 states, "A termination [of pregnancy] may be carried out in accordance with this section where 2 medical practitioners ...".  In section 9, "viability" is defined as one medical practitioner but in the main section where it is used it is defined as requiring two medical practitioners.  The first issue is around drafting to provide absolute clarity and to state that if this is the main section where "viability" is used, then it should be inserted here.  That is the first point I would like the Minister to address.</p> <p>  The second point relates to viability and delivery.  As I have been explaining this to people, my understanding of the legislation, with this definition of "viability", is that it states that a termination of pregnancy is possible if the woman's life is at risk, if there is a risk of serious harm to her health in the cases of fatal foetal abnormality and in early pregnancy, which obviously viability does not come into.  If the two medical practitioners say there is a viable pregnancy, meaning the foetus can live outside the womb, with or without extraordinary life-sustaining measures, which I know we will debate, the implication of that is once a foetus could be delivered and live, the option of termination of pregnancy is no longer available and, therefore, the foetus will be delivered.  That is my understanding of the implication of viability but it is not stated anywhere in the legislation that if one or two medical practitioners deem that the foetus can be delivered and live, then the foetus must be delivered and live.  In the context of viability, and it all hinges around the concept of viability, will the Minister say, because it is not explicitly written down, whether it is the case that the implication of this is that once the doctors believe the foetus can live, the option of termination is no longer available and there will be an early birth or an induced birth?</p> <p>  The third point - other amendments we will discuss shortly deal with the same issue - relates to the definition of "viability" in section 9, which states, "the foetus is capable of survival outside the uterus without extraordinary life-sustaining measures".  I have spoken to obstetricians about this and asked what would normally happen in terms of an early birth and whether they would normally use extraordinary life-sustaining measures to keep a foetus alive.  They said that they would.  They said the foetus would be resuscitated, that it could be in ICU, in incubation, and that is their non-legal understanding of the matter.  When asked if they would throw everything a hospital has at keeping the early delivered baby alive, they said they would.  Some clarification is required on that because "viability" means that the foetus can live outside the womb without extraordinary life-sustaining measures.</p></speech>

The first matter he raised relates to the drafting piece, if I may call it that.  The drafters inform me that when a word that should be defined is referenced more than once in the Bill, it then appears in the definitions section rather than the specific section.  As "viability" appears in section 9 but also in section 17 - and this is a technical issue in terms of what the Deputy is trying to do as opposed to a substantive one - if it was moved into section 10 but it did not appear in the definitions section, how would we define it in section 17?  That is very much a drafting issue but that is the challenge.</p> <p>  The second issue is what is viability and what-----</p></speech>

The reason that is singular rather than plural, which is a point I came across also, is because each practitioner has to singularly do it.  It is still a singular assessment, if the Deputy knows what I mean.  The practitioner will have to assess the viability and the other person will also have to assess the viability.  From the point of view of drafting, we are satisfied with that.</p> <p>  The second part of the question was if the Deputy's understanding was correct that once a foetus - a baby - reaches viability, will that baby be early delivered rather than terminated.  The answer is "Yes".  I can say that because the legislation states: "A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance ...", and it sets that out.  In other words, it may not be carried out if it is not in accordance with that.  Does the Deputy know what I mean?</p></speech>

In other words, the termination may not be carried out in the other circumstances.  That is the legal understanding of that, and I am satisfied that is robust.  There is an exception, and the Deputy is on section 10.  In an emergency, the priority is saving the life of the woman.  That is the law of the land today, and is not a radical departure.  Other than in the case of an emergency, the Deputy's understanding of it is entirely correct and tallies with my understanding of it.</p> <p>  The third part of the Deputy's question - this is a matter to which Deputy O'Connell also referred and I understand why people are raising it - is on the idea of extraordinary life-sustaining measures.</p></speech>

That opens a Pandora's box.  Doctors understand very much, as we do, what we mean when we speak about viability and a fatal foetal abnormality.  Clearly, we must get the wording right in our legislation and clinical guidelines.  We know what we mean.  We are asking if the baby can live for a decent period after birth.  That is what we are trying to get at.  Doctors were asking whether a baby was viable if they went through extraordinary life-supporting measures, with machinery and equipment being used forever to technically keep a foetus, a baby, alive.  Perhaps we have not got it right and I know that there is concern about it.  We are trying to say that if a doctor has to take extraordinary life-supporting measures to prove and sustain viability, it is not viability.  Nobody believes it equates to viability.</p></speech>

The March version of the general scheme of the Bill which was placed in front of the people defined viability as "the point in pregnancy at which, in the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner, the foetus is capable of sustained survival outside the uterus".  Defining viability by reference to extraordinary treatment would be problematic, as it is vague and would give rise to a range of interpretations.  It could potentially lead to vast numbers of interpretations and experiences in different hospitals.</p> <p>  If I am correct, we are speaking about the 12-week period; therefore, the pregnant woman would be very sick if an entitlement to an abortion was being considered.  If I understand it correctly, she would be in a position where there was a risk to life or a serious risk of harm to health.  It could be interpreted in vastly different ways.  I was very happy with the March version, but the July version references extraordinary care.  As I do of a weekend, I just happened to be reading the catechism of the Catholic Church.  In the section which deals with respect for human life paragraph 2278 refers to extraordinary and disproportionate care.  If the Chairman will indulge me, I will read this brief part of the catechism.  It states: "Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate; it is the refusal of 'over-zealous' treatment".</p> <p>  I accept that I will argue with the Minister about this, but I am concerned about the differences between the March and the later version of the Bill.  We have heard so many times this morning about what we told the people we would do and what we were going to do.  The logic has been used so many times to say we cannot do something because we told the people something else.  We told them something in March, but we are now looking to do it differently.  The only change is that bit of the catechism, which is a good read.  There is also reference to socio-economic circumstances, which is another day's work.</p> <p>  I think of Ms P in Mullingar.  If a woman is sick and a foetus can be kept alive by extraordinary means, the Minister could be allowing something similar to what happened to Ms P happen again in the way this is phrased.  I realise we are coming at the issue from different angles.  Perhaps there are people present who know something different, but I have spent hours looking at this provision.  The law clearly could be used to keep that woman pregnant until the stage of viability was reached.  We are talking exactly about such a case.  The woman could be unconscious and a caesarean section could be carried out, even if she did not consent to it.  To me, it smells of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, from which we are trying to move away.</p> <p>  I am concerned and would like an explanation for the distinct difference between what is in the Bill and what was placed before the people.  Perhaps it is a cut and paste job or whatever happens in Departments, but it is extraordinary that the catechism could just end up where one might not expect it to turn up.  It was not used before and I argue that it did not get in there by accident.  I know that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith recently mentioned the word "sinister".

When we questioned Dr. Boylan at the committee, the figure was approximately 0.1%.  The amendments vary in their wording, but, generally, the fear is the same.  This relates to cases where a pregnant woman needs a late abortion.  The fear is that there could be hesitation because in the legislation there is a reference to the point of viability.  The point of viability changes with medical technology.  The question is how much such technology should be employed.  I do not have the answer to that question and do not know if anyone does, but essentially a migrant rape victim was refused an abortion for three years and ended up having to go through the trauma of an induced pregnancy.  Serious concerns arise.  The girl was suicidal.  I know that this happened in the past, but it could happen again.  I do not know what happened to the baby which survived, but I do know about the possible physical and mental difficulties.  For example, approximately 25% of babies born at 23 weeks have massive problems.  There is a real danger that if the law is left as it is, with a push towards viability, very sick people will have their treatment delayed.  What will be the outcome of such action?  Who will look after such a baby which might never have been born, except for massive intervention?  We must find a definition of the point of viability.  We must delete the current wording as it could potentially lead to very difficult cases.</p> <p>  I am guessing that this might have been introduced around the time of the referendum because of the outlandish pictures and claims made.  I do not know what was shown in the pictures.</p><p>They purported to show late-term abortions at the extreme end of the spectrum.  There was perhaps something of a rush to reassure the public that that would not happen.  We must reiterate that these are life and death situations for the pregnant person.  Nobody wants to see such situations, but they are sometimes necessary to safeguard the life and health of the woman.  We should not allow ourselves to be emotionally blackmailed, rather we need to find an appropriate wording.  There is a danger in that regard.</p></speech>

This wording would have been of assistance in the Miss P case.  All of the Deputy's arguments would be correct if the section stated "with extraordinary life-sustaining measures".  If I was bringing forward a definition of viability such that a foetus would be considered to be viable if extraordinary life-sustaining measures could keep it alive, we would be in the era of catechisms and so on.  However, I am saying a foetus is not viable if it cannot survive without these extraordinary life-sustaining measures.  Deputy Donnelly correctly pointed out that the legislation could state the foetus would be viable if ordinary life-sustaining measures could keep it alive.  However, it does not state that but, rather, that extraordinary measures would have to be used.</p> <p>  We do not want this to lead to normalisation of the very difficult and painful situation outlined by Deputy Donnelly where doctors would have to go beyond ordinary resuscitation measures and so on which, in the normal course of neonatal care, would be seen as keeping the baby viable.  This is an extra protection for doctors and women and a more compassionate approach to viability.  The formulation in the Bill specifies that a foetus would not be considered to be viable if extraordinary measures beyond those used in normal current neonatal medical practice would be required to save the life of the foetus.  This definition is included to try to provide clarity that this is not about the ordinary life-sustaining measures that could be used in a resuscitation unit or neonatal care but, rather, applies a higher bar of extraordinary measures in order that doctors will not find themselves in situations where, theoretically and technically, they could take certain steps to maintain the viability of the foetus but in so doing would only cause absolute agony and pain for the parents, which none of us wants to do.  That is where it came from and what it is trying to do.</p> <p>  I do not wish to discuss individual cases too much, but in the Miss P case it would have been a good start if the eighth amendment had not been in place.  If this viability bar had been applied in that case, it would have been a very different set of circumstances because the question would have been as to whether the foetus could have survived without extraordinary, rather than ordinary, life-sustaining measures.  That is what we are trying to do.  It is a well intentioned definition.</p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing the views of the clinical community and our clinical leads.  I have some familiarity with their views on the matter and will be happy to ensure those views are made available to the committee before Report Stage.  The intention is to set the bar at an appropriate level such that the clinician can make a compassionate decision on viability in very tragic cases.</p></speech>

We should not cut corners or only do a certain amount to keep a baby alive.  Everything possible should be done.  If the baby arrives outside the uterus and into the world, every available medical intervention should be made to ensure the little baby will have the chance to survive.  If it fails, so be it, but we should not do only a certain amount.  A human being is a human being when he or she is born.  I do not refer to interfering with the life of the mother.  When the baby is outside the womb, every means available to the medical service, extraordinary or otherwise, should be employed to ensure the little baby will survive.</p></speech>

Of course, it is the case that when a baby is born, any doctor in the country would move heaven and earth to try to keep that baby alive and care for him or her, but that is not what this discussion is about.  Rather, it concerns a situation where there is a threat of serious harm to the life or health of the woman or there is a fatal foetal abnormality and doctors must make a decision as to what they can do in for that woman and her pregnancy.  I am sure the Deputy does not intend to confuse the matter, but for the avoidance of any misunderstanding, let me make it clear that when a baby is born, everything will be done to protect and care for him or her.  That is beyond all doubt.</p></speech>

In such a case, the baby would not yet have been born.  Accidentally or otherwise, the Deputy painted a picture of a baby being born in Ireland and a doctor deciding not to do everything possible to save his or her life.  That concept is alien to the health service.  Of course, it will do everything possible in such cases.  The amendment relates to the viability of a foetus which has not been born and how one tests whether it has a chance of living outside the womb.  It proposes that these be the criteria that should apply in those circumstances.</p></speech>

What constitutes "extraordinary measures"?  What is extraordinary today might be very ordinary tomorrow and what is extraordinary in Crumlin hospital might be very ordinary in Tralee hospital.  I acknowledge that the Minister has tried to define it.  The legislation contains definitions of words and phrases such as "obstetrician", "viability", "review", "relevant decision", "health" and "medical speciality".  What are considered to be extraordinary measures today could be considered very ordinary tomorrow, depending on technological, scientific and clinical developments in the medical care of babies.  A friend of mine gave birth at 25 weeks.  The doctors did amazing, extraordinary things and the baby is now in good health and running around.  One of the nurses pointed out that they did such things every day of the week.  For them, it is quite ordinary.  The inclusion of the phrase "extraordinary measures" may be problematic, which is why we have tabled an amendment which would provide that viability was the point at which, in the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioner, the foetus was capable of survival outside the uterus.   The section, as it stands, is too open to interpretation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.865" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#TT01200"><p>The issue which the Minister and I have been discussing is whether "extraordinary life-sustaining measures" can be used when a doctor is determining whether a pregnancy is viable.  The key issue is probably short term versus long term.  My understanding of the Minister's response is that the phrase "without extraordinary life-sustaining measures" was added to avoid a situation where, in theory, a baby born prematurely could be physically kep alive; it might be brain dead or have issues such that the foetus would not be not viable but, technically, doctors could use equipment to keep the heart beating.  That is not a situation we want to see in hospitals.  I am talking about the immediate term.</p><p>As the legislation is written, a doctor or two doctors will make a call and say: "We can induce birth and keep the baby alive or we can't, and if we make the call that we could induce birth and have an early delivery, and keep this baby alive, then that is what we have to do, and we cannot terminate."  Essentially, that is what the section says.  In other words, for termination to occur then the pregnancy must not have reached viability.  However, viability has been defined as the foetus being able to exist outside of the womb "without extraordinary life-sustaining measures".  Now, a doctor makes a call saying: "This foetus is at a point where if we induce birth we can keep this baby alive and the baby could be fine and healthy but we are going to throw everything we have at this and use extraordinary life-sustaining measures.".  As the legislation is written I could see people interpreting it as saying: "We have to let the pregnancy get to a point of viability where the baby can survive without resuscitation, incubation or the aid of a neonatal intensive care unit, ICU."  Therefore, I want the term "viability" clarified for obstetricians whereby a pregnancy has reached a point where if they take a foetus out they can use whatever they need to use to have a healthy foetus, and keep him or her alive, while he or she grows strong enough.  Obstetricians would do that for a premature birth anyway.  In terms of the legislation as written, I am concerned that it is not what the Minister intends and actually says that when doctors make a call on viability we are telling them that we are defining viability as survival "without life-sustaining measures".  I do not think that is what the Minister intends.  In fact, he has just said the opposite which is that they will throw everything they can at the problem.  Unfortunately, that is not what the legislation says.  It states that when one defines viability or makes a call on viability, we are telling doctors that it is viability without life-sustaining measures and that is my problem.  </p></speech>

I cannot see what the problem is with the March version as I imagine it was cleared with the Attorney General.</p> <p>  Let us consider the word "extraordinary" and, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has asked, what is meant by extraordinary versus ordinary.  I spent a long time in an intensive care unit with a neonate one time so I can attest to the fact that medical staff do extraordinary things in such units and throw the kitchen sink at such cases.  Sometimes when things get really bad they make a call to do something according to guidelines or whatever, and their actions often save the baby or improve life.  I have been there and seen that they make decisions on the hop, obviously the best clinically supported decisions.  We must focus on what is routine and normal medical practice.  If I may, I shall read the amendment.  If the legislation were to be amended, as I have suggested, then it would read: </p> <p>""viability" means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner, the foetus is capable of survival outside the uterus with reasonable medical care".  I believe that the words "reasonable" and "ordinary" are almost equal.  I do not want to fall out with Deputy Donnelly.  He explained the legislation very well compared with how I read it.  I would much prefer if my amendment were accepted and the words "with reasonable medical care" inserted.  If the legislation is as Deputy Donnelly has suggested then we should be very careful that the interpretation of "extraordinary measures" in the clinical guidelines is exceptionally clear.</p> <p>  In hospitals, service providers or wherever that have religious codes of ethics, we must ensure that under no circumstances can the religious codes of ethics of a particular organisation trump clinical guidelines.  I say that because we cannot have a situation where a woman in this situation ends up in a bad situation in a hospital with religious codes of ethics that use this sort of interpretation.  I know and accept what Deputy Donnelly is trying to do with his amendment.  I really do not see, if we went back to the March version, what the unintended consequences could be but I am willing to work with him on this matter to make things right.  We, or those of us who want this to happen, need to be assured before Report Stage that we will not end up in a situation where the legislation can be subject to misinterpretation because at the end of the day it is all going to affect the women who are pregnant.  </p></speech>

The question does remain and the phrase "extraordinary life-sustaining measures" is extremely vague.  At the last engagement we discussed the necessity to detail 28 days.  We could not leave for a lack of clarity because that would put medical practitioners on the hook, to a certain extent, in terms of not knowing what to do.</p> <p>  It seems to me that by inserting the phrase "extraordinary life-sustaining measures" one will reduce what viability is and, therefore, there will be a higher test for viability.  I have a nephew who was born at 24 weeks.  Extraordinary life-sustaining measures were taken to allow him to survive and I thank God that he has survived.  I am not sure that he would be considered viable according to this Bill.   </p></speech>

We must remember the head of the Bill where the definition is outlined.  This is where there is a serious risk to a woman's health or life.  This is not the broader argument on viability in general.  This is a woman who is probably lying in a hospital bed or, indeed, in the back of an ambulance being rushed to hospital and her life is at risk-----</p></speech>

This is not the general discussion about viability in the pregnancy where, thank God, the woman is well.  This is where the woman could die.  In that sense, the conversation is much more prescriptive and restrictive because it only relates to head No. 10 of the Bill.  I wish to point out to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that this is not the general test of viability in terms of maternity services.  This is where two doctors are looking at, consulting on and assessing a woman.  I always try to be very careful with the language that I use.  Let us bear in mind that this is a situation where, presumably, this is a pregnancy and a soon to be baby that a woman really wants and the pregnancy has gone well beyond 12 weeks.</p></speech>

That is the situation we are talking about, not the general situation without specific indication or pre-12 weeks so, in that sense, it is quite different.</p> <p>  I very much take the point made by Deputy O'Connell.  We are all trying to land on the same point here.  There are things that we have to be prescriptive about in legislation, and we had that debate a few minutes ago when we discussed timelines and grounds.  There are other things that we should not be prescriptive about, and I do not think the doctors think we should be either.  For example, we have not defined on purpose what reasonable opinion is or in good faith because we have to allow doctors, who know what they are doing and are working with, which is probably the wrong phrase to use, to consult and make decisions.  They are consulting with the woman on her medical choices as well, particularly medical choices that are going to directly affect her health or life in a very serious way in these situations.  We are providing an opportunity here to define what we need to define and to not define what, quite frankly, the doctors are better to define.  I am sure we are going to continue to debate what is appropriate to define and not define.  In this case I think our doctors know what is meant by the term "extraordinary" because it above and beyond what they would do if a woman today, in her full health, walked into a hospital to have a birth and had a baby prematurely.  The doctors would know what to do in that case.  The legislation refers to a different situation.  This is a tragic situation where there is a risk to health or life so doctors have to make decisions.</p> <p>  We all want to get this right.</p><p>I do not think we are actually a million miles apart.  I suggest that we actually ask the people who are writing the clinical guidelines, the medical colleges, their views on this issue and on the word "extraordinary".  Perhaps Deputy O'Connell's wording or Deputy Donnelly's is better.  I am not precious about the wording.  I am trying to make sure that the doctor knows that this is not the normal or regular situation where a woman has gone in and is about to have her baby early.  This is a very particular situation in which there is a risk to the woman's health or to her life and in which doctors have to make decisions.  I am trying to apply the bar that gives the doctor the flexibility to make the decision he or she knows is right.</p></speech>

Would it not be better to leave that out of the law and, like the Minister has said, deal with the ins and outs of what viability is in the guidelines?  It brings the chilling effect into play again.</p></speech>

He has not come back to me on it.  He has made the point that he would seek medical input on what "extraordinary" means.  That is fine.  I am raising a different point, which is a legislative point.  Medics can give us their view but really it is a legal point.  This defines viability in terms of the survival of the foetus outside of the womb "without extraordinary life-sustaining measures".  That is its definition.  We are telling the obstetricians that when they are making calls as to whether a pregnancy is viable, the foetus must be able to live without "extraordinary life-sustaining measures" after delivery.  The Minister and I know that obstetricians are not going to do that.  They will throw everything they can at the baby, but to be in compliance with this they cannot.  There is a serious drafting issue in how the Minister has defined and applied viability.  Could he speak to that?</p></speech>

It is certainly not what we are endeavouring to do.  We are attempting to do what Dr. Boylan told this committee.  Every other doctor probably told the committee a variation thereof.  If a pregnancy reaches viability, except under the emergency head which I want to come back to in a minute because it feeds into this conversation, the baby will be delivered.  That baby will then receive all the supports that the Deputy, myself and everybody else would humanely expect a baby to receive.  As the Deputy said, everything will be thrown at the baby in terms of service provision, supports, and equipment to keep the baby alive and to care for him or her.  This is a situation where the doctor is satisfied that the foetus is not viable.  If the doctor believes the foetus is viable he or she will deliver it, subject to section 11 with which I will have interplay in a second.  If the doctors do not believe the foetus is viable, we will not end up in the scenario the Deputy painted a picture of - and the Deputy did not use the word "cruel" but I think he would agree with its use - in which a doctor would be technically keeping the heart beating but for all intents and purposes everyone, including Mum and Dad, would know that the baby is not alive.  That is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  Section 11 comes into the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

What this legislation says, clearly and unambiguously, is that when it is being determined whether a pregnancy is viable, the test to be used is not the normal medical test.  How a doctor thinks is, if one can have an early birth, if pregnancy can be induced and if everything needed can be done to keep the baby alive, then he or she will do that.  This, however, does not say that.  It says that when it is being decided whether a pregnancy is viable, viability is defined as not using any of the kit the doctor would normally use.  That is what this says.  That is what the law says.</p></speech>

I do not mean to interrupt the Deputy but it says that viability is defined in terms of not going above and beyond any of the kit that would normally be used.  We have talked a lot about the chilling effect.  It is to prevent that doctor having the chilling effect of being concerned that where, in theory, he or she could do something that would keep the heartbeat going, somebody might argue about or challenge it in the courts.  I do not mean to be in any way cruel about that but I am referring to a situation in which, in reality, the baby cannot survive and the foetus is not viable.</p></speech>

I am genuinely not saying that.  I am sorry.  I know it has been a long day for all of us in here.  Perhaps I have not been clear enough.  We are putting this in to make sure that a doctor has an extra protection.  Let us be honest; doctors know what viability is.  They make decisions on whether a foetus is viable.  They know these things.  This will involve two doctors, obstetricians, and they will be dealing with a consenting woman.  People will get this.  They will know this and these will be personal choices.  We are providing doctors with extra protection so that they do not have to have at the back of their minds the concern that, in theory, if they did this, that or the other, that they could perhaps keep the baby alive for all intents and purposes but that the baby would not effectively be alive.</p></speech>

We are trying to avoid that extra chilling factor which the doctor might have in cases where there is something medical that could keep a foetus alive but where, as the Deputy rightly says, the foetus would never become a viable baby.  That is what we are trying to get to.  I am not sure any of us is clear whether we have gotten there.  I am convinced that is what this section does and other people, including the Deputy and Deputies O'Connell and Smith, have raised questions about it.  That is why I believe there is a clinical element to this.  I am putting this in to provide legal clarity for doctors.  It only functions if the doctors interpret it in the way we intend it to be interpreted.</p> <p>  On Deputy Coppinger's point, while I would not support it, the Deputy is entirely correct that section 10(1)(b) could just be deleted.  It could be done, but I do not believe it is a good thing to do because we told people, I told people, and doctors told people that when a baby is viable in Ireland, that baby will be delivered.  Section 10(1)(b) provides that reassurance.  Quite frankly, even if it was not in legislation I believe that any master of any maternity hospital would say that is what he or she would do anyway.  That is what doctors do.  They try to deliver viable babies.  Obviously section 10(1)(b) is not replicated in section 11 because if there is an emergency risk to a woman's life or health, the viability test does not apply.</p></speech>

It was said earlier that the extraordinary today will be the ordinary tomorrow.  I do not believe that.  With regard to a patient in an ambulance or hospital, to me extraordinary life-sustaining measures means the best available there and then based on the experience of the people available.  Changing that to reasonable medical care sounds as though the whole thing is being watered down.  I know that if I was the patient I would want extraordinary measures taken.  I would want the best measures available taken.  I would not want to have reasonable medical care, I would want the best care.  All we are actually doing at the moment is watering the whole thing down.  We are confusing people at the moment.  At the end of the day, all the person, patient or child wants is the best service.  To me "extraordinary" sounds like the best service.</p></speech>

It strikes me that the extraordinary measures referred to are already done.  I accept the point made about going above and beyond where there is no hope.  The Minister wants to remove the burden from doctors but this does not do that.  I understand the intention.  It would be very good if we could do it.  They perform extraordinary measures.  There is a problem with the language but it can be fixed.  There is no massive disagreement between members.  We are talking about the words "ordinary" and "extraordinary".  One person's ordinary is another person's extraordinary.  We could be here all day.</p></speech>

The problem is all these words are somewhat subjective.  The words "reasonable", "extraordinary" and "ordinary" are subjective.  The most important point Deputy O'Connell made in this useful and informative discussion is what it will mean in the hospital setting and to the doctors?  Will it achieve what I am endeavouring for it to achieve?  Will it not?  We should try to test it and I am very happy to test it.</p></speech>

I do not have any absolute answers.  It is an intricate medical and legislative subject.  There is another issue we need to keep in mind.  There are some conditions a woman may have at a particular stage during the pregnancy which accelerate very rapidly with consequent results for her health and life.  A study of some of the cases the committee dealt with last year would illustrate just how rapidly a woman's health can deteriorate to an extent beyond which it is possible to save her.  We need to bear it in mind at this juncture and not leave it too vague.  We need to be certain in determining that a particular procedure should follow and when a particular action is to be taken by medical staff so it does not in any way put the mother's life in jeopardy due to doubt, indecision or delay.  That can be crucial.  I am referring to individual experiences I have come across in public life.</p></speech>

I would like to change it to read "medical consultation".  This has to be a two-way process; the woman must be involved.  I also believe that the word "examined" suggested that there will be a physical exam.  In standard checks before 12 weeks of a pregnancy with no complications, I am told this is not necessary.  I am concerned that the use of this word will have a negative effect on the woman and also may be a barrier to her attendance at services, leading to the use of the illegal pill market.  I do not see that the amendment would materially change anything, and I would appreciate it if the Minister could support this amendment.</p></speech>

I am proposing amendment No. 44, which seeks to include the words "and ascertained her views".  It has been pointed out by several people - and I do not believe it was intentional - that the focus is very much on the doctors in the way this Bill has been written.  There are suggested terms which read, "Two doctors, having examined the pregnant woman", reference to two doctors forming opinions, provision for who the two doctors have to be, mention of two doctors certifying their opinions, and reference to actions carried out by two doctors.  The wishes of the woman are missing.  This is a very simple amendment, which I hope the Minister can accept.  It is on page 9, line 11.  It currently reads: "A termination may be carried out where two medical practitioners, having examined the woman, are of ... reasonable opinion [of the following things]".  I would like it to read: "Two medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman and ascertained her views".</p></speech>

All of the amendments in this group are saying more or less the same thing.  To echo what Deputy O'Connell said, if the Minister could just agree to the amendments we would all get home earlier tonight.  </p></speech>

At present the Bill requires that two doctors examine a pregnant woman before approving an abortion due to the risk to life or health.  If it was a medical consultation this would not happen.  We are now saying that a person can have an abortion having spoken to two doctors over the phone.  If that was my wife, my daughter or another woman, I would want her to have a proper consultation.  We previously made the point that there was not enough backup for the people making the decisions.  The decision to have an abortion is a very big one.  For me, making the decision having spoken to two consultants over the phone, perhaps without an examination of the woman involved, is gruesome.  There is no way I will be supporting this amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill as it stands does not allow a voice for the pregnant woman, the person most affected by this section.  That has to be corrected.  It could be done in a number of ways, for example by the Minister supporting the amendments which provide for the ascertaining of the views of the woman.  Amendment No. 54 is similar to amendment No. 44 tabled by Deputy Donnelly, and reads, "to give effect to the pregnant person's wishes".  The language in amendment No. 54 is much stronger.</p><p>This is necessary because it is up to the doctors and they can override the person.  There is a case, which I might consider it on Report Stage, for even adding a clause, after (a), (b) and (c), in reference to a risk to health, along the lines of "and the pregnant person deems this risk unacceptable."  It came up in the committee hearings that different doctors have different views on what is a risk.  It is subjective.  It is good that we are not putting in conditions.  The patient, as we would say if it was in another setting, should also have a say.  We have seen this paternalistic attitude with cervical cancer.  If we are serious about that issue, then we should reflect it in the legislation.  An example is a woman with serious health problems.  We have all read about, and could cite, cases where a woman has said she was not prepared to take that risk.  The doctors should listen to what she has to say.  </p><p> I support these amendments and perhaps they could even be strengthened so that rather than saying "consult" or "get the views", refers to the woman being a factor in the case.  There is also the question of "examined".  This idea of two doctors examining the passive woman lying there speaks to that kind of paternalistic language.  If a woman's health is at risk, she will not get an abortion over the phone, just in case anyone thought that was possible.  The woman, of course, has to be physically there.  The point is that it is about a consultation or discussion on what that person feels.  That person may have had serious issues in previous pregnancies in childbirth and that all has to be explored with the doctors.  I do not know if we are taking "serious harm" now, if it comes into this group, or whether we are leaving that for the moment?</p></speech>

The decision to have an abortion is a serious one, which people take seriously.  Our amendment does not seek to replace the examination; it proposes to add another.  Nobody says there should not be an examination but there are issues about what "examination" means.  It gives a connotation of that physical issue.  The views of the person at the heart of this, whose health is at risk and who is deciding that risk, are important.  Somebody aged 42 or 43 who has just found out about a wanted pregnancy late in years might be told by the doctor that if she goes ahead, there is a risk to her health.  That woman might weigh it up and decide it is a risk she is willing to take.  A younger woman, however, with children at home might think about it and decide she did not want to take it.  The views of the person at the heart of situation, whose health is up for grabs, are critically important.  We need to put that in the Bill and have it reflected there because it is personal to whomever is the heart of it.  It is a worthy addition that makes the Bill more woman-centred.</p></speech>

There are several others that follow a pattern of seeking to delete the requirement to have two doctors examine the pregnant woman before approving an abortion due to the risk to the life or health of the woman.  They would also, perhaps, only have had a conversation over the telephone.</p></speech>

Deputy Coppinger pointed out that many Deputies have tried to do better in slightly different ways but we are all trying to arrive at the same landing point.  The amendments tabled by Deputies O'Connell and Donnelly are similar in that the idea that "examination" has a connotation that the woman's views will not necessarily be taken on board or that it is just a kind of a physical examination and that is all.  That is not the intention.  Without being pedantic or negative, because I support what is trying to be done here, there are some things we need to get right between now and Report Stage.  It would be excellent if we could try to agree, with the benefit of the legal advice I can offer, on improving the wording on "examined" so that it is much clearer that this is a consultation and a discussion and that, of course, the woman's views matter.  We are all entitled to our beliefs but not to our own facts.</p> <p>  Nowhere in these amendments, as Deputy Daly correctly said, is any Deputy trying to remove the idea that the doctor has a role to play and that he or she carries out the procedure.  As Deputy Coppinger said, this is not pick up the telephone and have a termination.  Truthfully, that is not what is happening.</p> <p>  In response to Deputies Fitzpatrick and Mattie McGrath, this will still involve seeing a doctor, a consultation and all of the other stipulations.  It is more about seeing if there is a way of making the language more woman-centred.  In this case, it may also be more than just language.  It may also be about making sure there is a clear understanding as to how that engagement, if I can call it that, or that consultation is meant to work.   To state the obvious, much of this is implied.</p> <p>  The Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners, published in 2016, states on page 10 how any consultation is meant to work in taking on board the views of the woman - the guide uses the word "patient" - and that includes consent, etc.  The Medical Council regulates our doctors, not me and not the Oireachtas.  It tells our doctors how they are to behave and also provides for serious sanctions if our doctors do not behave in that way.  I thank the Deputies for the amendments which will improve the legislation if we can get this right together.  It is worth pointing out, however, that, while there is benefit in doing this, there is also a role for the Medical Council.  That would be helpful.  </p> <p>  I may have said this already because it has been a long day, but, if I did not, these amendments apply to head 11, which is important.  They need to apply to head 17 as well.  How the review process is carried out needs to be consistent with how the initial consultation is carried out.  I have spoken to colleagues about this and I acknowledge there will be issues in respect of some circumstances where a woman could be very sick or unconscious.  I do not suggesting that there are not ways of dealing with that but these are issues we need to tease out.  The three sets of amendments have all tried to do roughly the same.  Everybody might have their own preferred wording or version or feel that their version is stronger but everyone is basically asking if the legislation can be improved and made more woman-centred.  I am committed to working with all of the Deputies to do that by Report Stage.</p></speech>

When someone says "examine" the pregnant woman, to me that means physically examining a woman.

Will the Minister confirm that will not happen?</p></speech>

At the end of the day, the main concern here is the woman.  As I told the committee, to me "examine" and "medical consultation" are two different things.

I do not mean this smartly, but I am not 100% sure which amendment to accept.  The amendments from Deputies O'Connell, Donnelly, Coppinger and Daly are all trying to achieve the same objective.  Which of us together can get the best wording is something we need to tease out.</p></speech>

On the basis of legal advice we obtained - Deputy Kelly got the same advice - "mitigate" is the preferred word.  If there is an argument against that, we will hear it, but there is clearly a conflict because the advice that we are getting contradicts what is in the legislation.</p></speech>

Deleting the phrase "of serious harm" is incredibly important to support medical practitioners' decision-making.  This is a key amendment.</p></speech>

There was a difference between what the committee on the eighth amendment recommended - if we are concerned about following the committee's lead when it suits-  and what this states.  The bar is being raised by using the term "serious harm" as opposed to "risk to health".  It is a bit frustrating for those of us who spent quite a lot of time on that committee and put a lot of work in.  The committee thrashed it all out and had a public debate.  People watched those committee meetings, which they would not normally.  We are here, and people went on a journey and Deputies changed their opinions.  Why come back with something that is raising the bar when the term "risk to health" covered a multitude in that it is so subjective?  All the doctors said one health risk can quickly lead to another health risk.  All of the points have been made and they were made on the record.  This should be changed.  People voted on the basis of the term "risk to health".  In all of the polling, health was centre stage, for years before we even had a debate.  The people were ahead of politicians on this for a long time.</p><p>It is dangerous if one starts to raise the bar.  Risk to health should be sufficient.  We should go back to what the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution agreed.</p></speech>

Speaking to my amendment, my advice is that the word "avert" in section 10(1)(c) is too absolute in its meaning and it needs to be examined.  That is why I have suggested, as has Deputy O'Reilly, that we put in "to avert or mitigate".  I do not understand why that could not be allowed.  We have looked at the measure in different ways and the conclusion is that it is too absolute as a legal term.  I would appreciate if the Minister could examine the wording because what we hear is that it could potentially give rise to issues.</p></speech>

The phrase is used twice as it is used again at line 35 on page 9.  We also believe it should be deleted and have tabled an amendment to that effect.</p> <p>  The matter is subjective in that one doctor might consider it to be serious harm to one's health if one's fallopian tube does not work again and another might consider that to be a minor element of harm.  What a pregnant person or woman thinks must also be taken into account.  I am not trying to insert that into the section but deleting "serious harm" stops it being subjective on the basis of there being a risk to health rather than serious harm to health.</p></speech>

The terms are different and they are meant to be different if, for example, one puts the word "or" in front of it.  I will come back to the Deputy on that but I will seek a legal opinion and revert to the committee.  The sense was that the word "avert" was to clarify that the scale of risk of harm involved goes beyond that normally involved in a pregnancy and that an abortion would be allowed only where it is required to avoid such harm, but I will check out the reference to "or mitigate" which Deputy Kelly has brought to my attention through this amendment.</p> <p>  In terms of "serious harm", this was a point that was considered at some length during the drafting of the legislation.  I take Deputy Coppinger's point that this was not in the Oireachtas committee report, but to be fully transparent, it was in the heads of the general scheme of the Bill I produced in March.  I do not know about the Deputy but it was discussed by me and others when we were debating the issue.  We had many arguments thrown at us on the question of what is health.  What all of us campaigning on the "Yes" side were trying to do was to show that this was different from just an impact on one's health.  We are talking here about a situation where a pregnant woman is gone beyond 12 weeks and where the 12 week indication is available without specific indication and she needs a termination to protect her health.  We were trying to debunk some of the flippant examples that were given in relation to this situation.  The committee did ask me on page 8 in the definition of risk not to define risk, so what we tried to do was not put serious risk in but instead tried to define health.  Whether we got it right or not, that is what we tried to do.  Instead of saying "serious risk to health" we said "risk of serious harm to health" which is a different thing.  The qualification was included in section 10 to clarify from a legal perspective that the nature of the risk to a woman's health goes beyond the normal risk of harm to a woman's health which pregnancy would pose to even a healthy woman.</p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger rightly made the point earlier that pregnancy is a risk to one's health.  Being pregnant is more risky from a health perspective than not being pregnant, so we were trying to clarify that this is above and beyond the normal risk to health that comes with being pregnant.  For example, the risk would not include poor health from a respiratory tract infection or another easily treated ailment which could harm a woman's health while she was pregnant but which would obviously not have sufficiently serious consequences for that woman to justify a termination of pregnancy being carried out.  Unlike some, I do not believe women go through with terminations for easy reasons.  These are things people think through as they are very serious decisions so I am not in any way attaching a value, judgment or a view on the decisions women make but we felt at the time that there was a need, and we put it to the people, to differentiate between health and risk of serious harm to one's health.  That is what we were trying to achieve.</p> <p>  People are going to ask who will know what serious harm is, and again, if one looks at the legislation, we are not just talking about a random doctor, we are talking about two specialists, an obstetrician, who is someone directly involved in one's pregnancy care and a specialist in that condition which relates to one's health, so if it is a heart problem we are talking about an obstetrician and a cardiologist.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, we are also talking about the woman who finds herself in this situation.  Through clinical guidelines doctors will know exactly what this is.  These are specialist doctors who in consultation with the woman will be able to make the right decision for the woman.  I feel very strongly about the issue of serious harm because regardless of my personal views this was in the draft legislation that was debated extensively during the referendum.  People asked us what health means and we provided clarity in relation to it not being the normal risk to one's health that comes with being pregnant.</p> <p>  I need to take a more detailed look on the issue of avert or mitigate.</p></speech>

We were scrutinising the 28 day period and while that was serious this is important because of Savita Halappanavar and others.  For example, we could all speculate, and I often have said that if she had been in another hospital she would be alive today.  I believe it was random.  My point is that the situation is subjective.  Women's health matters.  It is annoying that one has to justify to the public why people's health is important.  We should not be so defensive about this.  Health is health and it matters.  If there is a risk to somebody's health from being pregnant that person should have a right to have an abortion and we should not have to apologise for that.  It is a question of degrees of suffering to which women are forced to go, which happened with Savita.  The point is that we cannot intervene yet because someone is not seriously enough affected and I am fearful that something like that could happen again.</p> <p>  We have not specifically mentioned mental health.  As has been pointed out, serious harm to mental health is more difficult to measure.  One could say serious harm to physical health involves this condition or that condition but we all know that people who feel suicidal do not even bother arguing about it, they just go to England.  They do not have the discussion because they know it would be too difficult but it would be very difficult for people with mental health issues that are ignored or neglected.  There seems to be a stage that happened between the eighth amendment committee's report and the drawing up of the legislation.  I do not expect the Minister to be perfect and adhere to it but some things were changed and there is a question over who made those decisions and then brought them into the debate on the referendum.  At this stage it will be one for the history books.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.1010" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#DDD00200"><p>It is purposely not defined in the legislation for the same reason I have not defined "reasonable opinion" or "good faith".  It has to be about clinicians being able to make that decision.  One of the flaws with the way we are having this conversation today, and it has been a constructive debate and this is the nature of Committee Stage, is that we are plucking a phrase from here or there in the Bill, but it is when we read the phrase in the total sentence that we get a greater understanding.  There has to be the specialist doctor in respect of the condition the woman has.  That person is the expert and knows that this will cause serious harm to her health.  The specialist has agreed it with the woman and agreed it with the obstetrician and he or she forms the reasonable opinion.  If I and the Deputy start defining too many words in this legislation, the risk is that we will do exactly what Deputy Coppinger says and put our doctors in straitjackets if it does not fit within those parameters.  There are certain things that must be defined in the legislation and what does not need to be defined is left to clinicians making the decisions.</p></speech>

The Minister's definition of health means the physical or mental health.  We are now saying that it is where there is a risk to life or of serious harm to the health, that is, the mental health.  How does one even ascertain what is a serious risk to someone's mental health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.1014" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110600002#DDD00600"><p>I heard many people talk about this in the past during the debates on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I specifically remember Dr. Mahony, the master of Holles Street hospital, make the point that when there is only life as the ground there is far too thin a line between a serious risk to health - these are not her words but my interpretation of them - and that risk to health being a risk to life.  In my view that was the cause of Savita Halappanavar's situation.  One could not make the intervention until one believed it was a risk to her life.  We are trying to clarify that it is not necessary to wait until the woman is about to die and that the doctor is able to intervene at an earlier stage when he or she believes there is a serious risk to her health.  What we are trying to do in this clause is ensure that medics can interact at an earlier stage, before waiting for a horrific situation where the woman is at risk of losing her life.  I am not being facetious but we are not trying to say that one can have a termination in Ireland on the broad ground of health.  We can all have health issues, particularly pregnant women, so it must be a serious risk.</p> <p>  We know what we are trying to do here.  There is a broad situation in early pregnancy, where there is no specific indication required and it is a woman's choice made in consultation with her doctor.  After that we are saying it is illegal in Ireland to have a termination beyond 12 weeks except where there is a risk to the woman's life or a serious risk to her health before it gets to that or there is a fatal foetal abnormality or an emergency.  That is where we are trying to go.  There is no broader ground in the proposition that was put to the people which referred to terminations on broader health grounds.  Our medics know what they are trying to identify, which is making sure they can make the intervention before the risk becomes a risk to life.  No woman in this country should have to wait until there is a risk to her life before a doctor can make an intervention.</p></speech>

The Deputy rightly asked me how to define serious harm.  This is a rhetorical question but if one removes it, what is the health ground then?  I am not being facetious about this because I do not believe any woman decides to have a termination lightly and nobody should attribute that to what I am about to say.  However, I referred to the respiratory tract infection that could be treated satisfactorily in other ways.  Out of respect to women in this discussion, we also must note that these are women who wish to have their babies.  We cannot presume the default position here is, as some people did on the opposite side of the debate during the referendum campaign, that the woman would not want to have her pregnancy or would make these decisions lightly.  It is beyond 12 weeks and it is probably a very much wanted pregnancy, but something has happened which means that continuing the pregnancy will risk the woman's health and the best way of resolving that risk is, sadly, a termination.  That is the situation, not a broader ground.</p></speech>

Regardless of my or other people's personal views, we told the people that it was not just health.  Indeed, many of our opponents tried to paint that picture.  They told people not to vote "Yes" because if they did the politicians would change it anyway.  I have a significant responsibility to hold the grounds that we put to the people.</p></speech>

The words are "serious harm".  Thinking of myself, who decides for me whether it is serious harm to my health?  We would never say to a bloke that his health is not as important to him as his life.  It is verging on sexism to say that a woman's holistic health, mental and physical, is not very important and that somebody who examines her has to decide that there is serious harm.  It is not a tiny bit of harm or some harm but really serious harm.  Who decides what the words "serious harm" mean?  It is too fluid and open.</p></speech>

To be clear, nobody should be obliged to have their health jeopardised.  The question here is whether the best way to avert that - "mitigate" is the word Deputy Kelly and others want us to consider - is a termination or if there are other medical interventions that do not require termination that can avert that risk to health.</p></speech>

This shows that things were said in the referendum campaign that should not have been said.  People's health is important and we should not be introducing degrees.

It proposes to change &quot;appropriate&quot;, to &quot;necessary&quot;.  According to the conditions under which a termination is allowable under section 10 because of a risk to life or health, one of the three criteria is that it is appropriate to carry out the termination to avert the risk referred to, which is a risk to life or serious harm to the health, and the foetus has not reached viability.  We have had various discussions on these issues.  The amendment seeks to change the wording &quot;it is appropriate to carry out a termination&quot; to &quot;it is necessary to carry out a termination&quot;.  I have tabled the amendment is on behalf of others who feel very strongly about this issue.  They have a different view on it to mine but they hold it very sincerely and deeply.  This matters a lot to them.  It is one word but it matters a lot.  Their view is that we should state it is necessary to carry out a termination of pregnancy.  That is it.  My hope is it does not change the legal situation and that it respects many views throughout the country.  I hope it is quite a simple change that we can achieve.</p></speech>

I accept that people hold the view sincerely and that what they are trying to do may seem minor because it is just changing one word.  It is largely the opposite to many of the conversations we had earlier about making sure our doctors have the flexibility and clarity to make clinical decisions.</p> <p>  I believe the word "necessary" to be too prescriptive based on my interactions with doctors and on the legal advice.  The word we are using in the Bill, which is "appropriate", has been considered from a medical perspective with a view to ensuring flexibility for medical practitioners practising in the field.  For the Deputies' colleagues who are coming at it from this perspective, flexibility does not mean no regulation.  I suggest the legislation is already very regulated in terms of what a doctor must do and consider.  To use wording other than that currently used in the Bill could have implications for obstetric practice and I believe that, intentionally or otherwise, it could have a chilling effect on the provision of the service or for medical practice in the area more generally because a doctor would have to ensure it is necessary as opposed to appropriate.  How will doctors be satisfied it is absolutely 100% necessary as opposed to trusting their clinical judgment and their interaction with the woman?  I am coming at this from a point of view which, in fairness, I believe is that of the Deputy also, of trusting the clinical judgment of specialists and experts in this area and trusting the clinical guidelines.  Legally, my advice is this would be too prescriptive and would not provide the flexibility for medical practitioners to do their job to make clinical decisions.</p></speech>

The current wording is that "it is appropriate to carry out the termination of a pregnancy" to save life and health.  The amendment would be an improvement on the Bill, as it stands, and deserves our support.</p></speech>

I respect the fact that Deputy Donnelly has tabled it, although he himself does not support it.  Perhaps the conversation needs to be had with those who do support it.  I am sorry to borrow its language, but I do not think it is a necessary amendment.  The use of the word "appropriate" is not appropriate in these circumstances.  I do not see the need to change the wording as doing so would muddy the waters and make it less clear, when we have spent all day talking about how we could make it more clear.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in will not be supporting the amendment.</p></speech>

That may also be a little abstract, but I know from where the Minister is coming.  He says the word "necessary" would have a chilling effect.  I think the word "appropriate", because it is more abstract than "necessary", might have more of a chilling effect.  I would be in favour of inserting the word "necessary" into the provision.</p></speech>

That has been reflected at the committee today.  If the Minister is telling me that there is a legal issue with it and that he has so been informed, he must not take this the wrong way, but I need it to be more than just his view.  If the medics are telling him that it would constrict their ability to provide appropriate healthcare, that is legitimate.  If they are not, I have to say I would have no problem in changing the wording if it was a respectful way of reflecting the fact that there is a wide spectrum of views on this topic.</p></speech>

My amendment is very similar to amendments Nos. 57 and 58; it is just a different type of wording which says the same thing.  It seeks to delete subsection (4) and put in place the proposed wording, which would allow for an obstetrician, as named in the other section, to make arrangements for the carrying out of the termination of pregnancy to which the certification referred to in subsection (3) relates.  This is intended to bring about clarity and ensure the obstetrician would have choices in ensuring the termination could take place and could make arrangements as he or she saw fit for that to happen, rather than have it as constrained as in the current wording in subsection (4).</p></speech>

Amendment No. 58 in my name would provide that, if the certifying medical practitioner was not available to carry out the termination certified as necessary or appropriate, another medical practitioner would be able to carry it out.  The Minister has referenced advice he has received from the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  They wrote a letter to him which they copied to the committee, specifically on this point, on which they were very strong and said the legislation, as it had been tabled, was completely unworkable.  This is a really serious issue.  They pointed out that a certifying obstetrician might not be available an hour, 12 hours, a day or four days later.  He or she might be called to another emergency, might not be working in the hospital later that day, might be on leave, get sick, work across multiple sites and so on.  The Bill stipulates that the termination which is certified by two medical practitioners must be carried out by them.  The medical community has stated this is completely unworkable.</p><p>My amendment does not intend to change anything in the section but to provides that if the medical practitioners referred to above are not available, then it can be carried out by an appropriate medical practitioner.  I know how fond the Minister is of the word "appropriate" rather than "necessary", so I have used language that he likes.  I hope he will accept this amendment.  The unambiguous advice from doctors is that it is needed and that what is there is completely unworkable.</p></speech>

It was never the intention of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and while I may be incorrect, I never heard it suggested, that it would be the same doctor when discussing wait periods and such.  From the advice I have been given, it is unworkable in a practical sense.  I know there are issues with one doctor certifying a patient and another doctor carrying out a procedure based on that certification.  Fundamental to being a registered medical professional, whether a pharmacist or doctor, is that one is in charge of one's own decision at that time.  It is not as simple to change it in the way Deputy Donnelly is suggesting but it needs to be addressed in a practical way that is workable for doctors and women.  We want to make sure that in any case where there is double certification or complications that we do not end up with women stacking up with three-day waits or being told that it has been three days but they are not certified, so they are really on day zero.  We have to work through that.  I agree with Deputies Kelly and Donnelly but we need to work on it before Report Stage.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell is entirely correct that we cannot have a situation whereby an obstetrician is responsible for carrying out a procedure that he or she has not certified as appropriate in his or her reasonable opinion because he or she will then take on that responsibility.  We need to come up with a mechanism and we will.  We are talking to clinicians about this and I am happy to keep this committee briefed as to how the second doctor can take on that responsibility without, as Deputy O'Connell says, causing the clock to start again, which nobody wants to happen.  I am confident that we can resolve this.  I am conscious that it must be resolved.  From an operational point of view, the issue we are discussing applies to other heads too, as we will discuss tomorrow.  We need to make sure it is operational and this is the biggest operational issue to get right in the legislation that we have discussed today.</p> <p>  I strongly believe, and think we would all believe, that the law should not impose an obligation on a medical practitioner to carry out a medical procedure based on the opinion of another medical practitioner if he or she does not agree with that opinion.  There is a provision about protecting the doctor which we have to get right.  Deputies have tried to get us there and they are trying to get us to a good place but we are not quite there yet with the language.  We need to consider this under a number of sections.  We need to link closely with clinicians who are drawing up the clinical guidelines on this, above and beyond anything else, about what will work, in order that we can get the issue of certification right.  There is a practical issue.  If a certain obstetrician certifies a patient in a nine to 12 week period in a hospital, there is a three-day wait, the patient comes back and the obstetrician is no longer rostered, is on leave or is sick, there is an issue.  I accept there is an operational issue to get right.  The Bill as it currently stands does not address it adequately and the amendments do not quite get there either but we can sort it out together.  This is an area, above and beyond all others, in which I will ask not just for the important advice of the Attorney General but also of Dr. Boylan and those drawing up the clinical guidelines.</p></speech>

I do not want to put words in his mouth; we are all tired.

That seems reasonable, though I would like to add a caveat, which is that we meet informally as a committee on this.  I want to avoid a situation whereby the first we know of his intent is after the amendment deadline.  As he and I discussed this earlier, I sought a briefing on a wide range of issues and was given guarantees that I would get a briefing note to help with the crafting of amendments.  Despite chasing that up several days in a row, it never arrived and has not arrived to this day.  Can I get a commitment from the Minister that he will meet with us with the required notes on this before the deadline for us to table amendments?  This is critical to the operation of the legislation.  It would not be enough for us to find out what he intends to do after a point in the legislative process where we could not propose our own amendments.  I would like us to support whatever is said to be okay by the Office of the Attorney General and the medical practitioners, and the Minister is best-placed to do that.  Can I get a commitment that we will meet and get a briefing in time for us to consider our own amendments in response to what the Minister proposes to do with this?</p></speech>

Depending on when we finish Committee Stage, I propose, with the Chairman's indulgence, that the committee be informally convened, or whatever he believes is appropriate, so we can work out the issues we have discussed on this Stage.  As the Deputy has heard me argue vociferously today, I believe some amendments, though I am not talking about this specific one, while well-intentioned, are not necessary.  Other amendments tabled by the Deputy and others have got me thinking and I am happy to stress-test them.  I will bring forward amendments where appropriate in the legislation to make sure it can be operated by our clinicians.  I suggest that we meet again next week to seek an update on where we are before Report Stage.  I am not sure when Report Stage will be but it will need to be soon.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that one could have a situation whereby the procedure and certification are carried out by different doctors.  I am trying to think of all eventualities.  What happens if a doctor examines a woman and decides that there is a serious risk to her life but the doctor has a conscientious objection to carrying out a procedure?  Such a doctor would be very unlikely to certify that there is a serious risk to the life of the woman because the legislation would force him or her to carry out the procedure.  When does conscientious objection kick in?  A doctor may be afraid to certify that there is a serious risk to the life of the woman when the only way to avert or mitigate that is to carry out an abortion which the doctor would be obliged to perform.  However, another section provides that doctors with a conscientious objection are not obliged to perform such procedures.</p></speech>

There is an obligation on the doctor to notify the woman of a conscientious objection at the earliest possible opportunity rather than do so at the end of the decision-making process.  That is a somewhat technical point.  Contrary to the arguments being made by some people, institutions do not have a conscience and, therefore, there is no such thing as institutional conscientious objection.  The legislation provides that in a situation such as that referred to by Deputy O'Brien the procedure should be carried out by an obstetrician and in the case of a conscientious objection care would be transferred to another obstetrician.  Those who run our large maternity hospitals and tertiary centres will be able to provide for such circumstances.  Members should bear in mind that approximately 20 terminations a year are carried out in Irish hospitals on the grounds of a danger to the life of the mother.  Those charged with running our hospitals must ensure that they can comply with the law of the land.  I am confident they can do so.</p></speech>

The Traveller accommodation expert group was established by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, earlier this year in order to review the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 and other legislation which impacts on the provision and delivery of accommodation to Travellers.  The expert group met for the first time on 15 October.  It has been tasked with thinking about the best way of approaching the delivery of Traveller accommodation, as well as providing the Minister of State with suggestions and key actions in the next six months.</p> <p>  The background to the setting up of the expert group is that A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to the establishment of a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' Traveller accommodation programmes and to consult with stakeholders in respect of key areas of concern.  On foot of this, the Housing Agency commissioned a report, on behalf of the Department, for an independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date.</p><p>The review had regard to the targets contained in the local authority Traveller accommodation programmes and units delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  On foot of this report, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, advised the Minister to establish an expert group to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation that impacts the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  The terms of reference were drawn up in consultation with the NTACC.</p><p> These terms of reference were to review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 with a view to examining whether it provides a robust legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community, which takes effective implementation into account in the context of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity in 2017; to examine national and international best practice in the provision of accommodation for nomadic communities to inform the legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community; to review other legislation that impacts on the provision and delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, including transient accommodation; to consult all relevant stakeholders at local and national level, including Traveller representative organisations and other stakeholder groups represented on the NTACC and the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACCs, with such consultation to include an invitation for written submissions and a series of meaningful national, regional and local workshops and focus groups; and to draft and present report and recommendations to the Minister within six months of commencement.  </p><p> The Traveller accommodation expert group comprises three members.  I will not go through the biographies, which are contained in the opening statement.  The membership consists of myself and my colleagues, Professor Michelle Norris and Dr. Conor Norton.  Dr. Norton sends his apologies this morning; he is out of the country on other business.  </p><p> In respect of the initial focus of the expert review group, the first step taken by the expert review group was to gain an understanding of the key themes, challenges and issues on which to focus.  To this end, the initial actions of the expert group were a desktop evaluation of research papers and reports considering the findings and recommendations, a desktop study and overview of planning code and planning issues and collation of planning statistics relating to Traveller accommodation and an understanding of current expenditure on Traveller accommodation, Traveller accommodation broken down, annual count, Census figures and Traveller homelessness.  Some initial themes and barriers to the effective provision of Traveller accommodation identified by the expert group to focus on are land use planning and the interaction of the legislation and systems with the legislation on planning for Traveller accommodation provision; social housing provision, particularly, the provision of Traveller-specific social rented accommodation, for example, halting sites and group housing schemes, accurately measuring Travellers' preferences for Traveller-specific social housing compared to standard houses and apartments and the role of approved housing bodies, AHBs, in provision of Traveller accommodation; the increased use of private sector accommodation by Travellers either rented or privately owned, the push and pull factors, advantages and disadvantages associated with this development and how Travellers who wish to secure private accommodation can be supported; and key gaps in data provision which impede effective policy design and implementation, for example, annual patterns of movement by Travellers.  </p><p> The next step the expert group intends to take is to complete the desktop evaluation, including a review of planning legislation, and to commence a consultation.  The expert review group is now planning face-to-face consultations.  Later this month, the expert group will meet with CENA - the Irish Travellers Movement, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the Irish Council for Social Housing and Dr. Anna Visser of the Oireachtas Library.  A member of the expert review group will attend the next NTACC meeting with Offaly LTACC later in November.  Wider stakeholder consultation will take place in November and December with written submissions being requested from LTACCs, local authority social workers and other key stakeholders.  We hope this committee will afford the members an opportunity to participate in this consultation and we are look forward to hearing members' views on the expert review of Traveller accommodation.</p><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to make an opening statement.  I will take questions from members.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the establishment of the expert group.  This committee has had a lot of discussions on Traveller accommodation and the failure of local and central government to spend funds allocated and to provide the housing included in the local Traveller accommodation plans.  There is an openness among many of us on the committee to see significant changes and to consider good proposals to allow us to tackle that, mindful that we are going to have local government elections next year with a fresh round of Traveller accommodation planned for the five years after that.</p><p>Part of the reason we asked the expert group in today was not so much for it to report on its work, because we know it is only starting its work, but for the group to hear the committee members' views and give it a sense as to where this committee is at.</p><p>We tracked very carefully, both before the report was published last year and since then, the chronic underspends, particularly in specific local authorities.  There is a mixed picture out there, which we acknowledge.</p><p>We are also very aware from our own experience that often there is an unwillingness to provide land and there are politics around the approvals of the Part 8 planning process.  There are complexities around consultation.  There are local Traveller consultative committees that work well and there are others that hardly work at all or very poorly.  These are some of the key matters the expert group will be looking at.</p><p>Many of us in the Oireachtas would like to see quite radical recommendations coming back from the group as to options for Government.  If one looks at the figures, it is intolerable to think that in 2017, local authorities overspent their standard social housing budget by a factor of &euro;100 million and had to come back to the Oireachtas and Government and seek approval for that extra &euro;100 million while in that same year, the underspend in the Traveller accommodation programmes was the worst recorded at 45%, with a number of local authorities spending nothing at all.  At a time when local authorities are clearly able to spend, even with social housing projects that can sometimes be politically controversial, they can get over those humps.  Clearly, the problem is not the system<i></i>of delivering housing<i>, per se</i>, but there are other factors at play.</p><p>I have no doubt, and I will say it publicly, that while there are many reasons individual projects are slower to deliver, prejudice operating at a community, political and management levels is one of the key factors.  We have to be honest about that and where prejudice is clearly a barrier, we have to find mechanisms to take those decisions away from some of those people, or at least have the sanction of those decisions being taken away and handed for delivery somewhere else.</p><p>We had a lengthy discussion at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness on this matter and there was a proposal that where local authorities had a track record of not drawing down the money to spend in accordance with their Traveller accommodation programmes, that function would be taken away from them, even for a time-limited period.  The idea was not that we wanted to take those powers away from local authorities but if that threat was hanging over them, it might add an additional incentive to draw down that money and spend it and if it was not spent, we wanted to make sure it was spent through some other mechanism.  We could not get agreement at that committee, so this was not in its recommendations.  The committee was split almost 50-50.  Given that since then things have got worse, we have to revisit that, whether it is in terms of the section 183 land disposals, in the Part 8 planning proposals or otherwise.</p><p>We also need to look at the approvals and procurement process, and Professor Norris has considerable expertise in this.  These are also factors in the delay in some of these things.  Perhaps there are ways of speeding these up.  The Government, for example, is about to increase the financial threshold for the one-stage approvals process up to &euro;7 million, which would give a development of 20 units or so.  There might be an argument for looking at having a specific one-stage approvals process for Traveller-specific accommodation if that &euro;7 million figure is too low.  That is something the expert group could look at and it could come back with some proposals.</p><p>Some other smaller things might be useful.  We now get a very useful report, the social housing construction pipeline report, each quarter from the Department which gives us a project-by-project breakdown of where all the new build social housing construction by approved housing bodies and local authorities are at.  We need something like that for Traveller-specific accommodation so this committee can track on a quarterly basis where the projects are at, which ones are being held up and why they are being held up, which would add that level of transparency.</p><p>Spend is not the only issue.  As the Housing Agency report shows, while the overall underspend was 13%, the under-delivery of units was 31% so it relates to what it is spent on, whether that is new units, refurbishments and so on.  We are keen to hear ideas around that.</p><p> Consultation on this is so important.  There has been widespread misreporting and misinformed commentary on the situation regarding the housing units in Tipperary.  It is clear from that that whatever about the detail, the consultative process failed.  Had that been more effective, I do not believe that we would be in the situation that we are in.  How do we make sure that at all stages, pre, during and post-Part 8, for example, or any other planning process, that the Travelling community, and especially the people who will be living in sites or units that are being developed, are centrally involved from the outset?  </p><p> Should we consider sanctions for local authorities in other areas of their expenditure if they fail to spend Traveller accommodation budgets and meet their statutory requirements?  I am just throwing this out there but if a local authority knew that its roads budget, for example, might be withheld if it did not spend its Traveller accommodation budget, it might focus the minds of elected representatives to do what they are legally required to do under the Traveller accommodation programmes.  I am inviting the expert group to be as radical as possible and to put as many things on the table as possible, not because I want to see local authorities sanctioned or have powers removed but because at a time when Traveller accommodation budgets are finally beginning to increase, not a single euro of the post-recession increase in Traveller accommodation funds allocated to local authorities has been spent.  If one looks at the last three years, as budget started to increase modestly, this has been completely underspent.  I say modest, and we need much greater spending than that.    </p><p> I appreciate that the expert group has a great deal of work to do.  I am not telling it what its job should be because the three people here are far more expert on the issue than any member of this committee, however, we are about to enter into a local government cycle and getting legislation through the Oireachtas will become increasingly difficult the closer we get to that and we need to be honest about that.  Therefore, the earlier that recommendations come back to Government, even if they are only initial headline recommendations around some of the legislative reform, the more conducive the political environment will be to consider them rationally and progress them through the Oireachtas.  If we are looking at very significant proposals in changing things such as how section 183s or Part 8s operate within a couple of months of local elections, it will make it very difficult.  If we do not get some of these changes in either just before or immediately after the local election, they will not inform the next five years of Traveller accommodation plans and budgets.  I am not saying that the work should be done quickly at the expense of quality, but the working group should be mindful of the political timeframe under which we are operating.  Many of us here would like to get good things through and the Minister has attended this committee, and I think that he also wants to get things through, but the space to do this is limited because of how the electoral cycle impinges on it, so it should be considered.</p></speech>

What specific work does the working group envisage in a root and branch examination of the role of local authorities?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the underspend.  I wish to put on record the underspend in Tipperary, the local authority in the eye of the storm.  In the past 18 years they underspent by &euro;4.7 million.  That is a very significant underspend when the spin in the media was all about money being spent and people not taking up offers, not that the reporting was accurate.</p><p>It is important that underspending is examined in the work of the expert group.  The role of local authorities in those underspends should be outlined.  The review should refer to the political activities and discriminatory practices of elected members who oppose accommodation.  It is important the review does not avoid or skirt around it.  We all know it happens and it should be discussed.  The efficacy of local measures such as the LTACCs should be referred to in a root-and-branch examination of the role of local authorities in delivery.  I hear them criticised anecdotally as not being useful and as being talking shops.  Will the expert group take a view on whether we are talking about reforming local authorities and applying sanctions such as those Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined such that if a local authority does not spend its Traveller budget, it will not get its other budgets?  Should we be looking at something far more radical and not wasting energy on reforming something that is not reformable given the latent prejudice among elected members representing their communities?  Is the working group open to examining the establishment of an independent national Traveller accommodation agency?  In its report back to the committee, will the working group be specific about addressing the issues of underspending, the crises in people's day-to-day lives, safety and overcrowding issues?  Will it provide an interim report so that, having regard to the political cycle, we will not miss opportunities to get any legislation on the books?</p><p> The consultation with stakeholders will be critical.  Groups on the ground have been doing an awful lot of work and research and it is important the expert group taps into it.  In north Cork they have been conducting extensive data gathering and research on concerns among members of the Traveller community about accommodation.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, we could take note of that work and research.  It should be done in addition to the LTACCs, which would also connect with local Traveller development groups because they have their finger on the pulse of the issues people face on the ground.</p></speech>

I welcome the establishment of the expert group.  It is time to get to the bottom of exactly what is stopping the delivery of Traveller accommodation, whether that is political blockages, administration blockages or critical infrastructure that is missing.  In Wicklow, while we were trying to identify a number of transient halting sites, the lack of infrastructure to deliver sites was an issue.  I acknowledge there is a lack of political will to deal with the Traveller issue.  In some local authorities, the administration does not want to deal with it.  It is probably the only budget in any local authority that is not spent.  All the other budgets are spent.  There is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with.  That is why I welcome the expert group.  I will welcome the report when it is published but the sooner the better.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we are coming into a local election cycle so it will be difficult to get decisions made the closer we come to that date.  If local democracy is not working, we will sadly have to look at removing it from the remit of local democracy agencies.  I am an advocate of local democracy but if local authorities are not willing to make the difficult decisions, the decisions will have to be made somewhere else, possibly at national level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.1146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018110600002#K00300"><p>When we have a conversation about Traveller accommodation or lack thereof, we are having a conversation about human rights and the denial of human rights.</p><p>The expert group clearly has important work to do and the recommendations it comes up with will be important for the Traveller community, society and human rights.  The discussion needs to be framed in this context.</p><p> I will use the example of the fire in Carrickmines.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire local authorities throughout the country generally moved to take some action under pressure of public opinion and with a spotlight on the inaction of the past.  What was done?  There was some signage and some fire-fighting equipment and smoke detectors were installed on sites and an element of training was given, but as the weeks and months rolled by less and less was done and at a certain stage it came to a virtual standstill.  Was the job complete when things came to a virtual standstill?  Very far from it.</p><p> I highlight in particular the question of overcrowding on sites.  I understand best practice, and what is meant to be achieved, is a 6 m gap between mobile homes, caravans and buildings.  There is overcrowding on Traveller sites in this State and in the city where I am a public representative, and the 6 m gap is not met by a long shot.  If we look at the halting site in Spring Lane in Ballyvolane on the north side of Cork city, if anything the overcrowding situation there is worse than it was a couple of years ago.  The fire safety precautions that were meant to be implemented nationally in the wake of the tragedy do not come close to applying in daily practice on the site.  Is it the only site in the country where this is the case?  I very much doubt it.  I have plenty of anecdotal evidence that it is not the only one.  I use this as one example of a situation that needs to be addressed with urgency.</p><p> There is an elephant in the room, which is the conversation and debate that was had in the recent presidential election and its aftermath.  It is not unusual to have wannabe politicians and councillors playing the Traveller card in local authority areas to big up their vote but this was on a level that had not been seen before in the State.  A candidate in national presidential election cynically stirred up and appealed to anti-Traveller attitudes in society to boost his profile and vote.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was done with some success by the candidate in question.  Against that backdrop, there could be a pressure or perceived pressure on the expert group to go easy or to soften the approach and come up with recommendations that do not rock the boat, but in the aftermath of that controversy I believe it is more important than ever that the expert group brings forward recommendations that are bold, radical and address the festering issues and problems that exist.  This issue has been pushed to the side for far too long, as shown by the lack of spend in so many local authorities.  It requires courage and proposals that match the needs of the situation, including addressing the human rights issues that are clearly present.</p><p> On the question of steps for consideration, a spotlight must be shone on the lack of both action and spending by local authorities, followed by proposals on how to address that.  Nine councils did not invest any funds in housing schemes last year and only seven drew down 100% of the funding.  In the Cork City Council area, despite the fact that there are at least 50 families living in overcrowded conditions, &euro;97,000 from a fund of &euro;1.1 million was spent.  In fact, more than &euro;4 million of the funds allocated last year in the country generally were not spent.  I will not labour the point as the witnesses are aware of the information.</p><p> The information provided to the committee by Senator Kelleher contains a figure I had not heard about previously.  Some &euro;4.7 million-----</p></speech>

That figure says a great deal about the reality.  Various ideas have arisen here.  One is the idea of having a sanction hanging over councils whereby if a council does not spend its budget, sanctions will be put in place against the council on other fronts.  There is also the idea that the powers be removed from the councils entirely and given to another entity whose job would be to do what is necessary and address the problems.  I believe there would have to be some form of democratic accountability and input in that regard, but if we are at the stage where we must consider that then let us do so.  The situation that has pertained for years has reached a point now where these issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I wish to make some comments.  Notwithstanding the witnesses and the people in the Public Gallery, there is a great deal of experience in local and national politics in this room with regard to realistic views and options that could be pursued.  I have been through three development plans.  I am very aware of that TA sign, taking it on, taking it off and the problems we have around that.  It all comes down to clear communication and information in the local authority in that area.  It is about bringing people from all communities with us, not leaving them behind.  We do that through clear communication and leadership.  That leadership must come from the local authority.</p><p>I am loath to take it away from the local authorities because it will add another layer of bureaucracy.  They are best placed.  They know the demographics, the needs and the wants of their communities in those areas.  I am also loath to introduce sanctions because sanctions put up a wall.  It is better to bring people along than to put up a wall.  Introducing sanctions would be something I would do as a last call.  A solution can always be found; nothing is insurmountable.  I am also a realist.  We have 15 accommodation programmes for the Traveller community in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which are all well maintained.  There are issues with some; there are no issues with others.  We have some issues on private estates but we do not have issues on other private estates.  One tries to ensure balance and fairness in the system.  It is up to the local authorities to come forward with solutions and sites.  </p><p> A lot of information was made available to this committee.  Some of us took advantage of that.  I was delighted to meet with Anna Visser from the Library and Research Service who carried out a report.  She went through it with me in great detail in respect of different areas of the country.  It raised many issues that will need to be dealt with.  We have to look at the needs as opposed to wants at local level.  We also have to recognise that some Traveller families want to be in a permanent house rather than a Traveller accommodation programme, while others do not.  It is about the desktop study the expert group has spoken about and about getting that database together to find out the needs of the Traveller community.  Numerous other issues come up with regard to finding suitable land including objections from local communities.  Funding is clearly not the problem; drawing it down is.  There has to be a willingness, however, in the local authority to drive that.  Local authorities are under fierce pressure as of late in respect of the delivery of social housing but this issue has to be part of that.  I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy English, wanted to get this expert group together because he recognised that there is a problem that needs to be solved and that we have to recognise where those pinch points are and work on them together.  </p><p> We also have to be fair about it.  If there is a family on the side of the road for whatever reason, one has to be fair to the people who are living in that community.  They have to be kept informed of the situation.  We have to communicate with them.  We have to find out why that family has decided to be on the side of the road.  Is it because accommodation was not made available to them?  Is it because they were not included in the system?  Is it because the local authority is not aware of them?  Have all solutions been offered to that family?  If so, there has to be fairness for people who live in that area.  </p><p> There is a role for all sides to play in teasing through these solutions.  It is not about pitching local authorities against Government.  It is not about adding another layer of bureaucracy and asking another body to enforce this.  A group such as the expert group will come up with the radical solutions that are required and decisions will be made on the informed evidence which it will collate, rather than on the basis of one-liners such as those to which Deputy Barry alluded.  None of us agreed with the comments that were made during the presidential campaign but there has to be a fairness in providing Traveller accommodation.  It has to consider the need, want and demographic required in the area.  There has to be proper consultation, and that can be difficult at times, but there has to be bravery in doing that.  There also has to be a fairness.  </p><p> In my own area in Shankill, we have a family that is on the side of the road in a particular area.  There is no issue.  They are not causing any trouble in any shape or form but there has to be a fairness.  People are paying mortgages or rent.  There has to be a balance in the system.  It is hard to strike that balance and that is where the expert group will be pivotal.  By doing that, we will bring people with us.  Working together, I believe local authorities will play their role in delivery but that has to be done in a manner which we can all support, that local politicians also support and that delivers homes in safe communities for families.</p></speech>

We are cognisant of their role and experience as public representatives in dealing with these issues on the ground and the valuable insights they can bring to the process.</p> <p>  They are correct on variable output.  The latest figures supplied to us by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government indicate 67% of the total budget for Traveller accommodation over the past ten years has been drawn down.  The drawdown levels are variable.  Some local authorities have drawn down almost all the moneys made available while others have a zero drawdown rate.  Senator Kelleher mentioned that in the past year, nine local authorities have drawn down no funding whatsoever, despite the fact that the Traveller population out of accommodation in some of these local authorities is high.  The nine in question are Laois, Mayo, Monaghan, Westmeath, Longford, Wexford, Kildare, Galway and South Dublin County Council.</p> <p>  The issue of Traveller accommodation provision is solvable considering the small size of the Traveller population compared to the national population. That is a starting point from which we need to work.  The policy and funding nationally has improved, been honed and reformed much over the past 20 years.  The issue is with the implementation of the policy, particularly the differences between various local authorities.  As part of our work, we have started to review the extensive volume of evidence collated on Traveller accommodation by the Department and the different Traveller bodies.  There is much research on Traveller issues and there is ample evidence of what the problems are.  It is an issue of collating the evidence, consulting with people and trying to identify solutions, particularly around the implementation side.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the points raised by the Chairman around trying to balance achieving output on the one hand, in many cases against opposition from local politicians and local communities, and bringing communities and local politicians around.  The system of LTACCs, set up following the recommendation of the task force on the Traveller community, has worked well in some areas but not in others.  There is learning we can bring from the areas where it has worked well.  That is a point we will examine.</p> <p>  In the local authorities where it has not worked, there is no doubt that needs to be some intervention at this stage.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the idea of a national body.  That has been recommended in policy since the 1980s but not acted on.  The challenge one faces is the particular local issues which operate regarding Traveller accommodation and the level of consultation with local communities.  The other side of this is that if we continue to work with the situation where there is such under-delivery and uneven delivery around the country, the problem will never be resolved.  In some ways, it creates additional problems for the local authorities that are meeting their responsibilities.  It is unfair treatment of the local authorities that are meeting their responsibilities while other local authorities are getting away with the problem.  Solutions such as sanctions are some of the issues we will examine.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of centralisation of the function.  Although, in view of the fact there has been success in some areas and the importance of local consultation, that would have to be a last resort recommendation.</p><p>Some of the other points raised relate to the need for leadership from local authorities and elected Members in particular, which I acknowledge.  </p><p> I will flag some other issues members did not raise in their comments that we plan to look at.  Local authorities are not the sole providers of social housing so we will definitely examine the role of AHBs, which have been the major source of social housing supply since the economic crisis in the late 2000s.  We will examine the potential role of AHBs in social housing supply, including speaking to a Traveller-specific AHB.  We will also examine the increased number of Travellers in accommodation in the private sector.  There are barriers to Travellers accessing private accommodation that we plan to look at.  The research commissioned by the Housing Agency shows that in many cases, Travellers are pushed into private accommodation against their will and actually seek social housing but in other cases, Travellers have a preference for private accommodation.  If they want to do so, they should be facilitated and barriers should be removed.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-06a.1159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Joyce" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018110600002#P00200"><p>I welcome the views of members, some of which are very practical in terms of very straightforward things.  I like the idea of being able to monitor on project-by-project basis, something that does not occur currently with Traveller accommodation.  In terms of the work we intend to do, there is a significant interaction between planning, the planning process and Traveller accommodation provision and not just at the level of local authority development.  We should remember that many Travellers also seek to make their own provision, some of which could be considered specific provision in respect of sites or halting sites for themselves - essentially private provision.  That type of development is not open to Travellers under our current planning system - certainly not in terms of the decisions that are made regarding those sort of applications.  Clearly, there is a greater link between the objectives of a Traveller accommodation programme and that being a material consideration in the planning process.  I hear the comments of the Chairman in terms of a balance being struck.  Where there is a clear link in the planning process and Traveller accommodation, that need to address local concerns can be met in an objective way that prevents it being a political consideration.  Ultimately, the idea behind planning is that there is local consultation within it.  Currently, the provision of Traveller accommodation does not seem to be provided for within the entire planning process.  When I say that, I mean it in the context of families who want to provide for themselves.  It creates an issue so Traveller-specific accommodation rests with local authorities and the particular political issues that arise in that context.</p> <p>  We are looking at radical proposals.  Some of them may not be very radical but we are certainly taking on board what has been said by members of the committee as Members of the national Parliament.  They are ideas that will, hopefully, be reflected at some level within our report.  Trying to address that balance can be done by objective legislation and removing the political capital that can be made from objecting to any type of accommodation and putting it into a more objective process as opposed to the current subjective process.  Again, I welcome the comments made around the table this morning.  The concerns that have been expressed about the actual spend when it comes back purely to local authority provision are concerning to the committee.  They constitute one area that we hope to see addressed in our recommendations.</p></speech>

Obviously, there has been a very public debate about the more excessive language used by Peter Casey during his presidential election campaign.</p><p>One of the things that concerns me, however, is that in my experience much of the anti-Traveller prejudice that is most effective is the anti-Traveller prejudice that does not allow itself to be seen or heard publicly.  It is what happens privately between certain councillors and managers and it uses a language which is a world away from Peter Casey's language and would insist that it is not prejudicial or designed to prevent Travellers from getting access to the accommodation they need and deserve.  We need to be mindful also that the most dangerous anti-Traveller prejudice is that which vehemently protests that it is not prejudice at all, but is something else.  I only say that because that is the stuff that has a much more negative day-to-day impact on the delivery of projects.  That raises a challenge.  Quantifying and proving that is much more difficult but it is important to state that.  I am not at all disagreeing with Deputy Barry, who is right in what he is saying, but it needs to be named.</p><p> The second thing is a small bit of the picture but it is still worth noticing.  We have spoken here about the global spend but, for example, if one looks at the spreadsheet provided by the Department for the Traveller caravan loan scheme, it is the same picture.  One of the problems we are experiencing at the moment is that even in local authorities - South Dublin County Council is one example - where elected members, against some resistance from management, manage to push through a budget allocation for a caravan loan scheme, they get into all sorts of protracted arguments with management about the implementation of that scheme and the rules that are required.  South Dublin County Council agreed a budget for Traveller accommodation before this D&aacute;il was elected, and when a number of us were still members of the local authority, but not a single euro has been made available to people because of arguments over what is the best way to implement that scheme in terms of the financial rules and regulations.  This might an element the expert group might look at also because clearly there are implementation issues with the loan scheme even though it is only a small bit of the overall picture.</p></speech>

One may have the perfect structures and the perfect law.  The law on the face of it is not a bad law but the fact is it is not working.  We have to understand what is under the surface, although not as under the surface as has been the case since the presidential election.  What are those impediments?  How do they relate to the role of local government?  We have to be mindful of looking at alternatives if these things are ultimately going to be serial blockages to delivery because they reflect not just the prejudice of elected members but of the people the elected members represent.</p> <p>  One may have a fantastic suite of solutions but if they do not pay attention to those underlying factors and human rights, as Deputy Barry stated, then all that will be worth nothing because it will be undermined, delayed and peeled back.  A component of the expert group's report needs to pay attention to those matters as well.</p></speech>

It is important not to forget the work that is being done at national level in reforming the policy, the procedures and the approvals.  No doubt there is more work that could be done, but the information available to us indicates the key barrier is that projects are not being initiated at local level.  We sought information from the Department on applications for Traveller accommodation funding as opposed to approvals.  Some 100% of applications are approved.  We also sought information on the planning process, and the Part 8 process provided a relatively fast track planning solution to getting planning for Traveller-specific accommodation.  There is no doubt that there are problems and niggles with all these measures but the fundamental issue is that applications are not being initiated.  That is the fundamental reason for the variation between output in different local authorities.</p><p>Some local authorities are active, others are less so.</p></speech>

T&aacute; turas fada le d&eacute;anamh againn go dt&iacute; go bhfillfimid ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann roimh na fadhbanna eacnama&iacute;ochta.

An bhfuil s&eacute; cinnte go bhfuil c&oacute;ras monat&oacute;ireachta l&aacute;idir curtha i bhfeidhm?</p> <p>  Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla rud eile a lua.

Is &iacute; sin an tsl&iacute; is fearr chun an teanga a hathbheochan agus chun meas in&aacute;r n-oidhreacht a chruth&uacute;.  Cad a cheapann an tAire St&aacute;it faoi sin?
