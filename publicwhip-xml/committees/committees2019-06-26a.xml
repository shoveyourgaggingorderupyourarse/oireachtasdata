The University of Limerick, UL, academics who appeared before the committee on Wednesday, 19 June, have requested the following correction to the record of yesterday's proceedings, which I will read into the public record.  At yesterday's with committee meeting with Eir, it was stated that the UL academics who attended the previous meeting may have said that the standard of Eir's fibre cable was not of the same standard as the fibre that would be overlaid by the preferred bidder in the 300,000 premises exclusion zone.  The UL academics did not state that Eir's fibre was inferior to National Broadband Ireland, NBI's, fibre at any stage.</p><p>We will proceed with today's meeting on the national broadband plan and I welcome Mr. Denis O'Leary, head of strategy and innovation, and Mr. Michael Mahon, former national broadband plan, NBP, project manager, from the ESB to discuss the national broadband plan.</p><p>Before we begin I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that they make to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice members to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.</p><p>I invite Mr. O'Leary to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.</p> <p>  As well as a two-page statement, we circulated a short presentation on ESB's involvement in the national broadband plan, ESB's involvement in the telecoms industry in Ireland generally, the establishment of SIRO, our delivery vehicle, an introduction to the broadband plan and the timelines that were key to that, the commercial challenges and the key decisions that led to our withdrawal from this process over two years ago, and some summary conclusions.</p> <p>  We first got involved in the telecoms business back in 2003, when we ran fibre on the overhead transmission network with a northern ring which covered north of Leinster with a T up into County Donegal.  There was a southern ring which covered most of south Leinster and much of south Munster.  That was a backhaul network, which basically means it was similar to a motorway network, and all the major retail companies Eir, Enet, Virgin and BT were customers of that network since 2003.</p> <p>  A diagram in the submission shows the lower voltage system - the 40,000 or 38,000 volt system.  We have approximately 700 stations all over the country.  One can take it that any town in Ireland with a population greater than 3,000 to 4,000 people has one of those stations.  Another diagram represents the medium voltage system - the 10,000 to 20,000 volt system, which ultimately brings electricity to every home in the country.  We have approximately 90,000 km of that network.</p> <p>  We had this idea that as well as being the provider of the backhaul network utilising the electricity network on a larger scale gave us greater commercial opportunities in the telecoms business.  We looked at it in a lot more detail in 2014 because the European Union had produced the digital agenda for Europe.  It was the first time that the whole issue of the replacement of the historical copper networks had been addressed in terms of a new type of high-speed broadband network and what would be required in the more modern economies to deliver both the uptake and the download speeds that both residential customers as well as commercial and industrial customers would work with into the future.  Ireland at that time was lagging behind the European average in terms of the take-up rates, the availability and the speeds available to customers in Ireland at that time.  We decided there was an opportunity there but we had to make a decision as a company as to what level we would get involved in this business.  On the one hand, we could simply lease out the electricity network to a telecoms operator while on the other we could do end to end and do the infrastructure, the wholesale, and the retail.</p> <p>  We discounted both of those extremes and landed in a position that we would become an infrastructure company through a joint venture with another telecoms company.  The reason was we did not have real experience in the mass telecoms market, nor did we know enough about telecoms pricing or about the telecoms industry, as such.  At that point, we went into a very extensive procurement process that lasted more than 12 months.  At the end of it, Vodafone was the preferred candidate and it joined up with ESB to form this new company called SIRO.  The structure of SIRO is that there is a joint venture agreement between the two main shareholders, ESB and Vodafone.  SIRO has a separate agreement with ESB Networks called the network access agreement which contain the terms and conditions by which SIRO must abide in order to access the electricity network to string the fibre on the network.</p> <p>  That company was set up in 2016 and is functioning at fairly optimum speed since mid-2016 or the start of 2017.  Since then it has passed nearly 250,000 homes with broadband network, or 242,000 homes to be exact.  We have connected more than 42,000 customers.  The target for this phase of the business plan for SIRO, being funded by both shareholders, is to pass 450,000 homes.  This represents an investment of not far off &euro;500 million in the telecoms infrastructure business in Ireland.  We were the first retailer to offer a 500 Mbps and a gigabit service to the residential sector.  We considered the company to be best in class in service delivery and there are nearly 14 retailers operating on the SIRO networks at this time.  It has been a tremendous success.</p> <p>  The phase one concentrated on the 50 towns outside the main cities, particularly outside Dublin.  Once that is completed, the shareholders will discuss the options for a phase two.  To date, the business has been very successful and has met the key metrics set in terms of a formal business plan.</p> <p>  There was then talk of a national broadband plan.  I have provided a diagram of Ireland and members can see the comparators.  What is in blue in the diagram is what is not in the intervention area.  The areas and premises in the intervention area are coloured light brown and orange.  Those 757,000 homes are in the two coloured areas.</p><p>The different colours represent the fact that initially there were to be two lots.  If we compare SIRO's challenge with the challenge of developing and rolling out a national broadband plan, SIRO's plan was to cover 450,000 homes, while the national broadband plan, NBP, was to cover 757,000 homes.  SIRO intended to roll out about 1,300 km of fibre, while the NBP plan, based on our technical design, would have required nearly 77,000 km of fibre.  That is an extraordinary structural, engineering and project management challenge.  The amount underground was minuscule in the NBP.  The reason for the State putting a national broadband plan in place was that it would not be commercial for any of the key operators to go into these rural locations and roll out fibre in the hope the customer take-up and revenue from it would generate an adequate return from the investment over 20 or 25 years.  Some stimulus was needed.  To do it in the way we were going to do the technical design would have involved very close to 600 mini-exchanges throughout the country.  They would have been based in our 38Kv sub-stations and medium voltage sub-stations.  That was the level of network design required to ensure the required broadband speeds set down by the Department in the tender documents could be met for every single household on the island.  That would have required an extensive amount of fibre in the intervention area.  </p><p> SIRO was formed in 2014.  From mid-2014 to 2015 there was a lot of discussion with the Department on the strategy and mapping for the NBP.  Much of it was about technical issues, the number of houses and the accuracy of the mapping in the intervention area.  In mid-2015 there was a draft strategy and in December 2015 the Department published the revised strategy and the updated map and commenced the procurement process.  At the time most of the emphasis was on the technical and mapping side and not much on the commercial contract.  In quarters 1 and 2 of 2016 we prepared a detailed pre-qualification submission to show that we had the financial support of our parents and the ability to build, operate and manage large-scale networks.</p><p> In June 2016 the Department pre-qualified the bidders and progressed to the formal procurement process.  That was the first time we got sight of the commercial contract and its conditions.  In December 2016 the Department advised bidders that there could be 300,000 premises removed from the contract owing to a commitment by Eir that it would do these premises on a commercial basis and that there would be no need for any subvention or State funding for them.  That had an impact on the business case on which we had been working from a technical point of view and from the point of view of the potential revenues that could have been generated from the original subvention area to what would be a revised subvention area, minus the 300,000 homes.  Nevertheless, we asked for additional time from the Department to redo the technical design because we had to go back and start from scratch.  I can explain later the impact of the 300,000 figure on the business case.  As we progressed, following the withdrawal of the 300,000 premises and with certain challenges in the construct of the commercial contract associated with the NBP, we met the Department on several occasions.  In September 2017, following more urgent meetings, we asked it specifically to consider certain requests that would have made the possibility of presenting a commercial business case less challenging than it was.  While it did move on some issues and tried to help us on others, at the end it was not enough.  Following two years of fairly intensive involvement by a not insignificant number of staff and outside help in the ESB, a decision was taken by both shareholders in SIRO that it would not fit with what they had hoped for and in September 2017 we advised the Department that we were formally withdrawing from the process.</p><p> The commercial challenges associated with a significant infrastructural job such as a national broadband plan can be broken down into four parts.  Above the line are the costs, the cost to build the network.  It is very extensive.  I was reminded at the start by one of the guys working on the project that the length of fibre required to serve all homes in rural Ireland, 80,000 km, is roughly twice around the world, but it is a one-off cost that has to be managed.  The second part is the day to day cost of managing that level of telecommunications equipment, managing the maintenance of the equipment, all fault repairs, the information technology, IT, systems and the billing systems.  To match it, there is the amount of revenue from each customer and, most critically, the number of customers who will connect to the system.  There was a point when the number of customers was in the region of 800,000 when we would have been quite positive about the business, but when the 300,000 premises were removed, it had a very serious impact on the potential and projected revenues over the ten, 20 or 30 years of the project.  That is what made it really challenging.  </p><p> The key issues that forced SIRO and its shareholders to withdraw from the NBP process approximately two years ago were the removal of the 300,000 premises, the risk apportionment within the structure of the contract, the financial viability of the contract simply owing to the risk apportionment within it, issues with the use of alternate networks, an issue we can discuss, and the rebalancing risk.  When we entered the project in 2015, we entered with high expectations and in very good faith.  We put together a really good team of people to get into a level of detail on the project by which many at senior level in the ESB and Vodafone were astounded.  Mr. Mahon and his team did that work.  The reduction of the intervention area by 300,000 premises had a material impact on the project.  Throughout 2017 we were really challenged as a business to make a business plan that would meet the financial criteria set by both shareholders.  In quarter 3, following significant engagement with the Department, we were left with no choice but to withdraw from the NBP.  The ESB has since moved on.  It has been two years since anybody in the ESB or Vodafone has worked on the national broadband plan.  It is amazing what happens within two years.  In the ESB our focus is on delivery of our Brighter Future strategy in working with and supporting the Government in the implementation of its recently announced climate action plan.</p></speech>

At our meeting yesterday with Eir it stated it could design, build, operate and upgrade the poles and ducts and pay value added tax, VAT, for &euro;1 billion to roll out the NBP.</p><p>That is in contrast with its final draft bid of &euro;2.75 billion, which did not include VAT.  Is that credible?  Is coming in under &euro;1 billion something that the ESB could do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#E00200"><p>As already stated, it is two years since we exited the process.  I know from media reports and so on that the process has changed somewhat in the interim in the context of the subsidy, the size of the intervention area and some of the commercial issues that were in the contract.  What we worked on two years ago is different to what I understand is there now.</p> <p>  I am loath to comment on the bids of the two companies because I do not know what is there as regards project delivery.  There seems to be some confusion as to whether we are talking about the total project or the main fibre running along the side of the road or the fibre running along the side of the road plus electronics and all the equipment needed to run the fibre.  Are we talking about all the maintenance costs or the drop cost to all these customers?  I do not know what is included in the &euro;1 billion in terms of the figures quoted yesterday.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked whether the ESB or SIRO could deliver the project with a subsidy of &euro;1 billion.  Based on the work that we had done by 2017, the answer is that the ESB would not have been able to deliver the project for a &euro;1 billion subsidy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#E00300"><p>There has been considerable public commentary going back some months, with which, I am sure, Mr. O'Leary is familiar, to the effect that ESB poles could be used to roll this out.  Will Mr. O'Leary outline how he would replace fibre and what challenges, if any, in placing fibre along electricity wires and its impact?  There is a popular narrative that the ESB could roll this out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#E00400"><p>The ESB has a nationwide infrastructure.  We have a connection and probably a piece of equipment in most fields throughout the country.  Eir has a similar national infrastructure except that it is predominantly along the roadside.  Fibre can be run on the ESB electricity infrastructure.  Before we signed the joint venture with SIRO and allowed it to roll out fibre on the ESB infrastructure, we carried out intensive testing on the fibre network at our main test centre in Portlaoise.  We also built test facilities in different parts of the country and tested the network under the most extreme conditions in the context of storm loading, wind loading and ice loading.  We then developed a set of criteria and standards that would have to apply and would be applied by the local ESB networks management team to any company that wanted to run fibre on the ESB infrastructure, namely, SIRO.  We are confident about the ability of the electricity infrastructure to hold the fibre network if the standards are applied without any risk to the key purpose of the electricity infrastructure, which is the delivery of a reliable supply of electricity to all customers.  The latter is the one thing we would not want to undermine in any way.  We have done that work and are confident about it.  It is not easy running fibre on the electricity network because there is energy on the infrastructure.  In the vast majority of cases, the network must be disconnected and earthed before any work can be allowed in order to string the fibre.  It can be done and it is possible to do it if due regard is had to the electricity infrastructure.</p></speech>

Our experience in SIRO, where we have rolled out an extensive amount of fibre, is that the fault level on the network is tiny.  It is really robust infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#E00700"><p>I am also chairperson of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  Mr. O'Leary referred to the ESB's focus on rolling out charging points.  What kind of capital investment plans are in place for this.  We have set a target of 70% in respect of renewable electricity generation by the year 2030.  How would the ESB's capital plan have worked had it also been rolling out a national broadband plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#E00800"><p>That is a very interesting question.  If one looks at the challenges faced by the ESB up to 2030, it is not only than the 70% target for renewable generation but also that we may have to connect over 500,000 new homes in the same period.  In the context of the climate action fund the Government launched last week, reference has been made to retrofitting up to 400,000 homes in the same period and providing the charging infrastructure for 300,000 electric vehicles.  Members will be aware from media reports of the challenges we face in terms of supplying energy to the data centres that are trying to locate operations in Ireland.  Given the very strong inflow of foreign direct investment, we notice the degree of the electricity service, both in its speed and quantity, increases as we go along.  These are just the issues in terms of delivering our key strategy, A Brighter Future, and supporting the Government.</p> <p>  It is two years since the ESB withdrew from the process.  We have not done any work on it in over two years and things have moved on, so we consider that to be a hypothetical situation.</p></speech>

His reputation is such that I would not expect anything less from him.</p> <p>  The ESB delivers electricity to every home in the country under a mandate from the State and is subject to oversight by the regulator.  If the State was minded to mandate the ESB to deliver broadband to the 542,000 premises in question notwithstanding the issues involved, is it correct that it, as a semi-State company, would have to do so?</p></speech>

As I told the Chairman, we have withdrawn from this process in the past two years and have worked on all the other key programmes I mentioned.  Any potential broadband plan has passed us by.  Without being an expert, my understanding of state aid is that it would be a challenge in getting to that position.  If we were mandated to do that as a company, then we would have to seriously consider it then.</p></speech>

He is well aware of what Eir has stated about it being cumbersome, complex and difficult.  Let us go back two years to when Mr. O'Leary was in the thick of it.  If he was asked, in a relatively simplistic way, to say how he would deliver high-speed broadband - commensurate with what he was doing in the SIRO areas - to the 540,000 homes, would he have done it in the same way as that proposed in the context of the NBP process?</p><p>Yesterday, Eir told us that it has connected 300,000 homes to high-speed broadband in what it refers to as the 300k intervention area.  It said that using the same model, criteria and standards it could connect 542,000 homes for &euro;1 billion or less.  It said that the difference between the &euro;1 billion and &euro;3 billion bid is to do with the complexity that was introduced, the inability to use existing infrastructure and the necessity to establish an entirely new wholesale operation and provide a different service-level agreement to customers.</p><p> To the uninitiated on this side of the room, myself included, it seems that the process undertaken by the Department was overly complex and aimed at creating a level playing pitch for everybody to compete on, rather than getting best value for money.  The purpose was to create a level playing pitch so that anyone could come in, whether or not they had infrastructure.  I am interested in how that relates not to Eir but to ESB.</p></speech>

In my opening remarks I tried to give some impression of the complexity of the project.  Having been involved in the roll-out of infrastructure with ESB for many years, I know that it is an enormous project to roll out 80,000 km of high-speed broadband in the most remote locations in the country, where road access, the terrain and connectivity are poor.  It is really difficult.  For a project such as that, it cannot be decided to do all of west Cork and then all of north Kerry.  Work would have to start in all 26 counties at the one time so that the whole lot could be brought together.  That adds to the complexity.  It is only once the process begins that it becomes clear how detailed the contracts and documentation have to be because there are so many issues to be covered.</p> <p>  It is true that we have had disputes and disagreements with the Department.  On the one hand, as the bidder, we wanted to have it our way; and on the other hand, in deciding the contract, the Department approached it from the point of view of ensuring that the maximum risk lay with the bidder, the minimum risk lay with the State and the State was covered in all eventualities.  In doing that, the Department crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's, and it is our position that it crossed too many t's and dotted too many i's; that was our concern.  However, we never disagreed with why the Department took that approach.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily want a comment on Granahan McCourt, but if it was known how much was available from the State - be it &euro;2.7 billion, &euro;2.8 billion or &euro;2.9 billion - and that ESB as a parent company would have to commit only &euro;170 million of real capital and around &euro;40 million of venture capital, would that have been a proposition worth pursuing?</p></speech>

It is a different proposition now than when we left.  I have no insight or detail on what the NBP quote was except what I have read in the paper, and I am not sure how accurate that is.  In the same way that I am slow to comment on any statement made by Eir yesterday, I am also slow to comment on the bid from the preferred bidder.</p></speech>

Is it fair to assume that when ESB withdrew, it did not feel that that level of subvention was available?</p></speech>

It was not intended that an extremely high subsidy would make extremely high returns, because there was a clawback mechanism in the contract from the State.  Unfortunately, if far inferior returns were made, there was no mechanism in the contract to support the bidders.  All the risk lay with the bidder.  That is one issue I want to raise on the discussions that have taken place regarding the subsidy.</p></speech>

It is clear that this is an enormous project with an enormous level and multiplicity of risk.  Based on its considerable experience of stringing cable and rolling out fibre and high-voltage lines, ESB recognised that at an early stage and decided that the risk was too great, given the return on investment versus the investment made.  We have to draw our own inferences from the fact that a company such as ESB, with a fine track record, did not believe it was doable for the money available and that the achievable return was questionable.</p> <p>  This leads to a point that I have had real concerns about for a long time.  How did a private investment firm from Boston, with a list of subcontractors and without the level of expertise in the marketplace, experience or understanding of the continued complexity of this process, go as far as it did?  I do not expect ESB to discuss that; it is merely a comment.</p> <p>  The removal of 300,000 homes was termed by others as cherry-picking by Eir.  It was entitled to do that and the State had no choice but to remove those homes from the intervention area because, once the offer was made to roll it out commercially, under state aid rules the State could not be seen to subvent that.  It was a game changer for ESB, but the Department had no issue with it.</p> <p>  Having rolled out fibre into that area, can we assume that it is now easier for Eir to rock up and offer to do it for &euro;1 billion, given that a good chunk of the groundwork is done?  It could be said that that is Eir's good luck, but the truth is that this is a significant advantage for Eir and would help explain how its costs are less than those of anyone else in that position.</p></speech>

The red lines represent the main roads out of Mitchelstown and in the middle is Mitchelstown itself.  All the houses in the middle already have high-speed broadband through fibre to the cabinet or fibre to the exchange, so they are not in the intervention area.  While we had 775,000 homes, all the homes along the red lines were in the subvention area.</p><p>For the 300,000 customers, Eir has removed from the intervention area all those on the red lines and will connect them on a commercial basis.  Our equipment is in Mitchelstown.  If we have to reach the homes in the intervention area, we must now go through all the red lines without fibre but we cannot pick up any customers because they are no longer in the intervention area.  In effect, Eir has put a doughnut around each town, our equipment is in the middle of the doughnut, and all our customers are on the other side of the doughnut.  We must go through the doughnut in every case to get to the intervention customers.</p><p> I want to be careful.  I am not accusing Eir of anything.  It made a commercial decision to take 300,000 customers out of the intervention area and indicated it would connect them on a commercial basis.  From our understanding, that was perfectly correct and there was nothing anyone could do to prevent 300,000 people who had never had high-speed broadband from getting it.  We had done 12 or 14 months of hard work on a good, technical design and case study but found we would have to start again.  That was the impact of the 300,000 customers.</p></speech>

It is a little bit like the television programme, "Dragons' Den", when the dragons say, "I'm out".  The ESB is out.  While I do not carry any flag for Eir, the truth is that its investment on a commercial basis will put it in a much stronger position to offer a better deal to the State, based on the level of subvention required to reach the 540,000 customers.  It should have not been a surprise to any of us, although perhaps it was yesterday, that Eir was in a position to deliver against what the Government required for the citizens in question at a lower cost to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

One important aspect, however, is that following Eir's decision on the 300,000 customers, one of the issues we raised with the Department was that which the Deputy has just highlighted.  We were at a serious disadvantage in having to get infrastructure through the doughnut before we could start picking up the customers in the reduced intervention area.  We had discussions with Eir, ComReg and the Department because we felt we should have access to Eir infrastructure in the doughnut at incremental costs in order that we would compete in the intervention area on the same footing.  We had much difficulty with that issue in the summer of 2017 with Eir, ComReg and the Department, and it was not getting any closer to a resolution.  It came at a time when the clock was running down, under pressure from the Department, and there remained many commercial issues.  It was a reason we withdrew.</p></speech>

To tease out further what Mr. O'Leary stated, even after the 340,000 houses were removed from the intervention area, the ESB was still considering the possibility of connecting houses from the end point of those red areas, on the outskirts of Mitchelstown, where it would be just a regulator.  If the ESB had provided the fibre on the same red routes through the doughnut, it would still be able to hook on at the end of point of that and continue the network from there.  Mr. O'Leary indicated that the Department, or perhaps ComReg, was ultimately unable to agree on that.  What were the Department's concerns in that regard?</p></speech>

Rather, we never received an answer or resolution to the issue we had.  Eir could have stated yesterday that the national broadband plan company has decided to run its own infrastructure through the area, presumably because it was unable to come to an agreement.  We assessed whether it would have been cheaper.  While we knew that the decision to remove 300,000 homes from the intervention area would have a significant impact on our business plan, we nonetheless kept working on it and assessed where we could reduce costs.  We believed that one way we could do so was to minimise the capital spend to get from the equipment in the towns to as far as where the customers were in the reduced intervention area.  That is one of the ways we examined the matter.</p> <p>  Mr. Mahon might confirm that to have been the case.</p></speech>

From the committee's hearings, it is clear the developer, Granahan McCourt, still has options for what it will use on the final few miles to a house.  It has the option of using Eir poles but the Department and others have indicated that it would also be possible, in the final part of tendering process, to use the ESB poles to gain access to the houses in the intervention area.  Has the ESB had any discussions with the Department or the developer about that possibility?</p></speech>

There has been initial contact but it has not been in any great detail.  It is public knowledge that extensive agreements have been signed by the preferred bidder and Eir for access to Eir infrastructure.  The build model, therefore, is on Eir infrastructure.  While hopping between Eir infrastructure and electricity infrastructure might sound simple, practical and fine, it is very complex and expensive.  Eir infrastructure runs along the side of the road and does not have any high-voltage equipment or any dangerous electricity lines, whereas ESB equipment runs across fields, behind houses and is not always close to the telecommunications industry's infrastructure.  If the preferred bidder wants access to ESB infrastructure, it should get in contact with ESB Networks as soon as possible, identify the requirements and assess the best way to deal with them.</p></speech>

They are very much one-off housing.  If there is a ribbon development on a road, one can understand that Eir linking fibre along the telegraph poles to a series of houses on a road would be much more attractive than following a winding country road to a boreen.  The ESB might have certain advantages in respect of the final mile to an isolated farm house.</p></speech>

Between now and the end of phase 1, the shareholders will have to decide what the scope of phase 2 will encapsulate.  There is significantly more enthusiasm in the Irish telecommunications industry for the roll-out of fibre than when we started SIRO.

They were similar to the concerns raised in the memorandum to the Government.  A very unusual, separate memorandum was sent to Ministers.  At the end, it effectively stated the process should be stopped and that the Government should start with a State entity - it was not specified which exactly - providing a revised roll-out.  Eir stated yesterday one of the reasons it withdrew or encountered difficulty was that it would have had to set up a completely separate wholesale division, with all the various pricing arrangements and so on.  If the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had its way and there was a re-initiated process whereby the State was seeking to manage the initiative, similar to the way in which it proceeded with the MANs, would the system set up with SIRO, with its wholesale management, resources and the expertise built up, be able to respond to the Department if it came looking for the resources to be used in the way it outlined?</p></speech>

The question of the risk-reward parameters involving the Department and the bidders must also be borne in mind.  Earlier we discussed ESB's existing workload.

It has not been mentioned in the ESB in the past two years, and I would say it has not been mentioned in Vodafone in the two years either.  Both companies are busy delivering their own business plans.  Anything related to a new process is hypothetical.  So many things have changed in the two years since we left that it is difficult to answer any question.</p></speech>

I was struck by the fact the fact that 76,000 km of fibre will be required.  It is an amazing figure.  If the ESB were to be involved and put that volume of cable in place, how much disruption would there be for its customers?</p></speech>

Our intention is that no customer would suffer more than two day outages.  We would approach it in many ways like electrification was approached in many rural locations.  We would make it a kind of community event, indicating what was being done was for the community.  I refer to the provision of an essential service a community does not have.  We felt we would get the support of the local people but we would have to work very closely with them on issues such as that raised.  We are used to dealing with people during outages, however, and we accommodate people who cannot deal with an outage.  There could be a wedding, christening or Holy Communion.  We try to accommodate such customers as much as we can.  In general, we will try to do it as quickly as we can and minimise the outages for the customers.</p></speech>

The first thing we did was redesign entirely.  As part of that, we considered the option of using the Eir infrastructure with the information we had, which was based on estimations from certain towns.  It is not off the shelf.  We had a number of interventions with Eir.  SIRO had these over two or three months but the information was not forthcoming at that point.  We also engaged with ComReg and the Department to push it along.  We got to a point where we were not getting sufficient engagement to properly consider the matter in any revised proposal.</p></speech>

Naturally, as the Senator will appreciate, there are Chinese walls between different parts of the organisation.

There was a joint team involving ESB, SIRO and Vodafone.  We had a team of more than 75 for most of 2016 and the period going into 2017.  We had a cost sharing mechanism involving both parties.  The costs are commercially sensitive.  There was extensive work done from the beginning of 2015 through to mid-2017 on the process.  We ended up mapping every house in the country.</p></speech>

Is the ESB happy not to be involved in the project, taking into consideration the challenges Mr. O'Leary mentioned, such as the number of homes to be brought on board, the 70% renewables target and everything else required under the new regulations coming down the line owing to climate change?</p></speech>

Due to the shareholders' interests in SIRO, we are not totally divorced from the telecommunications business in Ireland.  SIRO continues to grow and to be more relevant to the people whom it is serving, especially now that we have launched a gigabit project, to which we can see the reaction of customers.  We have a telecoms business that will grow and prosper.  It is a comfort to be no longer involved in the national broadband plan.  That is important to board shareholders.  I cannot speak to Vodafone's work programme but I know from talking to the managers in Vodafone that it has an extremely challenging programme in front of it, as do most telecoms operators.  While the ESB has a challenging work programme, it is also an exciting time to be in the ESB.  There is a significant focus on decarbonising the energy sector and on the electrification of transport and heat.  We find ourselves at the centre of the key deliverables that have to be managed in the State over the next 20 to 30 years.  It is essential for the Government and State to meet their decarbonisation targets.  It is essential to the ESB to deliver its ambitious Brighter Future strategy.  We have a full book.  We are looking at the next decade to 20 years and at a challenging programme of work, not just for ESB Networks but also ESB generation and our consultancy and engineering wings.  If the national broadband plan came in on top of that, it would probably not be possible to deliver everything and we would have to look at the priorities at that point.  That we still have SIRO and are interested in growing it means that our involvement in the telecoms market continues.</p></speech>

At all times, I found the Department to be very good to deal with.  It was open, co-operative and approached matters professionally.  It provided all the information to the bidder but its interest was in protecting the State.  One could say that it was the right approach.  In the engagement we had with it, even up to the end, when we were looking for changes to the contract and it was unwilling to accommodate us, the relationship between SIRO, the ESB, Vodafone and the Department throughout the two year period was constructive and good.</p></speech>

Members of the public are entitled to know exactly what was going on behind the scenes.  There is a feeling that there was some sort of preference for the Granahan McCourt approach.  It was so influential that it persuaded the Government to potentially award it a contract when it does not own any fibre or a single pole.  That is extraordinary.  We have a semi-State company with a proven track record which has accounts in every house in Ireland.  It would be simple to extend the accounting system to fibre.  It would be within ESB's ability to do that.  When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I was in Kuala Lumpur with ESB International.  The ESB went to Malaysia and the Middle East and secured fantastic contracts, employing over 750 people who were top technicians.  I was very impressed by the ESB's work there.  It implemented an account system in Malaysia for its government, yet here, in the ESB's own country, as a semi-State company, it could not come to some terms to ensure that it secured a contract as lucrative as the roll-out of broadband.  In the end, if the ESB made money from it, the dividend would come back to the State.  From my perspective, it was a win-win scenario.  The current proposal, costing up to &euro;3 billion, is a lose-lose scenario because Granahan McCourt will own all the infrastructure in 25 years and the State will not own anything.  We do not know the cost per individual or the cost of the subsidy.  I am lucky that I have privilege here, which is brilliant.  I have far more faith in the ESB to do a job on behalf of the State than I would have in American venture capitalists coming in to do it.  I do not know how Granahan McCourt will install the wires without working with the ESB or Eir.  It has no physical structure.  Why would the ESB walk away in September 2017, even when it is making substantial investments and making money all over the world?  That decision surprises me and I cannot understand it.</p></speech>

The ESB found itself in a position, following Eir's decision to commercially connect and run high-speed broadband to 300,000 homes, that the risk profile and structure of the contract had changed entirely.  As I said earlier, I am not suggesting that there was anything wrong in what Eir did.  It was perfectly entitled to do it but it had a dramatic impact on the potential revenues for the business.  That, with some other issues in the contract, meant that the shareholders of the ESB and Vodafone were no longer willing to continue to fund the team that was putting together the bid.  That is why a decision was taken to withdraw.</p></speech>

At that time, Telecom &Eacute;ireann was under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I tried to suggest that it use the ESB network to bring wires to rural areas.  That was turned down due to being technically not possible.  How did it become technically possible to put fibre-optic cables on to poles and bring them to rural areas when it was not possible to do so with telephone wires in 1982?</p></speech>

There was a significant risk that it would interfere with the network and create potential risks, which could possibly go into somebody's house.  The two had to be separated.

It becomes much safer.  That is why the ESB, as with other companies, considered using fibre on its infrastructure.  We have been doing that successfully for 20 years.</p> <p>  With regard to the Senator's previous comment on the process, the Department went to great lengths, which I give it credit for, to ensure that there was a proper process from the start.  This ensured that only competent bidders with the technical and commercial capability to deliver on the end project got through the pre-qualification process.  Things might have changed for us but the Department followed that process from the start, in December 2015, until today.</p></speech>

I felt at the time that if the wires were adequately insulated, they would not conduct and would not have access to electricity.  He makes a good point that fibre optics do not do that.  I live in a rural area.  We have quite a good service for our house provided by a company called Imagine.  It is adequate for our current needs.</p><p>I would prefer to have the ESB bring the fibre optic cable into my house directly rather than using radio signals.  It is a tragedy that the Electricity Supply Board, our company, is not carrying out this work.  I hope somebody in the Government will have the sense to quickly consider the matter again.</p></speech>

I thank the delegation as this has been a very clear-headed and lucid presentation that has gone a long way towards helping my understanding of the matter, and particularly the timelines.  It was a very good idea to give us the timelines in respect of the company's involvement with the national broadband plan.  There is a very clear message from the witnesses that it was two years ago and they are talking about the future.  It is a very unambiguous message.</p> <p>  Having said that, I might detain the witnesses a while longer to help my understanding of the engagement with the Department up to the point in September 2017 when SIRO withdrew from the process.  I am trying to imagine myself in the room where SIRO is engaging with the Department after the mapping exercise has been done and there is a revised intervention area.  How did it come about that the company decided it was out and finished with the process?  Is it because, as the witnesses stated earlier, the revenue reduction was such that it would just make it untenable?  Was there any profit or return on investment where it could be said that even with the 542,000 premises in the amber area, the company could still persevere with the process?  I may not be putting it across very clearly but what would it have taken for SIRO to have stayed in the game?  That is the kernel of my question.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Leary has stated "it would also have led to a much bigger reduction in revenue and thus our overall potential target revenues were significantly reduced also".  He also outlined the Mitchelstown example, which is fairly close to home for me, and the doughnut effect.  At what point did the company say "that is it, we are gone".  There was engagement and the witnesses have said it was a positive engagement with the Department.  The company had just seen 300,000 connections being taken up by another entity so what would it have made this commercially viable for the company?  I still cannot fully grapple that.  Personally, I found it a pity that SIRO pulled out because of its international reputation, which was mentioned earlier, and the ability to get projects done in a very seamless and quick fashion.  That is why there was a certain amount of disappointment.</p></speech>

I suppose we were looking for everything to change and there was a list of things we would have liked to have seen happening.  The Department reminded us we were in the middle of a procurement process that was open and ongoing, although due to close.  It was not really in a position to accommodate the list of requests that we had that we felt were reasonable.</p></speech>

There was not any one thing.  There is no doubt the change in the intervention area from 850,000 to approximately 550,000 connections was very significant.  As I said, that was a commercial decision, which is fine.  With regard to the other changes, we were still trying to make a business case.  Following much discussion and being advised by the Department that it could go a bit of the way but not the whole way, the shareholders made a decision.  We had been at the process for two years and it was not looking like we would get to a position where a business case could be supported by both shareholders.  The costs that were being incurred in staying with the process were not insignificant and they continued to grow.  A company will bear those costs if it sees something positive on the horizon but when they are mounting up and things are getting more challenging, a decision will be taken.  We decided not to go any further.</p></speech>

It was a large team spending much time and effort, including personal time and effort, committing to the project and trying to make it work.  One gets to a point, as Mr. O'Leary notes, that it just does not stack up.  The Mitchelstown case is a perfect example of the challenges.  There is not just one example like Mitchelstown; there are 800 of them around Ireland.  We engaged in the process and had great discussions with the Department but we were looking for one thing, and regardless of whether other bidders were seeking it as well, the Department had to maintain a particular line.  In fairness, it was very clear in that respect.  There were other issues that were worked through with us that were probably of interest to all bidders.  It was a very fair process.</p></speech>

The tender process was designed to deliver X number but the numbers changed.  They were reduced because of the actions of another entity.  I would have thought there was a clear justification for all bidders to sit down at that juncture with the Department and say that the process had changed.  The terms of the other parties may have been reasonable because of those material changes.  I cannot reconcile the justification of the Department in saying that parties are in the middle of a tender process and there are restrictions in what can be said, etc.</p><p>I will refer to the current roll-out of services from SIRO.  There were 242,000 homes passed and by virtue of this, there is potential for them to be enabled.</p></speech>

When we looked at this three years ago, we were looking at a totally different landscape from what we are looking at now.  We have to do a bit of thinking about it.

If my constituent is supposedly encapsulated within the 300,000 connections to be provided by Eir but is in the last house on the link and is waiting for months on end or put on the never-never, is there potential for him or her to be included in the 450,000 connections that SIRO envisages?</p></speech>

If he or she is a next door neighbour of the last person we served in phase 1, it is highly probable that he or she is a SIRO customer.  Unfortunately, if he or she is 3 km or 4 km away from the last customer we served in phase 1, he or she will not be the type of customer to whom SIRO will go.  It will go to a customer who is more suitable to be included in one of the intervention areas under the national broadband plan.  That was the purpose of the plan.</p></speech>

The ESB doing this has been mentioned a lot.  These are all hypothetical questions, but, for the purposes of clarity, if we were to roll out a contract such as this again and it was to be given to the ESB - we know what the issues are with state aid rules - will Mr. O'Leary clarify that a new procurement process would have to be gone through?  Does he have an idea of what the timeframe would be for the process?  In general, how long would it take?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019062600002#L00300"><p>It is really difficult to answer that question.  It is more a question for the Department.  Anything to do with state aid is managed 100% by it.  The ESB would have no involvement in it whatsoever.  It is about the State getting clearance to make an intervention for a particular reason.  I am not an expert when it comes to state aid, but I know that it is a very time-consuming process.  We would then have to get into a procurement process which would also add time, as would appointing contractors.  Time would be be added all the time before we would reach a period in which the infrastructure could be built.  Without knowing the first timeline which would be the difficult one, it is very difficult to answer the question.</p></speech>

I will just make a few opening introductory comments.</p> <p>  The national oral health policy was approved by the Government in March 2019, so it is now Government policy.  The chief dental officer, Dr. Kavanagh, led the development of the policy over a period and will set out for members the ethos, principal features, key plans and actions in it.  The policy is quite wide-ranging and takes an intersectoral approach as well as being consistent with the primary care philosophy of prevention, treatment at the lowest level of complexity and recourse to specialist care where this is clinically appropriate.  This work is the culmination of a comprehensive programme of research, analysis and consultation over a number of years and, over time, we will update models of care and service delivery that have been with us for 25 years or more.</p> <p>  The policy is not only aligned with international models of good practice but with the ideals and approach in other healthcare policy areas, such as Sl&aacute;intecare and Healthy Ireland.  It is important to say that it does not seek to change all aspects of service delivery overnight, but it puts in place the framework for real and substantive change on a phased basis.  As with any area of public service provision, implementation will need to be planned and managed in consultation with all interested parties, particularly the dental profession, as well as all those who use and depend on the services.</p><p>It might benefit the committee to know that in the development of the policy and the planning for implementation, the Department and the Minister are fully appreciative of the professional contribution made by the dental profession; namely, those in the salaried services of the HSE, contracted providers in private practice and those in specialist services.</p><p> I will now hand over to Dr. Kavanagh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Dympna Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#D00200"><p>Thank you, Chair, for inviting me here today to outline the key aspects of the national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which was launched in April this year by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  As Mr. Fergal Goodman said, it is a comprehensive and evidence-based policy informed by extensive research and consultation.  Its aim is to better facilitate oral health for everyone and to support continued professional development.  The programme is transformative, introducing and managing a series of changes over eight years.  The policy is aligned with other Government policies, including Sl&aacute;intecare, Healthy Ireland and First 5, which is a whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and families, as well as the national strategies on disability and mental health.  It conforms to the international policies of the WHO and the European Union.  The policy embraces the "no child is left behind" principle of First 5 and the education policies.</p> <p>  This is the first major oral health policy statement in 25 years and much has changed in Ireland in that period, including the standard of general and oral health, the materials and technology used in dentistry, and the types of services we aim to provide.  In developing the policy, we have ensured that it is supported by up-to-date information about the oral health of the population, as well as by appropriate international evidence.  A broad range of stakeholders was consulted, including those who use the services and those providing the care.</p> <p>  Our current oral health system is out of step with other Irish and international health services.  There are gaps remaining in routine dental care for the very young and the vulnerable, including people in residential care, people with disabilities and older people.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte reorients how care is provided in line with Sl&aacute;intecare so that most dental care is provided in people's own communities, as close as possible to where they live.  This is beneficial for service users and allows acute services to focus on more complex care.  What is described in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte is not a demand-led service.  Instead, it enables the Irish public to access services and forge a relationship with their chosen dental practice; we call this their "dental home".</p> <p>  To support this universal primary care approach, a safety net system will identify those who do not or cannot attend their local dentist.  This safety net system is part of the surveillance system outlined in the policy and ensures that the most vulnerable children and adults, including those on lower incomes, will be supported and receive the same quality of service as the rest of the population.  The existing public dental service will be stronger.  A key service will be to identify, support and deliver care for vulnerable children and adults when it cannot be provided in the local dental practice.</p> <p>  The measures set out in the policy will provide professional opportunities for staff in areas such as health promotion, special care services and public health.</p> <p>  I will pick out some of the key policy strategies and proposals, which members have in front of them.  Water fluoridation is one key reason we have such good oral health in Ireland and will remain a cornerstone of oral health policy.  Health promotion programmes will be put in place for the whole population and to target the most vulnerable.  Most children and eligible adults will be treated in local dental practices and a package for children from birth until the age of 16 will, in a phased way, replace the existing schools programme.  It is the first time that those under the age of 6, teenagers and adults will have lifetime access to preventive treatment such as fissure sealants and fluoride varnishes, as well as access to dietary advice in dental practices.  The expansion of primary care is proposed from birth until old age, across the whole life course.  We have focused on improving access for vulnerable groups such as those on low incomes, rural dwellers and people with disabilities.  Enabling them to get to local dental practices is key.  As I mentioned, the safety net service is essential to ensure that their needs are addressed and they get comprehensive care.  We must not forget that we need advanced care and specialist care services, and that includes the concerns around general dental anaesthesia.  Monitoring systems will have to be put in place to identify people who are not taking up the services, overall dental needs and the policy's impact.  There must be a full review of dental undergraduate education, in tandem with career-long professional mentoring for dentists.</p> <p>  I will talk briefly about the development of the policy.  As mentioned, it was informed by oral healthcare professionals through a series of working groups and consultations.  We are indebted to the Oral Health Policy Academic Reference Group, and we drew expertise from Irish universities in this regard.  These experts assess current needs and how best to meet them.  In addition, we had an external international independent panel made up of leaders in different aspects of policy development.  From this, recommendations and research from the reference group were quality assured in line with international standards.  All research undertaken, including the additional facts study analysis, was robust, representative, ethically compliant and externally quality assured.</p> <p>  At the start of policy development in 2014, and again in 2016, more than 5,000 letters were sent from the Department of Health to the whole profession inviting all dental registrants to comment and engage in policy.  A stakeholder day was held, with more than 70 attendees from 16 representative organisations.  There was one-to-one engagement with dental practitioners in independent practice and with those in the public dental service.  Their views overall highlighted an appetite for change in oral healthcare services but emphasised the challenges of such a change.  The Dental Council of Ireland training bodies, including the RCSI and the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, were also consulted and given a draft document.  These engagements informed the direction of policy in key aspects of service provision and training for professionals.</p> <p>  I have outlined the key findings from both the public and from dentists.  I will mention a few points arising from the public point of view.  The public indicated that the current system is complex and very difficult to navigate and they were worried about cost, particularly in relation to children's care.  Young children rarely attend the dentist before six years of age.  Of concern to us is that over the age of 55, there is a decline in quality of life, which sharply declines beyond 70 and into a person's later years.  Overall, all age groups and social classes perceived that their main access to care is via their general dental practice.  </p> <p>  Stakeholders and practitioners insisted that very early childhood care is needed and also want special care services for the vulnerable.  They expressed frustration with bureaucracy, barriers to accessing care for patients and an outdated State payment system.  There is a need for a greater emphasis on primary care in the profession to bring it forward.  Those in the public dental service emphasised the need for prevention and for opportunities to expand their skills.  The information from the consultations fundamentally changed the direction of a lot of our policies.  Leadership roles in primary care to refocus the profession and facilitate leadership from within it is a key action being called for by dentists.  The policy also includes very early intervention for children, to give them the best start, and the need for comprehensive support for the most vulnerable through specific support services within the reoriented PDS.</p> <p>  Along with the policy action, a career-long mentoring framework will be put in place, as exists for other professions such as social work and psychology.  Undergraduate and graduate education is the first priority within the policy, with an emphasis on training and primary care.  </p> <p>  The policy includes a review of dental technology and clinical dental technology training.  This was a key issue that arose from the public, regarding the needs of those in residential services, and from dentists, regarding the need to maintain a workforce in this direction in relation to dentures and prosthetics for those with total tooth loss.</p> <p>  The committee will be particularly interested in implementation, which is where all the action is.  We have shared with members an overview document showing 41 actions and the priority for each of those over the next eight years.  The implementation period is needed to commit actively to engagement on significant and complex issues.  First, we need to build a framework to support long-term sustainability, the education review, a mentoring framework and a focus on legislative issues.</p><p>The Department has already begun to discuss the priorities with key agencies and we are agreeing targets and timescales.  As an example, action 29 in the policy, which is a priority, is the national plan for amalgam phase-down on which we worked closely with our colleagues in the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment and key stakeholders.  It is being finalised in line with Ireland&rsquo;s EU legislative obligations to publish on 1 July and submit to the EU in August.</p><p> I mentioned the full review of undergraduate training which, along with graduate mentoring programmes and upskilling for graduate dentists, are key immediate actions.  The Dental Council, through the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry, will lead in developing the advanced centres of care framework for specialists.  We are convening in July to commence this work.</p><p> For the First 5 strategy, the Department of Children is working with the Department of Health to support the framework for the under sixes policy in programmes of health promotion and services.  We have already met the Clinical Dental Technicians Association and we have its support to assess dental technology training.</p><p> Water fluoridation remains and we continue to review it and we will link with the expert body on fluorides and health.</p><p> The HSE has two main service focuses.  Epidemiology data indicate that those in residential settings require urgent attention and support.  The reorientated public dental service and community oral health care services will identify their needs and put in place a treatment programme for those who cannot use primary care.  The second priority is that the very young, up to six years of age, receive packages of preventative and primary care.  This is in line with Healthy Ireland and the First 5 strategy.  It will also give the public dental service an opportunity to release capacity.</p><p> Implementation of a transformative policy such as Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte will present challenges.  All change is challenging.  However, those challenges will present opportunities for the staff in private practice and the public dental service.  It is important that implementation is owned by the profession while listening to the voice of the public.  To achieve these priorities, we need key leadership roles operationally and in dental schools.  Primary care, special care, advanced or specialist care delivery and public health leaders must be in place so that implementation is sustainable and placed where it belongs in the services.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to outline the national policy.  We look forward to working with our colleagues in the HSE services, professionals and key stakeholders to implement this change.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Dr. Jacinta McLoughlin, a specialist in dental public health, and Dr. Alison Dougall, a consultant who treats patients with serious illnesses and disabilities.  We are here on behalf of the reference group whose chairman, Professor O'Mullane, has submitted a letter that addresses a number of specific points raised about the group&rsquo;s work.</p> <p>  The reference group was established to help provide the Department of Health with the best independent evidence that could be used to improve oral health in Ireland.  It is a broad group with a range of backgrounds and disciplines relevant to policy development.  Like all dental professionals, and indeed members of the public, we are acutely aware of the shortcomings of current dental services in Ireland.  There remains huge inequality in oral health, especially among vulnerable groups and those living in rural areas.  We see parents of children with disabilities who are often desperate to access appropriate care.  Far too many young children turn up at hospitals needing emergency extractions, and those who are frail, living with dementia or in residential care often find their oral health completely neglected.  The training pathways needed to sustain oral health services have not been developed or, in some cases, have been dismantled. </p> <p>  The committee should also know that most dental disease is preventable.  Dental decay and gum disease, which are the main reasons for tooth loss, pain and infection, are two of the most common diseases worldwide but preventing these diseases, and oral cancer, is possible to a large degree with simple primary care measures.</p> <p>  The reference group proposed principles that might frame an oral health policy.  Members will have seen some of these in the final Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte document.  There is the common risk factor approach, which recognises that some of the same factors are involved in oral and other diseases, so controlling these risk factors can have a big impact on health.  For example, high sugar intake is the main cause of tooth decay but is also implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes.  Reducing sugar intake should, therefore, be the business of the whole primary health care team, including dentists.  Importantly, the provision of a service such as dental treatment must be surrounded by broader public health policies to make a real difference.  The life course approach means that individuals need access to different services throughout life and depending on their circumstances.  However, at all ages our population should have a home in a dental practice setting that is focused on prevention and empowering them to maintain their oral health and independence.  As part of Sl&aacute;intecare, oral health care must be available to all who need it, regardless of income, location and disability.  These are just a few examples of policy recommendations that have been included in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which will be crucial to transform oral health in Ireland.  The principles are not only well established in Government policy, but are also contained in recommendations from internationally recognised professional bodies.</p> <p>  Those of us who want to provide appropriate care for patients know that an oral health policy will accomplish nothing without determined and sustained implementation.  Continuing with current services will not improve the oral health of the population and will exacerbate inequalities.  Available evidence is strongly supportive of change.  It is vital to build confidence in the public and in dental professionals that we will be supported in our roles.  Most of the population can be readily treated in a practice setting and a strong primary care system reduces the need for more complex interventions.  Nonetheless, primary care providers cannot be asked to take responsibility for patients unless they know there is access to backup and specialist care when needed, as outlined in the policy&rsquo;s advanced centres of care.  It is also essential that we monitor progress as we proceed, to make sure we are achieving the goals of the policy for all people.  The evaluation and research parts of the policy are critical to a successful outcome, as emphasised already in the Healthy Ireland framework.  All of these issues have been recognised in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte and we welcome the publication of priority actions to be addressed in the coming years.</p> <p>  We would like to highlight the need to develop a workforce that is fit to deliver the best oral health care across disciplines to the greatest number of people, as stated clearly in Sl&aacute;intecare and described in the oral health policy.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte proposes a review of dental education and the development of primary care leadership throughout the dental schools and, I hope, the HSE to ensure that dentists will be central pillars of the primary health care team.  This may include extending education in a mentored environment to encompass broad community experience, inter-professional teamwork and general practice skills.  The oral health policy provides for ongoing access to retraining through a skills match programme, so the dental team can keep abreast of changes in the population, disease patterns and technology.  In order to support patients and practitioners, specialist and academic training must be put back on a firmer footing within the established medical model.  As the policy has stated, it is also time to look at the scope of practice of the whole dental team so the population has the greatest possible access to good quality care.</p> <p>  My colleagues and I have the privilege of working not only with students but all members of the dental team at all stages of their careers.  I assure the committee that in this country we have a talented and dedicated workforce whose skills are recognised everywhere.  I am confident they are capable of meeting any challenge they embrace.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the vast majority of members of the public believe they ring up the local dentist if they have a problem and they attend and pay accordingly.  To whom is the public dental system available?  Is it medical card holders only?  Is it the general public, even if most of them are not aware that the service is available to them?  Does the future strategy involve a roll-out of public services or will it include the dental practices in every town and some villages throughout the country?  I did not pick up from the statements exactly how existing dental practices will feed into the new strategy.</p></speech>

If I understood him correctly, the Deputy's first question was if the public is aware of current public system entitlements?  The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, and marketing research with the public through Am&aacute;rach found that the public did not have an understanding of their entitlements or what was available to them.  Those involved in TILDA might want to pick up on that issue.  In terms of the current arrangement in the public dental service for children, ideally pupils are seen at second, fourth and sixth class level although in general it appears that second and sixth class are the main focus.  Emergency services are provided beyond that, and disability services as well.</p></speech>

If it arises as an emergency outside of classes they get emergency treatment but they do not get additional primary care.  They do not get a full check up or added on primary care.</p> <p>  For the adult service, there are two separate schemes: the dental treatment services scheme, which is for medical card holders; and the dental treatment benefit scheme, which is operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  As I said, they are two separate schemes: one is a health scheme and the other is a social protection scheme.</p></speech>

We would estimate that approximately 10% of people take-up private care.  On top of that, there is a mixture of public and private care in that people do not rely only on public care.  The Deputy may be aware that the vast majority of care is paid for from the public purse.</p></speech>

We are taking the first step by focusing on people who are currently eligible.  It was launched by the Departments of Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which are working together to ensure both sectors receive the same services.  In terms of medical card holders and those on the welfare side, the intention is to bring the two populations together in terms of service provision.  This will be a huge majority of the population.  Ultimately, the ambition in terms of the roll-out of Sl&aacute;intecare is this would be the first step towards universal care, but not immediately.</p></speech>

There are a lot of schemes in being at the moment, a mixed public-private system to which the Deputy alluded not only in dental care but in other services in the community and in the hospital system as well in respect of which we have a variety of arrangements.  One of the core objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare is to take a stand back from that, to do the analysis and come up with sustainable options for consideration.  That is a sizeable job of work.  This will inform what will happen in oral health services as well, because they will have to be included in that consideration.</p></speech>

It was considerably successful.  In response to the second letter, we received 256 responses.  We also got a number of responses from professional organisations, including the Irish Society for Periodontology, the Irish Society for Disability and Oral Health, the Irish Dental Hygienist Association and others.  As I said, 256 general practitioners responded.</p></speech>

It responded in writing that it was declining to submit its responses.  We had briefings and engagements with the association, as outlined.  We met it specifically on the policy and we will meet it again on other issues.  On the policy specifically, we met the association in 2018 and 2019, where we gave it a comprehensive briefing of the policy and an overview of the ethos.  From our records, I do not think there was anything left out.  We then met it again in 2019 before the policy was launched.  I also had one-to-one engagement with the former president to discuss issues.</p></speech>

It claims that the new policy will make dental health worse instead of better.  There is an element of clarification or relationship building required.  What is being fed into the political system by the Irish Dental Association is that it is not overly impressed with the consultation process on this strategy.  I am not sure if Dr. Kavanagh is aware of it but the Irish Dental Association is telling us that it was not properly consulted.  Whether that is factual, I do not know but it is out there in ether.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Donnelly, has tabled a number of parliamentary questions on waiting lists, the responses to which are complex.  On the final page of one response, it is stated that the number of people on the treatment waiting for less than two years is just over 10,000.  The number for those waiting two to four years is 7,133 and for those waiting greater than four years is 1,316, which is a total of 18,400, which is a substantial number of people.  How is it planned to tackle this backlog?</p></speech>

We are currently treating under 18,000 and there are 18,000 on the waiting list, as the Deputy said.  There are currently working with us, on a whole-time equivalent basis, 13 consultant orthodontists, 45 orthodontic specialists and 64 dental nurses, in our regional orthodontic services.  We acknowledge that those who are being treated currently are the most severe and the highest risk.  That is the basis on which we are treating people.  I will ask Dr. Joe Green to comment on what arrangements are in place in terms of prioritising treatment.</p></speech>

In response to the long waiters in particular, in 2016 the HSE initiated a procurement process.  Currently, there 1,489 patients being treated through that process.  We are hoping to extend that process later this year or early next year funding permitting.</p></speech>

The are other options, assuming the criteria are retained.</p><p>There is a threshold, as Mr. Healy stated.  The HSE provides orthodontic treatment for the most severe and complex cases.  An assessment system is in place through which a decision is made in respect of each child referred from the dental service.  We are considering initiatives to increase capacity of the regional orthodontic departments through an expansion of the number of specialists and the possible introduction of the grade of orthodontic therapist to the HSE.  Orthodontic therapists are important members of the dental team who work directly with specialist and consultant orthodontists.  It will allow us to increase quickly the capacity of the service.  We are currently in discussions about that and we hope to introduce the grade in the regional orthodontic service next year.  There is work to be done.</p></speech>

Apart from the issue of dental health and concern, there is a significant psychological attachment for young people, given that they are often image conscious.  It is not only about healthy teeth but also about one's well-being.  When assessing the urgency of a case, it needs to be taken into consideration, although I am sure it has been, that young people are far more conscious of their self-image than they were in the past.</p></speech>

We held a stakeholder day, which was attended by 16 of the 22 representative organisations that were invited.  The association sent three or four representatives, who led the round-table discussions.  In addition, I outlined the briefing we gave them and I understand they have spoken about it as being a meaningful consultation.  I hope I have outlined how much attention we paid to the consultation and how much we took on board in respect of policy.</p> <p>  We also carried out a year-long structured engagement for dentists and salaried services.  There were intensive structured interviews and the engagement was analysed by the University of Sheffield.  Many of those who participated were Irish Dental Association members.</p></speech>

We considered all of them and one will find a great deal of crossover between the consistent recommendations of bodies such as the Irish Dental Association and what is in the policy.  Such recommendations are not especially controversial.  For example, children should be seen much earlier in order that problems can be prevented before they end up in hospital with acute emergencies.  These are the policy and recommendations the Irish Dental Association and every other professional organisation have published.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, on the policy, there is significant agreement on most of the areas.  I speak to dentists every day.  Their concerns are largely about the implementation of the policy rather than the policy itself.  They ask whether there will be enough funding for it, whether the entire policy will be implemented and so on.  I can certainly understand those concerns, as can most of us who work in the system, given that we do not always have a great track record of funding everything properly and ensuring that all parts of it work.  Ultimately, dentists, like any health professionals, want to deliver a service for the population but want to do so in a safe, sustainable way.  If they start to take care of a new group of patients such as children or people with disabilities, they need back-up.  If it is 4.30 p.m. on a Friday and somebody appears at a surgery with a problem, there needs to be someone who can be called and who can see the patient if it is an emergency.</p> <p>  Those are the main kinds of concerns that underpin much of what I have heard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alison Dougall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#G01100"><p>I am a special care dentist.  I started work in general practice and moved to the equivalent of the public dental service, developing a special interest in the treatment of people with disabilities.  I undertook considerable training and now provide care for people with complex disabilities.  As well as perusing the evidence, we consulted extensively professionals working in the field and, along with our medical colleagues, people with disabilities.  I draw the committee's attention to an excellent document published in 2005 that brought together the viewpoints of people working in the field, such as people from the HSE and the National Disability Authority, who were all in agreement that the key to managing the problem for people with disabilities was mainstreaming their oral health.  There was wide agreement in that regard.<br/><br/>The availability of appropriate care is <i>ad hoc</i>.  People with disabilities are grossly underserved, they experience high levels of unmet need, along with reduced treatment options even when they are able to access care, and their outcomes are poorer.  A recent study from IDS-TILDA showed that people with intellectual disabilities who live into older age are twice as likely to have lost all their teeth.  More importantly, they are 12 times more likely not to wear dentures, not to mention bridges or crowns, to replace their teeth, ensure their dignity and allow them to chew a healthy diet.<br/><br/>There is agreement among the profession that such inequality is unjust, unfair and unnecessary.  Most people from vulnerable groups have needs that can be met with small, reasonable adjustments in primary care.  As was noted in the consultation, we must be mindful that when the public service fails to meet such people's needs, the fact that they have been affected by social inequality and had less access to education or well-paid jobs means that their ability to pay for alternatives will be greatly reduced.  From the literature, we know that only between 8% and 10% of people with disabilities require specialist care.  Where that care is required, however, it needs to be produced by well trained staff with access to adjuncts such as general anaesthesia and sedation and who are well informed on consent, ethics and working with teams in social care.  It is clear that people with disabilities want availability of care in mainstream services.</p><p>It is what they have asked for and there are great models to showcase this working very well.  However, what is required by people with disabilities, long-term conditions and frail older people is well-signposted pathways to services in a timely fashion as for many of these people, the only way they can receive basic care is with general anesthesia, sedation or experts.  The oral health policy and the consultation that we have gone through provides the structure and opportunity to address the frank inequalities that we see right from early intervention in childhood to frail older age.  For the first time targeted, preventive packages in primary care and establishment of these community-based services is really important.</p><p> Evidence shows that educating the general dental workforce and exposing them to diversity in their training gives them the skills and knowledge to manage most people with disabilities.  The training of the workforce, supported by specialists, is really important.  We cannot expect our primary care providers to accept people with complexities into their workforce without a very well structured framework and pathways to support them, for the few patients for whom it is beyond their scope.</p></speech>

Its representatives appeared before the committee and were very clear.  Their considered view was that the association was not consulted, that there was no meaningful consultation, and they do not see their views or position reflected in any of the documentation.  I struggle to understand how we can have two people in for two different sessions who can have such completely divergent views of the same process.  Dr. Dougall calls what happened detailed consultation, while the Irish Dental Association is certainly not of that view.  There appears to have been some meetings but the Irish Dental Association says that it cannot see its views in the policy.  It is the body which represents the profession.  Maybe we will never get to the bottom of it but it is worth noting that it was very strong in its view that there had not been meaningful engagement.  We could detail all the meetings - we could have 100 meetings here and maybe it could be that I did not listen or the witnesses did not speak.  It is a difficulty and I hope that the partnership can be rebuilt.  The two views contradict and I do not know if we can square the circle.  In the absence of a time machine it cannot be fixed but it is important that the relationship is re-established.  I am not necessarily asking the witnesses to accept that the relationship has broken down or put words in their mouths but it is difficult for us as we have heard two divergent views of the same process.  I find it curious that two groups of professionals could be involved in a dialogue the end result of which is that one group is firm that it was not consulted and the other is firm that it was.  </p> <p>  Something that was not in the submission, or if it was I missed it, was the audit of orthodontic services carried out in 2015.  This was reported in the press.  There have been calls for this to be published.  I think I read that the position of the HSE and Department of Health was that this was just a scoping exercise and there is no need to publish it but can Mr. Healy explain why it was not published?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#H00300"><p>I checked with my colleague, the head of operations on the community side, in whose area this falls, before the meeting.  I am advised that, as the Deputy said, the report or scoping exercise was one part of a process which advised the HSE on the actions it should take in determining the range of risk or if there was harm etc., in relation to particular cases.  That has led to an audit and a particular clinical review which is currently under way and nearing completion.  When that is complete, a serious incident management team will look at the outcome and determine the best course of action.  The important thing is that the clinical review and audit is actioned and any action is followed up.  My colleague, Dr. Breen, can provide any other detail the Deputy might need.</p></speech>

It does not seem outrageous to me that this be published.  We have just been through the Scally inquiry, for instance, which was a scoping inquiry.  Its terms of reference were very public.  The scoping inquiry itself was very public as were its recommendations, which were first shared with the people affected - or maybe not in all cases, which we will not dwell on, but that was the intention - and then put in the public domain.  Mr. Healy will understand that there is some concern because there seems to be some secrecy surrounding the report which has caused people to wonder what is in the report.  The attitude seems to be one of "Ah, there is not much in it," but if that is the case, why not just publish it?</p></speech>

The health committee, under a previous Government, held meetings on this.  I believe it was in 2005.  Two experts from the UK looked at the evidence and those two experts have called for their review to be published.  They completed it in 2015 but it has not been published.  That is the issue.  Myself and other Deputies have been approached on this and have all asked parliamentary questions.  The answer we receive is that the review is ongoing but the review that the two specialists from the UK completed in 2015 has not been published.</p></speech>

We may have to agree that is as it is but, as we move to implement the policy undoubtedly it will require a high level of engagement with the IDA in its representative role of the external providers and as the union for salaried staff in the HSE.  Mr. Healy and I, as the Chairman may be aware, recently were involved in a process in respect of general practitioners and despite much toing and froing, tension and differing perspectives, as the end of it we came out with an agreement.  That is what we will also be aiming to do with the reform of dental services.  Mr. Healy might want to amplify that, as he has been involved in many significant change programmes in the HSE.</p></speech>

As a number of Deputies mentioned, concerns have been identified by the IDA.  As we progress towards implementation, we are clear that we and the Department, collectively, will have to be engaged in a comprehensive consultation process with all the stakeholders involved in it, whether it be providers, our staff, patient groups or other interests.  The Deputy can be assured there will be a comprehensive process of engagement.  If there are bridges to be built we will try to use that process to arrive at a shared understanding of where we need to go and we will address the concerns identified.  I carefully read the IDA's submission and while it identified a range of concerns, it also identified four or five positive areas where there is common ground.  Those are areas on which we can build and concerns we can address as we proceed.</p></speech>

The first one concerns the existing number of clinics.  I will put my cards on the table.  This policy and announcement sound like further privatisation of the service, which is contrary to what is recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which places heavy emphasis on public provision.  That is the perspective from which I am approaching this.</p> <p>  What is the number of HSE dental clinics currently in existence?  Under the new model, how many of those will be closed, or will they remain open but will do different work?  What will the HSE clinics look like under the new model?  Essentially, how many of them are there and what will happen to them?</p></speech>

We set out in the report we provided the detail of all the services.  It also references the clinics.  A  significant number of staff, numbering 657 whole-time equivalents, currently work in the service.  I will ask Dr. Green to cover the detail of that.  It is important we emphasise that while the policy identifies a roadmap for the future, there is recognition of the good quality service currently provided by the HSE.  It is targeted and we have prioritised need towards a targeted group.  The issue of access must be addressed and under the policy we seek to do that.  It reorientates the role of the HSE service, particularly focusing on special care in terms of those with special needs, our ageing population, vulnerable groups and so on.  That is part of the implementation process in which we will be involved and we will have to work that out.</p></speech>

Nobody has a difficulty with the quality of dental care provided within the HSE, access to it is the issue.  In my simple view, expanding what the HSE is doing would improve access to what Mr. Healy has said is a good service.</p></speech>

We are relatively good at what we do within the limitations that apply and the resources allocated.  If we look to countries that have well developed services they are all moving in a different direction.  The policy builds on that and sets out a roadmap.  Will there be challenges in that respect?  There will and that is why we will have a comprehensive implementation process to work through those.  It is important we reassure our staff working in the service that there will be full engagement and consultation with them.  The policy provides for that.  I will ask Dr. Green to cover the detail of our existing clinics.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, they deal with children under 16 years of age and children and adults with special care needs.  Sadly, for many children their first interaction with a dentist is as a consequence of having pain.  We would like children to be seen at a much earlier age.  If children have pain they attend our clinics and are dealt with by a highly skilled and well motivated staff who do a very good job in difficult circumstances.</p> <p>  Many people&rsquo;s first experience of dentistry is quite difficult.  It might come as a result of pain or trauma, possible loss of sleep or the onset of infection.  No one, if he or she has symptoms, is in the best of form when he or she turns up at a dental clinic.  The staff deal with that on a daily basis.   Since the start of this meeting, probably 300 children experiencing pain have walked into dental clinics and private dental practices.  There are in excess of 70,000 attendances for emergencies in the HSE service.  That is quite a large quantum of service.  We are very proud of the efforts our staff make to look after children.  Not many of us look forward to having dental treatment.  Clinical dentistry in young children requires a highly skilled and well motivated staff together with high standards of care, which is what we strive to provide.  The same group of staff provide services for children and adults who require special care and they also provide treatment under general anaesthetic for children and adults in many of the hospitals.</p></speech>

On full implementation of the new policy direction, will some of those be closed, will they change what they do, or will they continue to do what are currently doing?  Presumably, the staff comprising 657 whole-time equivalents, as outlined by Mr. Healy, will continue to be employed.  Is it planned to expand the number of workers, will 657 remain the staff complement or is it planned to phase out some of them?</p></speech>

The policy was only published recently and the HSE's intention is to work with the Department of Health and other stakeholders to deliver an implementation plan.  The future role of HSE dental clinics will depend on the profile of services to be developed.  I envisage the existing staff will undergo quite a level of upskilling in order to provide a greater level of service for people with disabilities who require special care.  That would involve investment in skills and in facilities.</p> <p>  I cannot cite the number of clinics that will be in existence in five to ten years because they change from time to time in order to build better facilities but I can say we will be investing in staff.  There is quite a lengthy transition period under the plan.  We will be providing our existing service at all times with the priorities of care currently in place.  If a parent who has a child experiencing pain contacts a clinic, they will be offered an appointment the same day or the following day.  We aim to keep that service in place at all times.</p></speech>

Without putting too fine a point on it, I was correct and much of it was privatised.  At the time, I was told it would not be and it would enhance the service.  Of course, it did not.  Was there a cost-benefit analysis in terms of the investment in the public service building up from the 221 clinics, increasing staffing, delivering more through the public service versus purchasing from the private sector?  For example, we saw it happen with the home help service.  Directly employed home helps would provide the service for approximately &euro;13 to &euro;16 an hour.  Once one headed towards the private sector, one was knocking on the door of &euro;45 an hour, as well as losing control of the service and deskilling the public service.</p><p> It is not good that this would be lost.  What sort of cost-benefit analysis was done?  I appreciate that other jurisdictions may be travelling in another direction.  As my mother used to say, however, if all one&rsquo;s friends stuck their fingers in the fire, would one do it as well?  It does not necessarily make it right.</p></speech>

I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question and concern for the staff in place.  I was a principal dental surgeon when the last policy was launched and implemented.  Part of that was that the Department kindly offered us more dentist posts and it coincided with the introduction of dental hygienists.  We had great difficulty in County Meath filling those positions, however.  I had to go to Stockholm to recruit some dentists to fill those posts.</p> <p>  The problem is that, as currently set up, the HSE dental service is not attractive, particularly to new graduate dentists who would be young and enthusiastic.  Unlike in medicine, dentists graduate with a wide range of clinical skills.  In Dublin, they start treating patients doing irreversible procedures on patients in year two of a five-year programme.  They come out with an accomplished range of skills.  If one works in the salaried dental service, it does not allow one to use those skills.  In the past, there were more opportunities to use them.  When I was in the health board dental service, there were opportunities to treat adults.  For example, I did some of that kind of treatment in psychiatric hospitals.</p> <p>  Having extra positions does not necessarily solve the problem if the posts are not attractive.  Salary cuts, changes in the pension arrangements and so forth have an impact on the attractiveness.  The model of care needs to change.  This has been clearly outlined in the policy.  As Dr. Green said, there will be much support for that as people understand that if one goes to reorientate a service, one must give people the skills to deliver it.  Just offering extra posts is not going to work with the current model.  The policy proposal, accordingly, is to change the model.</p></speech>

It took four separate phases to look at it.  The first was commissioned and given to University College Cork by the reference group to look at the cost-benefit analysis of the various services.  There was much international research on salaried services.  We looked at the Scandinavian models and at introducing different types of models.  They did not involve privatisation but public contracts in local communities.  It was found that salaried services were best suited to providing services to vulnerable and special care services.  For healthy patients in primary care, it was not as effective or efficient.  There are multiple international studies in that regard.  We looked at countries which were similar and there are theoretical constructs of it.  The Dutch and Icelandic models are more similar culturally to where we are sitting and we examined those models closely.</p> <p>  The second stream looked at all insurance models internationally and what was successful and otherwise.  It just did not look at the oral health outcomes of those models.  Oral health is influenced by many other issues such as social determinism, disease and water fluoridation, and not just by the service.  It looked at the uptake and the buy-in culturally from the countries involved.  Insurance models work well in Ireland.  We saw extremely good and fast outcomes from many of those models.</p> <p>  The final phase was done by the ESRI.  It started examining various types of models such as mixed-payment models.  This involved looking at a preventive package overlaid by a fee-for-item system and further overlaid by service level agreements.  The reason we went down that model was because it was familiar to the public and it understood it more.  The outcomes from such a model are good in a short period, particularly for a preventive-oriented scheme.  It is good for the type of oral health we are experiencing at present, whereby the vast majority of children from middle to high-income families have good oral health.  Then there is the smaller group of vulnerable persons.</p> <p>  We looked at the Medicaid model in America, whereby it increased access through practices.  It found that ironically inequalities did not get worse but were much better for the high-risk and low-income groups when they got in early.  The higher income groups did not tend to use it as much but it really benefitted lower income groups.</p> <p>  We undertook four separate phases because it is a significant change for us to undertake.  We had to look at the economics.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform certainly put us through our paces in that regard.</p></speech>

As our colleagues and the HSE have outlined, it would be in a phased stage in order to release capacity in line with Sl&aacute;intecare to ensure fewer services are provided in a secondary care service.  As young children and teenagers would be taken up in local practices, this would release capacity in the HSE.  The only intention is that the HSE&rsquo;s salaried service would be stronger.  As was pointed out by Dr. McLoughlin, it would provide an opportunity for dentists to use a broad range of their skills.  We have had a significant amount of support from the disability organisations.  They are employed by the HSE in this regard.</p></speech>

Ten years ago they would have all travelled to Dublin for all of their dental care.  This led to waiting lists and decreased access.  People who had difficulty travelling needed to come from counties Mayo and Roscommon.  Over a period of four years, both by training primary care practitioners and offering shared care, where people can receive their preventive, minimal invasive care near their homes regularly, a saving of &euro;2.5 million for factor usage for dentistry in a two-year period was achieved.  Economics is not the driver.  It also showed increased access to care and less invasive surgery.  The price of having to provide complex care in a secondary stage, whether it is general anaesthetic or an integrated medical model in a tertiary or secondary care unit, is significant.</p><p>There is an ability to prevent, by working with networks of well-supported, well-trained primary care professionals in the HSE clinics or in general practice, as the patient prefers.  Patients have to have choice.  The greatest thing about this policy is giving choice to people as to where they take their preventive packages.  That has been a big factor with patients.  They want a choice and to be able to attend the same practitioner, if possible, as their families, and not to be medicalised.</p><p> There is choice but economics also is a really big factor.  We can show that in many models with medically complex patients.</p></speech>

In a packaging system, when one takes a preventive approach, it is all in one single menu.  It is not about picking and choosing and looking then for each item.  That is the beauty of it from an insurance perspective and is why we follow the insurance models.  They do not do it unless it is very easy for them to administer.  The packaging model is very simple and straightforward.  It is one package and one deal.  We are trying to put as much as we can into the routine care on fee per item package.  Some of the care should obviously be picked and selected between the dentist and the patient themselves.  We are trying to lessen that.</p> <p>  For very complex care, which we want to bring more into practice, as was highlighted in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, we may then be looking at different models.  It may remain fee per item or may remain service level agreements.  </p> <p>  Internationally, the majority of other public services use implants for retaining dentures in the care of the elderly.  We do not use that here.  We will have to see then where our clinical dental technicians and technologists come in and will look at contracts in that regard.  It is simpler for the patient.  They do not have to worry because they have their package and within that it is simply a menu selection.  The dentist can then simply send in a package, regardless of what they pick from the menu.</p></speech>

How does one then specifically respond to the lobbyists who are opposed to it, as and when required?</p> <p>  How are specific groups targeted such as, for instance those in the workplace, that is, people who are at work, or work for most of the day and are not available during the practitioners' working day?  They then neglect their dental care until it becomes a serious matter.  We all attend to it then, when it is probably too late.  Have our guest speakers found a particular means to contact people, maybe in the workplace or by some other means, through, for example, the sporting areas?  There are continuous contacts in the sporting areas due to injuries, but apart from the injuries area, how is contact made with that cohort of people of a certain age group who may have particular issues?</p> <p>  Has an oral health system been devised whereby cases that are serious or likely to become more serious can be caught at an earlier stage?</p> <p>  On the issue of the Irish Dental Association, without wishing to go over the issue that already has been raised, but would greater interaction with the Irish Dental Association be considered or for the association to interact with the groups represented here?  Should an established structure be put in place whereby a situation would not then arise where the association was progressing on a particular route while the groups present here were progressing on a parallel but different route?  How will the bodies present here address the sort of crossover that may be necessary?</p> <p> Is there any certainty as to the provision of access to all those most likely to be in need of assistance right across all the socio-economic groups, and if not, how is this to be addressed, given the particular importance of dental and oral hygiene?</p> <p>  Together with the answers to these earlier questions, can the witnesses address the extent to which women of childbearing age have ready access to and contact with the dental services in order that their progress and the value and quality of the support that they receive can be monitored, and as to how their particular health situations in and out of pregnancies may be affected by a lack of adequate attention?</p></speech>

From a policy perspective, as we stated, water fluoridation remains a cornerstone of the policy because it is the single most influential change in the improvement of our oral health and that has been monitored since it was introduced in the 1960s.</p> <p>  More recently, a Health Research Board study was commissioned known as Fluoride And Caring for Children's Teeth, FACCT, which was set up expressly to look at the impact of this, and whether it still is as impactful as it was before.  The outcomes are that it is and there is a distinct difference between children who receive fluoridated water and those who do not, in both the severity and distribution of their disease.</p> <p>  In addition, the Department itself also commissioned a separate study directly with the Health Research Board to look at the benefits and risks because concerns were coming from the public on risks.  The Health Research Board produced a very clear evidence-based document and assessed all of the risks and the evidence underlying them.  There is no evidence that there are risks associated but it does indicate that ongoing research and monitoring is necessary, which is why we have reappointed an expert body for fluorides in health in place.  That deals with water fluoridation but does anybody else on the group here-----</p></speech>

The search engine for scientific publications shows huge volumes of research on it.  The United States is one of the key countries.  Over 300 million people worldwide receive fluoridated water.  In the United States there is quite an amount of naturally occurring fluoride in water supplies.  In this country we reduced the level in the water supply in 2007 because on the basis of research carried out here it was considered that a reduced level would perhaps be better.  The range now is 0.6 to 0.8.  The maximum allowed in EU drinking water regulations is 1.5.  There is a very cautious approach being taken here.  In the United States in the past there was a maximum allowable concentration of four parts per million, which is considerably higher than the EU figure.  This is something that has been shown worldwide to be effective because everybody gets it.  People do not have to make any effort to get it, whereas in a programme which involves the application of a topical fluoride in some form or a varnish, or however it is put onto teeth, they have to come into the surgery.  Water fluoridation occurs for everybody.  That is why it is so beneficial.  It has had a huge beneficial impact on oral health in this country, not just for children but also for adults.  A whole generation has retained natural teeth, something that perhaps would not have happened in the past without water fluoridation.  It remains a cornerstone of policy because it is a key aspect of preventing one of the main dental diseases that afflicts people.  People do not look forward to going to the dentist, which is understandable.  The problem is claims can be made, but in the scientific world a very careful evaluation is made before talking about cause and effect.  People do not do this lightly.  They want to have lots of evidence to show a positive or negative effect.  It is a really important part of policy and will remain so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alison Dougall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#M00200"><p>I would like to respond to Deputy Durkan's question about access to care and how to nudge people to access it before something becomes a problem.  The major change required is oral health has to become everybody's problem.  We have to integrate the mouth with the rest of the body and work with our medical colleagues, community nurses and midwives to nudge people at appropriate times.  This is really important in early childhood, but it is critical in older age, too.  We find that for the first time older people are retaining their teeth.  In the past they went into older age with dentures.  People make more medical appointments as they get older but fewer dental appointments, although their risks are higher because of medicine, poor eyesight, lack of dexterity and finances.  Pathfinder surveys examine how we can signpost people in order that they have really good levels of oral health as they age.  As one in five people over the age of 80 years will get dementia, we need to make sure the teams that are caring for people with dementia take oral health seriously because we have the technology to prevent and reverse disease if we catch it early.  Our problem is that people with dementia who have not received any care for perhaps eight or ten years present with advanced problems which at that point are very difficult to treat.  That is a real priority.  It is a new problem, but the nudges about which the Deputy talks mean redesigning the way we provide care.  For homeless populations, we need more drop-in centres; for older people, we need to make sure services are local because they are least likely to be able to travel.  Therefore, we need to make services accessible and affordable and design domiciliary care services in such a way that we can take teams into residential homes.  They do not need to be dentists; we can work with teams of hygienists who can effectively and economically reverse disease.  This is incredibly important and it is highlighted in the community services.  We need to work with the professions and our colleagues in other areas of medicine to design services to reach more people at risk.</p></speech>

It tried to replace it with toothpaste and other programmes outlined by Dr. McLoughlin.  For all those reasons, the level of decay has increased phenomenally.  The only area in Israel that has maintained its oral health rates is a place in which water is naturally fluoridated.  Now that water fluoridation has been taken away, it is impossible to put it back in.  It is really important that we protect water fluoridation as there are stark and dramatic outcomes, as we see in Israel.</p> <p>  The point made about the workforce is very important, especially because we have put in place the World Health Organization, WHO, safety net surveillance network.  On focusing on children only, the WHO is very clear that we must consider five year olds, 12 year olds, adolescents from 15 to 19 years of age and 35 to 45 year olds, the prime ages for childbearing, and then move to 60 and 70 year olds.  The overarching safety net monitoring and surveillance service has been recognised by the WHO since the early 2000s and all European countries are moving in this direction exactly for the reasons outlined by the Deputy to make sure people in the workforce are encouraged and formally nudged to tell them that their oral health is not okay, as they need to be signposted to the dentist and assured on where they are going.  </p> <p>  The view from other countries, particularly the Dutch models, is that there is much more flexibility when the message is sent to the profession in communities that dentists are providing care because they can afford to be more flexible, work on a Saturday, or late if they so chose because it is up to them to get their patients into the clinic.  A core part of oral health policy is to establish a dental home as early as possible because the first two years are crucial, not just for children but also their parents because the effect is twofold.  When they bring in their child, it nudges them.  There is a lot of evidence to support this.  We can be absolutely certain that certain socio-economic groups have access to services.  One of the key points in the policy is to say it is a universal approach, but it must be overlaid with a targeted approach.  That comes through in the oral health promotion programmes and services, but at no point do we say universal access stands on its own.  We are absolutely aware of the vulnerable and people with disabilities.  That is why we have put in place the WHO safety net surveillance network to ensure we can pick up those in the vulnerable groups.</p></speech>

I can understand this.  Most English speaking nations use water fluoridation to a greater or lesser extent.  I have examined this issue.  The WHO, the European Union, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, and others have examined it in great detail and never been able to find any problem with its safety.  The Health Research Board commissioned a study a few years ago, examined every piece of evidence and could not find a problem with it.  Last year Public Health England recommended that more water fluoridation schemes be rolled out.  More people in England receive fluoridated water than in Ireland.</p><p>It is a smaller percentage of the population but there are big fluoridated communities in the UK.  </p><p> The Deputy is right about catching serious cases at earlier ages.  We spoke earlier about on-demand services and children turning up in pain and with infection.  Why are 70,000 children turning up in pain and why do 7,000 children have to go into hospital to have teeth extracted?  By the time they are seen, it is too late.  I agree with Dr. Green.  No parent wants his or her child's first time visiting a dentist to be because the child has a serious infection and needs to be bundled into hospital and put to sleep to have teeth removed.  Nobody wants that.  No organisation or dentist wants that.  This is why one of the key aspects of the policy, in line with all international recommendations, is to see children when their teeth first appear and start to give basic advice to them and their parents about looking after their teeth, diet, brushing and so on to ensure we do not have young children turning up in hospital needing extractions.  That is very important.  </p><p> At a later age, there is a growing problem with diabetes.  There is a well-known relationship between gum disease and diabetes.  The more one improves one, the more one improves the other.  Some of the health insurance companies in the US will pay for people to have as much gum treatment as they want if they are at risk of diabetes because the more a person improves his or her gum health, the better controlled his or her diabetes will be and it will stop people from going into hospital.  It also saves money.  The preventative approach is important and runs through the everything.</p></speech>

We looked at all the different professions providing more general care, for example, with regard to smoking.  Results related to pharmacists, dentists and medical doctors but we noticed the contribution from dentists was 20-odd percent.  It is about having an integrated approach so that we are all on the same team.  This is a key part of the policy and has been mentioned over and over again.  We no longer consider ourselves just dentists but as being integrated with the rest of the team.  We consider ourselves to be common health professionals like everybody else so we are not stuck in a silo that is only about dentistry.  There is considerable evidence from the British and Canadian systems on the advantages and the fact that people, particularly in Great Britain, regard the pharmacy as the best place to receive their oral healthcare advice.  While that might not translate to Ireland, there is certainly strong evidence to suggest that this information should come from several different sources.  Finland is another example of a country that changed its system.  The pharmacy is the first point of contact, which means that if person goes into a health service where the first point of contact happens to be a pharmacist, that pharmacist will guide him or her through the system.  We are not saying we will Finland but that it is important that we are part of an overall team and that that team is part of our team as well.  We want other health professionals to provide dental advice and for us to participate in supporting obesity, smoking and dietary messages that are important for good health.</p></speech>

The HSE has a very good programme called Making Every Contact Count, MECC, which is an integrated programme rolled out to all health professionals.  We are doing it now and teaching it to staff and students.  It involves all care providers working together so that they all provide the same health messages about smoking, diet and exercise.  Everybody eventually interacts with somebody, be it the dentist, pharmacist, GP or community health nurse.  The important point is that we all give the same messages on health.</p></speech>

It is important to note that national surveys in Ireland are carried out across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  When we compare Northern Ireland with the Republic, we can see there is a distinct difference in the outcomes relating to oral health.  The argument would always have been that Northern Ireland had a much more accessible health service than we have, but we benefited enormously from water fluoridation compared with Northern Ireland.  That is a very clear-cut comparison for us.</p></speech>

There is a critical age that is regarded as being the proper time to interact.  In the meantime, the pain and suffering of the child while waiting for that age to progress can sometimes be severe.  The amount of medication the child must take to prevent the pain is considerable.  In some cases, the conclusion is not what would have been intended.  Is there a procedure is in place whereby health professionals are alerted to the existence of such cases where the pain is likely to become extreme or the damage done in the waiting period might require major rebuilding of the jaw or face?</p></speech>

In a case where an orthodontic condition - a malocclusion - is identified, usually around the age of 12, referral will be made to the HSE orthodontic service.  If the assessment is successful, the child is placed on the waiting list and called for treatment.  Within the system, priority is given to more complex cases.  If a child is in pain, he or she will not be left in pain.  The pain will be managed.  If there is an orthodontic element to the condition, the dental service will liaise with the orthodontic service and try to resolve the matter and deal with the pain and symptoms</p></speech>

The referral to the orthodontic service has already been made.  If there is an element of the orthodontic condition - the malocclusion - that is affecting the child and causing some physical pain, we would liaise immediately with the orthodontic staff to deal with that.  Malocclusion by itself would rarely give rise to pain.  There could be something else going on.</p></speech>

There could be a situation where the child may go past 12, 14 or 16 years of age while still awaiting an outcome - perhaps on very good advice.  However, the child may reach the age of 18 or 19 years of age and be left with a serious problem that requires major surgery to correct, whereas if the service and attention had been available during that window of between 12 and 15 years of age, the effect on the child would not have been as severe and the outcome could have been much better.  What I am trying to get at is the delay.  Some of those cases cannot afford a waiting time.</p></speech>

I am a primary care dentist.</p><p>My understanding is that cases where the malocclusion is severe and the treatment is complex may include a planned episode of surgery.  These are known as orthomatic cases where the orthodontists works in conjunction oral with maxillofacial surgeons.  The vast majority of those cases are identified at the point of referral and the point of assessment.  While those cases are prioritised within the current system, some of the surgery is dependent on the completion of growth in the jaws and that is not completed in most instances until the very late teens.  Therefore, the surgery will be planned at the end of the teens rather than at age 12 or 13 which is the optimal age for the majority of children to have orthodontics.  In a small number of cases, the planned approach will be that some orthodontic treatment is undertaken with a possible delay thereafter to allow growth to be completed followed by more intervention by the orthodontist and the surgeon working together.  There are a small number of such cases, but they are dealt with on a priority basis within the system.  However, they are in a parallel stream to most of the other cases where priority is determined according to the extent of malocclusion.  There is serious management of those cases, but inevitably some of those adolescents will be treated right through until their late teens or even early 20s because of the nature of their condition and the physical limitations on what can be achieved in the early to mid-teens.  It is not my area, but that is my understanding of it.</p></speech>

When one has a long drought, one generally drinks from the pool for a little bit longer, similarly with dental care and orthodontics.  We have covered the interaction with the general population but I have not really got any great response on interaction with the Irish Dental Association even though previous speakers have asked that question too.  Dentists in the field are working in that business every day and they should have first-hand accounts of whether progress is being made.  If they are complaining that we or the authorities do not liaise with them sufficiently, somebody is wrong.  It might not be deliberate, but if someone is wrong, that is to the detriment of the quality of the service.  That is not a criticism, it is just a statement.  Could we have some further elucidation on that if it is a possibility?</p></speech>

If one looks back at the last decade, in particular from the perspective of those working in both salaried health services and in contracted services, salary reductions and fee cuts probably left everyone in an uncomfortable position.  There may have been a feeling among those providing services that things were done to them rather than they were part of a process, which was the traditional model of engagement.  As I said earlier, the new policy is a very good basis on which to engage and we have an absolute obligation and necessity to do so.</p></speech>

In addition, something that came out of discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation in respect of GPs was the need to have a form of clearing house for a whole series of issues between contractors and those contracting services from them.  There is a necessity to have engagements of a number of different sorts.  Sometimes it is on the basis of a formal, clear and specific agenda and at other times, it is about an opportunity for parties to bring issues of concern to a table to work them out.  There are various models for doing that and we are in the process, coming out of the agreement with the GP organisation, of putting such an arrangement in place.  It is about relationship building, in which regard improvements have already been achieved and that will continue.  I see us doing the same with dentists and other contracted professionals.  We recognise that it is a job of work we have to do.</p></speech>

There is a distinct difference regarding engaging with dentists.  I appreciate and understand that there may be some confusion but there is absolutely engagement directly with the profession.  It is important to note that we got a mass of responses when we contacted 5,000 registrants twice and when we had a year-long structured engagement via structured interviews with a particular sample across a wide range of dentists.  They engaged in three-hour interviews and we got a massive amount of consultation from that process.  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from with regard to the Irish Dental Association, but I have to stand firm and say there was in-depth consultation directly with the dentists on the ground as well as with the public.  When one looks at any of the other policies that have been produced, the engagement directly with the dentists was extremely comprehensive in comparison.  I hope I will be supported in that regard.  There was a great deal of other consultation that was carried out separately with the academic reference groups and a separate practitioners' group.  I want to ensure that is made very plain and clear.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave the meeting but I had a prior commitment on another issue.  I am not sure if the following issue was raised while I was away.  It is about the whole area of training.  The RCSI made the point to us regarding training that there was no foundation year.  When one is training in medicine, there is an intern year.  The RCSI says, however, that there is no foundation year in dentistry.  The second issue is the lack of available training for people who want to specialise.  We do not appear to have a structure or the structure we have is not training enough people.  We have people who require specialist treatment, but we do not have enough practitioners in the area.  How do we improve training?  There are many people who come out with qualifications from university and appear to leave the country at a very early stage.  Some of them come back but many do not.  How do we work on that?</p> <p>  I refer to the number of dentists employed in the public sector and trying to provide the required support for children going to school.  The committee has been advised that some children might be in sixth class before they receive any dental examination.  How do we deal with that issue?</p> <p>  I refer to the development of primary care centres, of which there are more than 120 nationally.  Dental health is an important aspect of people's health.  How many primary care centres have facilities for dentists to operate in?  I am not sure that has occurred.  I have seen new primary care centres open with facilities for every other part of healthcare but not dentistry.  Has any lobbying taken place to ensure that when primary care centres are rolled out, they cover all health areas, including dentistry?  Could we have some figures on the number of primary care centres with the capacity to accommodate dentists?</p><p>I am not clear that provision is being made.  Those are my initial questions on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.231" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#P00200"><p>I mentioned training in the statement.  It is certainly something for the reference group.  It is contained in the policy.  Obviously, if one wants to have a good and functioning primary care system, and one wants to have a good ecosystem, one needs to have people trained at primary care level - we have spoken a fair amount about that - but one also needs people with special skills who can treat the more complex patients and provide the training for the people on the ground to be able to see the widest number of patients possible, and those are the specialists and academics.  Indeed, some of that has been hollowed out over the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  When we had the then Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board, it was medical and dental and there was more attention given at that point to having a structured career through dentistry.  That was disbanded when the HSE was set up and it feels like much of that responsibility for further training and dentistry in specialisation and in academic pathways seems to have dissipated.  We have spent a lot of time over the past years trying to find it and we do not know where it has gone.  Certainly, we need to put specialist training and consultant academic training back on a firmer footing and that is recognised in the policy.</p></speech>

Senator Colm Burke is correct.  We talked about implementation.  It is recognised - we would be clear on it - that this needs to be implemented together.  If we ask dentists to see children in practice or people with disabilities on Monday morning, by Monday afternoon in some cases they will need to contact a specialist.  It is critical it be rolled out together.</p></speech>

I welcome those points and an opportunity to talk about that.  We worked closely with the Dental Council.  Indeed, it set up a separate working policy group to work with us, particularly around the areas of education and training.  We are proud of our graduates.  They are fit for practice.  It is important to say they hold their own among all of the European graduates.</p> <p>  However, what was clear, indeed, in our consultation that came back from the dentists, was that they want primary care at the heart of it and, as Professor O'Connell articulated, they want to have more exposure to practice and all those areas of managing one's own practice in primary care right through their graduate programme, and those who we asked were not necessarily convinced that what is being proposed in "foundation training", as it was then called, would rectify their problems.  In fact, the older graduates said that they were still having problems.  That is why we started to look at it moving more towards a mentoring programme, which, I suppose, is a super extension of that programme.</p> <p>  Let us focus on the specialist side of it because that is an important area.  The Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry, which is the formal recognised group over specialist training and part of the Dental Council, has welcomed this policy in writing and is very supportive of it.  We have already started working with the Dental Council and the Institut Sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; en Technologie D'Art Dentaire, ISTD, to put in place advanced centres of care.  That involves not only a name.  That involves credentialling, looking at the work and at the workforce we need at all the different levels.  Specialists in dentistry in Ireland, and, indeed, in Europe, are different from those in medicine in that they are independent practitioners.  That adds a different dimension to our workforce.  Unlike in medicine, it does not mean that one automatically jumps into consultancy.  We have this firm grade in between.  This is a piece of work and they are well placed to lead in it.  In fact, they have done a tremendous amount of work already to prepare for specialisation and for the advanced centres of care coming through.  When we talk about it being a five-year plan, this is a priority - education and training, mentoring, and then moving forward into the advanced centres of care and credentialling those.  This is a key piece of work with the Dental Council.  We have met already and the working group will start to get going in July on it.  We want to start commissioning, certainly early next year, a look at our undergraduate training in the first instance.  We have so much groundwork done on the specialisation.  There is great leadership there.  We hope that we are in a strong position to move them in parallel.</p></speech>

Instead of leaving it to the last year, because dentists start using their clinical skills right through, we want to get more of that into the undergraduate training.  However, we recognise it is jam-packed already and we will need to have a mentoring framework afterwards.  We are not naive.  Dentistry changes fast.  Every five years it changes.  It is not only for new graduates.  It is for all those other graduates who are out there.  We looked at psychology, as mentioned previously.  We looked at social work.  We looked at other systems that are in place for long-term mentoring.  This is the position that we are looking at.  What we are looking at is like a super-extended type of foundation training.</p></speech>

One of the issues that has been raised is that they want to have the opportunity to use all their skills.

It is highly dependent on the state of the economy at the time.  During the recession, when there were no opportunities here, the majority of graduates emigrated.  In the past couple of years, the majority of graduates have stayed here because they can go right into practice.</p> <p>  To be clear about the foundation training the Senator asked about and what we are talking about, as was mentioned, when dentists graduate, the way the system is designed has worked well.  When dentists graduate, they have an excellent set of skills that enables them to do a wide range of tasks.  There is no evidence that there is any difficulty with that.  If goes to the Dental Council and looks at who is appearing before its fitness to practice committee, complaints from the public or any metric, there is no problem with new graduates.  In fact, in many ways the way they practice may be better and safer than established practitioners.  What they do not have is the broadest experience of treating a wide range of patients about whom we have been talking here, for instance, people with disabilities, very young children and people living in residential care.  If we are looking at a so-called extended year or foundation training, we must look specifically for an Irish system as to the gap needed to be filled here.  I would definitely agree we need to look at extended training in a mentored environment, as stated, but we should not replicate exactly what has been done in the UK because it is not fit for purpose.  My colleagues in Cork would feel the same.</p></speech>

The degree course is a fairly big cost to the State.  Would it not be appropriate to establish what percentage of graduates over the past ten years are now in Ireland, what number have left and at what stage they left?  One of the problems is that the State is giving significant funding to the universities and it is about a return to the State for that investment.  If we are educating a considerable number of graduates who are leaving, we need to ask what we need to adjust in order to make it more attractive for them to stay, not only for one year but thereafter.</p><p>If they need to gain further experience by travelling abroad, we need to work on that issue also.  It is one that is coming up.  As the delegates are aware, we are facing significant challenges in many areas of the workforce because of a shortage of people.  I do not want us to have a shortage of dental practitioners because we have not responded to their needs after they have come out of college.  I wonder whether it might be appropriate at this stage to try to find out what level of return we have got from our investment in dental training.</p></speech>

It is a very fair point.  As in medicine and other areas, it is a little complicated because we must also consider why people leave.  If someone cannot find a job here, we can hardly blame him or her for leaving.  Others go because they want to have the training opportunities about which the Senator has spoken.  Such opportunities are not always available here.  People in such circumstances leave with the intention of coming back.  The Senator is absolutely right.  They leave for complex reasons.</p></speech>

As the Senator rightly said, Irish graduates are registered.  It is important to note that many students in the dental schools come from other countries.  As part of an agreement with Canada, the Canadian authorities provide a substantial contribution to the education aspect.  When we talk about people graduating from Irish schools, we are not necessarily talking about Irish people.  Canadian graduates might want to go back to their homes in Canada.  People who came here for their education might want to go back to other areas.  There is a phenomenal degree of mobility in the European Union.  A sizeable majority of those who come here from other European states - I have the figures available - stay beyond five or seven years.  I think our policy on this point aims to give graduates more opportunities to acquire a breadth of skills from the time they graduate.  It is about having a mentored environment for them, not for one, two or three years, even if the work done in these years is of benefit, but for a much longer period.  It is about helping them to establish in practice in order that they can set up principalships in practice after five years.  This is all knowledge nobody is going to gain overnight.  It is important that we focus on the mentoring framework in the long term.  Many other professions have done it.  Ours tends to be very isolated.  This emerged clearly when we consulted dentists.  They told us that they felt isolated from their peers, particularly in rural environments.  That led to a fundamental change in how we were approaching education.  We realised something much more substantial than a one-year programme was needed.  My colleague, the chief dental officer in Britain, is very firm on the point that this is an NHS scheme, rather than an education scheme or an intern scheme.  I think it has been somewhat misrepresented.  She constantly berates me for the misrepresentation of the scheme.  The scheme in the United Kingdom is linked with an NHS practice and attached to that practice only.  If one is entering into private practice as a UK graduate, one enters into practice in the same way as every other European graduate.  The scheme is linked with the NHS system only.</p></speech>

I do not have the exact number, but I will get it for the Senator.  A small number of the centres that have been developed have dental clinics.  The earlier development of primary care centres focused on the core team.  Mental health was added thereafter.  In the more recent development of our guidance we have taken account of the overall accommodation needs in a particular location.  In those circumstances a wider range of services can be provided.  That is what has happened in more recent times.  I will get the exact figure, but I think the number of primary care centres that have dental services is small.  Dr. Green will set out the position on the 221 clinics in the system.  These locally based clinics link with the team and are clearly seen as part of it as we move forward with the development of a network of services.</p></speech>

I will also come back to him to confirm the number of primary care centres with dental facilities.  We have 221 locations.  That takes account of over 430 dental surgeries.  Certain dental equipment safety standards have to be met to ensure infection control is up to speed.  We tend to take a ten or 15-year view on the installation of a dental surgery.  If a primary care centre is being developed on the same campus as an existing dental clinic, it may not be appropriate to include a new dental facility on the same site.</p></speech>

What percentage of dentists who are working in private practice or the community hold a contract to supply public services under PRSI and other contracts?  Is there any move to reverse the FEMPI cuts for dentists?  In recent months we have had a move to restore funding for general practice, but I do not think there has been a move to reverse the FEMPI reductions that are affecting dentists.  The delegates might comment on that matter.</p> <p>  What level of funding will be needed to fund implementation of the oral health strategy?  What funding is available for it at present?  What increase is needed?  We have been battling with the amount of money that will be needed to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are trying to determine how much money will be needed each year and when it will be released.  I ask the delegates to respond to these questions.</p> <p>  My next question relates to public orthodontic waiting lists.  I understand there are 13 public orthodontists.  Is that right?  How many would be needed to clear a waiting list of 1,800?  It seems that there are more people waiting than in treatment.  Surely the way to address this issue is by increasing the number of orthodontists, rather than using private dentists to pick up the slack through an NTPF-type mechanism which does not really address the problem.  Such mechanisms try to fill the gap, rather than addressing the actual problem.</p><p>Will Dr. Dougall address the issue of where treatment is provided for those with complex special needs?  There are probably patients in all our constituencies who cannot have such treatment delivered by their community dentist.  Is it delivered through dental hospitals or general hospital services?  How and where can people access those services?</p><p> We received a submission from dental hygienists, the main point of which is that they are entirely focused on prevention.  They do not seem to be involved in the oral hygiene policy.  Where do they fit into it, particularly in regard to prevention?</p></speech>

Approximately 13,000 people require complex care at some time.  Access to services is <i>ad hoc</i>.  A large number of patients are particularly at risk.  A relatively small number of people are specifically trained to treat such patients, which is an issue.  Access to general anaesthesia is also <i>ad hoc</i>.  There are some pockets of brilliance and excellence, but in many other areas there is nothing.  Some people must travel a great distance to a dental hospital or across borders to access treatment.  The dental hospital is not an acute setting as it does not have general anaesthesia facilities.  General anaesthesia is provided throughout the country but it is severely limited and many people with disabilities have their treatment options severely limited by poor access to it.  For example, extraction-only services may be offered or, within the general anaesthesia setting, the patient is not offered root canal, even to save a front tooth.  It is well recognised that there are no well-defined care pathways and not enough people trained to provide the required care.  That needs to be addressed in the policy and there will undoubtedly be a need for more people to be trained in this area.<br/><br/>On training at undergraduate level, evidence has shown that we can train people in general practice to do the bulk of the work, but undergraduate is not the time to work on complex patients because students are honing their basic dental skills.  The mentoring of graduates following qualification is extremely important.  Special care dentistry is a specialty.  We offer three-year specialist training on an international basis.  Most Irish graduates travel overseas for training in this area because of its cost in Ireland.  Unlike orthodontics or periodontics, in regard to which people can thereafter go into general practice to earn a living, it is currently difficult to self-fund a expensive course of treatment.<br/><br/>On succession planning, I am a consultant but there is no formal recognition for a consultant training pathway to, for example, replace me when I retire in ten years.  The provision of training across the board in this area is a priority and it has been recognised as such.  It is possible to achieve very good levels of care for people with disabilities, as evidenced by the literature.  It will be a challenge, but we know it is possible and the evidence shows that the training is available in Ireland.  We have the methodology and curricula to train our undergraduates, postgraduates and practising dentists to give them the skills to prevent the need for extensive treatment.  We always seek to avoid general anaesthesia being necessary.  Prevention works very well for people with disabilities.  We need general anaesthesia to be available and people to be trained to provide sedation, which opens up bigger options of care than general anaesthesia, but we mainly wish to prevent the necessity of sedation or general anaesthesia by having good, well orientated preventative services in primary care.</p></speech>

To retain or train staff in regard to treating those with disabilities, a career structure is required, as is the case with every specialty, because that will get people interested in it.  I will hand over to Dr. Kavanagh, who will address policy.</p></speech>

In the UK in particular, there is a plethora of specialties.  There is much debate, particularly among my chief dental officer colleagues, about the merits of having multiple specialties in smaller countries such as ours with a population of 4.5 million.  A dentist practising in a specialist limited area needs a body of work to maintain his or her skills and that is a dilemma for us.  Many people first look to the practice in Scandinavian countries, where they have developed a concept of specialist generalist training and are moving away from limited specialties.  Although I do not wish to pre-empt what will be in the policy, practitioners could combine several specialties, which would be of particular benefit to us in respect of rural areas, which are a challenge for us.  It would be difficult for us to appoint a paediatric specialist, a special care specialist and several other specialists to such areas as there would be a shortage of applicants for such posts.</p> <p>  To come back to the policy, the advanced care centres provide credentials in this regard.  On a national level, we need a broad range of specialties available to us.  However, if we are looking into the community, we would have to consider that workforce planning in a certain way.  It is important that practitioners maintain their skills.  One of the important concerns raised in the consultation with dentists on the ground was that they are primary care dentists with a broad scope of practice, but feel squeezed by the specialties and auxiliaries coming in and want a clear definition of their scope of practice.  The view of the Dental Council of Ireland is that primary care covers all eventualities unless, as Dr. Dougall rightly pointed out, it is an advanced part of care and this network is required to provide it.  It is a mutual relationship.  We currently only have two specialties and are conforming to EU standards in that regard.  We recognise that more specialties are needed in key areas, but I am unsure whether having 13 specialties would be appropriate for us as we do not have a population of 78 million.  The four key pillars, involving primary care, special care, looking at public health and looking at the advanced centres, such as in the areas of restorative and, perhaps, periodontal care, are key in considering the needs of our communities.  That is our first port of call.</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee but I have a number of questions that I wanted to ask.  What is the referral pathway for somebody to be referred to a public orthodontist?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joe Green" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#S00600"><p>A child is seen through the dental service run by the HSE.  The HSE dentist assesses whether there is a need for an orthodontic treatment.  A system called the modified index of treatment need is used.  If the dentist assesses the child and believes the condition or emerging condition is likely to be accepted for treatment, the referral will be made and the regional orthodontic department makes the assessment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#S00700"><p>I imagine that if somebody is referred to an orthodontist, it is for a good reason.  Even if it is for a routine treatment, it needs to be done.  Dr. Dougall spoke earlier about nudging people to make sure that they are treated as quickly as possible.  Dr. Kavanagh spoke in a similar vein.  If a person is referred to an orthodontist, how quickly should that person be assessed, inspected, treated or go through whatever else is needed?  If a person was referred but left it on the long finger for as long as six months, would that be a wise thing to do?  What is done to make sure that a person gets the treatment needed or that the inspection is carried out to see what the problem is?  How important is it that the person is seen as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

When we are looking at this with regard to policy and in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, the intention would be for the assessment to happen as quickly as possible.  We have talked quite a lot about advanced care and the importance of specialist care but one of the key points of Sl&aacute;intecare is to ensure that as much as possible is carried out in the local primary care setting.  This is a key task for the Dental Council, secondary care services and orthodontic care services.  What elements of orthodontics can be appropriately conducted in a primary care setting to speed up care provision?  That is the type of service that is provided in other European countries when they provide orthodontic care.  The UK has traditionally operated a specialist service but it is now looking at many treatments being in primary care, where that would be possible and appropriate.  I am not suggesting that it happen for advanced care services but where possible and appropriate, the Dental Council will look at that in conjunction with the committee for specialist training.</p></speech>

Constituents visit our clinics and ask us to raise issues of concern to them.  Orthodontics is sometimes one of those issues, especially in the south east because waiting times for treatment are longer.  I submitted a parliamentary question which I think Dr. Green responded to about waiting times in the south east.  I was taken aback by the response, which broke down waiting times by year from 2014 to 2019.  The average waiting time for routine orthodontic treatments across the south east in 2014 was 42 months.  The average waiting time now is 60 months.  In Waterford, my constituency, it was 37 months in 2014, 47 months in 2015, 51 months in 2016, then dropped to 47 months in 2017, possibly because of the national procurement process that the witnesses spoke about earlier, while it was 54 months in 2018 and 60 months now.  How could 60 months be an acceptable wait time?</p></speech>

That is five years.  How could somebody have to wait for five years for an inspection?  Even priority waiting times, while they were up to date in 2014 and 2015, went to nine months in 2016, 13 months in 2017, 16 months in 2018 and 18 months in 2019.  That is a year and a half for priority cases.  Those are astounding figures.  We talked about policy earlier.  We heard a great deal about policy and encouraging people to get checked up to make sure they get the treatment they need as quickly as possible, nudging and supporting them and raising awareness.  If the capacity and services are not there, a routine appointment takes five years to get and what is called a priority takes 18 months, it makes a mockery of the policy.  Why is it that people in Waterford and, by extension, the south east, since the numbers are similar, have to wait for 60 months for an inspection and 18 months for more serious cases?  What is the problem?</p></speech>

If it is increasing every year, surely the people who are tasked with making sure that waiting times come down would put solutions in place?  If something is a problem for that length of time, the people who are responsible for making sure that solutions are in place are obviously not delivering solutions because the times are increasing.  Dr. Green has acknowledged that waiting times are going up, not down.  What specific capacity issue is causing the problem?  Is it orthodontists?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joe Green" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#S01400"><p>It is the number of orthodontists.  Thankfully, there has been some recruitment in the south east.  An orthodontist took up duty in New Ross in April.  The number of orthodontists required is much higher than the number in place currently.  As I said in response to Deputy Brassil, to increase capacity, we either increase the number of specialists or introduce the grade of orthodontic therapist and provide the appropriate number.  The introduction of the grade of orthodontic therapist is in our workforce planning.</p></speech>

It is frustrating that I have listened to this for about an hour and a half.  I thought that Dr. Kavanagh's and Dr. Dougall's responses were first class in setting out the policy and vision, as well as what needs to be done and what people need to do to look after their oral health, dental health and so on.  We have also heard from others.  It makes a mockery of policy if there is a 60 month waiting list in the south east.  It takes five years to see an orthodontist.  Priority cases were up to date in 2014 and 2015 but have slipped back to 18 month waiting times.  It is hard to sit here and listen to all that has been said about policy when the reality for people is somewhat different.  Children suffer most.  If children have been waiting for five years for a routine case, they have been referred for a reason, even if it is a routine one.  If it gets worse over five years, the child could be 13 or 14 when he or she is referred and could be 19 before he or she is seen.  It seems outrageous.  I commend the people who passionately champion the policy but policy is one thing, while the implementation and outworkings of policy are another.  The policy and what is available for people in the south east seem to be two different things.</p></speech>

Technology has changed enormously in dentistry, even in the past five years.  A person has only to walk down the high street to see the number of dentists working in practice who are providing orthodontics.  This was undreamt of before.  I am not just talking about orthodontics but also about implants and other elements.  I am not talking about any advanced areas.  We absolutely need our specialists for those areas, but it is important to see what we can do in the primary care setting, reasonably and appropriately and supported by specialists and consultants.  I am not just talking about orthodontics.  A very clear example has been given of why we need a new way to look at features.  The model has worked excellently for us.  We have excellent oral health in Ireland but the model needs to change now.  As said, we just cannot keep up.  Changes in technology have now allowed us to have the facilities to look at this in a different way and make sure that, where possible and appropriate, people in Waterford can gain access through their local primary care dentist, with support from the specialists and the advance centres.  Support is key.  I am referring to what we want in the policy.  We are so keen to start on the advanced centres of care so quickly so we can have the specialists in place.  Their jobs would not just be about treatment but also about mentoring and support.  Also, primary care dentists should have the opportunity to provide what they believe they can provide.  In consultation, they were adamant that they have the skills, want to use all of them and want to provide services in other areas of secondary care.  They just need the support.  It is an urgent piece of work.  It is a priority in the policy.  We must move forward in that direction.  In all the areas of secondary care, let us move forward with the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

He mentioned capacity.  There is a capacity problem.  He has said there has been some additional capacity.  Is that additional capacity enough to reduce the waiting times?  If not, what more is needed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joe Green" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#T00300"><p>What is needed is a comprehensive workplace plan, not just with the south east but also for the wider orthodontic service.  The correct school mix needs to be achieved within that across consultants, specialists, orthodontic therapists and dental nurses.  The staff do a very fine job.  The outcomes from our orthodontic treatment are very good.  That should be said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#T00400"><p>To go back to what Deputy Cullinane was saying, there is significant dissatisfaction among the public, including parents of children who have to wait for a prolonged period.  Quite often, there is no knowing when one will be seen.  A person is put on a waiting list but he or she has no idea whether he or she will be seen in one year, two years, three years or five years.  That creates great anxiety among patients.  As a consequence, patients end up borrowing, stealing or remortgaging their houses and putting themselves at great financial risk to obtain privately the service that should be provided through the public system but is not.  They may have two or three children who need orthodontic treatment, not just one.  This puts them under serious financial pressure.  That is the issue.  The policy is fine and the intention to change it is fine, but the practical reality, as Deputy Cullinane said, is that the lists are growing rather than reducing.</p></speech>

From the HSE's point of view, it is clear there is a particularly enduring problem in orthodontics.  There has been a recruitment and retention issue.  Dr. Green and the team involved have done significant work on trying to bring forward solutions to improve capacity.  He has gone through that.  The workforce planning element is important.  The idea of the orthodontic therapist could make a contribution.  It has to be acknowledged that the points the Deputy makes are understood.  A lot has been done to try to address the capacity position to improve the situation for the service users who are waiting.  We prioritise the highest number.  There are 18,000 in treatment at present.  That is not adequate.  There are another 18,000 on the waiting list.  That is fully understood.  A significant amount of work has been done by the profession and the clinical lead, Dr. Green, to try to make proposals to deal with this.  That is what we will try to do.</p></speech>

It is correct that it has dedicated people.  All the changes need to be implemented together.  Essentially, specialty training has fallen apart.  Those who wish to train to be an orthodontist, here or abroad, are paying for their own education.  In Dublin or Cork, it is &euro;25,000 per year for three years to train as an orthodontist.  In such circumstances, it is impossible to attract those concerned back into the public service, especially when salaries have been cut.  It is simply not an option.  We are training the staff but they are paying for the training themselves, so there is no incentive for them to go into the public service.  Here is where we need some joined-up thinking.</p> <p>  Specifically at the request of the public service, we set up a training programme for orthodontic therapists in Trinity but the health service does not employ orthodontic therapists.  We have private petitioners lining up to send their staff in to be trained as orthodontic therapists to work in private practice but they are not working in the public service.  The public service is not employing them.  We need the joined-up thinking and the plans need to be implemented as one or they will not work together.</p></speech>

I had a question on the reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.295" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Goodman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#T00800"><p>When talking about the reversal of the FEMPI cuts, it is important to note that the mandate the Department and HSE would have were they engaging in a fee discussion with dental professionals would concern modernisation, reform and service development.  That would be the context in which the Government may commit to additional funding.  There would not be a mechanism just about undoing a fee change and changing nothing else.  That is the basis on which we would engage.  That was the mandate we had in regard to general medical practitioners, as the Chairman is probably aware.  I am not saying that in a negative way but that would be the basis on which I would anticipate we would be mandated to engage.  In the context of the implementation discussion we referred to earlier in this meeting, that is where the fee construct will come into it.</p> <p>  I was asked about the funding implications of the policy and the costings, which are subject to evolution over time, an eight to ten-year period.  Taking into account current fee levels, probably in the region of &euro;80 million would need to be committed.</p> <p>  We have heard quite a few discussions here on resource issues of one sort or another.  Some issues are structural and some pertain to resources.  We all know the health service is challenged all the time trying to live within resources and finding the resources to do additional things.  The process for decisions on additional funding will essentially be annual in the context of each year's Estimates.  We have a job of work to construct the proposition for a contractual engagement.  Going into that process, we would need to understand that the money will be or can be provided when we come with an outcome from it, which is what we did with general practitioners.</p></speech>

We met the professional group of Irish dental hygienists a few times.  We are meeting them in July as well.  They are a key part of the policy.  We also met representatives of the Clinical Dental Technicians Association Ireland two weeks ago.  These are the two key auxiliary groups under the new dental legislation that will be independent practitioners.  A key issue for us is the opportunity for them to take on independent contracts if they so wish, and particularly when we devise packages of care, to look at the Dutch system in particular, which has embraced auxiliaries and therapists in this way, as well as other groups.  That is exactly how the construct was and so we had a mind to the new dental legislation bringing in these independent practitioners.  A concern was raised by the clinical dental technicians that this would be a backward step and we said it would absolutely not be such a step and the intention was to expand the scope of practice of auxiliaries where possible.  We have been very clear about that in the policy.  Where it can be expanded, it should be but in a way that is mindful of the benefits and risks, of which the Dental Council of Ireland, as a regulatory organisation, would be aware.  These are two independent professions that we would see coming forward and that is extremely important to the policy and provision of care.</p></speech>

That is not to say such education cannot be undertaken currently.  We require legislation not for clinical dental technicians but for hygienists.  Student registration is another key aspect, although we have not discussed it here.  That relates to continuity of care and other reasons.  With regard to education and training, just two dental schools are specified.  One of the issues to which we alluded is the increase in the number of European graduates coming here.  We also have private schools in Ireland and the Dental Council of Ireland does not have jurisdiction over them.  Across Europe there has been a huge increase in the workforce of dental graduates but they are all from a variable mix.  We need legislation in that regard.  The Dental Council of Ireland does not have the wherewithal to go into premises and inspect them.  Dr. Green alluded to the need for us to have high-quality standards in dental care.  The HSE service is exemplary in that regard.  It is important that for all premises and practices, the Dental Council of Ireland should be able to put in a programme of work whereby it can inspect practices.  The main issues for the policy are for the continuing professional development to be mandatory and for there to be registration and fitness to practice for the two key groups of hygienists and clinical dental technicians.</p></speech>

It has been much tied up with that Bill but all of the infrastructure is now in place to move forward with that legislation.  We would love to say it will be there tomorrow but we will keep on with our plan of work.  The committee can see the urgency we have to move forward.  We will proceed with a skill matching programme and have everything ready and prepared once the Bill comes through.</p></speech>

I am not brilliant at being brief but I will try.  The point was made by Dr. Green that the staff do a fine job and they absolutely do.  There is no question or doubt about that at all.  The problem is there are not enough of them for everybody who needs to see them.  The issue is not with the quality of the work carried by the staff but rather that nobody can get in to get that high-quality work.</p> <p>  We spoke a little at the outset about consultation.  This concerns a change in the model of care for children's oral health.  Will the witnesses talk me through what input Tusla would have had?  Was it part of the consultation, given that much of the focus is on children's oral health?</p></speech>

Will our guests provide some detail on the level of emergency care that is provided?  If there is not enough routine care happening now, there will be a shift to emergency care, although that is not what people want.  What is the level of emergency care with respect to appointment numbers?  How is this going to change when the new model is fully implemented?  If there is a flashing blue light emergency, where will people go?</p></speech>

We are recording in excess of 70,000 emergency appointments each year.  The vast majority of those are children and many are very young at three, four, five or six years old.  Many of them are five, six or seven years old.  Most of the issues relate to decay in deciduous or baby teeth.  With those, treatment can either restore the tooth or perhaps it has to be extracted.  If multiple extractions are indicated or infection must be controlled prior to treatment, a course of antibiotics may be indicated.  If it is not possible to complete the treatment or if multiple extractions are indicated, that could lead to a referral for treatment under general anaesthetic in one of the hospitals.  That happens approximately 7,000 times per year between emergency patients and some patients who have been referred without symptoms but whose treatment is completed under general anaesthesia.</p></speech>

We would like children to be seen at a much earlier age, particularly in order to identify those who are at greatest risk of dental decay, or who may have a medical condition that would make treatment risky in itself.  Prevention is therefore of even more value for them.  That treatment risk could also include an assessment of their risks of being treated under general anaesthetic or sedation.  We would seek to avoid the worst possible treatment scenario, where someone is in a hospital for treatment for what is, as Professor O'Connell said, largely a preventable condition.  In transitioning to a revised system, the HSE's priorities would be to try to protect the strengths of the existing service, including a same-day or following day response for anyone who is in pain.  If the HSE service were involved, we would strive to continue to provide that.  That would be our plan, and it would be an upfront requirement in any contracted situation.  However, that might not be the easiest thing to put in place.  We have yet to reach the starting point for all of that, and there would need to be extensive consultation with prospective service providers, our own staff, the Department, and any other stakeholder which might be involved.  Putting that in place would be a priority. </p></speech>

Generally it is within 24 hours, though it does not have to be.  For example, if a patient rings in and the dental professional decides it is not necessary for them to be seen because they are not in pain, that is their decision.  It is not a question of where it is best set or seated.  It is part of one's dental professional ethics and emergency care must be provided.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Kavanagh.</p> <p>  I have two questions relating to specific areas.  My first, unsurprisingly enough, relates to my own constituency of Dublin Fingal.  Figures from replies to parliamentary questions show that of the 84,000 children who are on waiting lists, there are 4,450 in my own area who have been waiting longer than 52 weeks.  That is the number of children currently in fourth class with no guarantee that they will be offered a screening appointment.  That is clearly very worrying.  I happen to represent the constituency with the fastest-growing population in this State, and possibly even in Europe, so that should be enough.  I see parents in my advice clinics on a weekly basis who are concerned because their children's teeth are deteriorating and they are stuck on waiting lists.  The witnesses know the figures so I am not going to go through every single waiting list, but the list of children waiting for more than 52 weeks jumps out at me.  That is a year.  If someone is due a test in fourth class and they have to wait a year, one does not have to be a genius to figure out that they will not be in fourth class at the end of it.  What happens to these children?  According to the witnesses' own figures, it is highly unlikely they will get the screening.  I talk to their parents, so I know that, in many instances, the money is not there for them to go private.  Why should they have to, aside from the fact that their children are left waiting?  What are the likely outcomes of missing that important appointment for those children?  I presume it is important, otherwise it would not be on the schedule. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joe Green" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019062600002#V01500"><p>The HSE sets priorities of trying to see children in second class, sixth class, and fourth class if possible.  There are a number of areas in the country where fourth class has not been reached due to capacity, as we discussed earlier.  The amount or increment of treatment that is often required at fourth class is much less if children have been seen in either first or second class.  Focusing on permanent teeth for the moment, if fissure sealants have been placed on the permanent teeth in either first or second class, by fourth class visits would hopefully concentrate more on looking for dental milestones such as the eruption of permanent teeth, occlusion, and reinforcing preventative measures such as dietary advice, advice to parents, tooth brushing, as well as reinforcing good dental attendance.  In the event that children are not seen in fourth class, the increment of decay that may have occurred between second class and fourth class would be the one that could not be treated at that time.  Where possible, those children are followed up on if resources allow, and they would then be seen in either fifth or sixth class, depending on the approach of their local area.  As I said, the outcome of treatment at first or second class is critical.  If those children had been seen, a lot of preventative treatments would have been put in place, and that can help.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to some staff shortages in certain areas across Dublin North, and in Balbriggan in particular.  As it goes, not only do I represent a constituency with the fastest-growing population in the State, but Balbriggan is also the youngest town in Ireland.  This is a fairly easily identifiable cohort, and one does not need to be a brain surgeon to figure out that if a whole load of young families buy houses, the inevitable consequence of that is children, and the inevitable consequence of children is children's teeth.  Notwithstanding the fact that much of this was predictable, there is a particular problem with the recruitment of staff in Balbriggan.  Do the witnesses have any words of comfort for me to bring back to north County Dublin?  Is there anything I can say to the parents of these children?</p></speech>

There was a dentist in Balbriggan who left the service at the end of January, so I will follow up with the Deputy on that dentist's replacement.  There has been a 15% increase in population in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, of Dublin north city and county and it is impacting on our orthodontic service as well.  It is a serious question.</p></speech>

Before people start to build much-needed houses, they should talk about the services that need to follow.</p> <p>  I have a question on behalf of my colleague Deputy Funchion, which relates to the Carlow-Kilkenny area.  There are a few things in the answer we received to this parliamentary question.  Some 1,748 people have been on a waiting list for longer than 52 weeks in Carlow, and 2,181 in Kilkenny.  They are going to have the same complications Dr. Green has just outlined.  That is one thing, but reference is also made to a fire in St. Dympna's Hospital which led to the cessation of dental services and the cancellation of surgeries for four months.  What is the current state of play for children in Carlow and Kilkenny with regard to access and services?</p></speech>

There have been some difficulties in that respect.  Our process is quite lengthy but it is very robust.

The system in the Public Appointments Service is fantastic.  It is robust and everything it does is beyond question but it can be a little cumbersome.  People may get an offer of a job from a private contractor which they can start the following morning, whereas in the Public Appointments Service applicants will go through a lengthy process that leave people believing the PAS does not want to employ them.  It becomes difficult and the system can sometimes make it difficult.  Has any thought or consideration been given to streamlining the process for recruitment?  It has worked elsewhere.  I am not saying it has fixed everything but it has had limited success in other areas of the health service.</p></speech>

This is a very important piece of legislation and I thank committee members for their time and consideration.</p> <p>  I am joined by a number of colleagues: Ms Lorraine O&rsquo;Donoghue and Sinead O&rsquo;Gorman, who have been working hard on the rates Bill, from the local government finance section in the Department; Ms Sheila McMahon, who is here to cover the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act amendments; and Ms Patricia Curran and Mr. Paul Hogan, who are here to cover the planning amendments.  As requested, we have provided advance briefing on these Report Stage amendments to the committee.</p> <p>  Commercial rates are a critical source of funding for local authorities, accounting for &euro;1.51 billion, or 32%, of the &euro;4.67 billion expenditure budgeted in the sector in 2018.  The overall aim of this rates Bill is to modernise and improve the rates regime.  In this regard, the drafting process is complex and of necessity, requires significant ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, particularly local authorities and the valuation office.</p> <p>  I might just mention that in terms of important provisions not subject to amendment, the Bill provides for the introduction of rates alleviation - waiver - schemes by local authorities, subject to ministerial approval, which can support important policy objectives contained in local, economic, community and land use plans.</p><p>The Bill also includes important provisions for collection and enforcement by local authorities.</p><p> The Bill was passed on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 30 January, at which time a number of amendments were signalled for introduction on Committee Stage.  Report Stage is provisionally scheduled for 3 July.  Committee Stage consideration will take place immediately after this briefing session.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will be in attendance and it will present an opportunity to discuss important amendments such as those related to the Valuation Acts.  The changes are required to ensure the ongoing national revaluation programme will remain revenue neutral for the local authorities, taking account of the revaluation of utilities on a global basis and the impact of successful appeals to the Valuation Tribunal.  In that context, an amendment to allow the Commissioner of Valuation share the preliminary valuation of Irish Water with the local authorities is time critical to facilitate the calculations for 2020 budgets in local authorities.</p><p> A small number of important but mainly technical amendments were not ready for tabling on Committee Stage, but it is intended to introduce them on Report Stage.  There will be a number of further amendments relevant to the Bill.  Furthermore, amendments to the Planning and Development Acts, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are proposed.  Amendments to the rates regime are proposed to enhance notification procedures and provision for additions and amendments to the valuation list to be immediately effective for rating purposes, given that there is currently a delay.  A possible further amendment remains subject to drafting.  </p><p> An amendment to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 is required to overcome a risk that might allow the definition of an "owner of student accommodation" to be construed in a manner that could circumvent the intention of the Act.  The amendment is required prior to the imminent planned commencement of the student accommodation provisions.  Technical amendments related to the timing of the commencement of the student accommodation provisions will also be required.  An amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 will be required to provide an alternative route for protected structures to qualify, further to substantial refurbishment works, for exemption from rent increase restrictions in rent pressure zones, RPZs, because they would be unlikely to qualify under the provisions recently enacted in the 2019 Act.  The objective is to eliminate any potential negative impact on the planned refurbishment of protected structures in the rental sector.</p><p> An amendment will be required to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to address transitional issues following the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  It is a time-critical amendment in the context of the ongoing development of regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, by regional assemblies.  A further minor technical amendment will be proposed to underpin the special provisions for Cork city and county councils to extend the period for review of their development plans to incorporate RSESs into their plans.  A possible amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 to reinsert a provision inadvertently deleted which empowers the Exchequer to pay into the Local Government Fund is no longer deemed to be required following further legal advice on the matter.</p><p> I thank the committee.  We look forward to the discussion.  We have provided some more detail in the briefing note on the proposed amendments.</p></speech>

While I do not mean to criticise anyone, there is a certain degree of dissatisfaction among committee members.  Yet again, we have been notified of Report Stage amendments that we will not have a chance to scrutinise in committee.  I appreciate that the idea in Mr. Quinlan appearing before the committee is to fill in at least part of the gap, for which we are grateful, but the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, should hear loud and clear the view of the committee that it would have been much better if the amendments had been brought through the full and proper process of Committee and Report Stages.  Nevertheless, we have always been flexible as a committee and do not wish to stand in the way of important amendments.</p> <p>  I have concerns about two of the proposed Report Stage amendments and would like to hear more about them.  While the amendments related to student accommodation and rates seem to bebroadly sensible, my concern is with the protected structures and RPZs.  If I understand the problem correctly, it is that the building energy rating, BER, requirements included in the new definition of "substantial refurbishment" cause a difficulty in the case of pre-1963 properties because they are exempt from BER upgrades.  Would it not have made more sense to simply remove the provision of a new definition of "substantial refurbishment" from the criteria for pre-1963 properties to be eligible for substantial refurbishment?  Was this considered, or have I misunderstood the position?  Why is the solution to the problem a requirement to have been outside the rental market for 12 months rather than 24?</p> <p>  I also have a concern about the RSESs.  We will again give a significant power to the Minister.  Although I do not want to return to the debate, the purpose in creating a planning regulator was to shift the overconcentration of power from the hands of the Minister and the Department, to which the Mahon tribunal had rightly pointed.  In the case of the current RSES processes, however, the amendment would allow the Minister to issue a direction to the regional assemblies to take such specified measures as he or she might require for the plan.  That seems to be another significant shift in power towards the Minister and an undermining of the regional and local authorities.  What is Mr. Quinlan's response?  I am open to supporting both amendments on Report Stage, but I struggle with these two questions.</p></speech>

I have heard that population size might be used in calculating the figure.  I have also heard indications that, by coincidence, the valuation may end up being the same as the current total valuation of Irish Water.  That will be interesting if it turns out to be the case.  If the figure is divided by population, counties such as Wicklow will lose out significantly.  In fairness, Wicklow County Council rated all of its water infrastructure in its books, whereas I understand a number of councils did not rate any of their water infrastructure.  Is there a question mark over the current valuation of Irish Water, given that some councils did not carry out a valuation?  When the Valuation Office gives its valuation of Irish Water, who will decide how to apportion it and how will it be done?  If it is apportioned according to population size, what will happen to the likes of County Wicklow which will probably lose approximately &euro;1.6 million in commercial rates?  What involvement will we or the Government have in the process, or who else will decide how it is to be apportioned after the Valuation Office provides the valuation?</p></speech>

As Mr. Quinlan noted, &euro;1.5 billion is raised in commercial rates.  It is the most significant contributor in the running of local councils throughout the country.  I echo what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  I appreciate that everything is time sensitive, but what is happening with the Bill before us is similar to what happened in the case of the Cork city Bill, when an amendment was proposed on Report Stage to provide for municipal councils across boundaries.  However, it failed because it was such a late addition and there was not a proper debate on it.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Quinlan for the briefing.  He raised issues with the Planning Act and RSESs and I would appreciate it if he fleshed them out.</p><p>In time regional assemblies will have more clout than councils, which will have a significant impact on the hierarchy of plans ranging from the national development plan to regional strategies and those of councils.  As we are discussing a Bill on rates, I would like to flesh out what the impact will be.</p></speech>

They apply to pre-1963 structures but it is just the protected structures within that and this has to do with a technical issue.  The BER system emanates from an EU directive and the regulations were made under the 1972 Act.  That means the regulations can only be applied as a requirement as opposed to an optional facility.  They cannot be used like that.  It turned out that the only way protected structures could qualify for the exemption would be either more than 25% of the property was refurbished or they met all three of the exemptions relating to adaptation for disabled people, an increase in the layout and an increase in the number of rooms.  Effectively, that would have meant it would have been very difficult for protected structures to quality under the grounds of the change in the substantial refurbishment works.  To provide an alternative way in which this subset of buildings in the rental sector could qualify, so that there would not be a deterrent effect on doing needed refurbishment work, this amendment is being introduced whereby if it is a case that there has not been a tenancy in the building for 12 months prior to the new tenancy that commences after the works, there will be an exemption from the application of the 4% rent increase restriction in the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  This is an alternative.  It will still be two years for every other building.</p></speech>

The objective is still, though, that those buildings that are not in good condition would be improved to make them more comfortable for tenants.</p></speech>

Up until 3 April of this year what is envisaged is a power that the Minister has always had.  Up until now the Department, on behalf of the Minister, has been fully engaged in all three regional spatial strategy processes.  All three processes are well advanced.  In fact, the east and midlands regional strategy is due to be published on Friday.  The process is that well advanced and is almost complete.</p> <p>  The problem is that the legislation that we now have has made the involvement of the Minister in the process at this stage subject to the involvement of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, from the outset in the process, which can never be achieved because we cannot turn the clock back.  This arises because this legislation was published in 2016 and enacted last year.  It was always envisaged that the OPR would be in place before the RSESs kicked off but the office was not in place and it did not happen like that.  They have travelled down the road and the regulator has come in pretty much three quarters of the way through all of the processes.  As I said, the legislation envisages the regulator being given notice, making submissions and being very clear about what the issues are and what his or her office wants to see done all the way through and then, on foot of that either happening or not happening, making a recommendation to the Minister at the very end for the Minister to act.  The Department, on behalf of the Minister, has been involved to date in line with legislation that was there until 3 April.  This amendment simply seeks to put a once-off interim arrangement in place for the current round of RSESs, all of which are at a slightly different stage, and simply enable the process, as it was prior to 3 April, to be concluded as it would have been.  However, there is one new addition, which enables the Minister to invite the regulator to issue an advisory report to him or her.  That is seen as something that would enable at least the advice of the regulator's office to be brought in to the current process.  It is a new provision but it gets us over the problem of the regulator not having been involved all of the way through and having things on the record that he said.  There is an issue about legal consistency where one cannot have someone coming in at the 11th hour raising new issues or whatever.  The ability to involve the regulator is the only new element, otherwise it is just putting the clock back to prior to 3 April.  The regulator's office is only recruiting staff now so the reality is there will not be a significant capacity there to undertake what was envisaged even if we could set the clock back.</p></speech>

The way it works is once the strategy is published, the Minister has a period of time in which to form a view as to whether or not the strategy complies with national planning policy and guidelines, etc.  I do not want to prejudge the ability of the Minister to make that decision but there are issues in respect of some elements of the soon-to-be adopted plan in the east and midlands.  There are also issues ongoing in the north and west, and the south, that may not be resolved by the end of the process but we cannot anticipate how that will go.</p></speech>

As it stands, the way the legislation is, the regulator cannot get involved in the process and the Minister's involvement has effectively been curtailed since 3 April.  No one is responsible at present.  Basically, that is for the lack of a transitional arrangement.  This is a transitional arrangement given that we are well advanced on the three and that was not envisaged when the legislation was drafted.</p></speech>

It is quite a significant provision.  Clearly, it is a provision that was intended in the original legislation that was published in 2016.  So that we are clear, if the Minister or the Department is concerned that the content of one of these plans is a problem, this gives the Minister an avenue to resolve that problem in line with the national planning framework and Government strategies.</p></speech>

Let us say we had got to this stage and the regulator had been involved from the beginning.  From Friday, the regulator would be in a position where he would then report back to the Minister based on whether or not his recommendations have been taken on board and whether or not he considers the strategy has complied with national and other guidance, and would likewise report to the Minister in the four-week period, and the Minister then would have six weeks from the beginning of the process to act, that is, another two weeks on top of the four weeks.</p></speech>

The first valuation of Irish Water is under way.  Other valuations of the ESB and EirGrid will also be undertaken this year.  On the Irish Water evaluation, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent and that process is ongoing.  We have engaged with the commissioner and local authorities to ensure the greatest possible understanding but the figures are not yet available.  The preliminary valuation will be on 18 July and the Minister will be notified of it.  Local authorities would not normally be notified but that is addressed in one of the amendments.  These are Committee Stage amendments so there will be an opportunity to discuss them with the Minister.  The other two amendments are very important, particularly for local authorities that are being revalued at the same time as a global valuation.  There is also a mechanism for appeals.</p> <p> The revaluation will deliver a figure for each of the relevant local authorities.  What that means for local authority finances is a separate process.  We are engaging with the local authorities on funding and perhaps in the Estimates process later this year.  Both of those processes are operating in parallel, although the valuation is taking place in an information vacuum until the final figure is produced.</p> <p>  The apportionment under the Act is done by the commissioner.  I understand that the previous apportionments have been done by population.  Perhaps my colleagues would like to add to that.</p></speech>

For clarification, that apportionment is set out in section 53 of the Valuation Act 2001 and it is done by order.  As Mr. Quinlan said, it is done in consultation with the commissioner but the Minister is empowered under the legislation to make the order.  To date, all global utilities have been apportioned on a population basis.  As Mr. Quinlan said, two other global utilities, the ESB and EirGrid, are being revalued next year.  Previously, they would have been apportioned under that order on the basis of population data in the census.  It has been done that way to date because it is independently verifiable, treats every local authority the same way and the data are transparent and robust.  Those are the only reasons that approach has been taken.  It is a decision for the Minister to make later this year but I expect the same apportionment mechanism to apply to the three utilities this year.</p></speech>

Some counties will lose out significantly on this apportionment if it is done on a population basis because until now, the valuations have been done on the basis of the assets in each county.  What will happen if there is a gap between the revenues in the counties?</p> <p>  Before the Minister comes in, I want the witnesses to help me get my head around half of the letters of the alphabet in amendment No. 15.  I assume these are related to global valuations and national valuations that happen in the same year.  For the life of me, I still cannot work it out.  The Department has used 11 letters of the alphabet to come up with a formula that is mind-boggling, to say the least.  I presume the purpose is to protect counties which have a global revaluation and a national revaluation in the same year.  If nothing is done, they would lose out on the global revaluation but I do not know why we need a formula with 11 characters in it to try to calculate it.  The simple approach would be to take the complete valuation out of the equation along with its revenue, deal with what is left over and then add it all back together in order that the county would get the benefit.  I have not tried to work out the figures A to K because I lost the will to live and I do not want the land the Minister in it when he comes in.</p> <p>  I have concerns about Irish Water and about what exactly is happening here because I honestly lost the will to continue.  I got as far as F before deciding I had enough.  I just could not work it out.  Will the officials explain exactly how the formula should be worked out using A to K and what steps are taken?</p></speech>

I am acutely aware of the potential impact on local authorities, a number of which have written to us directly, but it is based on estimates of what they know.  We will work out the impact on each local authority and what the valuation will be.  Our understanding is it will have a significant impact on some local authorities.  Others will benefit from it, but it is only when one has the table that one can see that there will be a process.  I have said to the local authorities that we will have to engage on that issue.  We are working with them and the Valuation Office to bring them together to try to understand the process.  It would be good if the local authorities received the information at the same time as the Minister on the preliminary work.  At least, we could then all work out the figures and work off the same numbers.  Under statute, the commissioner makes a recommendation and the Minister then decides and makes an order.</p></speech>

The formula is complex and hard to explain and understand.  I might get ready to bat it to a colleague.  The aim of the provision is to separate the standard national revaluation, the global revaluation, and the ongoing impact of Irish Water.  We have crunched the numbers in the Department.  It is safe to say we made a similar assumption to the Deputy that a much simpler process was possible and to add it back in at the end, but we could not get the numbers to work.  We made an actuarial assessment, but it was not working out.  We reviewed the formula in consultation with the Valuation Office.  The draft members have related to the Committee Stage amendment is not straightforward, but it is what is being proposed.  We are as confident as we can be that it is what will work.  Ms O'Gorman might address more technical matters.</p></speech>

If we had pulled out the global income and worked out the rate limitation order with reference to non-global income, it would have made the ARV process very complex.  Two elements of the formula were changed from what we are proposing.  The portion G is to take account in the formula of possible leakage on appeal.  Following a revaluation, relevant properties can appeal to the Valuation Tribunal and the valuation may be revised downwards.</p></speech>

The amendment we are proposing is that element G in the formula account for the average percentage loss of income on appeal and that it be advised to the Minister by the Commissioner of Valuation when making the order.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in carrying out their functions and the only party who would able to provide the data accurately.  That is the first proposed amendment.  The second concerns the second portion of the formula in the second set of brackets.  At present, if a global valuation is revised upwards or a new global valuation such as Irish Water this year is added, it cannot be factored in in the formula.  As it is, the local authority cannot get the value of it.  The second portion of the formula is to allow for that buoyancy to be accounted for.  If we raise the upper limit in the rate limitation order for the local authorities concerned, it means that they will be able to get the benefit of a new valuation, or if the figure for the ESB or EirGrid was to go up, it would also apply.</p></speech>

We are confident that amending the formula is the best way to do it.  We want to tweak it to take account of appeals, the leakage that can come from them and the effect it can have on equity in the payment of rates overall.  This matter is critical because of the potential inequity in revaluing in counties at the same time as there is a global change.  It is an anomaly in the formula.  The best way to try to fix it is to fix the formula.  We have taken the advice of the people who are expert in the matter.</p></speech>

For the purposes of this discussion, we will allow it to go through, but I would like to examine it by the time the Bill reaches Report Stage next week.  With regard to appeals, there would be leakage in the determination of an ARV.  Why is it a factor in this instance?  I ask the question not having studied the matter fully.</p></speech>

Therefore, it can adjust its ARV upwards or downwards as it sees fit to earn a certain income from rates.  The local authorities which are subject to a rate limitation order because there was a revaluation in the previous year have no flexibility and there will inevitably be a loss.  They will be limited by the value in the rate limitation order and the ARV will have to be set in accordance with it.  This will give them a little more flexibility.  The amount in the rate limitation order will take account of a percentage for leakage and will be a little higher.  It is the upper limit to which they can raise rates, but it will give them the flexibility to do so which they currently lack.</p></speech>

Sometimes the tribunal might make a ruling on the valuation of a business which might have retrospective effect.  Some local authorities might find themselves having to provide refunds, assuming rates have been collected if there is an appeal.  The leakage on appeal provision proposed for insertion into the formula is simply to ensure the revaluation will remains revenue neutral.  The evidence suggests that when an appeal works it way through the system and the impact is fully known - this can take a number of years because of the volume of appeals - a revaluation is not revenue-neutral and that in some instances it is a considerable cost to individual local authorities.  This will allow the formula to be adjusted on the basis of the expertise of the commissioner and their advice and to be factored in immediately, rather than having to deal with the consequences a couple of years later.</p></speech>

In terms of the volume, etc. of appeals that came to us, that increased with our Reval work.  A little piece of work will do that.  It would be better to reduce that time so that the piece is more known.  In a way we have the flexibility.  If the risk of leakage on appeals is reduced because appeals are quicker then that can be taken into account and that would be a low element of the extra ceiling that is needed.  In the interim it could be a significant loss to a local authority.  That is not the way the system was designed to be because the RLO has been based on a figure that in actual fact may not materialise because of these appeals.</p></speech>

There are a couple of other things separate to the Bill.  I would see this as an important building block.  In terms of the overall valuation process, revisions, etc., the Valuation Office signed a contract this week to bring in extra resources specifically to do the revisions in the next group of Revals.  The Valuation Office has gone through a lot of them themselves.  The other piece is how the Valuation Tribunal operates.  That definitely needs to be modernised and made more efficient.  We are looking at those.  They do not all necessarily need to be done in legislation.

In order to ensure the smooth running of the meeting, any member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk to the committee if they have not already done so.  Deputy Cassells has already informed the committee that he is substituting for Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I propose that after a period of two hours that we take a break for approximately ten minutes, if required.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with special responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy Phelan, and his officials to the meeting.</p> <p>  At the request of broadcasting and recording services, members are requested that for the duration of the meeting, mobile phones are to be turned off completely or switched to airplane mode.  It is not sufficient to put phones on silent mode, as it maintains a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p></speech>

It may have been discussed earlier but I wish to outline the provisions of those amendments.  Section 10 is about notification procedures and the amendment will enhance the existing provisions of the section to ensure there is an obligation on ratepayers to register with the local authority and to notify it of any material changes in respect of rateable properties.  A difficulty in obtaining such information, for example, concerning a change of occupier or a change in the legal name of the business, has proven to be a barrier to the effective levying and collection of rates for many local authorities, placing a clear statutory obligation on the occupier-ratepayer and this amendment will mitigate that.</p><p>The amendment to section 4 relates to the making of the rate process and the provision for additions and amendments to the valuation lists and changes to occupation to be immediately effective for rating purposes.  Currently rates are levied on properties that exist on the valuation list on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means that additions of new properties or amendments to the valuation lists during the year are not effective for rates until the following financial year and the following budget year.  It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 4 to allow for additions and amendments to the valuation lists to become immediately effective for rating purposes.</p><p>A further amendment to section 4 provides that where a person becomes the occupier or enters into an agreement which entitles him or her to occupy the relevant property on a date after 1 January in any year, a local authority should charge that person a charge adjusted to reflect the remaining period of the year.  Currently the person in occupation on the date of the making of the rate is liable for the entire year.  This is an anomaly which the amendment seeks to address.  It is now proposed that the local authority should adjust the charge or demand issue to the person who was in occupation on 1 January or after 1 January where there were more than one previous occupier in that year, so that the charge for the full year is apportioned between the different occupiers during the year on a<i>pro rata</i>basis.  </p><p>The introduction of a rates compliant certificate will mean that if a ratepayer seeking a certain licence from a particular local authority, he or she may be required to demonstrate to that same authority that the rates bill has either been paid or is subject to a payment plan.  This measure is intended to facilitate a more joined up approach within individual local authorities without being overly burdensome and as a measure to encourage business to meet their rates obligations and to engage with local authorities.  Subject to the drafting being finalised this amendment will introduce the concept of this rates compliance certificate for the first time and can be kept under review in terms of its effectiveness.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019062600002#J00900"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:<br /><br />&ldquo; &ldquo;Act of 2015&rdquo; means the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015;&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment and is included to cater for an amendment to section 20.  Section 20 is being expanded to include two separate references to the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.</p><p> I will now turn to amendment No. 15.  Currently, rates are levied on properties on the valuation that exists on the date of the making of the local authority budget.  This means that the addition of new properties - this refers in part to what I said earlier - or amendments to the valuation list during the year are not effective for rates until the financial year following the making of the budget.  Amendment No. 15, as set out in the proposed expanded section 20, subsection (a), provides that additions and amendments to the valuation list become immediately effective for rating purposes.</p><p> As for the proposed sections 20(b) and 20(c), currently there are differences in the timeframes allowed to public utilities undertakings and other ratepayers as set out in the Valuation Act.  There are no objectively justifiable reasons that different or more generous time periods should be given to public utility companies, as opposed to private citizens or to citizens with businesses.  The current provisions in this regard appear to give rise to different treatment for different categories of ratepayers.  The proposed amendments to sections 53 and 54 address this and ensure an equitable and more efficient streamlined process for all ratepayers.</p><p> The proposed section 20(d) is about rate limitation orders, which was also discussed earlier.  It concerns section 56 of the Valuation Act and amends the formula on which rate limitation orders are based.  There are two elements to the formula.  First, the rate limitation order is introduced for local authorities following a revaluation process to ensure the revaluation is revenue neutral.  Revaluation results in a redistribution of commercial rates liability between ratepayers depending on the relative shift in the rental value of the properties in relation to one another.  In practice, however, local authorities lose out on income from successful appeals to the Valuation Tribunal, which means the revaluation exercise is not revenue neutral as intended.  To mitigate this, it is intended to amend the rate limitation order formula to allow for the inclusion of a factor that takes account of the level of appeals.  It is proposed to add this factor in order that the upper limit of rates income in the year following revaluation is raised slightly to take account of leakage on the appeal following revaluation.  The factor would be agreed annually by the Minister and by the Commissioner of Valuation.</p><p> The second part, which is a further amendment to the formula for calculating rates limitation orders, is also proposed.  As it is currently worded, section 56 has the unintended consequence of linking the standard revaluation programme, which is carried out on a cyclical basis, with the valuation cycle for global utility companies.  This has a particularly acute impact for any county or local authority undergoing a standard revaluation that coincides with a new valuation of a global utility.  It means that the mandatory rate limitation order will limit the rates income from that utility.  The global utilities are network based operators with a national presence and include telecommunications operators, ESB, EirGrid and Irish Rail.  Irish Water will become a global utility in the coming months and is currently being revalued for this purpose.  Authorities being revalued currently stand to lose out from any additional rates income from Irish Water at a potential cost of significant sums.  Included in the revaluation process at the moment are Fingal, Tipperary, Meath, Wicklow, Wexford, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  The addition of the second portion of the formula for the rates limitation order calculation will ensure the buoyancy achieved for new or revised global utility evaluations can be accounted for in the formula, which sets the upper limit for rates income in the following year.  In other words, it will accrue to the local authority and they will not have to balance it out with other existing ratepayers, and therefore will potentially see a rate reduction for some of the utility companies.  That is an unintended consequence of the current system.</p></speech>

There is no point in going through half the alphabet and discussing it all over again.  We are willing to support this amendment today with a view to having a closer look at it when the staff have agreed to send us on the details of that formula and how the amendment around the A to K formula is actually worked out practically.</p> <p>  We had a detailed discussion on Irish Water - I do not know if the Minister of State was listening in on that - and on the revaluation that is taking place.  With regard to Irish Water and how it is distributed further down the line, Wicklow had all of its water assets valued and had them rateable - unlike some local authorities that did not have theirs - and at this stage it looks like Wicklow will be at a significant loss if it is done on a population basis compared with how it is currently calculated.  In fairness to the staff, they have given us a clear indication of how that can be sorted out in the longer term.  In the last session I said that the buoyancy generated by EirGrid and by ESB could potentially be used by the Minister to sort out the discrepancies with regard to Irish Water.  I want to have this on the record again but at the moment I can say that we may want to bring forward amendments to this section on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with the thrust of anything he has said but I have two questions for clarification on amendment No 15, specifically on the proposed section 20(d).  Even though the title is "Power to limit rates income" can I take it to mean this is really to ensure that local authorities do not lose out financially either from losing appeals or from the global revaluations of the utility companies?  Is this essentially the nub of it?</p></speech>

In order for the local authority to not lose out from losing those appeals and for the overall rates income to be revenue neutral, it means that somebody else will have to pay more.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify how that will operate and how it will impact on the local authority, given that many of the people who appeal the rate increase through a revaluation do not necessarily pay the rates until the appeal is concluded.  What happens if other people who did not get a rates increase then get hit with a rates increase in order to meet the revenue neutrality that is set out in this?  Does this make sense?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019062600002#K00600"><p>I am aware there are other questions but I will start with that question while it is fresh in my head.  The idea behind the proposed section 20(d) is as the Deputy has said.  The legislation as currently worded would allow for that situation to occur every number of years where a revaluation of utilities coincides with a revaluation of X number of local authorities.  This would see any potential increase - or buoyancy - from revenue received in rates from the utilities offset against other existing rates received from existing businesses in their local area.  The main purpose of section 20(d), as proposed in amendment No. 15,  is to ensure that this loophole is covered off.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the appeals process and he makes a valid point.  Talk is ongoing between departmental officials and the Valuation Office to ensure staffing levels will be sufficient to allow for valuations to occur and for appeals to be heard in a timely fashion.  When the revaluation process was introduced originally, as everybody is aware, it was intended to be a revenue-neutral change and that any increases would be offset by decreases to other ratepayers in the local authority area.</p> <p>  On the length of time for appeals to be heard, members who deal with local authority members will know that when rates are agreed at budget meetings in the local authority, sometimes - even with the best of intentions by members and officials - if there are a number of appeals outstanding and if there are appeals that have been successful, it has led to a situation where the cost has not always been neutral with a resulting loss or reduction on the books of the local authority in terms of the potential income it thought it was going to accrue from commercial rates.</p><p>Part of amendment No. 15 is designed as an attempt to ensure that such revenue neutrality will occur into the future.  It does not fully occur at present but varies from local authority to local authority.  Amendment No. 15 refers to the change that will allow for another figure or factor to be used in respect of the volume of appeals and the difference between what was agreed by the local authority at budget time and what it can sometimes turn out to be.  The purpose of that particular section of the amendment is to ensure that this shortfall is as small as possible and may be fully eliminated.  I hope that answers some of what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has asked.</p><p> As to Deputy Casey's point, the process of valuation for Irish Water has not been completed yet.  Off the top of my head, Wicklow has significant water infrastructure, which serves a far greater region than Wicklow alone and that obviously would be a reason for Wicklow to have a greater commercial rate potential from Irish Water than most other local authorities.   </p><p> I fully agree with the Deputy, and it is his entitlement, to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that Wicklow would see a commensurate benefit from that Irish Water revaluations process when it is completed.  As to whether it will be offset, there is a further job to be done in the local government section as to how the Local Government Fund is administered in future.  I believe everyone present has been a member of the local authority at some stage and understands the number of movable parts that currently exist in the local authority fund, many of which are grossly outdated at this stage.  We need a more simplified, streamlined method of allocating local authority funding that is more easily explicable to the public.  That might well mean that a situation like the Deputy has outlined as to some of the buoyancy that is obtained from utility companies in the future would be distributed in a different manner.  I do not want to pre-empt whatever the ultimate outcome would be by completely agreeing with Deputy Casey.</p></speech>

An earlier definition of &quot;owner&quot; already exists in rating law exists in section 14 of the Local Government Act 1946 which defines the owner as the person for the time being entitled to occupy a vacant hereditament at the time of the making of the rate, which is old rates wordage.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 is another technical amendment and relates to deleting in page 6 line 34, &quot;Notice of&quot; and substituting &quot;A rates bill stating&quot;.  It is preferable to describe the notice that is being issued seeking payment of the rates as a rates bill.  The phrase, &quot;rates bill&quot; is the term already used in current rating legislation.  In Article 25 of the Local Government (Financial Procedures and Audit) Regulations 2014 &quot;rates bill&quot; is distinctive, self-explanatory and stands from out other statutory notices served by local authorities.  The number of rates bills that are issued also vastly exceeds any other statutory notice and are therefore worthy of a distinct title.</p><p>Amendment No. 4  is effectively the same amendment, which is to delete &quot;the notice&quot; and substitute &quot;the rates bill&quot; for exactly the same reasons that I have just outlined.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 is the same amendment, which is, in page 7, line 6, to delete &ldquo;A notice&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;A rates bill&rdquo;, with the very same explanation.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 proposes, on page 7, line 11, to delete &ldquo;in a prepaid registered letter&rdquo;.  The number of rates bills served by local authorities is considerable.  It is some 5,000 to 6,000 in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Council and multiples of this in the case of Dublin City Council.  In the event that a rates bill could not be served by ordinary post, the efficiency of the current rates recovery process would be affected to a major extent.  This would result in significant delay in the recovery of rates and the need for local authorities to apply further resources for the purpose of serving rates bills upon occupiers of rated properties who have refused to accept the service of a rates bill by registered post.</p><p>Amendment  No. 7 is also a technical amendment to allow for a rates bill to be addressed to the owner or occupier, if the name of the liable person is not known.  Addressing a rates bill to the owner or occupier is likely to arise in only exceptional circumstances, but the existing ability of a rating authority to address a rates bill to an owner or occupier, which is in Regulation No. 42 of SI 508 of 2002, which is superseded by Regulation 28 of SI 226 of 2014, should be retained in the new Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018, notwithstanding that it is not possible to issue legal proceedings for recovery of rates without identifying the name of the occupier.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the majority of those amendments are fine and are basically technical amendments.  The exception to that is amendment No. 2.  Before I register that position, I seek clarity and have a question.  My understanding of amendment No. 2 is that it changes the provision of the vacant property charge, in the case of a vacant property, from the owner being charged to whosoever is entitled to occupy it at that point in time.  Is that correct?</p> <p>  What would the Minister of State say to the assertion that this would tend to benefit landlords over occupiers at any one time?  Is there any compelling logic as to why that change is needed in his view?</p></speech>

I wish we had that many to send out in Wicklow.</p> <p>  I am not 100% sure what is the purpose of amendment No. 7.  Is it to take liability away from the person who was using the property and putting it back on the owner or occupier?  My understanding is that if the owner or occupier of the property informs the local authority with the name and address of the person who is renting the property, the liability then stays with that person and does not revert back to the owner-occupier.  If that is the case, why is this amendment needed, if the liability is not transferable to the owner-occupier?</p></speech>

If the liability on the owner-occupier ceases, why is it the case that, where "the name of the liable person concerned cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, a rates bill under this section may be addressed to "the occupier" or "the owner"" of the property?</p></speech>

It is often the case - in fact, I would say it is the case in most examples - that the owner is the occupier, particularly where it is a small operation paying the rates.  The compelling case for this change is that, if an owner rents a premises to a person who runs a business in it and the latter decides to cease trading for whatever reason, rates legislation has always operated to the effect that the latter is the person on whom the liability falls.  Rates are not a property tax or anything else other than a charge on commercial activity in order to fund local authority activities in the area.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 is necessary to meet those very rare cases where people have not registered.  Deputy Casey is right about the legal validity of a rates bill issued to the owner.  Currently, if an operator cannot be ascertained, the next logical fallback is generally for the rates authority to engage with the arms of the State that operators register their properties with, for example, the Property Registration Authority, and determine where the bill should be served.  The Deputy is right to point out that this would not occur often, but we are trying to ensure that there is a specific process that a rateable authority can go through in order to ascertain who the occupier of the premises is.</p></speech>

While I understand the logic presented by the Minister of State, this amendment seems to read that, even though I as the owner have provided the local authority with all of the necessary information, I will be next in line if the occupier absconds.  Does the amendment place the liability back on me?  I am concerned.  Given the way this is worded, it looks like the liability owed ends up-----</p></speech>

It still rests with the occupier, which relates to Deputy Barry's first question.  This is just a method of trying to ensure that the rates bill is served.  A local authority does not always have accurate information as to who the occupier is.  It is another attempt to get that information in a small number of cases.  It does not reverse in any way the liability that is currently placed on occupiers over owners.</p></speech>

As Mr. Quinlan told us, appeals by businesses have increased in recent years from just a couple of hundred to thousands.  There are 1,000 appeals on the books as we speak.  The Minister of State well knows that the impact on a business of a revaluation and significant increase, a situation caused by the Valuation Office not having kept pace with the process in recent years, is massive and can be very detrimental to a small business.  The thrust of this amendment allows for the staggered payment of rates so that a business is allowed to meet a significant increase over a period of time instead of being hit with it in one go.</p></speech>

There is not a Member of the House, be he or she in government or anywhere else, who does not get many queries from constituents on this issue, particularly in local authority areas that have undergone the revaluation process.  The Deputy is right to point out the number of appeals and the delays in same.  We have a responsibility to ensure that commercial rates bring &euro;1.4 billion into the local authority sector.  Were that figure adjusted downward significantly, it would have serious consequences for our local government system.</p> <p>  It is my intention in the autumn to deal specifically with the valuation side of this process.  As practitioners, we all know that rates and valuations are two sides of the same coin.  The Commissioner of Valuation operates independently of the Government and every elected politician, local and national.  That is important, as the job the commissioner must do should be completely independent of politics.  Equally, however, the Oireachtas has a responsibility to review from time to time the legislation underpinning the valuations process.  That is why I am determined to do so in the autumn of this year.  I will not use the word "anomalies", but there are a number of pinch points in certain sectors of the economy, particularly in small rural communities and villages where there is only a business or two that, in effect, can often act as a social service as much as commercial operations.</p><p>Other arms of Government - for example, the Minister, Deputy Ring's Department and the local government section - are constantly trying to do their utmost to improve the quality of life for people in these communities throughout the country and sometimes it can seem that commercial rate provisions do not have the same interests at heart, and they do not.  There is a conflict there.  The rating system is designed to ensure a level playing field or an even system is operated across the country in the way we collect commercial rates.  Equally, with respect not only to isolated rural areas but to some of the more deprived urban centres in towns and cities across the country where smaller business premises have closed in recent years, there is a desire, politically, across all sides for those local businesses to be retained and to ensure that valuation rules or anything around them would not be a contributory factor to the closure of such business.  In the autumn of this year it is very much my intention that we would bring forward legislation on valuations.</p><p> To answer specifically the amendment in the name of Deputy Darragh O'Brien proposed by Deputy Cassells, the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Department has been informed that the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability reduced following a revaluation and 40% have had their liability increased, which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the national programme advances.</p><p> With respect to reported cases where the rates liability has increased by multiples of the original bill, the Department has been informed that while such increases may have occurred in some isolated cases, increases of this level would be a rarity.  Possible reasons for significant increases where they occur would be that the valuation of some of these properties had not been revised to take account of improvement, extensions, etc., for some considerable time or where the valuations were historically low in comparison to the general level of valuations on the valuation list.</p><p> Additionally, some properties may have undergone extensive refurbishment and this was not reflected in the valuation immediately before the revaluation that is now in train.  It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by the local authorities.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provides that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government having obtained the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is obliged to make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid in the previous year, plus buoyancy arising from valuations determined in the year of a revaluation of newly constructed property and adjusted for inflation as measured by the consumer price index, CPI.</p><p> Rate limitation orders have been made in each local authority that has undergone a revaluation to date and further orders will be made in respect of future revaluations as they arise.  Ultimately, any undue or contrived delay in achieving up to date valuations in line with current property rental values would result in unfairness in the levelling of rates.  A proposal to phase in increases in valuations over a number of years would either see the shortfall in rates income being made up by other ratepayers in the form of higher rates bills or would be absorbed by the local authorities.  In light of that, it is not my intention to accept this amendment.  </p><p> We will have to examine in some detail the valuations system in the fall of this year.  There is already a review of some of the exemptions that currently exist under the Valuation Acts under way, to which I would have referred in a few of my responses to parliamentary questions.  We, as an Oireachtas, should ensure we have legislation in place to take on board that review.  I believe we can do that in the fall of this year.  It need not necessarily be major legislation but it could deal some of the issues Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment seeks to address, which is to avoid a situation where there can be severe increases on individuals.  Sometimes there can be a significant delay in the hearing of appeals and the process of revaluation is a little slower than we would like.  In that proposed legislation we should be able to address some of those concerns.</p></speech>

I put on the record that I am a commercial ratepayer so that everybody knows that.  Wicklow went through it is revaluation process this year and March was an exceptionally busy month in my office.  The purpose of this amendment to take the shock out of a revaluation system.  As the Minister of Sate said, 40% of properties received an increase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019062600002#N00300"><p>Those owners of those properties were not the ones who telephoned the Deputy's office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019062600002#N00400"><p>It was the 40% who received an increase who contacted my office not the 60% who did not receive an increase.  While the Minister of State mentioned that properties could have had improvements carried out and extensions added, the critical factor is that a revaluation had not been carried out in Wicklow during the past 30 years.  The fundamental problem is that revaluations do not take place often enough.  I have been contacted by owners of several properties facing a 300% to 400% increase in their rates liability for no reason other than they are located on a street that has seen much improvement in that period while they have not made any improvements to their properties.  It is hard for a small business to take that hit and to be asked to do so in one year.  This amendment seeks to harmonise that liability over a period of time.  In the absence of the legislation the Minister of State proposes to the Valuation Office, a harmonisation measure such as that proposed in the amendment is required.  I speak from my experience in Wicklow when we had to harmonise the town council rate with the local authority rates and we had a similar situation with properties decreasing in value and other properties increasing in value.  Therefore, it is possible to harmonise rates over a period of time when we can examine the figure with which we are dealing at the end of the day.  I went into family businesses that were on their knees when they got their revaluations.  It is not acceptable to say there is nothing in place to assist small businesses to deal with the shock of the impact of a revaluation that is not of their own making.  This is the State&rsquo;s fault.  It does not have a proper revaluation system.  It was nearly 40 years since Wicklow had a revaluation carried out.  My business suffered a 100% increase as result of its revaluation.  We had not had a revaluation in more than 20 years.  We, as a party, will be pushing this amendment.  In the absence of the legislation the Minister of State is proposing there is nothing in place to assist the small and medium sector to deal with the shock they face on foot of a revaluation.</p></speech>

He said there were only isolated cases where there were significant increases and that they were a rarity.  Meath had a revaluation this year, as had Wicklow, and Westmeath and Longford had revaluations last year.  I kept all the local newspapers from that period.  Individual businesses had significant increases and they were certainly not rarities.  If the Minister of State has been told they were rarities he has been wrongly advised.  Certain businesses such as public houses and so forth were hit with multiple increases which have the potential to close those businesses.  That is what this amendment seeks to address.  People want to pay the charges being levied on them but the issue the way they can do so.  The Minister of State admitted in his response to me that a phasing arrangement should be examined.  That is what we are pushing for in this amendment.  As Deputy Casey said, this scenario is developing because of the tardiness of the Valuation Office.  I tackled its representatives when they appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter.  The sheer lack of pace in the manner in which they are doing their job has caused this situation in the first place in the context of the timeframes involved.</p><p>That has already been admitted and accepted this morning.  The Minister of State agreed that the appeals process and delays in that regard are adding to the problem.  As I said, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I understand the Commissioner of Valuation engaged in a process with vintners groups whereby some of those difficulties were ironed out or an agreement was reached that was more acceptable to the vintners.  Following a number of requests to the Commissioner of Valuation in recent months, he indicated regarding the fuel retail sector that consultation and engagement were ongoing between the Valuation Office and the representative group of the fuel retail sector, the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, IPRA.  The commissioner has agreed to consider adjustments to the valuation scheme for service stations, including changes that would result in reductions in valuations based on detailed evidence to be provided by the IPRA.  That process is under way.</p> <p>  More broadly, the Valuation Office engages in ongoing consultation with other sectoral groups on the methodology used in the revaluation programme.  In that context, the commissioner has committed to fully examining any additional detailed information provided by sporting or equestrian bodies.  A number of Members of both Houses were made aware of issues among sporting and equestrian bodies caused by significant increases arising from the revaluation process.  The Commissioner of Valuation has indicated that in sectors where significant community and voluntary services are provided along with commercial activities, he is open to considering adjustments to the valuation scheme, including changes that would result in reductions in valuations based on detailed evidence to be provided by the sectoral representative bodies.</p> <p>  I welcome the Commissioner of Valuation's engagement with the vintners' representatives, service station representative groups and sporting bodies to try to iron out some of the significant issues that have emerged in the revaluation process.  I always felt that it was crazy that voluntary bodies were levied with commercial rates when certain exemptions from rates are provided under the valuation legislation for activities which, on the face of it, appear to be commercial in nature.  To return to my earlier point, that is the reason we will need legislation on valuation in the autumn.  The commissioner's engagement has the potential to deal with some of the issues raised in the amendment.</p> <p>  I reiterate that a full review of staffing is under way to identify additional numbers that may be needed to ensure the revaluation process is speeded up.  Deputy Casey is correct.  I do not know the exact figure for Wicklow but it could well be 30 or 40 years since the previous revaluation in the county.  The target is to try to have a revaluation process approximately every seven years.  That would avoid the emergence of significant spikes in rates, such as those with which every Member of the Oireachtas has been presented.  In light of that, I am not in a position to accept the amendment, although I accept many of the issues that gave rise to it.  Some of these matters are being addressed, while others will be addressed in legislation in the autumn.</p></speech>

It is also the case that, where local elected representatives are given a mandate to make decisions, they often complain - I receive such complaints - that their hands are tied too much on issues.  They have a free hand in how they operate and vote and in the decisions they take in the formation of budgets.</p><p>Under the legislation governing rates currently, a local authority may provide up to 100% relief on rates where a premises is vacant due to renovation, repairs or the owner being unable to find a tenant.  Outside the city councils of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, which historically had separate legal provisions enabling a refund of 50% on vacant properties, the practice has generally been for elected members to give 100% relief.  The introduction of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave discretion to the elected members of an authority to vary the rate refund levels applicable to individual areas within the authority's administrative area.  The lack of any charge on vacant premises may act as a disincentive for the property to be put to its best use.  Vacancy refunds also introduce a level of uncertainty regarding the revenue that a local authority can collect.</p><p>Section 8 provides that a local authority may provide for a temporary abatement for vacant properties subject to any maximum relief, which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners other than those whose rates liability would be below the <i>de minimis </i>threshold may make some level of payment to the local authority.  The section allows the Minister to prescribe that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  To incentivise the elected members, it is proposed that the revenue accruing from further reduction in the vacancy refund beyond this level would be added to the general allocations of the municipal districts in the local authorities.</p><p>A public consultation provision as envisaged by the amendment would be similar to the one in place in advance of the annual setting by a local authority of the local adjustment factor in respect of the LPT.  The public consultation on the LPT adjustment factor enhances the strength of the relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  I accept that public consultation during the development of a scheme for the abatement of rates on vacant properties can similarly strengthen the process, but the amendment as drafted inserts a new regulation-making power for the Minister under the proposed section 8(13).  Section 8(3) provides regulation-making power for the Minister for the purposes of this section and it would appear that this amendment would be more properly located in that subsection.  I am happy to accept the thinking behind the amendment, but it should be redrafted for insertion into section 8(3) on Report Stage.</p></speech>

There are pros and cons to an abatement decision.</p><p>One of the pros is the benefit to the local businesses or the ratepayers but one of the negatives is the potential loss of revenue to the local authority and the resultant impact.  Having a consultation process would allow some of those issues to be teased out.  When I was on South Dublin County Council we found a way to have an abatement, effectively, even though that was not what it was called.  We operated a kind of survey for small and medium-sized businesses and that worked well.  We found, however, that the level of take-up from small and medium-sized businesses was low.  It was difficult for us to get the injection of cash back out to those small and medium-sized enterprises.  If we had public consultation that might have increased the take-up in the first and second years.  It was not a great deal of money for some businesses but it was certainly better than nothing.  I am, therefore, minded to support this amendment or one from officials that might be better drafted.  The principle is a good one.  </p></speech>

It seeks to make regulations regarding an inability to pay clause for rateable premises.  In our earlier discussions the Minister of State spoke about the money being brought in from rates as amounting to &euro;1.5 billion.  That is funding 34% of the total local government budget.  It is a significant amount of money and that has increased by some 14% over the last decade alone.  I have consistently stated, in the Chamber and different committees, my fear that that money from rates is becoming a significant crutch for local authorities in how they source their funding.  In that context, every year the Minister requests the councils to show restraint regarding increases, apply that restraint and ensure that they are fair on businesses.  Some councils, however, in seeking to do imaginative works beyond the norm, will seek the only source of funding available and that is rates.  As a result some people are unable to pay the rates and this is at a time when we are trying to promote local businesses outside of the main city centres.  We have seen the impact on small towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Anyone canvassing during the local and European elections would have seen that major impact.  </p><p>The Minister of State mentioned earlier what the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, is trying to do.  The nuts and bolts of the situation, however, are that people do not have the cash to open their businesses because of debts and that is killing town centres.  Certain towns are doing well and powering along but there are also many that are not.  The imbalance and disparity between the bigger and the smaller ones is growing.  In that context, this inability to pay clause should be inserted into the Bill.  I pay tribute to directors of finances throughout the country who are trying, on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, to work with premises experiencing difficulties.  There are councils, chief executives and directors of finance trying their best to ensure that those experiencing difficulties are given a fair shake.  We should put those efforts on a statutory footing and acknowledge the impact.  An inability to pay clause should be inserted into the Bill.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-26a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019062600002#Q01400"><p>I argue, in a sense, that the provisions in this legislation will allow for those discussions.  The inability to pay clause is, effectively, being inserted into the Bill, albeit by a different mechanism, to some extent where a ratepayer has entered into an agreed payment plan.  The provisions under section 11 of the Bill are based on the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provide for the addition of interest to unpaid taxes to the Revenue Commissioners and in this respect aims to see rates treated on a similar basis.  This measure is proposed as a further incentive to promote compliance with the payment of rates.  There is no current legal provision for the imposition of a penalty for the late payment of rates.</p> <p>  The non-availability of a sanction, such as the charging of interest on late payments of rates, is regarded by rating authorities as a major weakness in rating law.  It is considered that the charging of interest on the late payments of rates would be an effective method of accelerating collection within the current year and improving cash flow.  The interest would accrue from 1 January of the following year and would only apply where a ratepayer refuses to enter into an agreed payment plan with the local authority.  As such the introduction of interest on unpaid rates is focussed on incentivising engagement with the local authority rather than increasing the income of local authorities.  </p> <p>  Local authorities have a long-standing record, as the Deputy has outlined, of working closely with businesses experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  I reiterate that one of the main provisions in this legislation is that the penalty will only apply where people do not enter into that agreed payment plan with local authorities.  Generally speaking, local authority officials do use discretion with regard to genuine cases of people and businesses with an inability to pay.  I have reservations about the creation of a statutory position whereby an inability to pay is put on the books in the manner proposed by this particular amendment.  The current level of discretion should continue to be operated by the council officials.  That is particularly the case in respect of agreements reached with businesses that may be in difficulty but that have agreed a plan to pay their commercial rates over a period of time.  </p></speech>

I agree that in many cases chief executives and directors of finance are showing that discretion around the country.  It is not always the case, however.  In my own county we have a chief executive who is a former head of finance and our head of finance works closely in that regard as well.  That works well but it is not the experience nationwide, however.  This process needs to be established on a formal footing.  That is because, outside of the greater Dublin area which is experiencing growth and doing well, there is whole different area that needs to be examined.  Putting this process on a statutory footing would focus the mind regarding the severe pressures that some people are under.</p></speech>

I have sympathy with the intent of the amendment but I do not support the mechanism by which this is being done.  We must keep in mind that any such exemption could potentially have a significant impact on the revenue coming into a local authority or, more important, it could have a significant impact on local authorities during an economic downturn for example.  Part of the difficulty with our rates system is that its value is that it gives local authorities a consistent source of revenue regardless of the economic cycle.  The difficulty is that that creates a challenge for businesses.</p> <p>  Nobody has yet found a way to marry those two things, though many people have tried.  I would prefer a mechanism whereby local authorities at particular times could use the abatement process to make democratic decisions about particular problems in particular sectors or locations and they can do that in the full knowledge of the revenue consequences for them.  I would prefer that they have some mechanism to do that.  It would then be possible, at least, to make those local decisions.  I would worry that, even with the best will in the world, if the Minister were to make such regulations it might not be possible to apply them sensibly in each local authority area.</p><p>I get the Deputy&rsquo;s intention but I do not think his amendment solves this particular problem.  During the depth of the recession, local rates officers and managers in a significant number of local authorities took pragmatic decisions to keep businesses alive.  They were in fact beaten up by some politicians in this House because rates collection levels fell significantly.  Deputy Cassells is correct, however, that this did not happen everywhere.  Anything which potentially reduces the revenue of a local authority without it having some control over it, particularly its elected members, is a matter we should caution against.  It is on this basis I will not support the amendment.</p></speech>

In the autumn, local authority members, especially newly-elected councillors, would be seeking to push the boundaries of what local authorities can do.  It is then that they suddenly realise local authority revenue fundraising is very dependent on the commercial rates system.  That is the essence of the problem.</p></speech>

The changes relating to the recently enacted section 37 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 are primarily technical but also to close off a potential means of circumventing the application of aspects of the 2004 Act, such as registration, dispute resolution and rent increase restrictions in rent pressure zones to student-specific accommodation occupied under licence.  Technical amendments are also proposed to clarify that the student-specific accommodation provisions and the provisions requiring annual registration can come into force separately.  The student-specific accommodation provisions are intended to commence in mid-July, prior to the late commencement of the provisions requiring annual registration that are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2020.  That explains the urgency to address this issue before the summer recess.</p><p>The 2019 Act also amended section 19 of the 2004 Act to specify the types of substantial refurbishment works warranting a higher rent level which could qualify for exemption from the rent increase restrictions that operate in rent pressure zones as protected structures are unable to qualify for exemptions on the basis of works to approving their building energy renting.  It is proposed to further amend section 19(5A) of the 2004 Act to allow the first rent set under the tenancy of the protected structure dwelling not rented in the previous 12 months to be the market rent.</p><p>It is also proposed to make a small technical amendment for consistency in the wording of section 3(1) of the 2004 Act by replacing &ldquo;include&rdquo; with &ldquo;applied to&rdquo;.</p><p>I also intend to bring forward amendments to the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2018 at the next Stage with amendment to section 31A and consequential amendments to sections 31AQ and 31AR of the regional spatial and economic strategies.  This is a time-critical amendment which arises in the context of the establishment of the new Office of the Planning Regulator on 23 April 2019.  Section 31A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for ministerial directions regarding regional spatial and economic strategies.  As currently enacted, section 31A provides only that the Minister can issue a direction on foot of a recommendation made to him or her by the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This cannot be satisfied in the three regional spatial and economic strategy processes currently under way, given that each commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  This amendment provides for transitional arrangements to ensure the Minister has a robust legal basis to issue a direction to a regional assembly, if necessary.  The proposed amendments will apply only in respect of the three current regional spatial and economic strategies which commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  Section 31A, and related sections 31AQ and 31AR, will remain valid in the cases of the regional spatial and economic strategies made in the future.</p><p>I also want to flag a further minor technical amendment that is proposed to section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to 2018.  Section 11(1)(<i>a</i>) requires a planning authority to give notice of its intention to review its existing development plan not later than four years after it is made and to prepare a new development for its area.  Sections 11(1)(<i>aa</i>) and 11(1)(<i>ab</i>) allow for an alternate notification period for Cork City and County Councils whereby they may extend the notification period to review their existing development plan from four years to a maximum of five years by way of ministerial order.  This is to facilitate the significant workload and range of complex issues arising from the revisions to the local government arrangements in Cork.  However, the special provisions of Cork City and County Councils were not included in section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) for the purposes of enabling the incorporation of the national planning framework and the regional spatial economic strategy into the development plan.</p><p>For legal certainty, this technical amendment inserts the special provisions for Cork in paragraphs <i>(aa)</i>and <i>(ab)</i>and section 11, subsection (1)<i>(b)</i>(i), (ii) and (iii).  This ensures consistency in section 11(1)<i>(a)</i>and section 11(1)<i>(b)</i>provisions.</p></speech>
