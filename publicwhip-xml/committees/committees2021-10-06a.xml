    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#A00200"><p>I thank the members for participating in today's committee meeting, in line with the exceptional circumstances and measures we must take due to Covid-19.  Members participating in the meeting room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and it will be noticed that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  We urge members not to move a chair from its current position.  They should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for their co-operation in this matter.  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only.  Members are well aware of that point.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Duffy.</p> <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, many workers in sectors across the economy have had to rethink their working arrangements, especially through the introduction of greater flexibility and technology in the workplace.  Today, we are considering another potential new working arrangement in the form of a move to a four-day week as the standard arrangement across the economy, with no loss of pay.  To discuss this issue, I welcome representatives from Four Day Week Ireland, which is a campaign group advocating for a four-day week.  We are joined by the following: Mr. Joe O'Connor, chair, Four Day Week Ireland and pilot programme manager, 4 Day Week Global; Mr. Andrew Barnes, founder, 4 Day Week Global; Ms Margaret Cox, director, ICE Group; and Mr. Kevin Callinan, general secretary, F&oacute;rsa.  From IBEC, we are joined by Ms Maeve McElwee, director of employer relations, and Ms Aoife McFadden, employment law services team.  All the witnesses are participating in the meeting remotely.  </p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Both opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To commence consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. O'Connor to make opening remarks on behalf of Four Day Week Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#A00300"><p>Four Day Week Ireland thanks the committee for the opportunity to present.  We are a campaign coalition formed in 2019, comprising trade unions, businesses and business leaders, environmentalists, women&rsquo;s representatives and academics.  We are part of the 4 Day Week Global foundation, a not-for-profit organisation established by international four-day week pioneer Andrew Barnes, following the successful introduction of a four-day working week in his business, Perpetual Guardian, in New Zealand in 2018.  Since our launch in September 2019, we have been making the case for a gradual, steady and managed transition to a shorter working week in all sectors of the economy.  We have started a public conversation in Ireland on the case for reduced working hours.  Our medium-term objective is for the four-day working week to become the new default work arrangement across the economy, with no loss of pay.</p> <p>  We believe that this is not only achievable but essential as a response to technological change to allow us to future proof our economy and to share the benefits with workers.  A growing body of international evidence, business case studies and academic research shows that a four-day week can be good for business, as well as for workers, families and the environment.  Many companies that have trialled or introduced the four-day week report happier, more focused employees and, critically, higher productivity.  They have experienced reduced employee burnout, stress, sick leave, absenteeism and turnover.  For many businesses concerned with retaining their best employees as well as attracting and recruiting new talent, a shorter working week can provide a competitive edge.</p> <p>  Working less is shown to improve the physical and mental health and well-being of workers.  It would also enable people to spend more time with their families, learn new skills, have more time for rest, leisure and socialisation and to give back to their local communities.  It could also be revolutionary regarding gender equality, allowing better distribution of caring responsibilities between mothers and fathers.  While on a societal level women still do the majority of care work, reduced working time will enable men to spend more time with their families and to take on more caring responsibilities in the home, which in turn will help remove barriers to women achieving senior positions in work, taking on leadership roles and pursuing training opportunities.  Alongside a better work-life balance, a four-day week would also lead to reduced childcare costs for women and families.</p> <p>  Studies also show that a four-day week can significantly reduce carbon emissions and make a huge contribution to our defining collective struggle against climate change.  Research from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden identifies a close correlation between working time and carbon emissions, and projects that reducing the average working week to four days, or equivalent hours, would deliver a reduction in emissions of 16%. </p> <p>  Our campaign seeks to challenge the "always on" culture that has crept into aspects of the Irish economy, which lionises long hours as a perverse badge of honour, and to shift public, political and media narratives about working time reduction.  A shorter working week is not about lazy workers wanting more time off, as some might have one believe.  It is a business improvement strategy centred on working smarter rather than longer and on investing in the well-being of the most important asset to businesses &ndash; their people.  In a poll carried out by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes for Four Day Week Ireland in 2020, an enthusiastic response to the prospect of a four-day week was recorded among the Irish public.  This concept was defined as "the same job, the same goals, the same salary but over four days rather than five".  Just over three quarters, 77%, of those surveyed said they are supportive of the Government exploring the potential introduction of a four-day week.  Among employers that responded, more than two out of three, or 67%, supported the Government doing this.  Encouragingly, almost half of Irish employers, 46%, polled also said that they see trialling a four-day week in their workplace setting as being "feasible".</p> <p>  The four-day working week that we advocate for is a flexible model and not a rigid one-size-fits-all approach.  It is based on the general principle of the 100-80-100 model - 100% of the pay, 80% of the time, but, crucially, in exchange for 100% of the productivity.  The disruption to societal and workplace norms by the Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for different models of work for workers and employers and reinforced the need to rethink old established work patterns.  </p> <p>  The Four Day Week Ireland campaign believes that the future of work requires a shift away from a focus on time spent in the office, at the desk or on the clock.  This is not an effective way to measure people&rsquo;s contributions at work or a rational metric with which to link income.  We must focus instead on measuring and rewarding collective outputs, results and productivity.  In fact, for many of the businesses that have made the four-day working week a success, the core reason they have almost counter-intuitively managed to deliver better business outcomes over four days rather than five is that they have not introduced the four-day week in isolation.  They have trialled the four-day working week as an entry point to a process within their business which focuses on productivity, prioritisation and a more efficient way of working.  They have had an open conversation with their people about how their business can work smarter rather than longer.  They have been clear about the metrics by which the trial will be measured and what success will look like for their business, and upfront that this needs to work for the employee and the employer.  Instead of taking a top-down approach to how this can be delivered, they have empowered their staff to come up with the ideas, solutions and changes to work practices that can ensure that they can maintain or even improve their output over four days rather than five.  It has worked.</p><p> The case we are making for a shorter working week is not that we should adopt a nine-to-five, four-day working week across every economic sector and setting.  Just as the nine-to-five, five-day week might be the standard or most common work arrangement today, it is, of course, not the only arrangement.  There will continue to be a need for different types of flexibility for both workers and employers in order to ensure that working time reduction across society can coexist with ensuring that essential services in both the public and private sectors can continue to operate over five, six and, in some cases, even seven days.  This will require strong management, clever rostering and buy-in from staff.  We do believe, however, that some version of a shorter working week, based on the principle of the "100-80-100" model, is achievable right across the economy.</p><p> This is not just some abstract idea.  The four-day week is working for huge numbers of businesses worldwide.  This includes a long-running landmark trial of a shorter working week in Iceland, which was hailed as an "overwhelming success", with the vast majority of the country's workers securing contracts to shorten their hours.  These trials ran between 2015 and 2019, cutting working weeks to between 35 and 36 hours from a 40-hour week for many, with no reduction in pay.  This included offices, playschools, social service providers and hospitals.  The landmark four-day week trial at Perpetual Guardian in New Zealand in 2018, monitored by academics at the University of Auckland, found engagement levels rose by between 30% and 40%, work-life balance metrics by 44% and so on.  Microsoft Japan's 2019 four-day week trial yielded a 39% increase in productivity.  In the US, leading fintech start-up Bolt and crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, among many others, have recently announced their intention to introduce a four-day working week.  Closer to home, here in Ireland, the four-day week has been successfully adopted by a diverse range of companies in a number of different sectors across the island.  This includes software developers in Donegal, a sales company in Clare and Armagh, a digital agency in Dublin, a legal practice in Newry, a public relations agency in Down and a recruitment, training and consultancy business located in Galway and Limerick, which the committee will hear from later this morning.</p><p> This should come as no surprise.  Numerous academic studies, including from Stanford University's John Pencavel in 2014, show there is no correlation between working long hours and greater productivity.  In fact, according to OECD figures, some of Europe's most productive economies, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, have among the shortest average working hours.  Meanwhile, countries with longer average working hours, such as the UK and Greece, score among the poorest when it comes to productivity.</p><p> In June of this year the Four Day Week Ireland campaign launched the first ever four-day week pilot programme in Ireland, which will enable Irish employers to participate in a co-ordinated six-month trial of the four-day working week alongside similar pilot schemes in other countries, including the US, Canada and New Zealand.  This follows the announcement of national, government-supported trials in other countries, including Spain and Scotland.  As part of this, we have developed a package of tangible supports for employers that agree to participate in the pilot, which will provide those organisations with unparalleled access to the expertise, tools and resources they will need to run a smooth and successful trial.  I hope to get the opportunity to address some of those supports as part of the discussion.</p><p> The roll-out of the six-month trial will take place in early 2022.  Since the launch of the pilot programme, we have had an exceptional response from Irish employers, with over 100 private and voluntary sector companies expressing an interest in participating in the trial.  Around half of those companies recently attended half-day information events held by Four Day Week Ireland on the practicalities of the pilot programme.  We have since secured firm commitments from 17 companies to participate in the pilot, with many others still engaged in advanced internal deliberations and processes about joining.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#B00300"><p>IBEC thanks the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the opportunity to address the considerations of a campaign for a four-day working week.  IBEC is Ireland's largest lobby and business representative group.  Our purpose is to help to build a better, sustainable future by influencing, supporting and delivering for business success.  IBEC engages with key stakeholders in Ireland and internationally and its positions are shaped by our diverse membership, which ranges from small to large and from domestic to multinational businesses.  Our 39 trade associations cover a wide range of industry sectors and include financial services, food and drink, medtech, small firms, retail, property and biopharmachem, to mention just a few.  IBEC represents members who employ over 70% of the private sector workforce in Ireland.<br/><br/>The accelerating pace of change in our workplaces has driven the adoption of new technologies and facilitated many new ways of working for our members.  This era, described as the fourth industrial age, is bringing changes to the way we work, live and relate to one another due to the digital revolution.  While it could be seen as an extension of the third industrial age, that of computerisation, it is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace.  Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country.  And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.  This speed of change has been further fuelled by the events of the past 18 months.  The experience of flexible, remote and hybrid working has grown significantly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with many organisations now considering how they might incorporate the continued benefits of new work structures for the longer term.<br/><br/>The relaxation of the remaining Covid-19 restrictions announced by the Irish Government has employers engaging with the return to the workplace in a significant number of ways and with a significant number of employees who have been working remotely, some for up to 18 months.  Many employers are putting in place for the first time formal remote and hybrid working policies where these are possible.<br/><br/>An IBEC survey of 370 organisations in May 2021 showed that of the employees working remotely at that time, 81% of IBEC members were planning for a hybrid working model, with 15% returning all employees to work fully on site and 4% of those working remotely to continue to do so fully after the relaxation of restrictions.  Across all respondent organisations, three quarters expected the use of hybrid working to increase over the next two to three years, 70% saw a change in the training of managers in managing flexibility, 70% envisaged new ways of working to facilitate that flexibility and 45% foresaw an increase in flexibility on start and finish times over the next two to three years, post Covid.  It is therefore very clear that the traditional working model is changing and that the four-day week or compressed work schedule model is one practice that may provide other opportunities for the right work-life balance for some organisations.  Some members in IBEC have conducted successful trials in this area.<br/><br/>The Four Day Week Ireland website sets out that it seeks as its objective &quot;to move towards the four day week being the standard work arrangement across the economy, with no loss of pay&quot;.  It further states:</p> <blockquote> 	Strong management and clever rostering will need to ensure that businesses and public services can function for 5 or in some cases even 7 days, alongside a shorter working week for all workers. </blockquote> <p>There are a number of well-publicised successful pilots of four-day working weeks, in particular, as mentioned, that of Perpetual Guardian, in New Zealand, an estate planning firm, Microsoft Japan's 2019 trial and the trials in Iceland between 2015 and 2019 in which working hours were reduced to 35 hours a week without pay reduction for 2,500 employees.  The latter covered about 1.3% of the country's population.  All were declared successful on the basis of increased productivity, employee satisfaction and well-being, and reduced absenteeism.  It is clear, therefore, that a four-day working week may suit some organisations and some ways of working.<br/><br/>However, the four-day working week does not suit all organisations.  In the UK, the Wellcome Trust, the second biggest research donor foundation, abandoned its plans to implement a four-day work week in September 2019, with Ed Whiting, its director of policy and chief of staff, stating:</p> <blockquote> 	After extensive internal consultation on whether we should trial the four-day week, we have concluded that it is too operationally complex to implement. </blockquote> <p>A pilot in the city of Gothenburg, in Sweden, introduced a six-hour day for some nurses.  The results of the two-year trial were encouraging, with the nurses becoming &quot;healthier, happier and more energetic&quot;, but the costs were too high.  For 68 nurses to change from eight-hour days to six-hour days on the same salary, 17 new workers were hired at a cost of &euro;1.26 million.  The cost was deemed simply too high and the pilot was abandoned as a result.  The Microsoft trial in Japan, while promoted heavily in the media as having increased production by 40%, noted in its report under &quot;lessons learned&quot;:</p> <blockquote> 	More issues must be considered and arranged before the four-day workweek can be implemented in Microsoft Japan.  After new preparations have been laid out, implementation cannot be readily made.  Thus, another experiment may not be as successful because some employees by nature may not be as patient as the others. </blockquote> <p>I understand that that trial has not been recommenced.<br/><br/>Will a four-day working week attract the same complexities and additional costs as the Wellcome Trust and city of Gothenburg experiences illustrated for some organisations?  While the benefits highlighted by the pilot schemes include increased productivity, reduced stress and increased well-being, and a company's ability to attract and retain talent, there are increased costs and complexities for employers.  It is not possible for all roles to be performed across four days only.  In many circumstances the employer will have to recruit to cover for the fifth day in traditional five-day roles, in particular in service and professional industries.  Roles that involve shift patterns that cover 24-hour days, seven days a week also see additional resources required to cover what is already budgeted and paid for in an employer's eyes.</p><p>Also, the Perpetual Guardian trial identified a number of challenges, for example, resourcing in some of the smaller teams.  By way of illustration, there could be a team of three where an employee has to fit his or her own work into four days and provide cover for others who are not available as they are also compressing their working week.</p><p> The complexities that may arise in the educational sector, across early childcare services, primary, secondary and third level providers must also be considered as falling outside the ease of introducing a four-day working week.  The introduction of a four-day week in such sectors would require an increase in headcount to cover service provision in that fifth day.  It may not be possible to source the necessary skill set or to attract employees to cover one-day-only roles.</p><p> While the new resources required would increase employment, it sees increased costs for employers and complexities in its management while disruption for service users, clients, children and third level students is evident.  The argument may be that the increased productivity would cover these additional costs and that it would be a win-win model for both employer and employee, but the reality is these complexities remain and some more so than others for certain industries and organisations.  Certain roles cannot be compressed into four days without reducing the corresponding service offering to four days, which for many businesses, organisations, clients and service users is simply not feasible.</p><p> Many flexible working arrangements exist, and with the national remote working strategy committing to legislate to provide employees the right to request remote working, this will further galvanise the evolution of the remote and flexible working landscape.  As a relatively new concept, the emerging evidence is mixed and for some organisations the complexity and cost of managing a four-day workforce over a five-day or seven-day working week has been and will continue to be prohibitive.  In other organisations, flexibility is considered more broadly, with policies tailored to reflect the different types of flexible working requests that employees may need rather than a one-size-fits-all model.</p><p> Announcing the &euro;150,000 research fund to launch a pilot scheme in Ireland in January 2022 to run parallel with several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, has said it is "too early to say" whether a four-day week could work in Ireland, but the idea is "ambitious".</p><p> IBEC would accept that the four-day working week holds many advantages for some organisations and sectors, and IBEC acknowledges the importance of innovative working models to continue to strive for better and more efficient workplaces, but it must be balanced in its approach and its application must benefit all parties to the arrangement.  Organisations must be allowed to introduce flexible modes of working that suit the particular needs of their businesses.  The imposition of a four-day working week on all organisations would be counterproductive to this aim.</p></speech>

I will declare an interest that I am very much a supporter of the four-day working week concept.  It has become a fundamental question for all of us now as we come out of Covid around how we can build back better and how we can build back in a way that makes a real difference to people's working lives.  I commend Four Day Week Ireland for a particularly strong presentation setting out how it can be done, where it actually has been done, and the successes to date.  It is important we use this platform to give an opportunity for those present today to explain exactly how it is working in practice.  To begin, I invite Ms Margaret Cox to tell us about her experiences as a manager of the ICE Group and how the four-day working week has become such a viable concept for her in her business.</p></speech>

I recognise the balanced discussions on both sides of the argument between IBEC and F&oacute;rsa.  Our organisation, the ICE Group, is a member of IBEC and we have been delighted with the help we have received from Ms McElwee and the conversations that we had with IBEC as we have gone through this journey, especially on the employment law and legal side of things.</p> <p>  Our model is very simple.  We decided to go for a fixed flexibility model.  In the ICE Group we work around a three-day weekend and everybody works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and they are off Friday, Saturday and Sunday, or they work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and they are off Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  We have small teams and it is a small organisation.</p> <p>  On the complexity issue, we went through a trial for six months that started on 1 July 2019 and we are now more than two years into the whole programme.  The trial was important because it allowed us to work out with our team members how we were going to address aspects such as covering the fifth day.  We did not take on any additional headcount to deal with people being off on the fifth day.  We did take on additional headcount because our business expanded.</p> <p>  For us it has been a commercial success.  It has been a societal success in terms of our employees as they have more time off, more time with their families and more time in the community.  We have increased our productivity.  We measured an increase in productivity in the first year of 27%.  We also measured a 33% increase in our wellness and happiness score.  We reduced our single day absenteeism to one in a six-month period.  Across all of our employees, we had one loss of unplanned absenteeism during a six-month period and we improved our retention.  From our point of view it has been a commercial success and a success for all of our people.  It is a three-day weekend in the ICE Group every single weekend.  It is like having a bank holiday for 52 weeks of the year around the weekend.  I am not sure this answers the Senator's specific questions but I am happy to answer any additional specific questions.</p></speech>

It definitely does answer my questions because it gives a good working example of how a private sector company can embrace a four-day working week and how it can be a win-win for employees and for the business given those striking details around increased productivity, absenteeism and staff retention.  It is a great example of how this concept can work.</p> <p>  I want to ask my colleagues from the F&oacute;rsa trade union to expand on this pilot project because it does look like a very exciting proposition.  In his presentation Mr O'Connor mentioned the opportunity to expand on what is involved in the actual supports available to companies that sign up to this pilot project.</p></speech>

The programme we have designed will roll out as a six-month co-ordinated trial between February and July of next year.  As I said, 17 companies have signed up to participate so far and we are in active engagement with a number of others.  This includes businesses from a range of different sectors, including manufacturing and logistics, software development, tech, finance, ICT, engineering and so on.  We have developed a package of supports that will provide those businesses with the opportunity to trial this in the most successful and smoothest way possible.  We have designed a training programme that has been developed by business leaders from all over the world who have successfully implemented a four-day working week.  The intention around that is to ensure the companies trialling this will be able to learn from the experiences of others who have done this already and to be able to integrate this into their pilot design and the planning processes.</p> <p>  They will also be able to avail of mentoring.  We have a panel of international business experts and pioneers of the four-day week, including people like Ms Cox, who will be matched up with each company that participates in the pilot programme based on their particular business needs, challenges and context.  There will be somebody to support and advise and guide them through the six-month trial.</p> <p>  The third area is networking.  We will plug companies into a peer support structure of other companies who will be trialling this programme in parallel, including Irish employers and other employers internationally who will be doing this at the same time.  This can provide a community where people can share ideas and experiences and learn from each other along the four-day week journey.</p> <p>  Finally, and probably most critically from our point of view, we developed a research partnership with Boston College and University College Dublin whereby they will work with each company to agree the most appropriate metrics for productivity for that business, whether it be sales, profits or service standards.</p><p>They will assess productivity, well-being, carbon emissions and other factors during the six-month trial, at the end of which they will produce an assessment of how the four-day working week has impacted on the individual companies participating, as well as, collectively, the companies and employees taking part.  I hope that answers the Senator's question on the outline of the pilot programme on which we have been working.</p></speech>

I have a follow-up question.  It is clear this is gaining a significant amount of leverage across the private sector, which is very welcome.  However, apart from the research grant from the Government, which is welcome, I would have hoped to see a level of public sector involvement in the pilot project.  Has such involvement been forthcoming to date?  What else could the Government do to encourage it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Callinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#D00300"><p>I will answer that question if I may.  The Senator is correct.  We are pleased the Government, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications have put forward &euro;150,000 for research so that Ireland can be part of this global movement.  What worries us is that, thus far, the employers coming forward to participate in the trial here next year, which obviously will be part of an international trial, are confined to the private sector.  For this to be balanced, it needs to include not just private sector companies but some public sector organisations and the voluntary sector.  I have written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, as has Four Day Week Ireland, seeking to engage to ensure we get some level of participation by the public sector in the trial.  In the context of the voluntary sector, we have a worry the current requirement for contracts with the State to be on an hourly basis rather than being based on output is a complete disincentive to its involvement in the trial.  If we come at this from the point of view of trying to ensure we research this to get the best evidence possible to go forward, then we do need to spread this across the whole economy.</p> <p>  IBEC stated it would be wrong to impose this.  Nobody is talking about imposition.  That should be clear.  What we want to do is develop this idea, embed it, demonstrate it can work and then, in the medium to longer term, try to leverage not just the economic benefits but the social and ecological benefits too.  The Senator's question regarding the public sector is relevant and a matter in respect of which this committee and politicians generally could be very helpful.</p></speech>

I am thinking in particular - perhaps all members, on a cross-party basis, will do likewise - of local councils, for example.  Local authorities are ideal organisations for us to encourage to consider participating in this pilot project.</p> <p>  In my final couple of minutes, I invite both sides to reflect on the following question.  One hundred years after an eight-hour working day was established, is it not high time to give serious consideration to a reduction in the working week?  After 100 years of massive productivity gains, surely it is time now for us all to work collaboratively - that is what is happening here this morning - to establish a four-day working week.  Surely it is high time to get a further reduction in working hours and a better balance for people's lives.</p></speech>

Our campaign is strongly of the view that, more than 100 years after the five-day week, the weekend and the eight-hour day were invented and introduced, it is time for an update and a reset.  Since the early to mid-1980s, average working hours in most advanced western economies have more or less flatlined during a period in which productivity growth has increased significantly and technological advances, including globalisation, the Internet and email, have made an enormous difference to the economy.  As we now enter this fourth industrial revolution of digital technology, automation and artificial intelligence, it is very important the benefits of that are shared with workers.  Working time is a very important place to start in having that conversation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#D00700"><p>I thank Mr. O'Connor and Ms McElwee for their opening statements.  I commend Ms Cox, who is from my constituency of Galway West and was a Senator for ten years, on her courage as director of one of the first companies in Ireland to implement the four-day week.  It will not shock anyone who knows Ms Cox or her family members involved in the ICE Group that they are breaking new ground.  I have been contacted by many people in Galway city who stated the ICE Group has led the way and continues to do so.</p> <p>  It seems to me all the momentum is on the side of those seeking a four-day working week, at least in certain sectors and companies.  It has been successful in the majority of places where it has been trialled.  The challenges such a working week would pose in certain areas, such as education, are significant.  I do not believe there is any desire to move to a four-day week in that sector.  I doubt there would be sufficient teachers to cover additional time, particularly for some second-level subjects.  Has Four Day Week Ireland considered this issue?  If so, what are its views on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#D00800"><p>I thank the Senator.  The reality is certain sectors of the economy are better positioned to make this change immediately.  We believe a majority of the workforce are working in areas where the four-day working week could be introduced without additional employment costs while maintaining or increasing productivity.  However, as Ms McElwee rightly outlined, the Swedish trial was extremely successful in terms of the outcomes for staff and patients but there were increased employment costs because, in that care home setting, there was a requirement to hire additional staff.  There are areas of the economy, such as healthcare, where that should be considered.  Our campaign is not proposing the introduction of a four-day working week for nurses and doctors without hiring more nurses and doctors.</p> <p>  However, in the context of this conversation about the future of work, there are certain sectors of the economy where a four-day week is appropriate.  I refer to climate action and the number of jobs that will be displaced by automation and artificial intelligence.  Most of the research suggests one of the areas in which we need to invest in the creation of new employment is the caring economy.  As regards teaching, there are many examples in the United States of private schools having introduced a four-day working week as a mechanism to attract new teachers.  Obviously, that is obviously a very different model from the one in Ireland but the four-day week has worked in practice.  The reality is certain sectors of the economy are at a later stage of the transition than other sectors.  In the context of the conversation about the public sector, local authorities and the Civil Service may be more ready for a trial now, but over time, the shorter working week can work across all sectors of the economy.  It might look different in some sectors, such as in the form of a compressed five-day week, but this idea of working time reduction can be achieved across the economy.</p></speech>

When we started this journey, I was the proverbial St. Paul on the road to Damascus.  The Senator knows Felim McDonnell, my co-director.  I told Felim a four-day week would never work in the ICE Group as we were too small an organisation and would not be able to make it happen.</p> <p>  However, what is very important is asking what we, as an organisation, a government or a country, can we do and how we can make it happen.  I refer to the benefits available to Ireland.  If we can make Ireland the best place to work and live, we will give ourselves a unique selling point in terms of the global outlook we have as a country to invest in.  It is about flipping it over and asking what we need to do to make it happen.  I refer to what has been done in the past 18 months.</p><p>Businesses, schools, hospitals and other bodies have done things we never would have thought possible.   The same is true of the Oireachtas.  Who would have thought we could be having an Oireachtas hearing on this issue involving six outside participants on a Teams link?  My message to the committee today and to the Government is we must open our minds and look at the opportunities that exist.  I see this an opportunity for the better for Ireland, specifically in terms of where we are positioning ourselves in the global employment and living market.</p></speech>

It is not that we have not thought about it in the way he has suggested, but in the spirit of what Margaret has just said, we need to be prepared to think bigger in the medium to long term about how we do things.  Maybe it would be better if teachers were teaching over four rather than five days and giving their energy there.  On the fifth day, children might not be back with their parents.  Maybe we could come up with things that children could be doing that would be better for them in terms of their broader development, health and well-being.  These are the kinds of issues that, over time, we can start to engage with if we embrace this idea.</p></speech>

That is the message.  It could be set up on a Monday to Thursday or Tuesday to Friday basis, with productivity remaining the same or even increasing.  That is a significant message for all companies.</p> <p>  I have a number of concerns around this.  There are certain sectors or areas, like healthcare, where it may not be possible to implement a four-day week and in that context, we could be in danger of creating a two-tier workforce.  We must be conscious of that.  That said, I welcome the concept and believe it would work well in places like Galway city.  However, in terms of nurses and doctors and the education sector, for example, we must look at it from an overall perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#E00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The idea is very attractive and would be very popular but I feel a bit like the character in "Father Ted" who asks "Where's the catch?".  The key to this is finding the 20% gain in productivity in the various sectors.  What is the framework for delivering that productivity gain so that wages are not affected?  As others have said, very small enterprises will struggle, as will 24-7 businesses and those that do not operate on a 40 hours per week basis.  Traditionally, the concern has been that weaker or less organised sectors will get squeezed out.  Is there a risk in moving away from the fixed working week, with overtime being required to be paid beyond that?  If we move to something that does not have that sort of arrangement, are we jeopardising hard-won gains and pushing more into the Deliveroo-type economy?  Those who are knowledge leaders can adapt to this while others will be left behind.  Is this something for those who are well placed in businesses that have all of these traits while others will fall behind?</p> <p>  Mr. Callinan said the idea is not to make this compulsory.  Some employers will see the benefit of this, and if the trials work, some will progress.  What is the framework the witnesses are looking for from the State to bring this along?  How do we ensure there is some level of equity for the sectors we have talked about like childcare, retail and so on, that need long hours and do not have the same capacity to produce the 20% improvement in productivity?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses see remote working as a step towards achieving these goals?  Is remote working a toe in the water for employers that we can build on, rather than coming in with some regulatory requirement, if that is where this is heading?  Do we suck it and see?  Risks to sectors that would not cope with a compulsory regime clearly exist.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is fair to make the comparison with remote working because the idea of a four-day week, whose time has come in our view, is not as far-fetched as people may have thought.  We are not talking about regulation at this stage or about implementing something across the economy or workforce as a whole.  What we want to do at this stage is maximise participation in pilot programmes to try to gather evidence and identify issues or problems that may arise in particular businesses, sectors or even areas within the public sector.</p> <p>  Comments about the danger of a two-tier workforce are fair, but if we look at this over the medium to long term, we can see how work gradually will be revalued.  Rather than it being what the Deputy describes, we can come at this anew.  It will obviously impact on training programmes if we need more people in healthcare or education roles, for example.  That is certainly something that would emerge but we are talking about this happening over a significant period of time.</p> <p>  I apologise but I have a prior commitment to address the PDFORRA conference at 2 p.m. in Killarney.  Mr. Andrew Barnes will join the meeting in my stead.  As a global pioneer on the four-day week, he has a lot of knowledge of the subject and will be happy to deal with the questions posed</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#E00700"><p>I wish to comment on the point made earlier by Senator Gavan regarding the changing world of work and how we have moved from much longer working hours over many generations to where we are today.  It is also worth recognising that, over recent years, we have introduced very significant legislation to ensure people have a better work-life balance.  There will be another directive from Europe on this but we have also seen significant improvements in all kinds of statutory and carer's leave to enable people to have a better work-life balance.  This is something we should not forget in the wider conversation because these are very important flexibilities.  They are also very important issues for employers in terms of managing and directing work on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  When we look at some of the challenges, the issue raised by Deputy Bruton regarding a two-tier structure and polarisation within our workforce is something about which we are also concerned.</p><p>We can already see that there is remote working internationally in professional classes.  Most often these people are in very well paid roles and they have a much greater opportunity to work remotely than many other people who need to turn up to their place of work to perform the duties that they perform on an ongoing basis.  In terms of layering on a four-day work week, again what we will see, potentially, is further issues around polarisation because it will be that same cohort who are more likely to avail, and certainly in the medium-term, of reduced working hours over the longer term.</p><p> When we consider the long-term future there are issues that we must think about very carefully.  One issue is the area of demographics and the current structure of society.  It is quite right to say, in the comment that has already been made, that we will see shifts with advancing technology with more of our work being realigned into areas like the caring sector.  A larger proportion of the population will also require care.  Without a significant growth in the population we will have into the future, and we have it at the moment, significant labour and skills shortages.  To be able to backfill and introduce those roles on a cost-effective basis, we have got a real challenge around the cost of implementing some of those.  Private sector organisations and agencies that deliver social care, intellectual disability care, broader disability care, home care nursing and so on cannot be managed more efficiently on a reduced hours basis so will require really significant additional resources.</p><p> Let us consider the Icelandic trial.  First, we probably need to adjust our discussion to whether this is a four-day working week or reduced hours.  I say that because the Icelandic trial was about reduced hours and not necessarily a four-day working week overall.  The people who conducted the trial acknowledged that there had been a significant increased cost of &euro;24 million in the care sector.  The trial only covered 1.3% of the Icelandic population so the findings mean that there would be a significant cost if one were to scale that up across a much greater percentage of the private sector that would operate within a larger ongoing four-day or reduced hours working week.  We need to recognise that those costs exist.  We need to think about the long-term realities of being able to attract and retain skills, and being able to produce those skills in a cost-effective manner.  It would be the current workers who will have to pay for that on a long-term basis.  That is a huge imposition of additional tax costs into the labour market.  There are really significant questions about the affordability of that and the overall attractiveness of Ireland as a work location unless we see us moving in tandem with a global change.  The really instructive piece is if we consider what has happened in France where a 35- or 36-hour work week has been implemented.  We know that their professional cadre do not work those hours.  On average, they work much more significant hours but that is a huge cost to employers where the state or the employer is having to pay overtime, and additional leave because it is time in lieu.  The state pays really significant subsidies in order to advance that 35-hour work week and it presents challenges.  The reality is that because the rest of international trade has not shifted, the French model is really making workarounds of that 35-hour work week in order to operate competitively at international level.  When one moves outside of the framework of the individual firm and considers it as a much broader national issue, all of those things would come to the fore and must be very carefully considered.</p></speech>

First, we view remote, hybrid, flexible and blended working as a huge part of the conversation on what the future of work needs to look like.  We also think it is important that we do not purely confine the discussion on the future of work to the location of work.  The conversation also needs to feature control over working time.  As we have seen during the pandemic, the whole conversation on the right to switch off has been an issue for many workers and many different sectors.  There are also the issues of average working hours and working time.</p> <p>  While we share the concern about having two tiers over the medium to long-term, we believe that if you do not start somewhere, you will not get anywhere.  This is a pilot programme and experiment.  We welcome the Government's commitment of &euro;150,000 in research funding as an acknowledgement of the fact that at a very minimum, this idea is worthy of further investigation and exploration.  The only way we can ensure that we get the best quality data from the pilot project and research is to ensure we have as broad a participation as possible, across as many different sectors and settings as possible.  It will be only then that we can answer some of these questions.</p> <p>  We, in the campaign, fully acknowledge that up to now most of the research in this area, with the exception of some projects like the Iceland one, has been very much at an individual company level.  In many cases, a company would introduce this and would pair with an academic institution, but would then self-report its own outcomes.  We want to develop a very ambitious pioneering project that will have a broad parallel trial of a four-day week across many different countries, sectors and settings because it would produce quality data that does not exist currently.  Some of the results we have seen from companies in different sectors that have conducted trials are positive enough that this initiative warrants further and deeper exploration.</p> <p>  It is important to note that while less than 2% of the population took part in the Icelandic trial, this has led to policy change and 86% of the workforce has now negotiated new shorter contracts.  It is a study around working time reduction rather than a move to a four-day working week.  Our campaign talks about the 100-80 model and we are not just talking about the four-day working week.  It is a reality that on the demand side around 90% of workers in almost all surveys, when given the option to choose between a four-day week or a compressed five-day week, chose a four-day week.  In terms of businesses, of the 17 companies that have signed up to take part in our trial, 16 companies are doing it on the basis of a four-day week and one company is doing on the basis of a compressed five-day week.  Within the business community there is a more significant interest in the four-day work week than the compressed five-day week.</p></speech>

There has been a swift change because all of a sudden we have gone from having no remote working to having a discussion on a four-day week.  The work that the organisations are doing on this matter is great.  It is important that the work is done well and that there is no narrative about two sides.  It is unhelpful to the discussion for Senator Gavan to ask to hear from both sides because we all want good quality working rights for workers and we all want productivity.  We all want happy employees and increased productivity if the four-day week is to work.  That is the commonality.  We need to make sure the debate is not polarised.  We all want what is best.</p> <p>  It is brilliant that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications have agreed to a trial because a four-day working week is a relatively new concept.  We had to fight to get remote working of any kind in the programme for Government and we were given a rate of 20%.  Remote working is a very new concept in Ireland and we are going from that to a four-day week.  For that reason, I suggest that Mr. O'Connor must bear with the system.  In reality, we all would prefer if a four-day week were introduced in the morning but things do not work that quickly.  It is excellent that a trial will start in January and it is most important that we await the outcome.  From what the witnesses have said, it seems that the trial will show that a four-day week is very effective.  There has been no research done in Ireland in this regard.  That work must happen first before we can jump forward in any direction.</p> <p>   I know that Mr. Callinan had to leave but I am interested in learning whether the teachers' unions have sought a four-day week because I have not heard that such a request has been made.  I had a meeting with Ms Cox and Mr. O'Connor.  I appreciate that a four-day working week is a very exciting concept in general terms but I contend that it must be done in a way that works and that nobody - employees or employers - takes the piss out of it.  We must have structures to support everybody.</p> <p>  I am not sure what the ask is outside of the trial.  If we have never done a four-day week in Ireland, we must start with a trial.  If a trial proves that a four-day week is useful and good, the next step is to conduct a trial in the public sector.  It will be interesting to see the uptake in terms of the trial.  I presume that Mr. O'Connor and his organisation will be involved in the forthcoming trial.</p><p>I think the call was put out in July and it is now closed.  Do our guests have information on the uptake?  I do not have it to hand.  It is great that mentoring and advice will be supplied because this is going to be a super programme we can extend throughout the country, although we will have to tread carefully and do it right.</p><p> In January, the Government will bring forward a Bill regarding a right to request remote working, which is definitely a step in the right direction.  Having worked in Leinster House, what I have learned is that just because there is a great idea, that does not mean it can happen overnight.  Unfortunately, it has to happen slowly but surely, with trials and tests.  This is a national issue.  We have great stories from individual businesses such as Ms Cox's that have done very well, but when we want something to happen at a national level, we have to do it with care.  That is why the trial is really important.  I am not sure how we can progress until we have the results from the trial but it is very exciting.</p></speech>

One of the concerns I have - this is an ask, if I am being clear about it - is that we should not confuse remote working with a four-day week.  Remote working and the right to request it is really important, but working a four-day week, with an additional day off during the week, will be a game changer for employees, communities and society.  It will give that one day back.  I think that if we mix it with remote working, productivity gains will increase even more than has happened at our company.  Let us not confuse remote working with a four-day week-----</p></speech>

I am just pointing out what stage we are at.  As a country, we are only working on legislation on remote working.  That is my point.  I would love a four-day week myself; who would not?  I am just highlighting the reality of where we are as a State.</p></speech>

We are not at this point talking about legislative change or regulation.  Our intention is to run this pilot programme over three phases.  The six-month co-ordinated trial will start early next year and we are planning to roll out two further trials between the end of next year and 2023.  The critical issue for us is to ensure there is as much private sector participation as possible.  Based on our engagements, we believe many Irish companies are interested in this and examining it.  If they are interested, we want to be able to provide them with the support they need, through this programme, to ensure they have the most successful trial possible but also to ensure our research is as significant as possible.</p> <p>  There is also significant interest in the voluntary sector and I have engaged with a number of voluntary sector employers.  As Mr. Callinan mentioned, however, there is a significant barrier to many voluntary sector agencies that receive State funds through State contracts.  They are almost debarred from the programme on the basis the money they receive through those contracts is, effectively, billed on an hourly rather than an output basis.  If they were able to tender for contracts based on the output they provide rather than the hours, that would enable them to participate in the programme.</p> <p>  Finally, as Mr. Callinan mentioned, there is the question of whether we can identify, not necessarily in the first phase of the trial beginning next February but at some stage over the pilot programme, discrete targeted areas of the public service and the Civil Service to participate in this trial in order that it will be broad and will apply to all sectors.  That is our ask to the political system at this point.</p></speech>

Particularly in the case of a four-day work week, one of the key concerns we hear from employers is that employees are not all seeking a four-day work week and a three-day weekend.  In fact, there are many other flexibilities they require to be able to manage their personal lives and their own personal work-life balance.  That is where issues such as the four-day work week cross over with remote working because children will still need to be dropped to school five days a week, they will still have appointments midweek that cannot necessarily be dealt with on one particular day off and so on.  What we are really seeing as a drive across our membership base is that the employee relationship is becoming much more personal in respect of how flexibility operates for individuals.  The narrative that is out there very much concerns how individuals want to interact with their employer.  It is important we are clear what we are talking about, whether that is reduced hours, a four-day work week or flexible schedules.  Flexibility represents the main driver we are seeing.</p></speech>

I am interested in the concept of a four-day week especially in the context of female labour market participation.  There is the issue of getting women into work but also that of keeping them there, given that, as we know, there is a significant and dramatic fall-off in women's participation after a particular age or because of certain care responsibilities in their lives.  My other main interest relates to how a four-day week may mitigate the level of commuting in this country and reduce emissions.  In some ways, the conversation is very timely.  I wish the pilot programme all the best when it takes off next year.</p> <p>  I am conscious that Mr. O'Connor indicated that much of the research is based at the firm level at the moment as opposed to anything broader.  In the context of the workplaces that have undertaken a four-day working week, what do we understand about female labour market participation?  I refer to the issues of women going from part-time to full-time work and of whether more women want to join the organisations.  Ms Cox might have a perspective on this as well.  Based on the research Mr. O'Connor has seen, what insights can he give us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#G01200"><p>Most of the research we have examined in this area has not really drilled down into the impact on household distribution of labour.  The National Women's Council of Ireland has been involved in our campaign since we launched it on the basis it believes this can be a great enabler of gender equality for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  They include enabling men to take on a greater share of the care and responsibilities and, in turn, removing barriers to women in respect of taking on senior leadership positions, training and so on, and providing a greater balance between women and men in that regard.</p> <p>  In the case of many of the surveys we conducted in the initial stages of our membership of this campaign, I was struck by the number of women who responded to say they were currently working a four-day week.  They had been reduced to a four-day week because they had come off maternity leave and decided that, because of the benefits to family and work-life balance, they would stay on it.  They were getting paid for only four days but their responsibilities and jobs had not changed.  They were still expected to do the same work, over four days rather than five.  That is a micro example of what we hope will be borne out by the research.</p> <p>  This project will examine time-use diaries of the employees who participate to see what the impact has been on the distribution of labour in the home.  Most of the research on carbon emissions and working-time reduction relates to the company-level impacts, such as commuting, energy use and buildings, but there has not been a great deal of analysis of the behavioural changes that happen with individuals.  Is it the case that when people work and live more intensely, they are unable to live as sustainably as they would like?  That is the kind of question we hope this research project will answer.  The broader the programme, the more we will be able to delve into some of those important questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Cox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#H00100"><p>I might just come in, specifically, on the qualitative data we have seen.  It is true that the lives of the women in my organisation are better than they were before we brought in a four-day week.  They have more time to spend with family and they get stuff done on their day off.  This is the case for men too but it is particularly true for women.  With all due respect to everybody here, it is an accepted fact that women do a greater share of the general household caring work, in general, than their husbands, partners or whoever they are.  It makes a difference to their lives but they are still getting 100% of their pay.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor made a very valid point.  We have all seen that when we come back from maternity leave, we want to take more time off to be with family.  Can we afford to go down to 80% of our wages?  Some people can and some people cannot.  We should balance that opportunity, especially for women, but also for fathers and other family members.  It does not necessarily have to be about children; it could be that a person is looking after parents or somebody with a disability.  It would be foolish to underestimate that.  There is opportunity in the concept of us all caring for our families and our community.  That is something that can be exploited in a very positive way as we go forward.</p></speech>

That included people who would have liked to work but could not because of various structural issues in their lives, such as caring responsibilities or a disability.  A move by some companies towards a four-day week would certainly encourage more of these people to seek work, which is very important.</p> <p>  My other question is on the conversation taking place in other countries.  Mr. O'Connor and IBEC representatives spoke about the trials within certain companies in other countries.  We had a discussion on the conversations in other countries and the legislative or other supports that could potentially be put in place.  It was mentioned that the right to disconnect and the right to flexible working are coming down the tracks because of an EU directive.  Are there other initiatives that could be taken at state level to encourage companies to take up a four-day week and set boundaries around it, so it is not just five days compressed into four, or people working all hours of the day, even if they are formally only working four days?  What conversations have taken place in other countries about this?</p></speech>

It depends on the structural issues they have.  We now see India is implementing a restriction to the working week but that is based on a very high level, while Japan is doing something different.  The key thing is the bulk of legislation on work, internationally, is based on time and, therefore, there is inadvertent discrimination against companies trying to bring things in.  In my country, New Zealand, we have to accrue holiday on the day we gift people off.  The best solutions we are seeing globally are where government looks to get rid of those inadvertent barriers to introducing a flexible or a four-day week.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of talk and I will not rehash what other people have said.  There are a lot of positives with this, but it is a question of how many business sectors it can be applied to.  It will not work for every business.  We have highlighted some businesses that have to trade.  Manufacturing companies cannot afford to stop a day's manufacturing, for instance.  Areas of the public sector and childcare are in a similar situation.  It will be interesting to see the trial that has been spoken about and what that throws up.</p> <p>  For those who have experience, and the IT sector was spoken about as an area where this has proven to be a success, will we create two-tier recruitment?  I imagine many people, if they look at their employment options, would much prefer to work in an industry where they were going to have a three-day weekend, for instance.  I could imagine how that would work for many people, but what are the thoughts of those who have been in this space?  Ms Cox might like to comment.  She talked about her business and how it manages its productivity, and mentioned that the three-day weekend works for it, but has she any idea about other companies she may have looked at?  Would staff be inclined to migrate to her business as a result?  If this is to be brought in at a large scale, there will be costs to employment but there may well be a shift in the types of jobs people are looking for.  People will choose employment where a three-day weekend is on offer.  I ask for Ms Cox's comments on that.</p></speech>

It would give us the edge in recruitment and retention.  What we have found is that because people are coming back more energised, more happy and more focused, we get more work done in the time we are in the office than we did previously.  That is what is giving us the additional productivity gains.  Let me give a very simple example.  Meetings tend to go on indefinitely in many organisations.  We now have a very simple rule that unless it is a very important meeting, it lasts 30 minutes.  No meeting starts without an agenda and if you are not supposed to be there, or you have nothing to add, you are not invited.  We have cut out the waste within the process of managing our business.  If we take that concept and work through it to the business moving forward, as people will do on the trial, the waste in that business is identified.  It is by identifying waste that you achieve the greater productivity gains.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question but I hope it does.</p></speech>

For businesses that are pivoting, is it the case that a business might give all its staff a three-day weekend that will start on a Friday and, therefore, the business is not open on a Friday, or will do the same on a Monday and, therefore, the business is not open on a Monday?  Will it propose, potentially, splitting staff between some being off on Friday and some being off on Monday?  How is this managed in terms of customer demand and dealing with the front face of business?</p></speech>

We are saying it will depend on the organisation.  In our organisation, we work Monday to Thursday or Tuesday to Friday because we cover five days.  Other organisations are in a niche business and can afford to close down on a Friday, so everybody works Monday to Thursday.  In other organisations, people choose what day they pick.  Some organisations have people picking a Wednesday and others a Tuesday.  It is a matter for the organisation itself to decide on what flexibility it wants and what works for its business.  That can be done by listening to employees, teams of people and customers.  Again, for businesses out there that are making money to create and sustain themselves, they have to listen to where their customers are.  We do not want to be in a situation where companies are not in a position to deliver superior customer service to their clients as they move forward.</p></speech>

I apologise to Deputy Shanahan because this was not his question but, on the equality space, an assertion was made that a four-day working week will rebalance many of the gender challenges we find in the workplace.  I would argue the issue is much more complex than that.  Even as we look at what has happened over the course of the pandemic with, in many cases, both parents at home and children being minded, managed and schooled at home, we did not see a rebalancing of the burden between both parents as a result of them having equal access to the responsibilities and chores in the household.</p><p>We absolutely know that burden fell much more heavily on women.  We would really need to think about how we would be structuring our society in a four-day work week to ensure we are doing many different things to rebalance that relationship as opposed to just allowing more women to work four days a week and have a better quality of life from that perspective.</p><p> The other points that are important and which were raised by the Deputy Shanahan concern where we want to attract workers to.  Obviously, for private sector firms this is a competitive piece, but from an IBEC perspective, looking at it from our wider economy and a sustainable environment, we have to think about where the jobs are going to be in the future.  We have already indicated that many of them will be in the caring sectors.  Those are not jobs where we can streamline or have efficiencies or choose to work Mondays or Fridays.  Care is required and happens in a particular timeframe.  For example, I cannot serve breakfast in a hospital at 9 p.m. on a Thursday evening to avoid coming in on Friday morning.  The reality is we will have to have people there and that is a cost.  It is a huge taxpayer cost.  We need to think about how that then flows through into the wider economy.  Based on our current demographics and the flows of labour, given we already have very considerable labour shortages in this area, we must consider whether we are going to be able to meet those needs.  Are we simply going to end up in a situation where it is so expensive to provide that care, we find people withdrawing from the labour market - more often, women - because it is not cost effective by the time they have paid for childcare and transport to get to work based on the salary and tax they pay?  That is not to say we should not do it, but the point I am trying to make is we need  to undertake a very strong regulatory assessment and take a careful look at both our labour market objectives and the economic costs, particularly as our population is ageing and our demographics are changing considerably, like many other European countries.</p></speech>

I thank, in particular, those who are campaigning for a four-day week.  I really think it is an idea whose time has come.  It brings together the interests of workers as workers, the interests of those who are unemployed, the fight for gender equality, and the need to tackle climate change.  The benefit of the demand is that it can bring together the interests of the big majority in society in terms of transforming people's lives and society for the better.</p> <p>  I will start with some questions for Ms McElwee.  In her opening statement, she referred to the four-day week or compressed work schedule.  I ask her to expand on what she means by "compressed work schedule".  Does she mean fewer hours overall in the week or is she talking about, as a potential alternative to the four-day week, an IBEC proposal to squeeze the same number of hours into a smaller number of days, for example, a person working 40 hours over four days, as opposed to over five days?  Is that what she is getting at with the compressed work schedule model?</p></speech>

We are not especially advocating for any type of flexibility.  In some of the trials and reduced working hours, we have seen that people work a longer working day and then have perhaps Friday, Monday or the chosen day off.  In other situations, they work exactly the same number of hours as they previously did, Monday to Friday, and have the advantage of an extra day they are not working.  There are different ways of doing it and we are not advocating for one or other, in particular.</p></speech>

That is why we do not particularly advocate for people working longer days.  In fact, we have been working closely with the WRC around the code of practice on rights to disconnect.  We are very conscious of the obligations of the working time legislation and the fact that working excessive hours does not tend to be productive in the long term.  Obviously, there can be times when we work longer hours to meet a particular demand, but on a regular basis it does not tend to be terribly effective.  Therefore, there are challenges around compressing the work week.  We know from some of the trials that there have been challenges and feedback from employees, who said that they found it very stressful to try to work at the increased pace of the shorter working week, that it did not necessarily fit in to certain organisations or even certain departments within organisations, and that it was better to spread the hours over the full week rather than try to compress the work into four days.  I am not necessarily referring to working longer days, but compressing out all the general day-to-day interactions, perhaps by taking out some of the breaks, shortening lunch breaks and doing away with a lot of the social engagement that is very important for people's mental health and well-being in the workplace, like the chat and the opportunity to spend some time together and know their colleagues outside of just their particular work interests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#J00600"><p>Ms McElwee has a point there.  The question is what to do about that.  For me, what to do about that is not to have a model whereby we try to extract 25% more productivity from workers on a per-hour basis, precisely because workers are already very heavily managed, their time is heavily managed in many cases and they already have stressful lives.  We should accept that there is a four-day week and an employer will pay a certain cost for that.</p><p>It relates to another question I wanted to ask Ms McElwee.  I just finished reading a book by Jason Hickel called <i>Less is More</i>.  He makes the point that gains in labour productivity have been appropriated by capital.  Instead of shortening the working week and raising wages, companies have pocketed the extra profits and required employees to keep working just as much as before.  In other words, productivity gains have been used not to liberate humans from work, but rather to fuel constant growth.  Those who have looked at the evolution of working hours over recent decades have found that productivity has increased, yet workers find they continue to work the same amount.  Looking at the share of wealth created, as GDP or GNI, that is going to profit over that period of time, it has increased pretty much year on year.  Going back to 1960, 32% of GDP was going to profit; now it is over 50% and, proportionately, the share going to labour has gone down.  Given the massive increase in profit share that has happened in this country, would Ms McElwee share that assessment of what has taken place and accept the introduction of a four-day week is one way of rectifying that?</p></speech>

Clearly, we have seen very significant advances in productivity and how people work, much of which has been augmented by industrialisation, technology and new and more efficient ways of working.  Without a doubt, we have seen very significant changes in how people work.  We hear back from member companies and what their employees are telling them is what they are looking for in terms of their work-life balance is around additional flexibility.  It is the ability, quite rightly, to disconnect when their working day is done, to be able to flex around childcare and education, and perhaps to be able to take time out of the working day or the working year to pursue other interests, rather than one single model.  Therefore, when we are looking at this particular question, we are looking at what are the best opportunities and what sustains our economy into the long term.  We are looking at how we can continue to operate successfully and ensure we sustain and maintain employment and employment growth, but it has to be in that wider lens of a strong stakeholder model.</p></speech>

I appreciate they are trying to get some level of buy-in from employers and convince them it can work, and so on.</p><p>As part of this they have emphasised that strictly speaking they are not saying it will be a four-day week with a three-day weekend and that they are open to flexibility.  There was a study in France on a 35-hour week that found the quality of time away from the job and who controls when it is taken and its regularity and usability is often as important as its quantity.  It found employees of lower social rank often received time of lesser quality since they had less control over its scheduling.  How do we ensure that flexibility is not used in such a way?  It is why the TUC in Britain has explicitly called for a four-day week and a three-day weekend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#K00200"><p>I will address the question on work intensification over four days.  We have only two barriers to entry for companies to join this programme as it stands.  The first is they must agree to participate in the research.  The second is that if a company contacts us and says it wants to compress its work schedule to ten hours a day over four days, that is not what we are researching or advocating for.  It needs to be in keeping with the general principle of the "100-80-100" model we have outlined.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's other question, I appreciate what Ms McElwee said earlier.  We think employees should have choice.  A company in Wales introduced this very successfully for its 15 staff.  Because of personal circumstances one member of staff preferred a compressed work schedule with five shorter days rather than the four-day week.  Giving staff this option is a positive thing.  Most of the studies we have done suggest that 85% or 90% of staff when surveyed on work time reduction have a preference for an additional day.  Could some companies, such as a small PR firm or communications agency, that does project work for other businesses effectively shut the business on Friday and do their work from Monday to Thursday?  They probably could.  For the vast majority of companies we are dealing with this is about continuing to operate over five days with people having a different day off.  It might be Monday, Wednesday or Friday.  One company involved in the programme operates over six days with employees on a four-day week.  They schedule around it.  The demand for this on the business side and the worker side is heavily geared towards one less day.  It is also heavily geared towards having a three-day weekend.  Facilitating flexibility within this is probably a good thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#K00300"><p>I apologise for missing the first few minutes of the meeting.  I was speaking in the Chamber.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I had a chance to read them prior to the meeting.  I echo what has been said.  There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come.  The fact we are all speaking about this is good.  We need to be clear about what we are speaking about.  We are not talking about the capacity to do all of the work in a shorter space of time.  I do not think that would necessarily create benefits.  It would disproportionately impact on workers who are not of a high rank.  There have to be benefits to this.  We need to look at what those benefits are and how we can maximise them.  I want to put on the record that it is very regrettable that a member of the committee used the phrase "taking the piss".  We do not need to introduce that concept.  Workers are mature enough, as are employers, to be able to have this discussion like adults and to work out something that works for everyone.  Workers do not want to put their bosses out of business.  Of course they do not.</p> <p>  I want to refer briefly to a World Health Organization study published earlier this year.  It found that long working hours are literally killing people.  It found that 745,000 people died in 2016 from stroke and heart disease due to excessive hours.  Perhaps Mr. Barnes will be able to address this question.  Benefits for workers are consequent benefits to employers because if workers are healthy, fit and well they will be more productive.  There is no value to an employer working a worker to death and no one would suggest there is.  Perhaps Mr. Barnes will speak to us about the international examples of the benefits.  I am specifically referring to the health benefits.  They are as important as the other issues we have been discussing.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right.  One in four to one in five of the workforce at any point in time will have a stressful mental health issue.  This means they are not in that time as productive as they might be.  If we can give them a day off a week, which could often be mid-week, the ability for them to contribute fully to the business and contribute more broadly to their own lives is absolutely enhanced.  This is what we are arguing.  The cost to the economy of people being not at their best from a health perspective is that more people go into the health system.  People are also less productive at work.  Equally we find that the health system itself is overburdened.  The Americans kill 250,000 people a year in the health system as a consequence of misdiagnosis occasioned by stress and overwork.  The real opportunity here is that, amazingly, a healthy balanced workforce produces at a higher level.  This is why it is a win-win for everybody.  This seems to be the research coming from all over the world.  A healthy balanced workforce produces more but also reduces the burden on government coffers.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Barnes for that.  It is important by way of context that when we discuss this we discuss the actual benefits not just to the worker but those passed on in terms of productivity.</p> <p>  My next point has already been mentioned and I would like to hear from Ms McElwee on it.  Clearly there is an issue with regard to the right to disconnect and people being contacted and working in excess of their hours.  This relates to the health issue I have just raised.  This has come to me specifically from speaking to young workers but it is not a phenomenon just among young workers.  This is the culture of always being on.  Ms McElwee is here to represent employers.  Not all employers do it and I do not suggest that they do but it is a feature and something that impacts on the health and safety of the workforce.  In tandem with any pilot there has to be a robust right to disconnect from excessive contact outside normal office hours.  These things have to go together.  Do Ms McElwee and Mr. O'Connor have a view on whether the two things have to happen simultaneously?  There has to be a robust right to disconnect alongside any move towards a four-day working week.  It is a bit counterintuitive to say we would have a three-day weekend or an extra day that people are not required to be in work but they would be on the phone or checking their emails and this would become expected.  Technically on paper people would have a four-day week but it would not work out as such.  Do the witnesses have a view on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#K00600"><p>I have a very strong view on this particular issue.  I have also seen the World Health Organization report.  It is important to recognise that we have robust legislation already on our Statute Book on the organisation of working time.  It is very prescriptive on the maximum number of hours that can be worked.  In effect, it provides a right to disconnect.  It very clearly states what hours people work, what hours are considered to be rest and what breaks must be taken.  We were fully engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission on foot of the Department's request to bring together a code of practice on the right to disconnect.  I fully agree with Deputy O'Reilly.  This is a very challenging situation, particularly for our younger generations who have grown up with a device in their hands.  There is work to be done in organisational cultures on what is an appropriate out-of-hours call.  Every role may well have a time when some flexibility will be required.  We all accept there is reason and time.  There are also needs to be an understanding of what this is.  It should not be a regular event.  We need to support this culture as at a time when people are sitting with their devices on Twitter or watching TV and they are also scanning through their email there is a general sense that people are never disconnected.</p><p>There are cultural things that, as organisations and as a society, we need to think about in the context of our ever-connected environments.  We all have a broader responsibility in that regard.  I agree that as the world of work is changing, particularly with the imminent introduction of a right to request remote working, but also with the fact that many organisations are already moving to blended and hybrid working, those are issues on which we need to educate people.  Many people have never worked remotely or in hybrid models in the long term and there are new ways to one manage one's own work.</p><p> With my employer's hat on, we need to think about the many challenges for employers in this regard.  How does one regulate employees on their personal device, or even on their work device, without overstepping their privacy in their homes and workplaces?  There is a significant amount to be worked through but, in general, it is really important that people rest and work.</p></speech>

It is very nice to see the former Senator, Ms Margaret Cox, again.  Almost 25 years ago, one of the first parliamentary questions I asked related to Sunday trading.  Tom Kitt was the Minister in the previous Government.  While in opposition, he brought forward a Bill to regulate Sunday trading and I was anxious to see whether the Bill would progress.  Obviously, it did not because now we have trading seven days a week all around.  As Deputy O'Reilly stated, things move on and change.  This is a fascinating discussion.  Of course, it is not a new idea.  As Mr. O'Connor noted in his written submission, John Maynard Keynes mentioned it in the 1930s.  I note that Richard Nixon spoke about it in 1956 as well, and so on.  It has been around for a while.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor referred to the 100-80 model, whereby an employee works 80% of the hours previously worked but productivity stays at 100%.  There are certain roles where that may not work.  If a teacher or another worker in a classroom is giving 100% five days a week but then goes to four days, how can he or she be expected to produce 100% as was the case previously?  The same applies in the case of nursing.  If nurses are currently being paid for five days a week or whatever hours they work and are working at 100%, but their working hours go down to 80%, how can their productivity remain the same given that they are already at their limit?  If the working time is reduced, how can productivity be increased in certain hands-on jobs such as that?</p> <p>  I note research carried out at Ohio State University and elsewhere that highlighted concerns relating to stress.  If employees are producing the same output or, in some instances, as some of the presentations alluded to, more in less time, is there a risk of stress on the employees?  Ms Cox referred to streamlining, cutting down on waste and so on but, for many people, work is enjoyable, a social outlet and rewarding.  It is not always a drudge.  Unfortunately, it is a drudge for some people but for many it is not.  In England they now have a minister for loneliness because loneliness is becoming an issue there, as it is in Ireland, particularly for people who have retired and are at home all day.  They have nothing to do and all day to do it.  All present are aware of the growth in men's sheds and so on, where people find an outlet and social interaction.  For many people, work provides that social interaction.</p> <p>  The idea of a four-day working week is fascinating.  It has significant merit and I am delighted the Government has put money towards the research project.  I will certainly take up the invitation relating to letting other companies know about it.  We need to discuss this issue.  The discussion today has been very good.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor referred to competition between employers and suggested that a four-day working week could be used as a competitive tool to attract workers to areas where it is difficult to get staff.  Obviously, quality of life is important.  At some stage, we should probably have a discussion on artificial intelligence and its role in the future because it is moving very fast indeed.  Ms McElwee and others rightly stated that we are going through a paradigm shift at the moment that may have been forced or brought on by the pandemic in many ways.  Many things are changing significantly and this is one of those things.</p></speech>

The 100-80 concept is borne out of the fact that a significant amount of research indicates that people are only productive - not busy, but productive - for approximately three hours a day.  That is often caused by inefficiencies in the way work is structured or the fact that there are disruptions and distractions that impact what they are doing.  What we are trying to say is that if one empowers the workforce to rethink how they do things, they will find a way to do it better and more efficiently.  If employees are working eight hours a day but only productive for three of those hours, a four-day working week will not turn the workplace into a heads-down, working-all-the-time environment.  It is about trying to get more productivity out of people within each hour while still leaving a large amount of time for socialisation.  My company has been doing this for more than three years.  We have found that our social interaction has increased, as have our teamwork and productivity, while the number of employees has decreased.  It is not about just focusing on time taken; it is about what is coming out of that.  That equally applies whether it is education, nursing, manufacturing or the service industry.</p></speech>

Nurses are already producing 110% during the time they work.  If they reduce their hours further, I do not know how they would be able to produce 100% given that they are already at that level, are working extremely hard and are very tired at the end of the day.  The debate is quite good.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Connor to explain and expand on the issue of voluntary agencies tendering for State contracts on the basis of hours rather than output and to give an example of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#L00500"><p>In recent months, we have specifically engaged with four voluntary agencies that attended our information events.  They were very interested in trialling this and remain so and hope to join the pilot programme at a later stage.  However, they have all been successful in tendering for State contracts that, effectively, are funded on the basis of hours worked rather than output or productivity attained.  The organisations consider that to be a significant barrier to their participation in such a pilot programme.  There may be a need for a conversation on how organisations tender for those contracts and whether it should be done on a results basis rather than an hourly basis.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

On the issue of the future of work, where do our guests see this going?  Obviously, there is a pilot project.  I note that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stated that if the public service went to a four-day week it would add &euro;4.2 billion to the public service pay bill.  Are our guests aware of that?  Do they know anything about it or how it is calculated?  Does it give rise to concern?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021100600002#L00700"><p>It is clear how that has been calculated.  It has been calculated on the basis of an estimate that if one reduces time by 20%, one reduces productivity by 20% and increases employment costs by 20%.  It is clear from our discussion today and from the research and evidence that has been put forward that while there certainly are discussions that need to be had regarding how this could be implemented in certain sectors, it is a falsehood to say that reducing time automatically leads to a reduction in productivity and, therefore, an increase in employment costs.  In fairness, that figure was provided in response to a parliamentary question.  It is very similar to a response to a parliamentary question on this issue back in 2017.  As members are probably aware, parliamentary questions are often answered on the basis of the most recent information to hand.</p><p>We look forward to engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on this.  We have had positive interactions with the Ministers, Deputies Varadkar and Darragh O'Brien, on this issue and we have had a great deal of interest from all three Government parties and the other parties across the political system.  We are keen to engage on the basis we believe this can be trialled in aspects of the public service and the Civil Service in a way that will not impact on productivity and, therefore, will not impact on employment costs.  We think it is important for this to be a feature of the trial because much of the research suggests the public sector can play a pioneering role in introducing this.  There is significant private sector interest.  Even since I joined the committee meeting earlier, I have received four emails from companies in Ireland that are interested in being part of the programme next year.  We are keen for the pilot to be as broad as possible.</p></speech>

In 1908, when people moved to five-day week, it was revolutionary, so this too would be a paradigm shift.  With the impact of AI, flexible working, remote working and so on, much is happening and many changes are occurring.  This proposal is certainly worthy of debate.</p></speech>

It is a very important conversation.  I am struggling a little with the issue of the measurement of productivity.  Businesses' key performance indicators and how they are used will vary, such as a call centre or coffee shop compared with a design house or a company in the construction sector, where business is really caught up with the scheduling of other contractors.  It is difficult to say how productivity could be increased in the context of a shorter working week, yet productivity expansion, by its nature, is a competitive driver in all businesses.  Is the general thrust of this concept of a four-day working week aimed largely at the technology sector, rather than being expansive to all industry?  Other speakers have highlighted how difficult it would be in the context of care work and so on, where the working week cannot be compressed in that way.  How many other sectors do our guests foresee this as capable of being incorporated into?</p> <p>  It would be good if we could be kept abreast of the results of the pilot as they arise.  There might be much more interest in this concept if, as the pilot is developed, some of the early data that emerge could be made public.</p></speech>

As for the research, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  Comparing a call centre and its productivity to that of a retail unit or that of a software development company would not work.  We are keen to design productivity metrics that are relevant at the company level and, therefore, we work directly with companies to determine the most appropriate metrics for them and how they will determine the success of the trial.  That might vary for different companies and it might be sales or service standards.</p> <p>  We also need to ensure the data are nationally comparable, so we are using national indicators that are currently used in Ireland to determine productivity and output, and we are keen to ensure this will be internationally comparable, so we are examining how those broad productivity metrics can be compared.  We are trying to get the balance right between the company level, the national level and the international level.  We are working with a research team led by Professor Juliet Schor, economist and sociologist at Boston College, who has been researching working time and the future of work since the 1990s, and Dr. Orla Kelly, assistant professor at University College Dublin.  We are confident we will have the results from the first phase of the research project in September or October of next year and we hope to run further trials thereafter.  We will produce a full research report into the three phases of the trial, probably at some point in 2023.  We will be delighted to keep in touch with the committee as that unfolds.</p></speech>

We have found that the increase in productivity is happening automatically.  I might remind everyone about what happens in a week with a bank holiday.  We all get our work done in that week, regardless of the fact that we have had one fewer working day, because we are more focused, we have more energy and we have come in happier to work, so we have a greater output.  That is the focus.  It does challenge organisations but the technology is now there for any organisation to measure how a job is done, what the inputs into it are and what is needed to ensure the outputs.  We are a service organisation, not a tech organisation.  Across the board in many organisations, not just in tech, a four-day working week might be a solution for people in managing productivity.  It is important to remember that the ask and the reward are that in exchange for continuing to maintain 100% productivity, there will be an additional day off in people's lives every week in order for them to do something with it for themselves, their family and their community.</p></speech>

If people are being pushed to do, say, 20% more in their every working day, there must be some add-on effect to the quality of the output or of the gizmo being produced?  Does Ms Cox have any thoughts about how that is to be monitored going forward?</p></speech>

In our organisation, we talk about 100% customer satisfaction and 100% productivity, and the team members work to that standard.  We have set the standard but the standard has developed organically from everybody working there because we know what we have to do to retain this benefit as an organisation.  The value of having an additional day off each week is so great to each one of our lives.  The intention is to do it once, to do it right and to do it in the best way possible.  We have had to provide retraining and cross-training with colleagues.  We might have to send an email on a Thursday to our colleagues picking up some work from us on the Friday.  On a Friday evening, I might have to send an email to a colleague who will be in on the Monday to give details of the work I have been doing in order that the colleague can pick it up on the Monday because I will not be back in until the Tuesday.  Mr. Barnes used the word "gift" and it is in many ways a gift we have created for ourselves that we want to keep.  In order to do so, we need to be able to deliver inspirational customer service and 100% customer satisfaction.  I hope that has answered the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It has to come that way.</p> <p>  I raised this issue earlier but I will do so again in order that I am clear.  If there are certain sectors or areas where this is not possible to implement, are there concerns about creating a two-tier workforce?  Healthcare strikes me as an area where a four-day week cannot possibly be implemented.  Are there concerns as to the challenges this would cause?  This year, it is much more difficult for students to be accepted to study medicine or nursing.  Is there a concern, however, that five or ten years down the line, this could turn people off going into those professions?  That is something we have to be conscious of and seek to address.</p> <p>  Finally, does Mr. O'Connor have specific numbers on 2022 and on how many companies throughout the country have taken up the pilot scheme at this stage?</p></speech>

The doctor who has been working ten hours a day and is tired and stressed, or the doctor and the nurse who are refreshed, healthy and able to deliver a high quality of healthcare?  One of the problems is we already know our doctors and nurses are not working seven days a week, albeit our health system works seven days a week.  That is just a question of scheduling.  Will we need more doctors and nurses under a four-day week, reduced hours concept?  Absolutely.  The Government then has to look at the quality of the healthcare service being produced.  We find there is a shortage of doctors and nurses in healthcare.  All of them are coming out of the industry because they are burnt out.  If you can maintain them, you will not have to continually recruit, retrain or bring in temporary nurses or doctors to fill gaps.  If the profession is made more attractive, you are likely not only to get better outcomes from health but you will be better able to deliver it.</p> <p>  The key thing here is we all assume it will not work in this or that area.  I can probably point the committee to an employer or industry somewhere in the world that is working a four-day week very successfully because it has just reimagined how it is to deliver that service.</p></speech>

A number of others are still in the process of deliberations and it may be at their board.  Others are saying they might like to join at a later phase of the trial rather than the trial we are rolling out from next February.  Even today when we announced the number of companies that have signed up, we received interest from a number of others only this morning.  We anticipate and are quite hopeful that we will get to a space where we will be looking at somewhere between 20 and 30 companies participating in this first phase of the trial.  As I said, we are hoping, if we can demonstrate this is something that can work in those companies as part of the first phase of this trial, it will lead to further interest from the private sector.  We are hoping that, as we develop this pilot programme, we will be able to get to a point where there is voluntary sector and public sector participation in a very discreet and targeted way that will help to inform policy choices in the medium term.</p></speech>

His line of argument is that we should reduce their stress and the amount of work they are undertaking by bringing in a four-day week.  However, as I said, for many professions, such as childcare, productivity is linked directly to the amount of time workers put in, at the moment.  If somebody is working five days per week minding a certain number of children and that is reduced to four days a week, productivity has to drop.  We can talk about the quality of work but it comes back to how productivity is measured.  If you assume right now, let us say, that a childcare worker is of very high quality and you reduce his or her time by 20%, his or her work and productivity is linked to the time he or she puts in.  It is the same with teaching in the classroom.  If you are teaching in a classroom, as I did for many years, and you work extremely hard and put the time and effort in, how can your productivity be exactly the same?  By definition, you will be engaging with fewer students to start with if your time is reduced to fewer classes.  It is a question I am struggling to get an answer to.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor mentioned the public sector.  I take it the companies he is trialling with do not include public sector workers.  It will probably be important at some stage to have a trial that includes public sector workers before we can pronounce on it.  We just have private sector workers who, as Ms Cox and Ms McElwee said, are in a different area.  It is different from the public sector.</p> <p>  I might get in trouble for saying this, but has anyone ever looked at the time politicians put into the work we do?  We do not switch off at all, as Ms Cox will tell you.  I know I will get in trouble for this, but we are always on and the phone is always there.</p></speech>

As he said, in some areas, and childcare is one, you will have to bring in more staff.  I do not dispute that.  One of the things we are talking about here is understanding what output is as opposed to the amount of time spent.  The Deputy used the example of education.  A number of American education districts introduced a four-day week as a consequence of certain issues last year and found the children's education standards improved by reducing the number of hours they were taught.  They also found they could bring in teachers and get better teachers, and because they were bringing in better teachers or attracting people to the profession, the quality of the teaching went up.</p> <p>  There will always be exceptions that prove the rule, but we are trying to argue that we should rethink radically how we work and what it is we are trying to do so we are focused on the outcomes and not the time we spend.  That is what we should be focusing on.  If we can get better outcomes, why is it we assume a five-day week, brought in for repetitive, manufacturing processes in the 1920s, is the way to deliver the best outcomes in the 21st century when we are largely not doing that?  It is a difficult point to understand how we find that.  My question when I went to my staff was, quite simply, "Tell me how I should judge you; how will you get better productivity?"  That was the start of the conversation.</p></speech>

What I am getting to is the argument put forward by Mr. O'Connor and others that pay stays the same, time goes down but productivity stays the same.  Mr. Barnes is now saying that it is not just productivity but that it also has to do with improved outcomes, which is another argument and another issue we have to look at.  I accept what he is saying.  I am not arguing with him on this but it is important to tease these things out.  I thank Mr. Barnes for his response.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance as it is a long note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For people watching this meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting.  Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.</p> <p>  After all that, I invite Dr. Anthony Soares to make his opening statement.  He is very welcome.</p></speech>

This has led to intensive work in analysing relevant policies and legislation, much of it set out in written and oral submissions to numerous parliamentary inquiries as well as in many of our briefing papers.  Last March, and with the objective of improving our understanding of the context being shaped following the end of the Brexit transition phase and the entering into operation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the centre also initiated a quarterly survey of the conditions for North-South and east-west co-operation aimed at civil society organisations and local authorities on the island of Ireland.  The third quarterly survey has just recently ended and its results will be presented later this month.<br/><br/>As a means of gaining a more direct understanding and to secure engagement with the mechanisms of the protocol under the joint oversight of the UK Government and the European Commission, and as many other organisations on the island of Ireland share our concerns, in May 2020 the Centre for Cross Border Studies came together with a range of organisations to establish the<i></i>Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation, which the centre convenes.  It aims to act as a prime contact point for purposes of meaningful consultation between cross-Border civil society and regional, national and EU bodies on matters relevant to co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland and between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  In the first instance, in light of the protocol, the <i>ad hoc</i>group and organisations involved in its work have been engaging with relevant decision makers, including the European Commission's task force for relations with the United Kingdom, the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee, representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>The Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation is committed to working with others to safeguard co-operation and good relations within and between these islands and looks forward to doing so with those who are currently making decisions that will affect the future landscape for co-operation and the maintenance of relations between our peoples.  We do so conscious of the fact that the underlying context for such co-operation has changed, with its actors no longer operating from within a shared membership of the European Union and therefore, for some, with their governments and other relevant institutions no longer in a position to directly shape EU policies, particularly those such as cohesion policy, that support cross-Border co-operation.  The <i>ad hoc</i>group believes that for all interested parties, including the Irish Government, to properly monitor the impacts of the implementation of the protocol on the conditions for North-South co-operation there must be sustained and effective engagement with those who are intimately involved in such co-operation.<br/><br/>The Centre for Cross Border Studies believes that the Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation<i></i>represents an invaluable asset in this regard and calls on all parties to continue and deepen their engagement with the<i>ad hoc</i>group, including the bodies established under the protocol.  Such engagement would ensure that organisations from the Republic of Ireland are able to offer their perspectives on the extent to which they are able to engage in co-operation.  It is our belief that no serious monitoring of the impact of the implementation of the protocol on the conditions for North-South co-operation or on east-west relations can take place without hearing directly from those involved in such co-operation who are based in the Republic of Ireland.  I am grateful, therefore, that joining me today are representatives from three of the other organisations involved in the <i>ad hoc</i>group: Dr. Aoife N&iacute; Lochlainn, Brexit policy officer with the Irish Environmental Network; Ms Tara Farrell, chief executive officer, CEO, of Longford Women's Link; and Mr. Stephen Douds, president of the Irish Association.  We will be pleased to answer the members' questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021100600002#C00500"><p>I thank Dr. Soares for that introduction and for the briefing paper.  It is always great to have Dr. Soares involved in any Oireachtas committee, but particularly this one at this time.</p> <p>  I wish to tease out some of the points Dr. Soares made and, indeed, some of the points that have been made by the centre in recent months on this area.  The first one is what opportunities or avenues are available to get engagement from those who are simply refusing to engage with the process.  I refer to certain actors in Northern Ireland - civic society, political and economic - who want to boycott the North-South institutions and anything to do with the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  What role can be played and how can it be more effective in bringing them to the table and ensuring that they are heard?  Even though they might not think it, people want to hear them and to address the issues they raise.  Then it is going beyond them, the political entity, to the people they represent.  This is the great work the centre is doing, but the issue is the role of civic society in the post-Brexit area and the fact that it is so lacking.  What immediate efforts must be taken, primarily by the British and Irish Governments, and how realistic are those efforts, bearing in mind the North-South stand-off and also the difficulties between the British Government and the European Commission when it comes to the implementation of the protocol?</p> <p>  The last point is something on which I wish to gauge Dr. Soares's opinion.  It has arisen a few times in meetings we have had with representatives from Northern Ireland, both through this committee and otherwise.  It is about involving Northern Irish political representatives more in the EU decision-making process.  Obviously, that was fairly straightforward before Brexit.  Three Members of the European Parliament were elected from Northern Ireland, there were two members of the European Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and so forth.  They are gone.  A number of people, including Mr. Barry Andrews, MEP, and other members of this committee have stressed the need to provide observer status or, more likely, a more formal role.</p><p>Yesterday, the European Parliament set up its official delegation to the British Parliament.  That is welcome and I hope it will be reciprocated, but more is needed in terms of representation for Northern Ireland.  I would appreciate any opinion that Dr. Soares or his colleagues might have about how that might work.</p></speech>

I will offer some of the centre's insights, but I will begin by stressing something about engagement and giving a voice to those who are reluctant to engage around the issue of the protocol.  I will point to the quarterly survey on North-South and east-west co-operation, which is aimed at organisations and local authorities on the island of Ireland.  It gathers responses from a wide range of representatives from various organisations, including those that may have certain perspectives on the protocols.  It is a channel for them to offer their opinions in a way that is effective and gives us a broader understanding of how organisations based on the island of Ireland are able to co-operate North-South but also east-west.  It stresses the fact that we cannot speak about one set of relations without speaking about the entirety of relations, as an impact on one set will inevitably have an impact on another.</p> <p>  Regarding a refusal to co-operate under strand two of the Good Friday Agreement, the perspective of the Centre for Cross Border Studies is that the Good Friday Agreement has three strands.  I refer to it as a three-legged stool.  If we believe that one of those legs has taken damage, we should not cut off another leg.  Rather, we should try to repair the leg we perceive as damaged.  Cutting off the other leg is not a way of arriving at a solution.</p> <p>  In terms of political representation and channels for engagement, what is required is patience and not paying undue attention to some of the language being used in the political rhetoric.  As civic society organisations, we stress this and get on with what we have to do.  We co-operate North-South or east-west or both, no matter what is happening at the political level because the people we represent and for whom we work cannot wait for things to happen.  We have to continue working.  The political context is important for our ability to engage in our work and it can make matters more difficult, but we do not have a choice.  We have to get on with our work as civic society organisations and ensure that we maintain co-operation and relations on a North-South and east-west basis.</p> <p>  Regarding Northern Ireland's political representation in EU institutions, we must be conscious of the fact that the UK Government made its position very clear recently that it is the interlocutor with the EU and the EU's institutions.  It is reluctant to see Northern Ireland or the other devolved administrations usurp that role by being involved in EU institutions without the involvement of the UK Government.  However, there are significant opportunities to continue engagement.  One of the platforms for such engagement and for Northern Ireland to continue having its voice heard and being involved, even if indirectly, in the shaping of policy at EU level that might affect cross-Border co-operation is the Northern Ireland Executive's office in Brussels.  I hope that that office not only continues its work, but intensifies it, while also being conscious of the fact that it has to work alongside, and with the co-operation of, the UK Government.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to something that we view as a positive initiative, namely, the European Parliament's approval for setting up channels of dialogue between it and the UK Parliament.  We hope to see that kind of relationship expand.</p> <p>  Regardless of what happens, though, we as civic society organisations will have to continue working together North-South and east-west in order to improve the lives of the people we serve and maximise the benefits that come from co-operation.</p></speech>

I will follow the same route as Deputy Richmond in acknowledging the centre's long work in developing co-operation North-South.</p> <p>  I am looking for advice in terms of the actions of politicians in the South from the centre's perspective both in terms of tone and language.  Everyone recognises that there are real and practical issues to be addressed in the protocol.  From an EU perspective, we are determined to resolve those and make the protocol work as practically and unimpactfully as we can.  However, it is the reality that these issues are being bundled into a broader political position that often has different audiences.  When one listens to Lord Frost and his commentary at the British Tory Party conference in recent days, one makes allowances for the audience, but it is a difference audience than that for the DUP and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's commentary.  I am taken by Dr. Soares's advice to us to not respond to that political rhetoric or commentary but it ultimately has a destination.  There is a threat from the British Government to trigger Article 16 and suspend the protocol.  Equally, there is an assertion from the DUP to, within a defined and short timeline, end the institutions if these matters are not resolved.  These are not matters that, if they are not addressed, simply have no consequence.  Rather, they have very serious consequences.  In that context, has Dr. Soares any advice for us in terms of a practical response to those issues and assertions, particularly of recent days?</p></speech>

I will put on notice one of my colleagues, Ms Farrell, to whom I will tactfully hand over shortly in order to respond to some of them.</p> <p>  I will pick up on some of the points the Deputy raised, beginning with the threat to trigger Article 16 and suspend the protocol.  Triggering Article 16 does not in and of itself suspend the protocol.  Rather, it will only suspend certain parts of the protocol.  Civic society organisations understand that the politics of this can sometimes be magnified in a way that is not helpful.  We have also stressed, as I have done repeatedly, to key decision makers in this process that what is entirely unhelpful is the production of artificial deadlines.  They are not helpful, particularly in the context of Northern Ireland, because such deadlines lead to artificial points of crisis, increasing tensions and increasing uncertainty around the process.</p><p>One needs to be conscious of and aware of the effects of tone and language on community, on cohesion and on our ability to undertake co-operation on a North-South and east-west basis.  That cohesion is essential.  Community buy-in to the idea of cross-Border co-operation is also essential.  </p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Tara Farrell, CEO of Longford Women&rsquo;s Link, to pick up on some of those points.  </p></speech>

First, I will give the committee some context as to why an organisation from Longford, which is not a Border county, is engaged in the level of cross-Border and all-island collaboration in which we are engaged.  Longford Women&rsquo;s Link is a social enterprise.  We have been in existence for 26 years.  We provide services to approximately 1,200 women and children every year across a variety of fora, including education, entrepreneurship, domestic violence, community employment and so on.  We also engage in widespread regional and national advocacy.  I have been on the board of Irish Rural Link and am the current chair of AONTAS, the national adult learning organisation.  We have been working with the Centre for Cross Border Studies since 2015.  We believe that working at the grassroots level, as we do, is critical if we are to see meaningful co-operation and community development, working alongside an empowered civic society across these islands.  <br/><br/>My first point is that we have seen with Brexit what happens when civil society is largely excluded from central discussions.  I also make the point that as a women's organisation, we particularly see what happens when women&rsquo;s voices are excluded, particularly those from rural areas.  Those voices are essential if we want to build those inclusive and resilient communities.  We are involved in a number of cross-Border and all-island initiatives, including the Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation.  We have also been part of the initiative entitled A New Common Charter, which was initiated by the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  It is a common charter for co-operation on and between these islands.  It is an initiative to empower civic society to drive this collaboration between the islands.  The key point here is that if we do not have the proper functioning mechanisms and structures for civic society to engage and if they do not include organisations from the South, then we will not see meaningful engagement.  We will not see the true spirit of the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement being honoured.  <br/><br/>We have seen what has happened throughout the pandemic: civic society organisations have in by and large been deemed to be essential.  As we have been essential during this crisis, why are we not seen as essential to the implementation and monitoring of the protocol and Article 11, as well as on maintaining the necessary conditions for co-operation?  Organisations like Longford Women&rsquo;s Link are engaging in this work with our counterparts across the Border and on an east-west basis because we believe in that work.  We believe in the value of the work.  We believe in the totality of the Good Friday Agreement.  However, it is not just about financial resources, which obviously are always an issue.  This is about the energy that goes into maintaining these relationships and the consistent dialogue, which is important.  We have to look at the longer-term impact of our work.  In terms of engagement, whether it is with the <i>ad hoc</i>group, whether it is in relation to A New Common Charter, or whatever form it is, there should be a structured process for that engagement.  There should be pathways and outcomes, so that the engagement is not on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, which is the case at the moment.  <br/><br/>I am concerned that many civil society organisations, from the perspective of the South, will not be in a position to continue to improve or to continue to work on this <i>ad hoc</i>basis if we do not see real and meaningful long-term outcomes.  I hope the committee might share some of those concerns.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021100600002#E00400"><p>I thank all the witnesses.  There probably will be an element of agreement at this meeting that none of us can see David Frost's renaissance due to Brexit at this point in time.  The difficulties that exist within political unionism as regards their view of the Irish protocol already have been mentioned.  To a degree, I believe that it is a cul-de-sac that will create difficulties for unionism itself.  That being what it is, I obviously am highly wary of relying on the British Government as an interlocutor.  It has done a poor job over any period in Irish history, whether that is the last 100 years, 800 years or whatever.  The democratic deficit that exists in respect of the North, as well as the lack of representation, needs to be dealt with.  In fairness, to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, when the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, was going through the Parliament, he agreed that there needed to be some sort of remedy to that and he spoke about it.  There is an onus on all of us to play what part we can to deal with that democratic deficit.</p> <p>  I would be interested to learn what are the main takeaways from the research or survey the Centre for Cross Border Studies has carried out.  As for the operations of the protocol, we know where political unionism stands.  However, we have heard from many quarters, and I have heard it myself, that a significant number of people from a unionist background who work in civil society, business or farming are looking to get by in life and to get by in business.  They are looking to do the best to mitigate and deal with the difficulties.  I am interested in the groups with which the witnesses have had interactions on a cross-Border basis.  Where do the witnesses perceive civil society, businesses, farmers and all those other stakeholders to be when the political sphere is taken away?  I seek an answer to that question, as well as, in particular, on the main takeaways from the ins and outs of what the survey has thrown up? </p></speech>

The only thing I would say in response to that is that in respect of the protocol, the withdrawal agreement, the trade and co-operation agreement and the structures that are created under that trade and co-operation agreement, the prime interlocutors in those agreements are the UK Government and the European Commission.  They are the two parties to those agreements and they are responsible overall for the operation of the agreements and their various mechanisms.  We have to work within that context.  It was the context that was given to us and is the context in which we have to work.</p> <p>  In terms of the lack of Northern Ireland representation, I will briefly refer to, for example, the trade and co-operation agreement and again to the civil society engagement with political representatives.  A civil society forum has been established under the trade and co-operation agreement, which is between the UK and the European Union in respect of civic society and it includes business, trade unions etc.  I will briefly note that whereas there might be some concerns that the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is primarily focused on the North-South relations, there are some concerns as to where the east-west relations fit into the agreement.  The structures created under the trade and co-operation agreement perhaps offer opportunities to redress some of that east-west balance, in terms of getting those channels of dialogue on an east-west basis, as well as with the EU.  </p> <p>  Briefly on the survey, I would first mention that the survey only closed on Thursday of last week.  We are currently analysing the results in detail.  They will be presented online live at 10 a.m. on Friday, 22 October.  There will be a detailed presentation on the analysis of the results and what they signify.  Before commenting on some of the results, I want to underline, stress and express my enormous gratitude to those organisations and representatives of local authorities who have responded to that survey.  Their responses inform us as we engage with political representatives.</p><p>They allow us to speak to this committee and others and to the UK Government and others and in doing so to cite evidence of how civic society organisations and local authorities on the island of Ireland are experiencing or commenting on the ability to co-operate since 1 January 2021.  We have just completed our third quarterly survey.  We asked people to comment on the political, social, regulatory and material contexts in which North-South and east-west co-operation is taking place.  We asked respondents to comment on how they see those contexts and whether those contexts are supportive of co-operation.</p><p> I will refer to the first quarterly survey results, just to give the committee an idea of the situation regarding the political context for North-South co-operation in March 2021.  At that time, 60% of respondents indicated that the political context had deteriorated in respect of their ability to co-operate.  The outcome improved slightly in the third quarter, with 36% of respondents saying that it had deteriorated.  I stress that 36% of respondents are still saying that things are getting worse in respect of the political context being supportive of North-South co-operation.  Some 54% of respondents said that it had stayed more or less the same.  Therefore, we started at a very negative point in quarter one.  A significant percentage of respondents still see things as deteriorating, but 54% now indicate that things have stayed more or less the same.  I note that the survey closed on the Thursday and the comments by Lord Frost on Article 16 of the protocol were made on the Friday, so people were not influenced by that and could not take that into account.</p><p> To give an indication of the situation regarding the east-west political context, some 60% of respondents to our survey in quarter one had said that it had deteriorated.  That outcome has now changed to 39.3% of respondents indicating that things have deteriorated in respect of the political context for east-west co-operation.  That is a significant result, because it indicates that even compared to quarter two things have deteriorated in respect of the political context for co-operation.  More detail will be given on the results of this survey, but I will pass over now to Mr. Stephen Douds, president of the Irish Association, to give some additional comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Douds" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021100600002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chair and Dr. Soares and Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for his question.  Some members may already be aware of the Irish Association.  It is one of the longest-standing organisations promoting non-party political co-operation across the island.  We are a membership-driven forum, and membership is open to all, regardless of party, religious belief and existing party political membership.  The thrust of the aims of our organisation is for better relations.  Our fuller title from our foundation was the Irish Association for Culture, Economic and Social Relations.  I imagine when the organisation was founded that people could not conceive of political co-operation.</p> <p>  At the time of the Brexit vote in 2016, we had members on our council who were pro-Brexit.  Those were people from a broad unionist background, what I think Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to as "political unionism".  Nonetheless, they were members of an organisation that wanted good relations across the island and that was an impartial forum for dialogue and debate.  That speaks to people having multiple identities, in 2016 and today.  In Belfast, where I live and where I am the chair, we alternate in our executive team every two to three years between North and South.  I succeeded Bob Collins, formerly of RT&Eacute;, who also spent 15 years after that in public life and civic society up here in Northern Ireland.  It is worth pointing out therefore that people have multiple identities.  There are people in Northern Ireland, then, with long-term constitutional aspirations for the maintenance of the Union and there are other people in our organisation with different constitutional preferences.  This has been a challenging time therefore because we have been on diverging paths since the vote on Brexit in 2016.</p> <p>  As we operate the protocol now, however, as I think the Deputy said, we must recognise that there is complexity below that of the formal political level in other areas of economic co-operation, cultural life and social relations.  Bringing this issue back to an earlier question, while party political representatives are asking for Article 16 to come into play and perhaps seeking the abandonment of the protocol, they represent people who have more complexity.  Recognising that aspect might mitigate the current and delicate crisis in which we find ourselves.  I thank the committee.  </p></speech>

Ms Farrell answered some of my questions already, but I will pose a query for her and for Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn.  Is the row about the protocol, and the political machinations in that regard, obstructing their work and obstructing the need for us to co-operate on that work and on so much other cross-community work?  For example, the agenda of Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn's organisation does not stop at the Border.  Equally, the agenda of Ms Farrell's group also does not stop at the Border.  Women on this island face serious challenges in respect of opportunities in the areas of healthcare, education and equality, regardless of whether they are in Belfast or Tralee.</p> <p>  Is it not possible to build greater co-operation that unites us in addressing such common issues?  I refer to those issues that do not respect our Border.  We were getting there before Brexit.  It struck me that as an island we could have done so much better in dealing with the impact of Covid-19 had we worked on an all-island basis.  Are there issues, therefore, within the witnesses' network and within the constituent groups, where it would it be possible to get around and negate the ongoing political machinations?  The reality is that people facing challenges in their daily lives look to Ms Farrell and Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn's organisations and those other groups that make up this network.  How do we get that message out?   </p></speech>

I will be brief and then hand over to Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn.  The Deputy has highlighted the crux of this situation.  To pick up on the point made by Dr. Soares in his opening statement, as civil society organisations we are getting on with things.  Longford Women's Link has been involved in at least six cross-Border programmes in recent years.  Several of them were initiated by us because we see the parallels in the context of the difficulties and potential solutions shared between women's organisations.  We are involved in a programme with WOMEN'STEC in Belfast that looks at women in non-traditional spaces.  We are just starting a programme with the Northern Ireland Rural Women's Network, NIRWN, entitled, From Grassroots to Government.  Both of those endeavours are supported by the reconciliation fund.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that financial resources are important.  The reconciliation fund, in particular, has been important in allowing us to do this work, which goes beyond financial resources in many cases, however.  What we need in addition is for the outcomes of these projects to be listened to and to be incorporated in other areas.  That is why appearing here this morning and being able to share the results of our work is so important.  </p> <p>  We are working in several spaces, including rural engagement, adult education, domestic violence and so on.  Anecdotally, what I am hearing from many of our colleagues is exactly what Deputy Calleary said in respect of the uncertainty around the protocol.  It is suggesting to us that organisations that may be more distant from the Border and this type of work geographically are either not considering the opportunities or are actively deciding that the current uncertainty means that they will not engage.  For me, that is the crux of the issue.  We are concerned that we are regressing a little.  The Deputy mentioned the context of the pandemic.  We have started to see the "them and us" type of language creeping in again and references to who was travelling over the Border at different stages, depending on the restrictions, to do shopping or to engage in social activity, etc.  That is unhelpful.  It is important therefore for us to have a structured pathway to be able to feed the work we are doing into committees like this and to policy-makers and to endeavour to put in place proper structures so that we can engage on an all-island basis.</p><p>As stated earlier by Dr. Soares and others, we cannot have proper meaningful engagement without organisations from the South as well as the North.  I will hand over to Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn now.</p></speech>

The short answer to the question is "Yes".  The current issues around the protocol, in particular the suspension of the North-South Ministerial Council work, has definitely impeded co-operation on environmental issues on the island of Ireland.  There is no doubt about that.  My role in the Irish Environmental Network and the environmental pillar is to develop North-South environmental co-operation in the NGO sector.  The environmental NGOs in the Republic of Ireland and colleagues in Northern Ireland work together to advocate for those all-island environmental solutions mentioned, such as climate change, biodiversity, habitat protections, the marine, etc.  We also work on joint research projects and our individual member groups, of which there are many across the country, work with each other on specific environmental cross-Border protection projects and on issues such as cross-Border dumping, illegal waste, etc.</p> <p>  As part of that cross-Border co-operation, we have collaborated with our opposite number in Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Environment Link, to produce a report which identified the main risks to the environmental integrity of the island posed by Brexit.  This report was published in 2019.  Members are probably all familiar with the risks identified, as I know the report was discussed by various committees, but it highlighted the risks of regulatory divergence, the loss of those supernational governance structures of the EU and our ability to engage with the new governance structures. While the trade and co-operation agreement and the protocol have partially mitigated these risks, they are not fully mitigated.  The solution advocated at the time by the environmental pillar and Northern Ireland Environmental Link, was that the Good Friday Agreement bodies should step into that lacuna and take up some of the cross-Border work.  With the political situation being what it is, that work is not happening.  This is detrimental to work on policy issues on which we are behind in our work.  As we are here today to discuss civil society engagement, it is important to point out that even when functioning as designed the Good Friday Agreement bodies are impenetrable to most of civil society.  They are highly diplomatic processes and NGOs such as ourselves have very few routes to engagement on the matters under discussion within those bodies.</p> <p>  Colleagues here today have spoken about how engagement with civil society needs to come from both sides of the Border.  If we are to have the type of cross-Border co-operation which I mentioned our membership engage with, we need to ensure there are structures and mechanisms for them to engage with.  Without those structures, as mentioned by Ms Farrell, there is a real risk that the co-operation, enthusiasm and opportunity will fall away.  That would be to everybody's detriment.  The engagement needs to be inclusive of all civil society sectors, including the NGOs in the Republic of Ireland.  Much of the conversation around the protocol has neglected the cross-Border co-operation element in civil society.  It has focused, understandably, on democratic deficits in Northern Ireland.  We are here today to talk about how NGOs in the Republic of Ireland can be better brought into those processes into the future. </p></speech>

I am delighted to learn more about what it is doing, its aims and objectives.  Many speakers have talked about the political context.  It seems it is not very good and that that is very detrimental to the centre's work on the issues of the Northern Ireland protocol and the threat to invoke Article 16.  I admire the witnesses' statements that they are going to just get on with it and continue to work together.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  Has there been any feedback to date from the civic society organisations, in particular farmers and businesses, on the benefits of the Northern Ireland protocol and how that might be good for the economy of Northern Ireland?  In the witnesses' interactions with their members, has that come up for discussion?  My second question is in regard to the shared island initiative brought forward by the Taoiseach and supported by the Government of Ireland, which aims to promote dialogue in the context of the notion of a shared island.  Under that initiative, there have been a number of seminars and conferences to date with various themes.  The intention is to have these themed seminars, whether in regard to young people, women's issues, environmental issues, business and so on.  I would welcome the witnesses' views on that initiative.  Are they interacting with it and do they believe it is beneficial?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021100600002#G00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will touch on both of them briefly and then hand over to Mr. Douds and other colleagues who may wish to comment.  In terms of feedback from farmers and businesses, in the last quarterly survey space was provided for people to indicate not only if they were satisfied or unsatisfied but to expand on their answers.  There was some commentary from local authorities and business representative groups and organisations indicating that they see opportunities coming of the protocol but that, perhaps, those opportunities are not being grasped with sufficient energy because of the political background which makes that more difficult.  I refer the Deputy to the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group and its commentary in terms of the implementation of the protocol, what that means for business and what they see as the necessary solutions in order to maximise the opportunities.</p> <p>  In terms of the shared island initiative, from the perspective of the Centre for Cross Border Studies it has enormous potential.  We have participated in all of the dialogues to date, including the most recent on education.  We engage with the shared island unit in all sorts of ways to try to make sure that we maximise the opportunities coming out of the shared island initiative.  I wear another hat, that is, secretary to the Standing Conference on Teacher Education North and South, SCoTENS, which I am pleased to wear.  The shared island initiative has initiated a collaboration with SCoTENS on the issue of funding for people involved in teacher education North and South in order to undertake research on education, which is really welcome.  There is one issue, which is not necessarily a negative, in regard to the national development plan published yesterday and what it contained in terms of the North-South dimension, that is, for us to be able to maximise the opportunities provided by the shared island initiative and the national development plan, we need the two sides, North and South, to work together.</p><p>If one pole of that co-operation is not engaged or has difficulties with it then we are not going to be able to maximise the opportunities derived from the shared island initiative or from the national development plan.  I am hopeful that we will be able to do so.  I stress again, that in terms of civil society we will grasp any opportunity and we will always be open to grasping those opportunities that are provided to us to enhance our co-operation, North-South and east-west.  Obviously, we would really welcome the political dimension being more favourable to that co-operation in order for us to exploit the opportunities.  I will now hand over to my colleague Mr. Douds.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Douds" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021100600002#H00200"><p>I thank Dr. Soares and I thank also Deputy Haughey for his question.  What links both questions is the notion of economic relations between both jurisdictions on the island.  As Dr. Soares has said, while the political environment might not be the most conducive to economic co-operation, businesses are in the business of getting on with it.  That is true for farming, which is Northern Ireland's biggest business.  There are a number of straws in the wind.  I am no economist but certainly from following business news and from picking up some straws in the wind, there is a more dappled picture, and perhaps a more complex and mottled picture, of the opportunities that the protocol is presenting and especially in manufacturing and the food sector in Northern Ireland.  An emphasis or a little bit more attention on economic opportunities, which sometimes is ahead of the political debate and dialogue, might open up a slightly more complex picture.<br/><br/>On the shared island initiative, we have benefited from very positive engagement with the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is also worth saying that I am aware from the Irish Association and many of our members, and I know from some of the conversations in this wider <i>ad hoc </i>group, many of the organisations associated with the Centre for Cross Border Studies welcome the language used about the shared island.  It shifts the dial slightly.  Since it was announced, the Taoiseach and that Department have not had as much bandwidth because of Covid, which has demanded so much time and attention from politicians and from civil servants.  There is enormous potential there.  The potential exists alongside the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the reconciliation fund that is run from that Department.  I believe that some flesh on the bone of what the shared island unit might be able to do and might be able to fund would be very welcome.  One significant point is that it is operating also at local authority level, sometimes away from the Assembly and the heated context of the Assembly.  There are Assembly elections due next year and at a local authority level, with North and South working together, it might be possible to achieve some good work around capital development projects there.</p></speech>

If I ask a question that has previously been asked, please forgive me.  I will plough on nonetheless.</p> <p>  I am very strongly supportive of the witnesses' work in principle and in practice.  As somebody from a Border county who has represented that county here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and at European Parliament level, I am aware of some of the very important work the witnesses' organisations do.  Sometimes, a lot of it is invisible work but this is the work that helps to build foundations and brings people together.  It is hugely important.</p> <p>  I have one or two questions for the witnesses and I apologise again that I was not part of the discussions for the first 45 minutes.  In the context of Brexit and the protocol, I was reading through the conclusions for the witnesses' document where it says that a wider process of engagement is needed beyond the business community.  I would have thought that there was a very significant process of engagement along the Border areas, for example, in the health area with the Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, programme, and others.  What is happening with those?  I have not followed up for perhaps 12 or 18 months.  I wonder where they are.  To me that was a very strong and powerful programme that worked well.  There are also all of the various programmes supported by the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, whether it is environmental or cultural etc.  Have those programmes been sidelined to some extent in the context of Brexit?  I am thinking specifically in terms of European Union funds.  If those funds are flowing, what are the positive outcomes from those?  I am not blaming civil society but I am asking whether the positive outcomes from those and the avenues into which they feed have been shut off or whether significant diversions simply have been put in the way.</p> <p>  My second question also refers to the conclusions where it says that it is imperative that civic society organisations involved in North-South co-operation are represented in any process for engagement between civic society and those responsible for the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and its protocol, and only by ensuring these steps are taken.  Have we taken those steps?  What are the steps we need to take to ensure that?  What are the blockages?  What can a committee like this do to try to get rid of some of the blockages?</p> <p>  Adding on to Deputy Haughey's question about the agricultural sector, consider the dairy industry, for example.  Both sides of the Border literally rely on one another in the processing plants and the different timetables they have for production and they fit perfectly together to maximise output.  One of the things I know about farmers is that they look to the bottom line.  In that context, has any progress been made there?  We know that our global markets in the dairy industry and especially around baby milk formula and so on, rely very heavily on the co-operation in the Border area.  What impact is that having?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021100600002#H00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I will briefly respond to those questions.  On the context for engagement and the wider civic society engagement beyond business, we did not at all mean to minimise in any way the importance of engagement with the business sector on how the protocol is implemented and how we shape to post-Brexit context.  We were trying to emphasise that we must try to avoid a dialogue between those responsible for the implementation of the protocol that prioritises business and trying to arrive at business solutions almost to the exclusion of wider civic society.  If there is not that wider civic society engagement, there is a potential for arriving at solutions that work well for business but do not fit into, or do not necessarily land well, within wider civic society.  The solutions might need to be arrived at through that wider civic society dialogue to avoid that potential of solutions that might work for business but which might not be immediately acceptable within communities on the island of Ireland, for whatever reason.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to CAWT and co-operation in the health area, as well as the SEUPB and the programmes it manages through EU funding.</p><p>It is enormously rich and positive.  The programmes that are funded by the EU and managed by the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, have enabled us to do so much cross-Border co-operation and brought us light years ahead of where we were 20 years ago.  It has been extremely positive and in that sense, we are really hopeful that the new PEACE PLUS programme will enable us to continue to do the same or even more in terms of North, South, cross-Border co-operation going forward.  The PEACE PLUS programme represents an enormous opportunity for us all in terms of wider civic society working together to exploit the opportunities that exist through co-operation.  Obviously there are some difficulties at the moment in terms of final sign off on the financial package because of obstacles at the political level around strand two but we are really hopeful that we can arrive at a solution very quickly in order to finalise the PEACE PLUS programme.  People are desperately waiting for that to hit the ground.  The committee will be very aware that many civic society organisations that have been in receipt of EU funding in the past are very fearful of the gap between funding ending under the current programme and the beginning of the new PEACE PLUS programme.  It is important to avoid an overly long gap between one programme and the other.  <br/><br/>Regarding civic society engagement with the mechanisms of the protocol, I would point to the fact that there have been initiatives from the UK Government and the European Commission, with the co-chairs of the joint committee on the withdrawal agreement and the co-chairs on the specialised committee on the protocol engaging with civic society.  We have been part of that engagement but what we have been trying to point out is that going forward, we must ensure there is a more structured process of engagement.We must be made aware of the agenda in advance of any meetings and know what issues will be discussed at those meetings.  Minutes must be kept and people must know who is present at those meetings.  In that way, civic society organisations that are not directly at the table will know which organisations are going to be there so that they can give feedback to them and raise issues with them.  Similarly, those representatives who are at the table can provide feedback to others on the progress, or lack thereof, on issues between meetings.  We need a more structured process because to date, we would have to characterise it as rather <i>ad hoc</i>.  There are no agendas, we do not know who is going to be present at the meetings and we do not know what happens between meetings.  For all we know, a lot might be happening in the background.  Officials from the UK Government and the European Commission might be doing lots of work on the issues raised at these meetings but we are not aware of it because there is no real feedback.  One of the current obstacles is the lack of work on a structured process for civic society engagement.  In terms of civic society engagement around North-South co-operation, that dialogue must involve organisations at the two poles, the two sides of that co-operation.  We must avoid working just with organisations in Northern Ireland to discuss issues around North-South co-operation because co-operation involves both sides.  We need representation from organisations in the Republic of Ireland as well.<br/><br/>Obviously, at the end of the day we do not make the decisions but we want to be involved in the dialogue.  We are entirely aware of that and are not asking to be decision makers in that regard.  The decision makers are the UK Government and the European Commission in terms of their oversight.  They are the ultimate decision makers but we want to inform them so that they can arrive at decisions that will ensure we maintain the necessary conditions for North-South co-operation as set out in Article 11 of the protocol.  We need to be able to engage in dialogue.<br/><br/>In terms of the agricultural sector and dairy, Deputy Harkin is absolutely right.  We know her as a champion of Border counties and of cross-Border co-operation.  She is very familiar with the integrated nature of the agrifood sector on the island of Ireland.  We have seen strategies produced by both jurisdictions on the future of the agrifood sector, including the Northern Ireland agrifood sector, which speak of an all-island agrifood sector.  That is the way they operate and that is the way they wish to continue to operate.  However, from the Northern Ireland perspective, farmers' representative groups have raised the issue of the east-west dimension and how that might impact their operations going forward.  Again, we hope that we will arrive at solutions that mitigate those impacts and really make the agrifood sector even more dynamic going forward, to the benefit of our communities, particularly those in the Border counties.</p></speech>

They have whetted our appetite for more discussion.  They have raised a lot of issues with us today and in their submission they have called for a more structured approach.  That is something this committee should think about.</p> <p>  Reference was made to climate change and sustainability, and the possibility of working together on a cross-Border basis at a practical level.  I am sure Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn is familiar with the Politics in Action programme.  Mr. Peter Weil and Mr. Dave O'Brien of that programme have been working with young people through the Glencree centre.  Young people go straight for the jugular in terms of the issues.  They do not get caught up in or bogged down by the issues in the way politicians do.  They reach out for the big, heavy issues and are not afraid to get stuck into them, including issues like education, climate change, future business, future work and where we are going.  If the witnesses need to make contact with the Politics in Action programme, the committee secretariat would be happy to help.</p> <p>  The empowerment and education of women through second-chance education is an area in which I have a keen interest.  I worked on a number of programmes in that area before I got involved in my current profession.  I know the value of that work and would agree with what Dr. Soares said about the PEACE PLUS programme.  We need more of that.  We need more engagement and more opportunities for women to work collaboratively on a cross-Border basis.  At the end of the day, there is real potential there in terms of second-chance education and empowerment.  It is not just about empowering individuals but also empowering communities so any help we can provide in that regard will be forthcoming.  </p> <p>  Dr. Soares called for a better process with a more structured agenda and we actually had that during the Brexit discussions through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It laid out a very credible, structured process on a cross-Border basis so in that context, we are not talking about reinventing the wheel.  There is a potential governmental structure there that we could possibly look at.  We could devote an entire day, if not weeks, months or years to talking about multiple identities.  The complexity that surrounds that may exist below the political level.  While I do not want to open up the debate again, I must ask a few questions around that.  Is there enough safe space being created to discuss the complexities of identity and multiple identities?  Is there enough safe space being created for people to express their own identity or identity preferences, be that Irish, British, British-Irish, Irish-British or Northern Irish?  The non-political group to which the witnesses belong has a very interesting composition in terms of focusing totally outside of politics, which is perhaps where the safe space lies.  Has the group looked at the history of Canada and how it has evolved and grappled issues of identity and multiple identity including people identifying as Canadian, French-Canadian, British-Canadian, Irish-Canadian, Scottish-Irish-Canadian, Welsh-Canadian, Manx-Canadian and so on?  Canada is a country with no shortage of discussion points around multiple identity.</p><p>A more comprehensive answer may be required but I would be very interested to hear brief feedback on that point from Mr. Douds.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  The short answer is "Yes", there are enough safe spaces.  There is a multiplicity of safe spaces and forums.  Interestingly, in the past year and a half, as a result of Covid, we have moved online many of our debate seminar events.  Oddly, one of the few positives of holding such events online is that one is able to draw together for events on Zoom people who possibly would not otherwise come together to meet face to face.  There is no opportunity to continue the debate afterwards over a glass of wine and have social relations, but there certainly is the opportunity to bring together people who would not otherwise participate.  People can express their own identities.</p> <p>  One of the events we ran online in February was chaired by Professor Katy Hayward of Queen's University Belfast, who will be known to many of the committee.  It was a new voices initiative at which we asked some recently elected politicians from both jurisdictions to speak about issues that were common to them.  I know many of the committee members will remember being recently elected to the D&aacute;il or to local authorities.  Even in February, at a time when debate on the protocol was at its height, there was a different DUP leader and the political parties on the unionist side of the benches in Stormont were urging very little co-operation, we were able to have a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy from County Cork, along with members of the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party at local authority level, share experiences that were common to them.  By and large, our organisation stays away from the political space, but when we stepped into that space it was relatively straightforward to ask people to debate common concerns as politicians working in both jurisdictions against the backdrop of Brexit and the protocol.  This is the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and committee members know those factors have definitely changed the context in which people work.</p> <p>  I had not thought of the example of Canada in this context.  I thank the Chairman for that suggestion.  Through family connections, I am much more familiar with Switzerland as a place much closer to us in Europe, although not a member of the EU, where different strands of culture, identity and social relations have managed to live together.  I am happy to consider the issue and perhaps speak to the Canadian representation in Dublin to learn more about that.</p></speech>

The primary purpose of this legislation is to amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to provide for the transposition of the EU whistleblowing directive.  The directive is a significant piece of EU legislation.  It is specific about how protected disclosures are supposed to be managed and, in many areas, member states transposing it have limited discretion.  Nevertheless, in the context of the discretion that is available and in considering how to transpose the directive, we have also taken the opportunity to reflect on how our domestic legislation has been operating and consider what can be done to improve it.</p> <p>  The 2014 Act was innovative legislation for its time.  It drew heavily from recommendations of the Council of Europe, the G20 and the OECD, among others, as regards best practice in legislating for the protection of whistleblowers.  At the time, Ireland was only the sixth country in the EU to enact a comprehensive whistleblower protection law and the Act continues to be ranked highly in international comparisons for the protections it offers.</p> <p>  Of course, what matters most is not necessarily what is written in the legislation, but how that legislation operates in practice.  In this regard, the approach we have taken to developing this Bill has been informed by the submissions that were made to the public consultation on the transposition; the Act's statutory review, which was published in 2018; and direct consultations we have had with a range of stakeholders, including public service managers responsible for handling protected disclosures in their organisations, prescribed persons, employers groups, academics and Transparency International Ireland, among others.</p><p>One of the principal issues with the 2014 Act is that it is largely silent about what is expected of employers, prescribed persons or other recipients with regard to what they are supposed to do when they receive a protected disclosure.  This new legislation imposes a strict obligation on recipients to acknowledge receipt of protected disclosures, to follow up on the information reported and to give feedback to the discloser within a specified timeframe.  This will go a long way to ensuing the disclosures are dealt with properly and promptly and that disclosers are reassured that their concerns are being dealt with seriously by being kept informed of what is happening.</p><p> We are proposing the establishment of a protected disclosures office in the Office of the Ombudsman.  This will make it easier for workers to report wrongdoing to prescribed persons.  With more than 100 prescribed persons, it is not always clear to workers which prescribed person they should report to.  The protected disclosures office will have a key role in directing reports to the right place.  The office will also cover any gaps in coverage by following up on disclosures directly if there are no appropriate prescribed persons to report to for a particular matter.  Prescribed persons will also be subject to the obligation to acknowledge, follow-up and give feedback in respect of all disclosures they receive.  The protected disclosures office will also provide expert support to Ministers in respect of any protected disclosures they receive.</p><p> The proposed legislation will further strengthen the position of whistleblowers who are penalised and have to resort to the WRC or the courts for redress in that the burden of proof will now lie with the employer to prove any alleged act of penalisation did not arise as a consequence of a protected disclosure.  We are also extending the provision of interim relief beyond dismissal to cover other acts of penalisation, so the courts will be able to intervene more quickly to protect whistleblowers from penalisation.</p><p> All of this will make the legislation stronger.  As I have said, it is the implementation of the legislation that matters and we recognise that we need to do more in this area.  We are taking steps in parallel with developing the legislation to drive better implementation of the Act.  We are undertaking a complete overhaul of the statutory guidance on the Act to take into account the changes the new legislation will bring, to incorporate lessons learned, and to provide better and more detailed advice on key areas of implementation that arise frequently.  We are also developing guidance to assist the private sector in meeting the new obligations for private employers with 50 or more employees to have formal whistleblowing channels.  This will be made available shortly after the Bill is published.  We will refresh the procurement framework for training services for public sector bodies to ensure that staff designated to receive and follow up on protected disclosures are professionally trained to better deal with whistleblowers in their organisation.  We also intend to further develop and enhance existing networks of protected disclosures managers across the public service to facilitate exchange of best practices and address common implementation issues as they arise.</p><p> Strong legislation is an important component in any ecosystem designed to support and protect whistleblowers.  It is also crucial to have the right organisational culture that will encourage workers to speak up without fear of reprisal as a number of other contributors to the committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme have highlighted.</p><p> Whistleblowers play a vital role in bringing wrongdoing to light.  For example, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners has found that 43% of workplace fraud is detected by way of tip-offs, mainly from employees, compared with just 15% by internal audit and 2% by law enforcement.  In Ireland, four out of every five workers who report wrongdoing suffer no retaliation as a consequence of doing so, based on research undertaken.  However, where retaliation occurs, as this committee has seen, it can have devastating consequences for whistleblowers and their families.  The case for strengthening the legal protections for whistleblowers is clear and this Bill represents a step in the right direction in this regard.  My colleagues and me are happy to answer any questions the committee has about the proposed legislation.  We welcome its contribution to the debate.</p></speech>

Has he considered the testimony of the number of whistleblowers that we have had before us, including other examples from outside this committee, such as whistleblowers who have come forward publicly to comment on the legislation?  Is that part of the Department's consideration?</p></speech>

We have studied the transcripts of the committee's earlier meetings and we are struck by those testimonies and the contributions of the whistleblowers.  As I said in my opening statement, it highlights when the processes and procedures in place under the legislation do not serve the needs of specific people.  We can see all too clearly the impact that it has on their lives and circumstances.  We all want to try to take into account those experiences and to ensure that, in devising this new legislation, we learn from what they can tell us.  We have been studying those contributions and the contributions of the other contributors at the committee's earlier meetings.  I invite my colleague, Mr. Keane, to say a word about the other parties that we have consulted with.  It is maybe useful for the committee to be aware of the conversations we have had and the people we have consulted with as part of this process.</p></speech>

It was held last summer, in June and July 2020.  We received 24 submissions from a range of stakeholders, including whistleblowers, whistleblower advocacy groups, employers, public bodies, legal professionals and academics.  These submissions have fed into the development of the Bill.  We have also taken into consideration the 25 submissions received as part of the 2018 statutory review of the Protected Disclosures Act.  In addition, we have also held seminars on the transposition of the directive with public sector protected disclosure managers and prescribed persons.  We have also had direct engagement with a number of interested parties, including Transparency International Ireland, IBEC, the Charities Regulator, Volunteer Ireland, the WRC, and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go maith &eacute;isteacht agus tuairim&iacute; nua a fh&aacute;il.  I have three questions.  The first question is about the stepped reporting procedure in this new Bill.  It is something that people have mentioned in previous committees.  They are concerned that it might lengthen the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#D00600"><p>One issue that we have become aware of in the operation of the current legislation is slight confusion about the processes for those wishing to make a protected disclosure.  At the heart of the EU directive is this concept of a stepped procedure and process.  We have tried to take that on board in the approach to the general scheme.  It is primarily intended to ensure that there is complete clarity with regard to how these matters are to be progressed and processed, who is to process them, and the timeframe within which they are to be processed.  The step process, as we have tried to set it out, enables us to bring complete clarity to it.  My colleagues will want to comment in more detail on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara Morgan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#D00700"><p>It comes to the heart of the legislation.  What we have learned in the negotiations on the directive with our colleagues in the EU is that those best placed to address a report in the first instance are usually the employers.  As my colleague, Mr. Menton, said in the opening statement, in many instances, the report is addressed, but sometimes it is not even recognised as a protected disclosure, the wrongdoing is addressed, and everybody moves on with no penalisation.</p><p>However, when it goes wrong it can go very wrong.  Then you have this stepped process.  You can make a report to your employer.  If they fail in their obligation to address that report then you have recourse to get what we call a prescribed person, which the EU refers to as a competent authority, which generally tends to be the regulator in that area.  In instances where that interaction fails, which should be very unusual, you then have recourse to move into a more public forum.  To be clear, that stepped process does not stop individuals and workers from going directly to the prescribed person.  That is always an option as well if it is his or her preference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#E00200"><p>I thank Ms Morgan.  All of us who have dealt with and spoken to whistleblowers know it can be something that takes a huge amount of time, the concern there being the massive toll that has on mental health, which I will come back to, as well as financial resources and everything else.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the concept of interpersonal grievance.  There would obviously be concerns about that.  If somebody were working with me and we did not get on or whatever it may be, could it then be seen as an interpersonal grievance, if that person was trying to whistleblow on me, so to speak?  That is an area of concern.  How do the officials feel that would work?  In what ways would that actually hinder people?  We must look at it in that sense as well, if it does hinder people, and be straight up and honest about that.  Alternatively, how do the officials feel the Bill stops that from hindering people?  I would be interested in answers to those and then I have one more question.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#E00500"><p>I will set out some of the thinking behind this.  The purpose of the Protected Disclosures Act, as it says in its Long Title, is to protect persons making "certain disclosures in the public interest".  Similarly, the directive states its purpose is to provide for:  "... the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law ... [...] ... that are harmful to the public interest ...".  While neither piece of legislation has a formal public interest test it is clear matters such as private interest, such as personal grievances, lie outside the scope of this legislation in general.  That is not to say personal grievances are not important but we must recognise such matters are to a large extent already protected by the very significant corpus of employment law, much of which existed for many decades before the Protected Disclosures Act.</p> <p>  It was never the intention of the Protected Disclosures Act that it should become an alternative avenue for the airing of personal grievances but in practice we have seen there have been some problems in this area.  There is a small but not insignificant number of cases that appear before the WRC that have tried to introduce protected disclosures into matters that are solely personal grievances.  Similarly, a small but not insignificant number of employers have raised concerns with us that some personal grievances that have already concluded formal internal grievance processes have been raised again by employees as protected disclosures.  In all these cases this has led to a certain amount of wasted time and effort on matters that should be outside of this legislation so we feel the legislation needs to make more clear this distinction between personal grievances and other forms of wrongdoing.  We noted a number of the other witnesses who appeared before the committee in earlier hearings have welcomed efforts in this area, although they did have a couple of notes of caution about it.  In that regard, we recognise there are situations where the line between a protected disclosure and a personal grievance can be blurred.  The wording of this provision is really important so it is not interpreted too widely.  In this regard, the wording we currently have is that matters "... concerning interpersonal grievances exclusively affecting the reporting person ..." will not be considered protected disclosures.  That would mean an isolated incident of bullying, perhaps, between a manager and an employee would be a private interest and would not be a protected disclosure.  It would be dealt with under employment law or under whatever internal grievance process exists within the organisation.  However, where there is a situation where there is a report or a series of reports that suggest a wider culture of workplace bullying, those certainly would be protected disclosures.</p> <p>  We recognise getting the wording of this right is going to be very important so we are open to suggestions from the committee and anybody else about wording that will ensure the correct application of this provision in practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#E00600"><p>I understand what Mr. Keane is saying and what he means in that sense.  However, what of the opposite situation, which he touched on at the end?  The whole concern about this is if somebody is whistleblowing or making a protected disclosure, that it could be dismissed as an interpersonal grievance when it is not one, if he knows what I mean.  I take his point that the Department is open to wording suggestions, etc., and I will follow up with the officials on that.  It will probably be after the budget, to be perfectly honest, but I will follow up on that.</p> <p>  My last question goes back to the impact this has.  These are very brave people and it takes a huge amount of courage and many other things to go forward and make a protected disclosure because it can and often does have a big impact on the person, his or her family and so on.  Do the officials think free access to psychological services would be worth having?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#E00700"><p>Absolutely.  Going back to the Chairman's initial question to us about the earlier contributions and the committee's earlier sessions, we were very taken with that issue and that dimension to this also, and we have been giving it some thought.  It may be of interest to be aware that Transparency International Ireland is planning a pilot service around this and we will be looking with great interest at that in terms of it maybe helping to inform us as to how we might plan some future initiatives in this area.</p> <p>  There are a couple of dimensions to this we must be a little bit careful about.  One is about ensuring the provision of services in and of itself, or an individual being seen to be availing of them, does not give rise to unintended consequences for that individual or cause him or her to be seen in a particular way that might be adverse to him or her.  I was quite struck by some of the contributions in the earlier sessions where witnesses talked about the personal impact on individuals when what they have done comes to light and what they have tried to bring to light.  We want to ensure whatever might be contemplated in this area does not somehow rebound on them in a bad way, even though our motives might be the right ones, if the Deputy understands me.  We are thinking about this and again, we are are very open to thoughts or suggestions around it.  Clearly one can see, as highlighted in the committee's earlier sessions, the issue that does need to be addressed.</p></speech>

To what extent is our legislation compatible with that in other European countries?  Is our legislation as effective as that of those other countries?  Those are my first questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Keane might take this question.</p></speech>

As Mr. Menton said in his opening statement, Ireland is considered to be one of the leading countries in this area.  Most recently the International Bar Association rated us joint second in the world for our whistleblower legislation, so it is often the case that other countries to us.</p> <p>  However, we do keep an eye on developments in other countries in the years since the protected disclosures legislation was passed.  We look at European countries in particular and especially the Netherlands because it has taken the approach of establishing a dedicated whistleblowing agency so we certainly wanted to examine how that would work.  We also looked at Latvia, which is kind of similar in the way it is set up, especially in the way it organises its competent authorities, or prescribed persons as we have here.  We have also looked at other countries, particularly around how they organise what matters are within the role of the ombudsman unit, which is obviously one of things that influenced our decision to establish a protected disclosures office.</p><p>There are other countries we have looked at.  If there is a particular point on which the Deputy would like me to go into in more detail, I will try my best to answer.</p></speech>

How do we compare with other countries, for instance, on being elected to something that falls under that category?  How effective is it in other countries and how does that compare with Ireland?  We seem to have ongoing situations that would merit more dramatic action than has occurred.  We then end up with investigations, inquiries and so on.  The legislation is there and it should be possible for us to be as good as anybody else in dealing with the issues and in processing them quickly and satisfactorily, and also in determining what is frivolous or interpersonal and what is not, so that the process can go on and not be used or abused.  How does the Department feel about that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara Morgan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#F00300"><p>I take the Deputy's point.  As Mr. Menton said in his opening statement, we have good strong legislation and it is well recognised internationally, but it is far from perfect and there are issues that need to be addressed.  When one considers the numbers of disclosures, and when considering the information we have in our own country and in other countries, due to the nature of protected disclosures it can be difficult to get data on reports being made and what is happening with reports because there are very understandable requirements for the high level of confidentiality around them.</p> <p>  With regard to the EU directive on whistleblowing and how we will transpose it in this Bill, the good thing is that we will have much better data and more stringent reporting requirements and it will allow us to benchmark ourselves against other EU member states.  We will be required to report annually to the Commission on progress under the directive.  This will shine more of a light and, given the way that the directive is being set up, it will do so in a safe way that will also protect confidentiality for people making reports.</p></speech>

At the same time, how do we know that we are not harbouring frivolous, personal reports that are not relevant at all?  For example, we have all heard of particular attitudes being adopted by people between themselves and their peers and <i>vice versa</i>- this happens particularly in academia for example - and sometimes with great damage to the person concerned.  There would appear to be a certain amount of lethargy in responding, which I would not see as protecting the interests of the vulnerable people who are under attack.  How do the witnesses feel about that?  Do they feel that the proposals, when completed in the revised legislation, will be sufficient to deal with that in a meaningful way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.177" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara Morgan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#F00500"><p>There are two elements I would like to raise in relation to this.  The first is the question of lethargy.  Maybe in some instances this is possible but I believe there is also an element of paralysis due to some issues with the existing legislation that we have been made aware of, and especially around the confidentiality provisions.  They are very strong provisions and they should be very strong.  It is very important that they are.  This, however, can be the situation when a report comes in: people almost become paralysed in that they are afraid to move on it.  They are afraid that if they transmit this to another person who can take action on it, it might expose the identity of the person making the report.  This is one element that we have been looking at very closely to see how we can help to support bodies when they get those reports, and to make the appropriate reports.</p> <p>  I now turn to the second elements of the Deputy's question around progress not being made, how we can ensure that reports are being addressed and dealt with seriously, and how we make sure that we are not accepting frivolous reports.  Provisions are made in the Bill for very strengthened procedures that will really help with this around what one needs to do and the consistency in how one deals with the reports.  Timelines have been very clearly set out whereby one must acknowledge a report within seven days, feedback must be given within three to six months, and be followed on by the report.  To support public bodies in that regard, the Department will be doing a new training framework so the protected disclosure managers are in a better position to do the job that they need to do, and to try to push more of that cultural shift as well.  Not forgetting about the private sector, we will be doing guidance to support them also in the establishment of their own channels.</p></speech>

We have a comprehensive network of prescribed persons.  If a person is not confident that his or her report is being dealt with, then he or she can take that to the outside body which is independent, which can look at it, and which has that mandate to look at it.  I believe this hopes to address that issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#F00900"><p>I will pick up on a few areas, one of which has been mentioned already.  I hear that the witnesses have heard there are concerns around the personal grievance space and interpersonal piece.  The concern is not just that somebody can still make a protected disclosure, but it is around how it might be interpreted.  It might be useful to have a clarification on this.  For example, somebody may have an interpersonal grievance, which may indeed be valid, and the person may be pursuing one channel on this, but that does not preclude the person from also making a protected disclosure in relation to a systemic issue or other wider issue.  It might be useful for this to be clear in the legislation.  Very often, people are used to a hierarchy of reporting or the hierarchy of engagement, whereby the issue is already being dealt with through one route, the person has chosen path A and, therefore, cannot choose path B.  It needs to be very clear to people that the other routes are open to them, including making a report to prescribed persons.  We cannot rely on those who become whistleblowers to know this.  They are not necessarily starting out as legal experts and it is a very frightening thing for somebody to make that decision.  They need to be confident in it, and such clarity would signal that.</p> <p>  As highlighted by some of the witnesses and identified here, there were issues in the past around the complaint or concern going back to those who were being complained about or being whistleblown about.  I understand there are some are some attempts to address this in the legislation but there is still a bit of vulnerability there in assessing the space around the validity of this as a protected disclosure.</p> <p>  I have another concern about accountability.  It is about the balance whereby we want to ensure that we can protect people, but we also want to make sure that we do not simply have this sitting in a separate space, and that there is a level of accountability, consequence and change within the organisation, the public body or the entity about whom the whistle is being blown.  This is particularly concerning with regard to the ministerial part.  There have been past concerns about ambiguity.  For example, if a person makes a protected disclosure to the Minister for Transport - to take one example, which is not the example I am thinking of - is the disclosure to the individual as a prescribed person or is it to the role of the Minister?  There has been an ambiguity around this in the past.  I am interested that this is phrased in the Bill as support to the Minister.  How do we ensure that such support does not end up effectively diminishing the political accountability piece of this or that Ministers end up getting cut out of the picture?</p><p>In the past, many issues and wrongdoings were framed as administrative errors or matters but there is a danger of the issue moving far away from persons who can be held accountable and being seen as separate to them.  That is also true of people who can execute cultural change.<br/><br/>I am also concerned about a more ambitious role for the office around protected disclosures.  It is very much framed as the data comes in and it is there to deal with individual wrongdoings but I am thinking of identifying patterns.  I am thinking of one submission, from <i>Raiseaconcern.com</i>.  One question that needs to be asked is why these issues were not identified previously.  If a similar type of financial abuse or other abuse occurred in three or four public bodies, they would be placed alongside each other.  One of the big failures of the previous legislation was reporting.  How can there be more robust reporting and how can the office playing a role in identifying the patterns from reporting?  It would be a case whereby the data would not be stored in an inappropriate way but that it would, at least, contribute to identifying patterns of bad practice or poor practice.  <br/><br/>I am using the word &quot;retrospective&quot; but I do not believe that it is retrospective; it is more accurately ongoing, that is, continuing cases.  There have been cases where people have made a protected disclosure, which may well predate this legislation, and a resolution has still not happened.  They may not have received communication on what the consequences of those actions were and, in most cases, they have not been able to access the compensation payment, sometimes because the paperwork for that compensation payment is going through the body that they are whistleblowing about or it gets tied up there.  For cases where the disclosure may be in the past but other parts of the process remain unresolved, will the whistleblowers be able to access the rights in terms of communication and compensation that are provided by this legislation?They should to build confidence in whistleblowing.  <br/><br/>On communication, I recognise there is the feedback after six months and then there is the final outcome, but there can be five years between those sometimes.  I believe this should be strengthened so that a person who has made a disclosure, who may be working in fear or concern, not knowing what those on whom they have blown the whistle know about them, may be able to get feedback or an update on where the process is at, so that there is an in-between right to communication and information. </p></speech>

I agree on interpersonal grievances.  It is important, as earlier contributions highlighted.  The objective in the Bill is to try to be as clear as possible on that and what is intended to happen in specific instances.  The definition and language around that will be key.  As my colleague mentioned, we are open to suggestions and contributions from the committee on that.</p> <p>  The ministerial channel is a key issue and it was in our considerations.  I mentioned earlier that one issue that has beset the current arrangements is the confusion and multiplicity of potential channels operating side by side.  What we would like to do with the legislation that we are trying to develop here is to be clear as to what the processes are for individual reporters in given instances.  We are in no way trying to remove the Minister from that process but rather be clear that when a Minister receives something, there is an immediate pathway to moving it on and progressing it and that there is a centre of expertise and best practice to which that matter will be sent swiftly for urgent action and response.  That is where building in the protected disclosure commissioner and that office into this architecture is key to fixing elements of the current arrangements that probably have not operated to their potential or to extent that we would have liked.</p> <p>  I could not agree more on timing.  I am reminded of the earlier sessions the committee had and the contributions at those on the passage of time in some of those specific cases and the toll it takes on individuals.  We are clear that this legislation needs to have a firm set of timelines to minimise the burden and toll that such a process can hold for individuals.  The timeframe set out in the legislation will hopefully provide some comfort and reassurance around that.</p> <p>  My colleagues might answer on interim feedback.  It is something that could be looked at.  I will allow them to comment on, not retrospection, but the existing stock of cases and where they might sit in a revised legislative environment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#G00400"><p>The point on interim feedback is good.  The Senator is correct.  There will be situations where investigations of some complexity will last for a long time.  It would be essential that people would receive more than just one feedback conversation beyond what is specified in the Act itself.  We think that is something that would have to be dealt with more through the statutory guidance than through the law.  One reason is the conditions that apply for making a public disclosure.  The person has to have a reasonable belief, having had their initial feedback conversation after the three months, that nothing is being done about the report that has been made.  If there is a provision in law whereby feedback conversation after feedback conversation can be rolled on, that makes it easier for the employer or person to string out the process and prevent the person from making a public disclosure.  We feel that putting it into the Bill itself could be legally tricky for that reason and maybe contrary to what is required by the directive.  It is something that could be elaborated on in guidance because we do agree with the principle.  It is possible that after three months, one might have only started on the process on something incredibly complicated that requires multiple witnesses to be interviewed and thousands or millions of documents to be examined.  Clearly there has to be a situation where the person is kept involved and informed along the way but it is in guidance rather than the law where that has to be provided for.</p> <p>  I agree with the point the Senator made on interpersonal grievances.  It is common with most protected disclosures that a person does not simply report one thing.  They report maybe five or six different things and they are often a mixture of personal grievances and protected disclosures.  It is incumbent on the recipients who basically go through these and break them down into individual sub-reports and say of the six things reported that they would consider two to be personal grievances, which can be dealt with through our grievance procedure.  The remaining four are purely protected disclosures and they would deal with them and those wrongdoings using the protected disclosures procedure.  Again, it is something that can be elaborated on in the guidance rather than in legislation for the purpose of allowing for the right level of flexibility for people to operate and implement the legislation.  We could also look at the wording of the definition of "follow-up" and what is meant in terms of what needs to be done in the initial assessment process when the disclosure is made.  There are options that we can look at. </p> <p>  Does Ms Morgan want to come in on anything here?</p></speech>

We have ongoing engagement with the Office of the Ombudsman around the establishment of that office and it has been extremely helpful, given its broad experience in regard to complaints in general, in speccing out what that office could look at and how it could act.  We had not actually envisaged the idea of the data role sitting with that office, and that is something we had intended to hold within the Department from a policy perspective to be able to do that analysis, look at trends and so on.  I see the point about being able to leverage that expertise in the Office of the Ombudsman as the new protected disclosures commissioner office builds its expertise and best practice.  It is something we might keep an eye on and keep under review as we see how those things roll out and as they get established.  We certainly want to be sure that we are able to look at the landscape and the impacts of the legislation, and ensure it is operating as intended.  In that regard, the commission intends to review the impact of the whistleblowing directive a number of years afterwards, and that will probably trigger our own review at that stage.</p></speech>

Part of that additional function of analysis could also be a role in promoting the contribution that has been made by whistleblowers because we do have that messaging and cultural shift.  Again, I do not need detail.  It is not just around the receiver.  When I am talking about the interpersonal, I am talking about the signal to the potential whistleblower.  I am a co-sponsor of legislation against the misuse of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, with my colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane.  If somebody has previously signed a non-disclosure agreement or if they have signed a specific confidentiality clause in regard to trade secrets or being on a board, it would be very useful for them to have a signal that that does not preclude them.  While I know it does not preclude them, people might need to hear that it does not preclude them, because people are careful and they do not want to find themselves in a situation of wrongdoing.  I am conscious I do not want to use up too much more time.  Perhaps Ms Morgan could comment on the key issue of the ongoing cases regarding communication and compensation.</p></speech>

This is one where we probably intended to address this in the statutory guidance and, again, to set out what best practice should look like.  We will be clearly signalling that if someone has an ongoing case, and maybe they have not given feedback and maybe it has been some time since they gave feedback, they would take that opportunity to have that feedback conversation, to take the spirit of the legislation, if not necessarily the letter of the legislation.</p> <p>  The question the Senator is raising around compensation in regard to ongoing cases and the new compensation measures is a trickier one.  We might have to take that away and have a look at it, if that is okay.</p></speech>

In regard to the draft Bill and the European directive, can Mr. Menton point us to the sections of the Bill and the proposed changes where the experiences and issues raised by whistleblowers have been addressed in a way that might prevent the difficulties faced by whistleblowers happening again?  Whistleblowers complain, for example, that the issues have not been dealt with or addressed.  How is that dealt with in the Bill?  How is the fact that whistleblowers&rsquo; experiences to date have been such that it is the whistleblower who is the victim in all of these cases and it is the whistleblower who pays the price?  How is that addressed?</p> <p>  One whistleblower in the Prison Service, who was mentioned to us, received an award but that has not been paid to him yet.  How do we force agencies of the State or Departments to honour a decision made in the case of whistleblowers, such as Noel McGree, who was here publicly, so I can mention his name?  How does the legislation address, for example, the whistleblower from CIT, where the new president of the Munster university refused to meet to try to resolve those issues in terms of mediation?</p> <p>  In the context of the legal process itself, all whistleblowers are encouraged to go through mediation, which can often break down and can be stalled.  That can prevent a further court case and it means the conclusion to the particular whistleblower&rsquo;s case is prolonged.  Overall, the experience seems to have been that the legislation was never tested in court, particularly on the public side.  Only one private case was brought and that was settled with a confidentiality clause.  In the context of confidentiality clauses being applied, we found out at our last meeting that there is no information around that.  Surely the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must know the number of cases that were taken against Departments that were resolved on the steps of the court.  If it asked each Secretary General, they could tell the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that they had a case.  They need not divulge any names or settlements, but they could say they had a case and they settled it on the steps of the court.  Surely, where whistleblowers&rsquo; cases are pending, all of those whistleblowers and the taxpayer are entitled to know what the Government agencies and the Departments are doing with their money.</p> <p>  In regard to the legacy issues that were brought before Departments and agencies under the current piece of legislation, what is to happen to the ones that are in a cul-de-sac, the ones that are forced to chase Departments, the ones that are treated badly by Departments and agencies?  What is to happen to those in the context of this legislation?  Will they be covered by any new sections that will give them a break?  Frankly, and I have said this time and again, I think the State has blackguarded whistleblowers in this country and it is shocking to watch the result of that blackguarding on the individual and their families, and there is also the disrespect and cynicism it creates in terms of the political and bureaucratic system in the State.  I ask Mr. Menton to comment on those few points.</p></speech>

In terms of the Bill itself and looking to the future, we would point to the timelines, to the revised redress provisions within it and to the strengthened penalisation clauses.  I will ask Mr. Keane to articulate a couple of points on that in terms of providing the committee with reassurance around some of the issues the Chairman has pointed to in terms of how the current legislative framework will be changed by what is proposed in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021100600002#H00700"><p>In terms of some of the main changes being put through under the heads of the Bill, one of them is the extension of the personal scope, whereby we are building beyond ordinary employees into other categories of people who also have a working relationship with an organisation, including volunteers, board members and trainees, for example.</p> <p>  In regard to the operation of the legislation itself, obviously, a clear change is the requirement on the private sector to have formal, published channels and procedures setting out how people can make reports and setting out what other channels of reporting are available to them if they are dissatisfied with how the internal process has gone.  Of course, as was said in earlier responses, those procedures will at a minimum require acknowledgement of the protected disclosure, diligent follow-up of the protected disclosure and that feedback be given to the person.</p><p>There is certainly a lot of reassurance there because one of the common complaints we get from whistleblowers is that they make their report and it disappears into a black hole.  This cannot happen.</p><p> The other factor, which is something we already have in legislation but which is worth reflecting on, because it is in the directive as well, is the stepped disclosure regime.  In other words, if you start out at one level, such as a report to your employer, and if he or she fails to co-operate, you have the option of then going to a prescribed person who is subject to the same requirements that I just set out as regards acknowledgement, follow-up and feedback.  If that fails, then there is the more significant option of going public and seeing how that works.  There are plenty of options if a failure in the process along the way occurs.  You would hope that in most cases everything would be dealt with at the first stage but the legislation anticipates what might happen when things go wrong and what the options are for people around that.</p><p> It is also worth reflecting on the fact that we are extending the interim relief provisions.  Currently, you have an entitlement to interim relief in the event of an unfair dismissal, but now it will apply to other forms of penalisation as well.  That is a significant strengthening because it means that when penalisation comes, you can go straight to a court and seek an injunction and you do not have to wait for the WRC or for the court to give you a hearing, which can be a lengthy process at times.  That is an important one.</p><p> Another one relates to the reversal of the burden of proof.  It is going to fall to the employer to prove that the person suffered a penalisation, and not because he or she made a protected disclosure.  It no longer means the employee has to prove that connection, and that is going to be a big factor in terms of cases, because that is often a determining factor in the way the WRC deals with those cases.</p><p> I would like to deal with another issue as we are talking about the WRC and the question of enforcement of awards made by it or by the Labour Court.  We obviously cannot talk about the specific case with regard to what appeared a fortnight ago but we should say that under current legislation, if an employer fails to carry out a decision of the WRC or the Labour Court, the worker affected or his or her trade union, if he or she is in one, can apply to the District Court for an order directing the employer or the respondent to comply with that decision.  This can be done 56 days after the WRC makes an adjudication, or 42 days after the Labour Court makes an adjudication.  In addition, a worker or his or her trade union can apply to the WRC for assistance in enforcement of decisions to the District Court.  If it accepts such a request, the WRC will make the application to the court on behalf of the complainant and will bear the legal costs involved, so if a person is in a position where he or she cannot hire a solicitor to enforce the WRC's decision, the WRC will actually act on his or her behalf.</p></speech>

I would say that the legislation on its own is never going to be enough, but it is the structure and the robust framework that we can put in place.  On the question on bodies acting in good faith, previous witnesses referred to culture and it resonated with me.  How do you support a cultural shift to recognise the value and the bravery of people who are reporting wrongdoing, often at significant cost to themselves?  This is an area where we want to do more.  We have plans to enact the legislation, but that is not enough.  To transpose the directive, implementation measures are required.  We have mentioned that we are going to be doing more comprehensive guidance to support public bodies in the first instance, and awareness-raising measures with business.  We have a good relationship with Transparency International Ireland and we keep in touch with and take input from it in regard to what might be needed.  It is about pushing that culture and tying into those wider reform measures in our Department on the public service reform side and the Civil Service renewal side to see how many angles can we come at this from.  It is very much a work in progress, and it is not the full answer, but it is something that we have to keep working on.</p></speech>

We do not want what we so often had in Ireland where civil society organisations end up setting the good practice and doing the work.  It is important that there would be funding strands to allow people act independently, and in some cases maybe for Transparency International Ireland.  We know that sometimes whistleblowers will work together.  Especially in the case of a large organisation, you may get a group.</p> <p>  There was a question of there being some difficulty, leaving aside the compensation case which really is that question the Chair put very strongly around the absolute failure to deliver compensation.  This is literally a very bare and nominal compensation for the harm suffered by whistleblowers.  It is also a question of supports for whistleblowers, including counselling supports and access to other supports.  There was a conversation, which I am sure the witnesses followed, in our other sessions around the difficulties even getting interim support, which is something people have sometimes had to access to and again that has been inadequate.  I want to press that I think that is one thing that will need to be stronger and we will need to come back to it, especially in regard to the ongoing case on that, and that question of resourcing for civil society.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses come back in around the non-disclosure agreement, NDA, and the confidentiality piece?  That was the question of the signal that making a protected disclosure is not constrained.  This actually related to another key issue that the Bar Council highlighted around the concern that people would not think that this applied to them.  I refer to the definition of the reporting person being a worker.  There has been a signal that there is a plan to interpret it in a certain way but one of the cohorts was board members, volunteers or applicants to an organisation, a school parents' association member or whoever it might be.  There was concern here, and the witnesses might comment on how they plan to address that definition of "worker" as the reporting person and the need to maybe expand that definition.  Linked to that was my point around the NDA piece or the confidentiality clause for a board member and so forth, and that people be very clearly assured in the law that they are in the right line on that.</p> <p>  The specific focus on the areas of discretion under the EU directive was mentioned.  I will not ask the witnesses to go through all of them but they could highlight some of the decisions made in respect of discretionary aspects of the EU directive, and maybe outline why they were made.  That would help us to understand the choices, and it seems they had their own internal process in regard to the discretionary components.</p></speech>

I might cover funding civil society and the definition of "worker", I will try to say a bit on NDA and confidentialities and then pass over to my colleague, Mr. Keane, who might pick up anything I missed on NDA and confidentialities and cover those discretionary aspects.</p> <p>  To speak to the funding civil society, our Department probably has a bad reputation in relation to that but this is something we are cognisant of.  At the moment, there is an Exchequer grant given through our own Department's Vote under transparency and that is directly to support the Speak Up helpline and the legal advice centre.  There is an ongoing conversation with them in regard to that grant and the amount of that for next year.  That will be discussed as part of the budgetary process.</p> <p>  On the definition of "worker", which the Senator rightly pointed out, it is a very much expanded definition of "worker", away from what would be the traditional employment law understanding of a worker, and that presents challenges.  We have been engaging with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel as to how best to manage that in the legislation.</p> <p>  There are three pieces.  The first piece is for very clear definitions in the legislation.  We will be working with the drafters as to how to achieve that.  The second piece relates to how one puts that into plain English in the statutory guidance and makes it as accessible as possible.</p><p>The third element is awareness-raising measures.  We do not have those planned out in detail yet, but they are an important piece of the puzzle to which we will need to turn our minds.  This feeds into the question that the Senator and the Chairman raised about people being aware of their rights and employers being aware of their obligations.</p><p> Regarding NDAs and confidentiality, it comes back to awareness raising and clarity.  Mr. Keane might add further on that and on the discretionary aspects.</p></speech>

Section 14 provides immunity from civil liability for making a protected disclosure.  It is stronger than what is in the directive, under which there is not an absolute immunity from civil liability.  Rather, someone can merely offer the fact that he or she has made a permissible complaint as a defence in a court case.  The only exception we have relates to the Defamation Act, which I understand has to do with the constitutional right to a person's good name.  We also have protections to the effect that, where someone has made a protected disclosure, it does not constitute a criminal offence.  If I were to make a protected disclosure, I would not breach any of the legal obligations that I am subject to as a civil servant under the Official Secrets Act, for example.<br/><br/>We have strong protections in terms of NDAs.  They are in section 23 of the Protected Disclosures Act, under which it is clear that:</p> <blockquote> 	Any provision in an agreement is void in so far as it purports&mdash;  	(a) to prohibit or restrict the making of protected disclosures,<br /><br />(b) to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of this Act,<br /><br />(c) to preclude a person from bringing any proceedings under or by virtue of this Act, or<br /><br />(d) to preclude a person from bringing proceedings for breach of contract in respect of anything done in consequence of the making of a protected disclosure.  </blockquote> <p>This section effectively voids any NDA that a person is told to sign.  As such, this matter is covered.  Indeed, our provisions are stronger in some areas than what is required under the directive.<br/><br/>Regarding discretionary areas, I can go through a few points.  Along with the other documentation, we submitted to the committee a preliminary draft regulatory impact assessment.  It set out some of our thinking in this regard and probably contains a great deal more detail, if the Senator wishes to examine it.  However, I will go through a couple of aspects.<br/><br/>One of the areas where there is a certain amount of discretion is that of anonymous reporting, which is one of the more difficult areas we have had to handle.  It is probably fair to say that we got a great deal of feedback on this during the public consultation.  It was finely balanced between people who thought it was a great idea and people who thought it was not such a great idea.  It is difficult to judge which side of the fence to fall on.  In the end, we felt that one of the major challenges in handling an anonymous disclosure is that it can cause administrative difficulties.  For example, it is necessary under the directive that reports be made by a person who has a workplace relationship with the organisation.  If someone makes a disclosure anonymously, that relationship cannot be verified.  Therefore, it becomes a question of whether the rules on how reports must be treated in terms of acknowledgement, follow-up and feedback apply.  On the other hand, modern technology has made two-way communication with an anonymous person easier than in the past when a letter might have arrived in the post with no signature on it and there was no way of following up on it.  However, not knowing the identity of the reporting person can make it much more difficult to follow up on a matter, especially if there is no means of making further contact to, for example, get clarification or more information.<br/><br/>Another point is that a person might believe that he or she is safer when making an anonymous report, but protecting someone from harm can sometimes be difficult, for example, if the incidents described are specific enough that the accused person figures out who reported him or her and subjects that person to harassment.  The informer might not be aware of this and the situation could be made much worse.  There is also a small risk that allowing anonymous reporting can enable employees to harass colleagues by submitting untrue or defamatory reports.  Without knowing the identity of the person making the report, it is difficult to punish false reporting.<br/><br/>There are also a number of legal issues because Irish legislation in some places specifically prohibits some organisations from following up on anonymous disclosures.  This is mainly due to the fact that disclosures may be related to judicial matters, which require providing the right to a fair hearing where the identity of the discloser must be known.  Examples of that are the regulations we made under the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  The flip side to this is that there are also some laws that specifically permit anonymous disclosures, particularly in respect of financial services money laundering.<br/><br/>We acknowledge that a number of organisations find accepting anonymous reports to be beneficial.  Notwithstanding that, we have come to the view that a blanket requirement to follow up on all anonymous disclosures would be problematic for many organisations.  It appears to us that the best way to approach this is for anonymous disclosures to be taken on a case-by-case basis.  We are providing that it be at the discretion of each organisation to set a policy on anonymous reporting.  That is the route we will take with the Bill.<br/><br/>I will be brief in responding to some of the other questions that were asked.  We have been asked about the establishment of internal reporting channels and whether they should apply to some entities with fewer than 50 employees.  There are already certain exemptions in the directive around financial services, oil and gas safety, and aviation and other areas of transport safety.  We are of the view that this could be explored on a sector-by-sector basis.  We are providing in the Bill that the Minister can, subject to a risk assessment, make an order classifying a certain sector of the economy as having a lower threshold for having formal internal channels and procedures.  At the previous meeting, a couple of suggestions were made about accountancy bodies and some digital companies.  There could be merit in that and it is something that we could consider, but we believe that a blanket approach would be disproportionate.  It would probably represent a significant compliance burden for small organisations and would not suit small builders, for example, a builder and two mates in a van, the local sweet shop, etc.  A blanket obligation is probably not workable in that regard.</p></speech>

The problem with the sector-by-sector approach is that sectors may be able to say that they are being targeted disproportionately.  There could be a provision relating to the volume of income.  Digital and financial services companies were mentioned.  They could have ten or 20 employees but turnovers of &euro;200 million or &euro;400 million.  Perhaps a level of-----</p></speech>

That is just a thought.</p> <p>  Regarding the phrase "workplace relationship" in the directive, perhaps that language more than the term "worker" would encompass some of the concerns we have raised about how people see themselves under the Bill.  "Workplace relationship" is certainly more understandable.</p></speech>

Our solution to how a competent authority is designated is the protected disclosures office, given that we recognise that there are a few shortcomings in the way the prescribed person system operates.  We have more than 100 prescribed persons, so it can sometimes be confusing for workers to figure out to whom they are supposed to report.  This would also clear up a number of the gaps in the provision.  The protected disclosures office proposal deals with many of those issues.  As I said in reply to Deputy Durkan, this is an area where we examined what other countries did.</p> <p>  Regarding the discretion for prescribed persons to close reports that were minor or repetitive, we had almost universal agreement on that being included.</p><p>We have provided for that.  The question of measures for support is another.  We had a discussion on VAT already.  We are considering those ourselves.</p><p> The final matter was about penalties.  We have been considering that.  It is all based on discussions that we have had with the Attorney General about whether there will be criminal penalties in that case.  We explored administrative penalties but the Attorney General is of the view that it would be problematic for this type of legislation.  Those are the areas under that which I think we can cover.</p></speech>

We should have direct authority in the context of general information, to find out, for example, how many protected disclosures arose in Government Departments and agencies in the course of each of the last five years, and how many of those cases were settled without going to court.  Is that possible?</p></speech>

There are annual reporting requirements for public sector bodies with regard to protected disclosures, which we get our data from.  We know that in the public sector, just over 1,800 disclosures were made over the past three years, with 796 in 2018, 615 in 2019, and 415 in 2020, which is a drop we think could be as a result of the pandemic.  There is a gap in information about cases which are before the WRC.  We get those data from the WRC itself.  We know that 360 cases came before the WRC since the legislation came into effect, 38 came before the Labour Court and five came before the High Court.  We think the breakdown of cases is about 50:50 between private and public sector.  We know that 27% of complaints were settled but we do not know what the breakdown of that is.  I think that is a fair, accurate representation of our figures.  There are gaps in that.  The new reporting requirements arising from the new legislation will be helpful to try to plug some of those gaps.</p></speech>

The Department deals with legislation, the law, how it should be framed, the context of the wording and so on.  I deal with practicalities for whistleblowers and their experiences.  In most cases, whistleblowers will say that if they had known this was going to happen to them, they would never have informed their boss or made a protected disclosure.  That in itself is shocking and needs to be corrected.  I will ask some questions and leave them with the witnesses.  These are names that are known publicly because they have been before the committee.</p> <p>  Mr. Keane answered about Noel McGree.  He said that the award was made.  It was never paid.  Reports that are outstanding in his case have never been concluded.  Only some were given to him before he last appeared before the committee.  There has been dragging of heels, at least, with regard to his case.  He told us that he lost his house and everything.  He blew the whistle and made a significant contribution in what he did and said.  The witnesses will understand why people would want to be able to make an anonymous protected disclosure.  A balance has to be struck between those that are nuisance, mischievous and all of that, and the ones that stand out.  I would like to see, where awards are made, that they are actually forced to honour those awards without the whistleblower having to pursue the matter further.  This comes after years and years of fighting with whatever organisation might be involved.  Noel McGree is out of his job.</p> <p>  In the case of the Grace report, the person who came before the Houses of the Oireachtas for assistance is no longer in her job.  Due to a confidentiality clause, we cannot find out any more about it.  The State did that, and did it to Noel McGree too.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to look at what happened to Maurice McCabe and John Wilson.  Within their stories and the experiences that they had are issues that should be corrected with legislation.  The witnesses are best positioned to look at those and devise some way or some wording that would correct the difficulties that they have in the course of bringing their case forward and making it easier for others to address such cases in the future.</p> <p>  Another name in public is Seanie O'Brien.  He made his protected disclosure to the Department of Justice and, more recently, to the Taoiseach's office.  It has never been dealt with.  He has never been communicated properly with about what he has to say.  There has not been closure to it.  I do not want the witnesses to comment on these cases.  I am simply highlighting them to determine if there is some way that they can be dealt with or if what happened can be dealt with in a different way through legislation.  There is a similar issue in the Committee of Public Accounts, where a whistleblower was outed in correspondence from a legal firm to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the law was broken, why could the Houses of the Oireachtas not take them to task about it rather than leaving it to the whistleblower to raise whatever they wished to raise over being outed?  It is something that should not be done under the current legislation, yet it happened.  It happened in the place where the law was made.  I think the place where it happened did not act as it should have acted in the context of the outing of that person.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the John Wilson case.  What happens to these people is a tragedy.</p> <p>  The Women of Honour is another issue in the Army.  Individuals have come to me who have been sexually abused in the Army.  It took years to get that out.  It damaged many lives.  We have to find a way for the State to deal with those issues and make whoever is a line manager, or whoever it is reported to, deal with it.</p><p>This brings me to the point of the protected disclosures office.  It is fine to have proposed legislation, which states that we should have a protected disclosures office and that this is how it should function.  I would like to see examples, however, from other countries of how their protected disclosure offices function.  The details that Mr. Menton could provide to the committee include how many people are employed in those offices, the costs of running such offices and the overall general costs involved.  I ask that because if such an office were to be established by this proposed legislation, then a large number of people will come forward, at least in the beginning until those considering making protected disclosures figure out if the new office is worth its salt.  </p><p> On the private side of things, the cases we have had have included Allied Irish Banks, AIB, and the EBS tied agents.  Those tied agents are just worn out and some of them have died.  Private companies that are large and well capable financially of dealing with issues such as this can easily brush off even an organised group similar to the EBS tied agents or, indeed, individuals such as Tony Lawlor and Jonathan Sugarman, who also appeared before this committee.  It is an issue in respect of the Central Bank of Ireland and what it does following a protected disclosure.  It will say that it has dealt with the protected disclosure, but that it cannot reveal what it has done in that regard because that is a matter between the Central Bank and the regulated bank concerned.  Proposed legislation in this area should allow for the naming of a bank, an individual or whatever it might be to bring a conclusion to an issue.  Legislation regarding the Central Bank is involved in that area, but this proposed legislation should overlap with it.</p><p> Regarding local government and the case of Ms Julie Grace, a report was requested and she went through the various processes.  The case has gone on for years and years.  It is not an individual that is stopping progress being made, it is the State preventing the case from being resolved.  In that instance, as with all the others, Ms Grace has brought something positive and truthful to the attention of the State and yet it is people like this who get penalised.  I cannot figure out why that is.  Culture was mentioned by the witnesses and it takes a while to root out that culture, but if we do not start speaking openly, honestly and directly about those who are a part of that culture, then it will remain in place forever.  That is why I am relying heavily on this proposed legislation to change the course of all that.  I am not asking for answers to all of these.  I am just using those points to explain in layman's terms the experiences of those people who have come to me.  Those experiences have never been good.  They have always been terribly negative, divisive and destructive in respect of families and individuals.  That State does not speak for me.  That is not my State.  </p><p> On the political front, I hope that a whip will not be imposed during the passage of this proposed legislation.  I hope the Members of this D&aacute;il will be allowed to consider all amendments and any proposals from the Minister and the Department regarding this proposed legislation in a way that is constructive and without the divisiveness of a whip.  I will deal with that in the political arena.  I consider this legislation to be important for everyone who needs to come forward in respect of allowing them to obtain the requisite protection to enable them to tell their story.  I am sorry for having gone a bit, but I have just heard too much negativity around this matter.  I want to see this proposed legislation being right.  We are at the end of the meeting and any of the witnesses can comment if they wish.</p></speech>

I will make a few points in that regard.  We agree with him regarding the cultural aspect.  We are mindful that while we can do our level best to design a robust legal framework in this regard, we also have a shared interest in ensuring that this proposed Bill enables the wider environment in this context to work as effectively as possible for those who want to truth tell.  That is important.  I again agree with the Chair on that point.  The proposed legislation should do all that it can to support such an environment and to ensure that it works effectively for people in these situations.  A big cultural dimension is involved and that came through strongly at earlier sessions of this committee.  It is something that we are mindful of and thinking about.  We know we must do things in parallel with this proposed legislation to try to improve the situation in future, given the learning that we have all derived from some of the specific cases highlighted by the Chair.</p> <p>  We will, of course, share with the committee anything we can about other jurisdictions and how they have approached this type of protected disclosure office model.  We have examined several of them, as my colleagues mentioned.  We will be more than happy to share any and all information that we have to inform the thinking of the committee in that regard.  I will leave it there.  I thank the committee.  I thank the Chair for his contributions and thoughts as well.

That commitment is absolute and unwavering.</p> <p>  Universal healthcare has never been achieved in Ireland and we are still far from it today.  Changing that, making universal healthcare a reality, is one of the defining projects of our time.  Our goal is clear.  It is timely and affordable access to consistently high-quality care for everyone.  Sl&aacute;intecare matters because it provides a pathway for this.  Doing it requires very significant funding and we have made a very substantial investment.  Investment of more than &euro;1.2 billion in budget 2021 has allowed us to increase capacity, which is fundamental to improving access to care.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to my officials and those working in the HSE for the significant progress and reform that has been delivered in spite of the pandemic and cyberattack.  I will not be able to list all of those achievements today but the increase across various areas is substantial.</p> <p>  We have delivered record increases in hospital bed capacity.  We have already added around 850 permanent beds to the hospital system this year.  That is the equivalent of about two medium-sized hospitals and more will be added between now and the end of the year.  In fact, we will have added more permanent beds to the system this year than have been added in any single year in decades.</p> <p>  Some &euro;52 million was also provided this year to increase critical care capacity.  We have delivered a record increase in critical care beds.  We had 255 critical care beds at the beginning of last year.  We now have 296 critical care beds and more will be delivered in the coming months.  We plan to have 321 critical care beds in place by the end of this year or very early in 2022.  That represents an increase of 66 beds or 25% in total critical care capacity in just two years.  To put that in perspective, we delivered an average of six critical care beds per year between 2017 and 2019.  We will have gone from an average of six beds a year to 66 beds in just two years.  Our plans are ambitious and I have already brought a plan to Cabinet, which has been agreed by Cabinet, aimed at increasing critical care beds to 446 over time.  Critically, this will exceed the recommendation of the 2018 health service capacity review.</p> <p>  We have 6,000 more staff working in the health service than we did last summer.  That includes almost 1,400 more nurses and midwives, and 1,200 health and social care professionals.</p> <p>  I am bringing proposals to Cabinet in respect of three elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway.  Very significant work has been done on this by the Sl&aacute;intecare office.</p> <p>  I would like to talk about new patient pathways and care closer to the home.  Various initiatives and reforms are ensuring that people receive care closer to their home.  Some &euro;25 million was allocated to the GP access to diagnostics initiative this year.  It enables GPs to refer patients directly to access diagnostics, including X-rays, MRIs, computed tomography, CT, scans and many more.  These are in a community-based setting.  I am delighted to be able to share with the committee that we estimate that through this new initiative, which was a core recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare, we estimate that about 140,000 additional scans will be carried out by the end of this year.  That is very positive.</p> <p>  There has been a dramatic reduction in waiting lists for funding approvals for home care.  Thanks to a large increase in funding there are no waiting lists at all for home care packages in some areas thus ensuring that we deliver on our objective to keep people well at home and out of hospital.</p><p>I am excited by what we are seeing in respect of the redesign of care pathways and the incredible impact that skilled advanced nurse practitioners are having.  Many patients who would otherwise have had to wait for traditional hospital appointments or to attend emergency departments can be treated in the community using these new pathways to care.  I will give an example. A pilot service to manage people living with heart failure, provided by specialist nurses in County Donegal, saw waiting times for new patient referrals drop from 18 months to between two and six weeks.  The current target, which is to have 2% of the nursing and midwifery workforce, approximately 800 people, working as advanced nurse practitioners or advanced midwifery practitioners, will be reached. I want that to be scaled up and have asked my Department to revert with a plan to that effect.  This area has great untapped potential for our healthcare system.  It fundamentally redesigns the model of care, bringing specialist care much closer to the patient and keeping it out of the hospital, wherever possible.</p><p> One aspect of universal healthcare that gets less attention than access is quality.  There is, understandably, a great deal of focus on access in our country because of the completely unacceptable waiting lists.  We will come to that but one of the core components of universal healthcare is a consistently high quality of care.  The reality in Ireland is that it can be hard to access parts of the public health system but, when one does, the quality of that care is often excellent.  That may not be the case in some cases.  There are also parts of the system where the care is good but needs to get better.  If we are serious about universal healthcare, we have to be serious about a consistently high quality of care.  One of the main routes to this is via our clinical strategies in maternity care, cancer care, trauma, mental health and many more.  This year, I allocated funding to ensure these strategies were, for the first time, fully funded.  I am delighted to be able to share with the committee that a lot of progress is being made on behalf of patients.  I encourage the committee to consider allocating some of its time to invite the clinical leads in these areas in to discuss this progress with them.  We have had some productive debates in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on issue such as maternity care and cancer care.  Serious improvements and progress are being made now that the strategies are being funded.  It would be great to be able to hear from the clinical leads on that.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, the Government approved the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and action plan for the period from 2021 to 2023.  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office prepared a report on progress in the first six months of the strategy.  That progress report indicated that, of the 112 deliverables, 109 were on track or on track with minor issues.  That means that, even while dealing with the worst public health crisis in 100 years, more than 97% of the Sl&aacute;intecare projects have been progressing well.  The report identified three of the 112 projects, specifically the waiting list, ehealth and regional health areas projects, as facing a significant challenge.  Action on these has undoubtedly been severely hampered by the pandemic and the cyberattack, as was clearly stated in the report produced by the Sl&aacute;intecare office. </p><p> Tackling waiting lists is my number one priority.  They were terrible before Covid and have worsened substantially since.  People are living in pain.  The long waits that many of our citizens face to access care are causing immense distress.  I am setting up a task force that will tackle waiting lists and funding it appropriately.  It will follow the vaccine task force model that has worked so well and will learn from it.</p><p> Substantial work has been undertaken over the past several months in progressing regional health areas.  Research into international best practice has been completed.  Policy options have been drafted.  Consultation with stakeholders including patients, clinicians, policymakers, hospital groups and officials in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, has taken place.  More is planned in the coming weeks.  I am establishing an advisory group on this.  We must ensure we arrive at a structure that is owned and respected by those working in our health service. </p><p> Our public health system is not where we need it to be when it comes to ehealth.  Our healthcare workers are often working on old, antiquated systems, but significant progress was made during the pandemic.  A great deal of additional work is required in this area. </p><p> In recent weeks, there has been debate about governance structures for Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are making some changes.  A new programme board co-chaired by my Secretary General and the chief executive of the HSE, and comprising other members of our senior teams, will be established.  This new board will ensure that the drive for universal healthcare is fully embedded in both the Department of Health and the HSE.  The board will report to me and the Cabinet committee on health will meet to discuss progress as appropriate. </p><p> It has been stated as part of the recent debate on Sl&aacute;intecare that change is impossible.  Not only is change possible, but it is happening at an unprecedented rate.  It is being led by people working across the healthcare family, women and men who are rightly proud of their efforts.  Many healthcare workers have been galvanised by what our health service has achieved during Covid, with one of the most successful vaccine roll-outs anywhere in the world.  There will always be people who will only focus on the negative and what they believe cannot be done.  Eight months ago, we were lambasted by some for saying we wanted at least 70% of our adult population to have been offered a vaccine by the end of September.  Our health service proved them wrong.  We are ambitious.  Change and reform is always challenging, but we are up for that challenge.  Access to high quality healthcare when it is needed cannot and must not be a privilege for those who can afford it.  It must be available to every girl and boy, every woman and man.  That is what universal healthcare means.  That is what must be delivered.  That is our absolute focus. </p></speech>

I also thank him and his Department for all the work they have done over the past 20 months in dealing with the Covid pandemic.  I will return to a number of issues he touched on.  The first is the resignations.  There is a view that Ms Laura Magahy and Professor Tom Keane, although less so in respect of Professor Geraldine McCarthy who resigned as head of the group in Cork, were forced to resign because they felt that what they wanted to deliver in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare was not going to be delivered, that there was resistance in the Minister's Department to their planned approach to what was agreed on an all-party basis with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare and that sufficient progress was not being made.  That is the view out there.  The Minister barely touched on these people leaving their roles in his statement.  Will he clarify some of the issues surrounding their leaving and the progress we can make without them?  They have great experience and their leaving is a very significant loss.</p></speech>

Both Professor Keane and Ms Magahy added a great deal.  As we are all aware, there has been public commentary as to whether change was happening, whether progress was being made and whether there is resistance to change.  The first thing I would look at is the progress report from the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation team.  We have to look at the evidence.  The evidence that change is happening is overwhelming.  The Sl&aacute;intecare project is defined by the Sl&aacute;intecare team on the basis of 112 projects.</p></speech>

They did leave so they obviously felt frustrated.  The Minister needs to clarify whether he was aware of that frustration and whether any action was taken to deal with that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#C00100"><p>Neither Professor Keane nor Ms Magahy raised any frustrations with me.  The first I was aware of any such concerns was when their resignations happened.  If I may, I want to finish my point on the substance of the issue.  If we are asking whether there was resistance to change, the question we must ask is whether change was and is happening.  The report I have from the executive director states that not only is change happening but, in the case of more than 97% of the projects, they are either on track or on track with minor issues.  The next question we must ask is how substantial the progress has been on the three remaining issues, because those issues matter a great deal.  What I see on e-health is that Ireland is a laggard, but substantial innovation happened during the Covid period.  We now have telemedicine and e-prescribing, which we were told could not be done.  We have unique patient identifiers for the first time because of the vaccine programme.  Much more needs to happen on e-health but substantial progress was made.</p></speech>

The Minister may not have been aware of the frustration felt by Professor Keane and Ms Magahy but were officials in his Department aware of it?  This situation did not happen overnight.  It was obviously an ongoing issue and Professor Keane and Ms Magahy came to the conclusion there was no point in staying on.</p></speech>

It appears to me that what is proposed is very much watered down from the original.  In the case of Cork, in particular, the existing hospital is an old building, originally built in 1751, with very little capacity to extend or renovate it.  Now there is talk of its being a day care facility.  If it is a day-only hospital, it will not be able to carry out serious operations, such as hip or knee procedures.  This means that large numbers of people will be excluded from availing of that facility, including anyone with underlying conditions such as diabetes.  It is going to be a very restricted facility.  We are now four or five years on from when this hospital was originally proposed and a site for it has not even been identified.  Where are we at with the proposal for elective hospitals, including site identification?  Even if a site were identified tomorrow, it will be necessary to go through a planning process.  We are at least four to five years down the road from anything being delivered.</p></speech>

Is that the right way to go when we have a huge increase in population in the Cork-Kerry region and there has been no increase in hospital beds in real terms?  The talk now is only of a day care facility.  How can that be justified?</p></speech>

A great deal of work has been done and I am bringing a memorandum to Government on it.  I entirely share the Deputy's determination that we get these hospitals-----</p></speech>

The position the Deputy has laid out is one of the core discussions.  The very strong recommendation from the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office and the team that has done the work is that these hospitals should be day case facilities.  There is a contrary, and very reasonable, view being expressed by some in the clinical community that they should offer inpatient care as well.  We are looking at both options at the moment.</p></speech>

In fact, many patients are going to Dublin because there is not capacity in Cork to treat them and the current facilities cannot be further developed.  When the next census results are available, they are likely to show a population increase for the Cork-Kerry region from 410,000 to 600,000, without there being any increase in healthcare facilities.  Does the Minister accept that a day facility is not the way forward?</p></speech>

I think we are both agreed on that.  Do we need more operating theatres, outpatient facilities and day case facilities?  Yes, we do.  The question the Deputy is asking is whether, as well as that, we need more inpatient beds.  The answer is that we certainly do, and they must be provided.  The question then is whether they should be provided as part of what is meant to be an elective-only centre.  The view from the Sl&aacute;intecare team is there is a risk that if patients are in inpatient beds, this could potentially stop the flow through the operating theatres.  For example, there is a new unit in Tallaght University Hospital, the Reeves Centre-----</p></speech>

I would not like what I am saying to be misrepresented.  I am saying we need more operating theatres, outpatient facilities and day case facilities and, on the Deputy's point, we certainly need more inpatient beds.  We are completely aligned on that.  The only question is where one puts those inpatient beds.  Should they be put with an elective hospital - the recommendation from the Sl&aacute;intecare team is that they should not be - or should they be put with the current model 4 hospitals, which deliver more complex care?</p></speech>

There is a major concern that patients are being referred out for assessment, after which they are referred for another period of time to another list.  The proposal is that when people are referred under the NTPF, it should be not only for assessment but that whatever procedure is required should also be carried out.  Is that being considered as part of efforts to deal with getting people off the waiting lists from start to finish?</p></speech>

The stark reality we are faced with right now is that we have a huge number of men, women and children waiting for care.  What I want, and I am sure we all agreed on this, is a single-tier public health system that can handle capacity for the entire country.  While we are building that capacity up, we will have to use all the capacity we have on the island in the best way possible to get care for people who are waiting for it.  As part of that, we are looking at the mandate of the NTPF in terms of how it operates.</p></speech>

We are sitting here today and we have the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department in.  We have had six resignations associated with Sl&aacute;intecare, including the former executive director, the chairperson of the board, and the two of the most senior people tasked with responsibility for delivering Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have also had a number of other resignations from the advisory committee, and, as I said earlier, the chairman of the South/South West Hospital Group.  In fairness, there is a standing invitation to most of those individuals to come before this committee also.</p> <p>  Yet, we are led to believe that the Minister had no idea that there were any problems with Sl&aacute;intecare or these individuals' views on Sl&aacute;intecare and that there was no difference or disagreement between Mr. Watt, the Department of Health, and any of these individuals, and that is seems they have resigned for no reason whatsoever.  It is hard to comprehend that there was no sense of disagreement that would have led to those resignations because we have received some glimpse of some of what they have said, particularly from Professor Keane and we want to hear from the others.  </p> <p>  From where I am sitting, can Mr. Watt understand how difficult it is for me to comprehend how we have these resignations on the one hand but there is nothing to see here from Mr. Watt and from the Minister on the other hand?</p></speech>

Mr. Watt talks about timeframes.  He is saying that there is no disagreement on the policy direction that was proposed by Ms Magahy and my understanding is that her council wanted this done over two years.  Is Mr. Watt saying that there was a disagreement or different opinions on how long it would take to get there and arrive at the final destination?</p></speech>

The timeframe on the implementation is a function ultimately of the policy that is arrived at.  Clearly, there were views and discussions with ourselves and the HSE about implementing structural change in the middle of the worst public health crisis for 100 years.  Sl&aacute;intecare itself states very clearly that we need to be completely sure that any structural changes are kept to a minimum, that we do not interrupt the provision or enhancement of services and that we are completely sure that any structural changes that we bring about are completely necessary and will improve the functioning of the system.</p></speech>

I would not have recommended to the Minister or the Government that we engage in functional change, whether it is horizontal or vertical organisational change of an organisation like the HSE, in the middle of the worst health crisis in 100 years.  Perhaps there are others who would have advised the Minister differently.  Good luck to them.  That is fair enough and that is their own view and we are all entitled to our views.  I would not have recommended that, however, because it would have been a mistake and overly risky.  The attention-----</p></speech>

My understanding of what the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Advisory Council, SIAC, was proposing was into the future as opposed to what was happening during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We will talk to the SIAC members whenever they appear before us.</p> <p>  I want to turn to the Minister because this has been very difficult and it has damaged Sl&aacute;intecare and, more importantly, people&rsquo;s perception that we will see changes in healthcare after having seen these resignations.  We now have this new structure that is being put in place, the programme board.  The patient advocates have been removed from it, as far as I can see.  I see that R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy is no longer going to be on that new structure nor will Brendan Courtney.  There is a perception again that these people would not necessarily have had a critical eye but certainly would have had a constructive view of this, and perhaps sometimes an alternative view to Mr. Watt or Mr. Paul Reid, and that these people are no longer on that board.  This structure will actually be headed up by Mr. Reid and by Mr. Watt.  Is that actually the best way to proceed with the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

We are talking about two different sets.  One was an advisory group and the other is an implementation group.  SIAC, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Advisory Council, had a three-year term and was due to finish up on 24 October.  This group did not report into me but reported into the director of Sl&aacute;intecare and I was not aware of any further meetings being scheduled.  Perhaps there was an intention to schedule more meetings but to the best of my knowledge I was not aware of any further meetings that were scheduled.  That group was essentially finishing its agreed term in the next few weeks, in any event.</p> <p>  I am doing two things. I am setting up a new advisory group to advise specifically on regionalisation.  Regionalisation had been identified by a great number of people-----</p></speech>

We now have this narrow focus on regionalisation.  I accept that the Minister is saying that this will focus on regionalisation.  The Minister said in his opening statement that we are a long way away from universal healthcare.  We certainly are.  We can talk about 97% delivery of some elements of Sl&aacute;intecare but we are a long way away from moving private healthcare from public hospitals, from universal GP care, and from reducing waiting lists which have gone in the wrong direction.</p> <p>  I will put a number of quick questions to the Minister and he or Mr. Watt can provide some quick answers.  Even in the presentation given by the Minister, he talks about &euro;1.2 billion that was allocated to health last year, which it was.  I ask Mr. Watt how much of that &euro;1.2 billion will be unspent this year?</p></speech>

Many of the people who would work or propose to work in those services were involved in other activities such as the test and tracing systems, and so on.

There has been slow recruitment and lower spending in some areas because of the challenges that the system faced because of Covid-19.</p></speech>

I have to tell the Minister that I do not have confidence that we are going to see any rapid reforms in Sl&aacute;intecare and I am not at all comforted by anything that he has said today as to why any of these very good people have resigned.  I do not have confidence that we will see any big changes in the next number of years in the big challenges in healthcare such as removing private practice from public hospitals under this Government.</p> <p>  I have talked about the &euro;1.2 billion and the beds that were promised.  The Minister talked about 14,700 staff last year where only about 7,500 of those will be recruited.  People see promises on the one hand but do not see delivery on the other hand.  At the root of all of that, which is why I welcome that there will be a focus on waiting lists, are real people, as the Minister knows.  We have talked about such people who are in pain, children with scoliosis and who are one of the 900,000 people.  The mind actually boggles at the number of people who are on waiting lists and yet we are not seeing the resources and the capacity go into the system.  Even what the Minister says he did and funded last year has not been delivered upon and it is very frustrating.</p></speech>

What the Deputy said was that he does not see the progress.  I reiterate this for people who are watching because I would hate people to think there is no progress on one of the most important projects in our republic.  This year, we will have added more beds to the public system than any year on record.  This year, we will have hired more people into the public system than any year on record.  This year, we will have added more critical care capacity to the public system than any year on record.  This year, we will have funded GP access to diagnostics at a level that has never been achieved before.  Some 97% of the projects that we have all agreed are critical to reform are on track, or on track with minor issues.  I appreciate the Deputy's job is to keep the pressure on me; that is what he is doing and I respect that.  However, let us make sure that the public know that there is a vast amount of progress.  We must almost always push for more but let us make sure that the public and the people working in our system and who depend on our system know there are levels of progress being made in the system now that are the most on record.  I want to put that on the record.</p></speech>

Context is everything.  I have always tried to be non-partisan on this and I will continue in that vein.  In a non-partisan way, there are two or three issues that strike me about this.  First, the Minister is just a year and a half in the job, so much of the narrative around Sl&aacute;intecare would have preceded his time in office.  Second, Mr. Watt is barely a wet week in the job and the consequences have landed on his table.  Third, as Mr. Watt said, we are hopefully emerging from a global pandemic.  That is the context.  To be honest, and I do not mean to be trite about it, part of me wondered about what all this excitement is about Sl&aacute;intecare right now, given what we have been going through and given what the health system has had to cope with and deal with, and what all the HSE staff and healthcare workers have had to do.  That is my objective overview of it.</p> <p>  When a Minister says he is putting the chief executive of the HSE, who, for a period, nationalised a load of private hospitals to deal with the pandemic and, so, has just garnered a load of experience in the provision of universal public healthcare in a particular context, and then the Minister also says that, with the Secretary General of his Department, these two individuals are going to take charge of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare under his political direction, that is about a big a statement as it gets in regard to the commitment of a Government to a particular policy initiative that emerged from an all-party Oireachtas report.  I imagine that a Government, regardless of what political hue it is in the future, would do well to follow that.</p> <p>  I have one caveat.  The Minister is bringing everything back to the centre, and I see the necessity for that in the circumstances.  How does he propose to withstand the accusation that the regional structure is the way to go when he is bringing everything back to the centre?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#E00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for genuinely acknowledging that the changes we are making are exactly to that end.  I am appointing the head of the Department and the head of the HSE to this role.  They report to me and I will report in to the Cabinet, so this is being managed at the most senior level, with clear lines of direction and accountability on that.</p> <p>  With regard to the regional health organisations, essentially, what we are talking about is merging community and acute care.  That was the point.  A lot of work was then done on how that might be achieved and the six regions were arrived at after a long consultation period.  Some people agree with those regions and some people do not agree with those regions, and that is quite normal.</p> <p>  A reorganisation of our healthcare system is probably the highest risk element of our reform programme.  Tackling the waiting lists, adding capacity, changing the models of care, and increasing advanced nursed practitioners and GP access to diagnostics are important but they do not pose a systemic risk, even if they do not work as well as one might want them to.  A reorganisation of a system as complex and critical as our healthcare system is a high-risk endeavour.  That is why the Sl&aacute;intecare report itself said it should be done with minimal change.</p> <p>  If we are going to embark on what I believe is the highest risk part of Sl&aacute;intecare - it is one of the enablers but it is high risk - it must have the oversight and the leadership from the Government, me, the Department, Mr. Watt and the HSE and Paul Reid.  However, if it is going to work, the change has to be owned by the people in the system itself.  A mistake would be for a group in the centre to come up with a detailed design and then announce it and say, &ldquo;This is the new change and this is what is going to happen&rdquo;.  International evidence shows that is resisted by the people who we need to be part of that change.  Therefore, while the policy direction will be owned at the most senior level at the centre, if we are going to get this right and do it successfully, it has to involve people right around the system, in the CHOs, hospital groups, hospitals and throughout the system.  Essentially, there will be wide consultation and involvement in this process.</p></speech>

I agree that context is the first casualty of political debate now, it would seem.  The context for all this is critical and everyone knows that the pressures the system has been under for the past while have certainly impacted on our ability to do other things.  Since I took over this role only nine months ago, I have spent 90%-plus of my time in regard to policies on Covid, vaccination policy, test and trace, hotel quarantining and all the different aspects the Department has been grappling with.  That is the reality of it.  We are now hopeful, given where the disease is, that we will be able to focus on all the other non-Covid aspects of health and public health that we have to do.</p> <p>  I will not add too much to what the Minister said on this question of centralisation.  The CEO of the HSE has reorganised the centre, and he did that a few months ago.  There is an interesting debate about what functions should remain at a central, national level, with national standards, policies, procurement policies, IT, HR and all of that, and what then should be delivered at a local level.  I am pretty convinced, having read a lot of the research on this internationally and in Ireland, that we need to align CHOs and hospital groups.  We need to integrate them to have organisations at a regional level that can deliver the integration of care that we talk about.</p> <p>  The demographic challenge the country faces, because of the number of people aged over 85 and the number of people over 60, is the wider context for this debate.  There is a massive increase in the demand for our services and it is only going to go one direction, thankfully, as our citizens are living longer.  As we know, as they live longer, they will have more conditions and they will rely more on the health system.  We cannot meet current needs, let alone future needs, with this structure, and we need to have much more of the service provided at primary level and community level.  The change that is proposed in regard to the regional health areas, RHAs, is critical to deliver that.</p> <p>  The final element, which is very important, is in terms of the allocation of budgets.  We allocate budgets based on "acute", "primary" and so on.  We need to start allocating budgets over time on the basis of the population needs of people in particular geographics, so that we look at what are the needs of a population - not what are the needs of the acute system or the community system, but the needs of the population - and allocate on that basis.</p> <p>  They are the critical elements.  We need to make decisions over the next few months and the Minister will have to decide, with his Government colleagues, exactly what implementation plan to embrace in regard to the RHAs.  We are committed to doing it and the HSE is committed to doing it, and we will push ahead strongly over the period ahead to do it.  It is a fundamental reform.  I agree, having read once again the implementation report on Sl&aacute;intecare, that this is a fundamental aspect we have to deliver to achieve the overall objectives.</p></speech>

The key lesson I draw from it ultimately is that I do not think the structure set up was the correct structure.  Ms Magahy may speak with the committee or she may not.  She may make comment on this.  The office was set up in a particular way as an adjunct to the Department, with Mr. Patterson and his colleagues working away.  I am sure Mr. Patterson and his colleagues would accept this.  What we need in the Department of Health - this is what we are doing now because we are reorganising the Department - is to ensure that Sl&aacute;intecare is embraced by the entire management team.  Ultimately, Ms Magahy felt that the office was not set up properly and that it was not going to deliver properly unless we embedded the philosophy, culture and the projects across the Department.  That is the key lesson for me from what has happened.  We need to look at our delivery structure and learn from it.  Ms Magahy suggested how we would do this in the future.  I accept that and that is what we will now do.</p></speech>

Many changes took place and many people were reallocated from functions.  Many functions were put in abeyance as staff were reallocated to deal with Covid.  Approximately 150 or 200 staff were affectively on Covid activities.  Most people are now moving off those and they will be reallocated.  As part of that, we are restructuring.

I think ultimately, as Mr. Watt has said, Ms Magahy was frustrated.  I think probably the structure of the Sl&aacute;intecare team needed to be changed and that is exactly what we are doing.  As to why Professor Keane resigned, he referenced a resistance to change.  As the Deputy will be aware, in his letter to the council that he chaired, he felt the environment was such that change was impossible.</p></speech>

The big recommendation of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare was that the Sl&aacute;intecare office would not be located within the Department of Health.  Lessons were learned from the experience with the cancer strategy.  The big fear was that there would be departmental capture of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  If the Department of Health and the HSE were capable of reform, we would have seen it long ago.  However, the concern was that it would be captured.  Hearing what is now proposed as a replacement structure, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that this is a hostile takeover of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I ask the Minister to be a bit more precise on what exactly he is proposing.  I ask him to outline the new governance structure for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare now as he referenced in his statement.  Who will be in charge of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Where will the independent oversight come from?  </p></speech>

That is what I am talking about.  In the Sl&aacute;intecare programme, a requirement was established for six pieces of legislation.  One of those has been introduced, which reinstated the HSE board.  It was crazy that this had to happen in the first place.  Two of the others concern legislation on the accountability of the Minister for Health, all staff, and in particular, the accountability of senior management in terms of the spending of budgets and also, critically, clinical outcomes.</p> <p>  I have looked at the legislative programme.  There is no indication that any work is being done on those pieces of legislation, which are regarded, and were regarded by the all-party committee, as essential to achieving the kind of reform required, that is, the devolution of power and the introduction of legal accountability for people within the health service.  Can the Minister provide a reason for no progress being made in that regard?</p></speech>

Did the Department officially recommend or advise that there would be a pause to Sl&aacute;intecare?  Was an end date given for that pause or was a timeframe provided for it?  It was said that everyone was in agreement that it should be implemented within a two-year timeframe and, therefore, the pandemic meant that there was a pause.  What timeframe was given for that pause?</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare has continued to be delivered as outlined in the progress report that Mr. Patterson and the team have just published, which sets out progress on the other aspects that are not included in the report.  There is ongoing reform in terms of how services are provided for patients.  There is reform in relation to ehealth.  Eprescribing is a very significant change which has brought about big benefits in terms of clinical practices, critical pathways and GP services.  That is ongoing.</p></speech>

However, while work is ongoing on specific Sl&aacute;intecare projects, without regionalisation, it is a bit like designing the best practice of a one-off item or perhaps designing a luxury room without the structure of the building around it.</p><p>Will Mr. Watt give us further information on what the Department imagines the implementation of the regionalisation will be?  When will we start to see the full devolution of budgets to regional structures?</p></speech>

We are setting the budget for 2022 now.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will set out the 2022 allocation to our Minister next week, so the devolution will not happen next year.  We are hopeful that we will have put in place a process for 2023 onwards.  I do not have the details at this stage, but over the next month or two, we will have them.  I agree with what Deputy Shortall said about the importance of this reform having a regional focus that enables the integration to take place, ensures that budgets are allocated based on need at regional level and provides better accountability at regional level for outcomes for citizens.  That is the philosophy that I subscribe to and that is the way to go.  We will give our views on how to push ahead with this to the Minister shortly.</p> <p>  There is no institutional resistance to this in the Department of Health or the HSE.  There was a healthy debate about the timeframe.  My experience as a long-time civil servant is that healthy debate between officials and, God help us, even between officials and Ministers is a good thing.  That there can be differences of opinion, which there are, is not a bad thing.  The worst thing is to have differences but not to air them and not to have a frank discussion.</p></speech>

Mr. Patterson and I not agreeing on something, which happens quite often, is not necessarily a problem.  That is healthy.  We do not all have the same views; we have different views, but we ultimately get to what we think is the best view, which we then give to the Minister, and the Minister and his colleagues decide what to do.</p></speech>

Structural and functional change is time consuming.  I have been involved in many reforms across the public service.  I do not know Professor Keane at all, but I have great time for Ms Magahy.  She is a great person and I know Professor Keane by reputation, but they are not the only people who work in the health system who have experience of reform.  Mr. Paul Reid is one of the most impressive public servants this country has ever produced.  His record of delivery over the past 12 months has been phenomenal.  We will refocus and we will set out what we are hoping to do, and we will be able to deliver these changes over time.</p></speech>

Given that we are now hearing that the head of the HSE and the head of the Department will be responsible for implementation, that is something of a worry.</p> <p>  What would the Minister consider is the most significant-----</p></speech>

Mr. Reid and myself are accountable to the Government and this committee and we are legally responsible for the allocation of budgets and spending public money on delivering this change, which is what we are going to do.  I have been involved in many reform programmes across the Civil Service in particular.  My experience is that they need to be driven by the people who are heading the organisations, with the political direction of the relevant Minister and the Taoiseach.  That is the best way to get progress.</p> <p>  Now that we are in a different phase of Covid, it is my professional view &ndash; members may disagree with me on this if they wish &ndash; that what the Minister is proposing in terms of Mr. Reid and me being charged with this responsibility is the most effective way for us to deliver the programme of change.  I am fully committed to doing that.  It is not as it has been characterised, that is, reform being suffocated.  The Department of Health wants to deliver this because the Department knows &ndash; colleagues say it to me every day &ndash; that the current system is not delivering for our citizens.  It is not a case of people being hostile to or suffocating reform; quite the opposite.  With the HSE, people in the Department are the ones who are driving the change and reform.  We are dissatisfied with ehealth and we want to do more, and we are dissatisfied with waiting lists and the changes in that regard.  The people in the Department are as dissatisfied as the Minister or anyone else.  The characterisation is not fair.  Officials in the Department are fully focused and driven.  That is why public servants want to work in the Department of Health.  That is what motivates them.  They are not just motivated to stay in the Department.  If they wanted easier jobs, there are plenty of them across the Civil Service.</p></speech>

Everyone will agree that the past number of weeks have been bad for the concept of universal healthcare, that is, Sl&aacute;intecare.  Regardless of whether that is down to internal or external factors, members of the advisory committee have asked serious questions of the future of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In light of that and the perception it has raised, many people - or some people, depending on their objectivity &ndash; believe that there is institutional resistance to reform, be that resistance political or in the HSE, the Department or other bodies.  Some of the wording in the resignations of Professor McCarthy, Professor Keane and Ms Magahy is damning of the Sl&aacute;intecare process and some people will perceive that there is institutional resistance.

To those who say there is institutional resistance, I am available to talk to anyone and I would ask him or her to tell me two things &ndash; the issue the Department is resisting, be it a policy issue or aspect of Sl&aacute;intecare, and who is resisting.  Is it me, Mr. Reid or someone else?  I am not accusing the Deputy of making general comments, as he is reflecting what people are saying, but making general comments that there is resistance to change or reform in an organisation is too easy.  There is something in it of people having watched too much "Yes Minister", with civil servants going around unwilling to make changes and only looking after their own interests.  That is 40 years old, to say the least.  I do not listen to radio, but I have been told that people have said on radio that there is not only resistance, but "brutal resistance", which apparently is an even greater form of resistance than normal resistance.  If people have evidence of that brutal resistance or resistance, they need to tell me.  They can email me, text me or even organise a meeting and I will listen to their evidence of the specific issue they are referring to and which officer is involved.  Is Mr. Patterson resisting the change?  Maybe he is, so let me know.  I do not know.  Is someone else resisting the change?  Tell me who-----</p></speech>

She wrote: "However, recent information and my own experiences tell me we are no nearer to the required reform than we were six years ago."  That is not fabricated.  It is coming from someone who was spearheading Sl&aacute;intecare.  It must be taken seriously if a person who has been leading the charge is saying this.</p></speech>

Ms Magahy is a serious person, Professor Keane is a serious person, and I take their resignations seriously.  The Deputy will have seen substantial new proposals from me, the Department and the HSE on the governance of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am appointing the Secretary General of the Department and the chief executive of the HSE to its implementation.  That is the level of senior leadership that we will have.  That board will report directly to me and I will report directly to the Cabinet.</p> <p>  The Deputy rightly said that damage had been done.  That is true.</p><p>There is a perception among some that change is not happening.  We heard a member of the committee say already today that the Department and the HSE are incapable of change.  All I would say is that we, as parliamentarians, need to be very clear as to the evidence.  Is there resistance to change?  In my experience, people do not resist change; they resist loss.  People from any walk of life or in any organisation, be it the HSE, the Oireachtas, Microsoft or whatever, will resist perceived loss.  That is why we have to get the reorganisation right.  If it is perceived as something whereby people lose out, they will resist that change.  It is human nature.  We all resist loss.  It is why it is so important that the reorganisation is done right.</p><p> Doing a reorganisation of a healthcare system is a bit like trying to upgrade a Boeing 747 mid-flight.  We do not get to shut down the operating theatres and tell the doctors and nurses to go home for two weeks.  We do not get to shut the maternity hospitals.  Everything has to keep running.  All the patients have to be seen.  No machine gets turned off and nobody gets to go home.  While they are still doing their jobs under immense pressure, we have to rewire the system in an important way.  That only works when the men and women who work in the system are brought into the change.</p><p> This is the point I was trying to make earlier.  When any of us make statements saying there is no change or progress, and that these people - whoever they are - are incapable of reform, it is incumbent on us as parliamentarians to look at the evidence.  The evidence we have is unambiguous.  The Sl&aacute;intecare office handed me a progress report stating that 97% of our projects were on track or on track with minor issues.  Think about that - not 60% or 70% but 97%.  I do not understand how an organisation can be 97% on track and at the same time incapable of reform.  I think we would all agree with this.</p><p> I spend much time out in the healthcare system talking to our front-line workers.  I believe I speak for us all when I say that what they have done over the last 18 months is magnificent.  It is extraordinary.  They are exhausted.  Many of them are traumatised but they have lived change every single day.  They are passionate about change and about the people they serve.  When I talk to people right across our system, be it in the Department of Health, the HSE or our front-line workers, I see people who are passionate about universal healthcare and who have probably implemented more change over the last 18 months than any organisation any of us can see.  Is it perfect?  No.  Does everything work perfectly the way we want it to work?  No.  Will we get pockets of resistance to certain ideas?  Absolutely we will, as we will get anyway.  Ultimately, this is a system that wants to and is capable of reform.  We in government are deadly serious about reforming it to ensure 100% universal healthcare.</p></speech>

Nobody listening to today's events and previous events will doubt there is change.  How fast that is going is the question.  We all want universal healthcare.  We want a system that ends the two-tier health system.</p> <p>  What is the current position on reform with regard to private healthcare in public hospitals?  It is one of the concepts of change in Sl&aacute;intecare.  For most people, that is counter-intuitive to what universal healthcare actually means.  Is there resistance from private medicine to decoupling that from our public hospitals?  As I said, most people hearing about that concept of private healthcare in public hospitals would say that if the Government does not start with that, then we have a problem.</p></speech>

Removing private care from our public hospitals is absolutely essential.  We are in the middle of negotiations with regard to a public-only contract.  I cannot get into the detail of that, obviously, because the negotiations are ongoing.  The policy goal, however, is that public patients are treated in public hospitals and that is it.  It is very important.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy's question on resistance, the doctors in our system have dedicated their lives to our patients.  They want to be able to treat as many people as possible as quickly as possible with the best available technology and medical science.  That is what motivates them.  That is why they went to medical school and why they work 60, 70 and 80 hours per week. We need to make sure, therefore, that the change is positive and works and that we move forward together.</p></speech>

I do not believe the current system works.  It leads to elements of dysfunctionality and it needs to end.</p> <p>  It has been heartening to hear so many consultants over the last few weeks giving their vocal support for Sl&aacute;intecare and saying that we should not cherry-pick Sl&aacute;intecare.  That means those consultants are in favour of removing private practice from public hospitals given their very clear support for Sl&aacute;intecare in all its manifestations.  Given those comments, we look forward to reaching agreement on making the changes we need to make.</p></speech>

It is not, therefore, appropriate for us to comment on that.  There is, however, a timeframe for the end of this month to conclude those negotiations.  Negotiations on that contract and aspects of it will be a really important element of the reform to ensure that all patients in public hospitals are treated on the basis of need and not their insurance status.  By the end of the month, hopefully, we will have agreement for a roadmap to move forward on this.  That is one aspect of it.  There are other parts of it but that is a very important aspect.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the tremendous success of the vaccination roll-out and programme and its uptake around the country.  Everybody can be rightly proud of the team within the HSE and Department of Health.</p> <p>  I also welcome and acknowledge the success of the heart health diagnostic pilot whereby GPs can refer their patients with suspected heart failure directly to the primary care teams for tests and diagnostics.  That is healthcare in action and working.  I will mention one bit of testimony from a friend of mine whose mother was referred by a GP for an ultrasound to a facility in Santry connected to Beaumont Hospital.  She was in and out in 15 minutes.  Again, that is public healthcare working correctly and properly.  It is important to put that on the record.</p> <p>  I welcome the plans for the elective units in Galway, Dublin and Cork.  I understand and welcome that the Minister is bringing that proposal to Cabinet tomorrow.  I am sure he will not want to go into too much detail about what is in it and I understand that.  As Deputy Colm Burke mentioned, the facilities planned are day-only beds.  This is not what the Saolta University Health Care Group has indicated is needed.  It has made that clear.  We have been led to believe, for example, that knee and hip operations would be carried out in these new elective facilities, which I do not think is feasible in a day-only facility.  Perhaps we could get some clarity on that.  Is there a commitment to overnight beds in the national development plan, NDP, for University Hospital Galway, either in the elective centres or elsewhere over the course of the plan?</p></speech>

I am bringing a memo to Government tomorrow.  The Senator will appreciate that I cannot discuss the details of that.  What I can say, though, is that I fully acknowledge there is a need for more inpatient beds in Galway.  The capacity in Galway needs to be increased.   A very ambitious plan is in place, on which the Senator and I have been corresponding, in terms of an emergency department block and additional facilities that would be part of that block.  There is an ongoing discussion about whether those inpatient beds are best deployed to a model 4 hospital or an elective-only hospital.  That is a live debate.</p><p>I cannot say too much before I discuss it at Cabinet tomorrow.  However, I can wholeheartedly support the core assurance I think the Senator is looking for, that being that more inpatient beds are required.</p></speech>

In response to the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals published earlier in the year, the Saolta University Health Care Group has indicated it believes the proposals must go further.  After the options appraisal there is an ongoing debate in Galway in relation to Merlin Park versus University Hospital Galway.  There a plans for a full move to Merlin Park, a partial one, and so on.  That has muddied the water to a degree.  I would rather there was a focus simply on healthcare in Galway and what is best, rather than have this competition, if you like, between certain elements in Saolta.</p> <p>  The Minister and his officials will be aware there was no mention of the ED on the list of projects on pages 141-142 of the NDP, much to my surprise and that of many people in the Saolta University Health Care Group.  I am not sure if that was an oversight or whatever else.  I put on record that I do not believe that means the project will not go ahead, or at least I hope it does not mean that, I should say.  Maybe Mr. Watt, from his experience at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will be able to say whether that Department will argue that because the ED is not listed on pages 141 -142 of the NDP it therefore is not a priority.  That would be a concern.  It is three years since the Minister's predecessor came to UHG and was promised by the Saolta University Health Care Group that planning permission for a new ED would be lodged by Christmas of that year.  I appreciate the specification has changed but that is still not lodged.  The facilities are inadequate.  Former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said, I would say back in 2015, that they were not fit for purpose back.  The Taoiseach, when leader of the Opposition putting questions to him agreed, following a visit, that they were not fit for purpose.  Everybody agrees they are not fit for purpose but there is such a delay on delivery.  There is a delay even on lodging the planning application.  We do not even know how that will go.  I presume it will be positive because it is so needed.  God behold anyone who objects to something as vital as that for Galway.  This is so needed.  Nurses are absolutely frustrated.  They have done so much Trojan work during the pandemic.  They are now decanting to temporary accommodation which will be open between April and July, as I understand it.</p> <p>  What is the update on the ED?  I believe the Minister is committed to this but I would like to hear it from him.  Will he commit to an emergency department on the grounds of UHG for the people of Galway and the west?</p></speech>

The Senator's analysis of it not being in the NDP is correct.  That absolutely does not mean it will not proceed.  Not every project is listed in the plan nor could it be.  I am very aware of the need for the facilities in Galway.  The Senator has raised many issues around planning permission.  As he will be aware, it is a multi-stage process which must be gone through.  I will get back to the Senator with a detailed note on exactly where all those pieces are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#K00400"><p>Okay.  I have raised it before.  I am hearing dates and I have heard dates before.  I heard dates of February 2019, May 2019, then it was delayed for the options appraisal, then it was going to September 2020, and here we are in October 2021 and there is now talk of 2022.  I have not been given a specific month, nor would I believe one at this stage because I have heard so many different dates.  I ask the Minister to come back to me on that with urgency.  There is frustration, as I said, from the front-line workers in relation to a project everybody, including at the most senior level of the Taoiseach and former Taoiseach, and the Minister and his predecessors, accepts is absolutely required.  Ms Laura Magahy appeared before the committee at our last meeting.  She talked about a more ambitious plan locally in Galway.  This comes back to the whole argument over what is needed.  The Minister has pointed to the fact that more inpatient beds are needed.  I would welcome an update, following tomorrow's Cabinet meeting, for Galway elected representatives on what exactly is planned with respect to inpatient facilities and where they are going to be located, if they do happen and whether they would be provided in Merlin Park, as the Saolta University Health Care Group desires, or in UHG.  I look forward to such an update.  As a final point on that, the Minister mentioned in his opening statement that 850 permanent beds have been provided to the hospital system this year.  Will he supply details on the location of all those?  Is there a small number of them in every hospital or a large number in certain facilities?  He might be able to provide that detail to us if he does not have it now.</p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Watt, he will know the expression "poacher turned gamekeeper", although perhaps in his case it is gamekeeper turned poacher, because he is now fighting for extra resources whereas in his previous role he may have been pushing back against Departments being given extra resources.  That might be an unfair categorisation but he can respond.  Is his primary role about securing additional funding for healthcare in this budget and all budgets, or is it about reform, saving us from waste, although that might be unfair, and improving efficiency within the healthcare system?  How does Mr. Watt see his role?  I ask because we have seen increases in budget every year.  There have been many successes and where there is capital expenditure and increases in staff, these are obviously visible and have an important role.  At the same time, given Mr. Watt's previous experience where does he see his role as Secretary General now?</p></speech>

We will come back to him on the beds.  We have a table here but it would not be a very efficient way to read something into the record.  We will provide the table.  There are changes across all the regions with respect to increased capacities.  We will send that on to him and he will see the details on that.</p> <p>  My job is to run the Department of Health and to deliver for the Minister and deliver the reforms for the Department and for the system.  That is my job.  Making the Department work as effectively as possible will enable us to deliver on the reform agenda, on the various policy initiatives and the legislative programme for the Minister.  My job is to manage the Department to deliver on the Minister's and the Government's agenda.  An aspect of that involves fighting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - and they are very reasonable people in that Department - about money.  Despite the general sense, officials in that Department want to have a well-funded, efficient health system that meets the needs of citizens.  People in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are also humans, despite what some people would suggest.  They are part of this community as well and they rely on the public health system in the same way as anybody else.  There is always a bit of adversarial cut and thrust around budgets but, ultimately, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Micheal McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, have the same objective in mind, that is, to fund the health system to meet the needs of citizens of Ireland, so that is what we are about.  My job is to work with the Minister on that.</p></speech>

I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will be making announcements but I am not going to pre-empt the budget.  In my experience Ministers prefer to announce the budget themselves, which makes sense.  Next Tuesday, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will be announcing plans for 2022.  It is not agreed yet of course but I am hopeful there will be another significant investment in the health system.</p> <p>  On top of the initial resources we have spoken about, which are absolutely critical, we must reform the structures and the system to get more out of those resources, and everybody accepts that.  We must ensure more of our citizens are treated closer to home in the community by community teams and GP teams.  We need to keep people out of hospital and when people get into hospital we must get them out quickly.  More and more treatment must take place outside the acute system.  That is not only better for patients but it is also a more efficient way of providing that care.  A key part of our role is not only to argue for and get more resources but to drive efficiency and change across the system.</p> <p>  There are many issues here with the drugs budget, for example.  We are negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies in the context of the drugs budget as we need to get savings on drugs.  It is very expensive and going up all the time.  We cannot meet the need that is out there.  There is the use of existing facilities.  Can we get more out of the diagnostic machines we have?  Can we get more out of the operating theatres?  Can we look at changes in work practices to drive efficiencies?  Thus there is a whole agenda which we are committed to, as is the HSE.  We are committed to it because no matter how successful the Minister is at extracting money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, those resources are finite and are never going to meet the needs we identified, so we must ensure we are maxing out all the time.  That is an ongoing challenge for us.  It is the challenge we face in the Department but it is a challenge every healthcare system in the developed world is now facing.  We have a demographic change which is absolutely profound and is going to have profound implications for our society.  It would be useful, Chairman, to talk about that at some future date when we can get into the detail of it.  Respectfully, it is a much more important issue than people resigning from councils or whatever.  How are we going to deal with the enormous changes that are going to be brought about by the fact that, thankfully, our citizens are living longer?  The number of people now over 85 years of age and indeed over 65 years of age will have a profound effect on the health system.</p><p>Those are the big challenges we face and that is what we are focusing on.</p></speech>

They have been very committed to everything that has been happening.  I do not doubt the commitment of and the great work the Minister, the Department and the HSE are doing with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare and a better healthcare system.  I just want to go back a little bit to the cross-party Oireachtas committee on Sl&aacute;intecare.  One of the top priorities of that committee, and many of the witnesses who came in, was reform of the HSE and the devolution of power.  Do the Minister or Mr. Watt think that there may be a conflict of interest with the Department and the HSE stepping into that role?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#L00300"><p>I understand the premise of the Senator's question and it is a very fair one.  We are tasking the centre with reducing its authority or its executive bandwidth, so whether that is a direct conflict is a very reasonable question.  Regardless of whether there is a conflict, when embarking on a programme of reform and organisational redesign of this scale the only people who can lead it are the senior leadership teams in the organisations.  They are the only people who can lead.  No one else can do that job other than the senior teams in those organisations themselves.  If you give it to somebody else it will fail because the organisations will not own it.  They will not have created it and they will resist it.  There is consistent evidence of that in large-scale change all over the world.  It has to be led at the most senior levels politically, which is me reporting to the Cabinet, as well as at an official level, which is Mr. Watt, and at an operational level, which is Mr. Reid.  That is the leadership team.  Mr. Reid and Mr. Watt are going to co-chair a very senior group of people who will report to me and then I am accountable to the Oireachtas, to this committee and to Cabinet.  The first thing needed for success is absolute commitment at the most senior level.  Given that, the Senator's question, which is how we ensure that happens, very much comes into play.  Part of what we have to do is tap into the fact that everyone involved is dedicating every minute of every day to universal healthcare.  Everybody has bought into that.  All of us have bought into that.  If people have bought into this, the argument has to make sense.  If it makes sense, and if people can see that this is better for patients, clinicians and workers, then it will happen.</p> <p>  The concept in management terms is subsidiarity, that is, pushing out decision-making as far from the centre as possible.  We have just seen an incredibly successful model of that with the vaccine programme.  Right at the centre we had a task force that reported to me, we had very senior leadership from the Department and the HSE and we had a very clear goal, which is critical for these programmes as well.  You have to be absolutely clear about where you are going and what it is you are trying to achieve and then the operational model is to push out the local solutions locally.  For example, I was in vaccine centres in universities, in GAA clubs, in hotels and in all sorts of facilities.  Every single person running those vaccine centres had to optimise locally but with all the support they needed from the centre.  Another area that gets less attention but which was even more random is testing and tracing.  I went to a testing and tracing centre in an old fire station.  We had testing and tracing on the site of a county GAA stadium and in all sorts of different places.  Again, that worked because our front-line workers were trusted to do the job that they know how to do and they got the support they needed from the centre.  That is essentially the philosophy.  I have bought into that, the Department has bought into it and the HSE has bought into it.  The Senator's question, which is really important and is one we are going to have to keep asking ourselves repeatedly, is whether we, the HSE or the Department are resisting this concept of subsidiarity.  We need to make sure we are not.  The way to deal with that is through a very clear goal and everyone passionately wanting to get there.  I am also establishing an advisory group specifically on this area so we will have a group of people who are outside of the direct implementation who will be able to feed back into the Department and to me as to whether they think we are getting that right.</p></speech>

It comes back to the Sl&aacute;intecare cross-party Oireachtas group and the recommendation that was given around the reform of the HSE and the devolution of power.  Is that a recommendation that will not be taken on board?  I am only asking about the cross-party Oireachtas committee and that recommendation.  Does the Minister think that recommendation will now not be taken on board?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#L00500"><p>It is absolutely being taken on board.  In terms of operational principles for regionalisation, it is exactly what we need to do.  I passionately believe that the only way we will get the level of performance and change we need, on behalf of patients, is to empower our front-line workers to do the job they know how to do.  I will give a very quick example of where it goes wrong and what we need to change.  I was talking to an emergency medicine consultant before I was in office who told me that they were trying to set up a triage room in their emergency department, which is an absolutely basic operational procedure for emergency medicine.  She told me that it took five years to get it in place.  At the time her colleagues told her she was wasting her time and that she would be exhausted by the end of it.  They got it after five years but she said to me it was the last time they were going to embark on that kind of local reform programme.  That is a case of the system being stuck and buried in red tape and failing on behalf of patients.  What we have to do is trust our front-line staff, our clinicians and our front-line management teams as well.  In fairness, there are many parts of the system that are already doing this.  We have to trust them to do the right thing in their local environment.</p> <p>  However, the flip side to that is that we need to know how it is going.  One of the big problems we have in the system right now is that we do not know.  We do not know, for example, how many procedures are being run per operating theatre in each hospital.  We do not know how many scans are being run per diagnostic suite.  We are not able to compare and contrast one hospital with another and say that it looks like hospital A is getting an awful lot more for the capacity it has than hospital B, for example.</p> <p>  There is wonderful change happening.  I will give an example just from last week.  I was in one of our model 4 hospitals and they brought me to the ophthalmology suite where they do cataracts.  They have basically applied engineering principles and lean process design to get the patients moving through quicker.  Believe it or not, they are going from an average of four and a half cataract procedures per session to 15.  No one in the centre, be it politically, in the Department or in Dr. Steevens' Hospital can solve those local problems and spot those local opportunities.  The only people who can do that are the people working in the community or in acute settings.  We have to make sure they are free to do it but at the same time we need to be able to hold them to account and make sure that reform, change and improvement are happening.</p></speech>

Could the Minister speak to the developments and the strategy that the Department is implementing to advance ehealth?  Does the Department intend to evaluate and review that current strategy?</p></speech>

I believe Ireland is a laggard in e-health.  We have invested a significant amount this year, but in fairness to those leading on that strategy, we got hit with the cyberattack and the extent of the damage that the cyberattack caused probably is not fully understood.  It caused absolute chaos in the system.  The very people - and they are excellent - who were going to be pushing on the ehealth agenda ended up having to respond to the cyberattack.  Therefore, I think we are behind.</p> <p>  However, a digital transformation team within the HSE is examining innovation.  We must also recognise that, during the pandemic, important changes were made.  We were told that telemedicine could not be done; now it is being done right across the system.  It is being embraced within the system and by patients.  For years, we were told that technically, it was not possible to move to eprescribing.  I am told that it was done in approximately three weeks under the intense pressure of the pandemic.  Through the vaccine programme we now have unique patient identifiers, something we have never had before.  There are exciting pilots going on in terms of diagnostics and sensors being used in people's homes to monitor chronic diseases they may have.  They are being monitored in the community by public health nurses or specialists.  Therefore, a lot of innovation is happening, but there is a vast amount of work required to bring Ireland up to the level that we need to be at.  Mr. Watt and I are having ongoing discussions about how we begin to push that, and have a clear and ambitious strategy and implement that.</p></speech>

Ms Magahy and Professor Keane are serious individuals with a lot of experience.  I very much regret their resignations.  I would have liked if the issues had been flagged earlier, and perhaps we could have proceeded differently.  However, the situation is as we find it.</p> <p>  In terms of Ms Magahy, as Mr. Watt has said, what was expressed to me were two issues.  The first was a frustration with resistance to change and, second, that the structure was not working.  There is a team within the Department trying its best.  Mr. Patterson and the team are working incredibly hard to own something as ambitious as universal healthcare.  Ms Magahy was frustrated with that structure.  We are making changes to that structure.  Let us be very clear: we are talking about universal healthcare and what I would argue is the most important programme of change and progress in our society and republic.  That is how I view it.  Something that big and ambitious has to be owned right across the Department and the HSE.</p> <p>  With regard to Professor Keane, his letter was sent to SIAC and is available.  He is a serious individual with a lot of experience.  He has brought a lot to the table and it has been very valuable to have him in.  He, too, expressed frustration with a resistance to change, and stated that the environment was such that change was not possible.</p></speech>

We are just emerging from a major medical emergency in the pandemic.  That was always going to interfere with change and progress.  If it did not, there would be something wrong.  We would have the greatest health system in the world if it did not.</p> <p>  In terms of universal healthcare, the term "universal" worries me.  I want universal healthcare for those on low and middle incomes, not necessarily for people who can afford it.  I certainly do not share the view on that concept and understanding of universal healthcare.  The wealthy in society should continue to pay for medical treatment.</p> <p>  I would like to raise an issue local to the mid-west, of which I am sure the Minister will be aware.  A 60-bed modular unit opened in the past few years to deal with the emergency department issue in the University Hospital Limerick, UHL, yet, in the past couple of days, there were reports of 82 patients waiting on trolleys.  Can he understand the bemusement and the lack of understanding of the people of the mid-west at the situation wherein a 60-bed modular unit has been provided, yet 82 people have been waiting on trolleys?  Can he provide some kind of explanation and understanding to the people of the mid-west as to why that is happening and when it will be resolved?  When will we be in a situation where we will not see those type of numbers on trolleys in Limerick?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#M00900"><p>First, the 60-bed unit was critical but not enough.  That is part of the issue.  We launched an ambitious winter plan last year.  There was only around a 12% reduction in attendances, but there was a 60% reduction in the number of those on trolleys.  The trolley numbers were the lowest since the records were first collected, I believe, in 2013.  Therefore, it worked well.  There were some things going in our favour, such as the absence of seasonal flu, but we had other things going against us such as the global pandemic.</p> <p>  The reason it worked was we implemented solutions for the whole patient flow.  First, we kept people out of the emergency department wherever possible.  Second, if they did need to come to emergency departments, they were streamed into minor injuries, medical assessment or surgical assessment units or what we would all understand as the normal emergency department.  Third, if they could be discharged quickly and supported at home, we did that; and, fourth, if they did need to be admitted, for example, to be stabilised for 24 hours, we ensured a home care package was available to get them out of the hospital and supported at home as quickly as possible.  This approach worked.  We are looking at a similar approach this year.</p> <p>  The good news is that last year's plan was a &euro;600 million winter plan and we locked the vast majority money into the base.  The staff, home care hours, diagnostics and beds that we added for the winter plan are still there for this winter.  That said, I share the Senator's concerns, because this is going to be a tough winter.</p></speech>

What is going to happen in November, December and January, when the flu peak usually happens post-Christmas and early into the new year?  If there are 82 people on trolleys now, what way is it going to be in January?</p></speech>

I very much share the Senator's concern.  We will allocate home care hours, staff, beds, diagnostics, frailty intervention teams and much more.  However, he is correct to point out that the system is under a lot of pressure.  What we are seeing in Limerick and other areas is people coming in who may be sicker than normal, and who, because of the pandemic, have perhaps waited or have not had the care during the year they would normally get.  They are less resilient at the moment and their average length of stay is longer.  That is what the emergency medicine professionals are telling me.  Therefore, it is a real concern and we need a comprehensive package in place on that.</p></speech>

It concerns the appointment of eye clinic liaison officers to hospital groups.  HE quite rightly mentioned a hospital that has turned around the number of cataract operations it performs per hour from 4.5 per hour to 15 per hour, which is fantastic.</p><p>However, for people who are diagnosed with post-operative sight loss, there is no link between healthcare professionals and step-down services.  The eye clinic liaison officer is that link.  It has worked well in the children's hospital group in Dublin.  If it was rolled out across the country, it would reduce the amount of time that medical professionals have to spend explaining to people what they needed to do in terms of step-down services.  It would ease a significant blockage and give people access to much better step-down supports.  I hope there will be eye clinic liaison officer funding in the budget next week and that the Minister will give a commitment to that at this meeting.</p></speech>

He stated that Mr. Reid was one of the most impressive public servants this country had ever seen.  I wholeheartedly agree.  I have experience of Mr. Reid from his time with Fingal County Council.  While we were sorry to lose him, it was to the benefit of the country.  I am aware of his deep commitment to public service and the public healthcare system.  His capabilities and those of the Minister and Mr. Watt have been shown in how we are world leaders with our vaccination roll-out.  It is a great source of pride for this country and we can hold our heads high.  I commend the witnesses and their teams on their excellent work in that regard.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Perhaps they have been touched on.  When the witnesses were making their contributions, I was delayed at another meeting, so I apologise if they have answered them.  Did Ms Magahy or Professor Keane ever alert the Minister to the fact that matters were so serious in their eyes that they were going to tender their resignations?  Was he given any advance notice of their decisions?</p></speech>

He and I were at a SIAC meeting.  When I took office, I met SIAC to thank its members for their work.  I am open to correction if I have this wrong, as I am going from memory, but the next communication I had was the resignation letter.</p> <p>  Ms Magahy and I worked approximately four offices away from each other.  We worked on many issues together.  We had great ambitions, and still have great ambitions, together from Healthy Ireland to advanced nurse practitioners, from elective hospitals to waiting lists.  It was Ms Magahy whom I asked to put together all of the work for the multi-annual waiting list plan.  She did an excellent job.  She led the work on the electives.  She and I spoke regularly.  Through our meetings, did she raise frustrations about this or that not moving fasting enough?  Undoubtedly.  Regarding her resignation, though, the first I was aware that it had escalated for her to that level was when she came to tell me she was resigning.</p></speech>

As I said, though, Ms Magahy and I are colleagues.  We have worked closely together over the past year and a half on any number of important issues.  I have no doubt that she would have shared frustrations with me and I would have shared frustrations with her.  As Mr. Watt mentioned, debate, teasing matters out and expressing our frustrations with things that are or are not happening is normal enough.  I want to be fair to Ms Magahy, as it is of course the case that she raised frustrations-----</p></speech>

They both added a great deal of value.  Professor Keane chaired an advisory group that reported to Ms Magahy and Ms Magahy led on the electives.  I asked her to lead on the waiting list plan, where she did excellent work.  She led on the 112 projects, including Healthy Ireland.  Recently, she and I had an exciting meeting about something we will launch after the budget, funded for this year, around tackling health inequalities in the community.  She and I were doing a great deal of work together and I was very sorry to see her go.  However, it is important to say that we all move on from jobs.  She has added extraordinary value and has done her country a great service in the work she did in that office.</p></speech>

If there is resistance from within and the resistance has not gone away, or we have not been told where it has been sent - and, in reply to a previous question, the people resisting have not gone to Coventry and are, therefore, still there - can I take it that the pausing of the process may have been seen by some as a means to stall the process and reverse it?  Is that true?</p></speech>

It is a pretty reasonable question but not one I can answer.  I do not know what others may have thought of the matter.  All I can tell the Deputy is that the decision was taken for operational reasons to manage risk.  I believe that it was absolutely the right decision and that the results of that are seen in how the HSE has responded with the vaccination programme, testing and tracing and everything else that has gone on over the past 18 months.  Is it possible that people thought as the Deputy has suggested?  I guess it is, yes.  Maybe they did, but I do not recall anyone expressing such a view to me.</p></speech>

The reality is that plans were advanced, implementation was paused for the reasons we have discussed, and the detailed planning continued and continues now.  I have set up an advisory committee to provide those of us involved with an external view.  I have set up the most senior team possible in terms of the ongoing implementation towards universal healthcare, of which regionalisation is one part.</p></speech>

It would be normal to presume that any slowdown in the progress in that area would lead to difficulties, and it obviously did.</p><p>Arising from the frank exchanges, did it become obvious that some members of the implementation group were getting disenchanted and were disillusioned?</p></speech>

If we are talking about creating a single management structure for the patient pathway from the home through to the acute, from cradle to grave as it were, there are many stakeholders.  There is the Sl&aacute;intecare programme team, which has been doing much of the policy work.  There are myself and the Cabinet, senior officials in the Department and senior officials in the HSE.  There are many different people involved in this, but certainly all the conversations I had in the Department, politically, with the HSE and, indeed, on the front lines are for a very strong buy-in to integrated care, which is what this is all about.  The problem has been that, for example, the community does not have funding for a home care package so somebody has to stay in hospital, which is bad for the patient and bad for the hospital.</p></speech>

Can the Minister give a firm undertaking now that it is intended to proceed with the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan forthwith, that it will not be further impeded and that there will be no changes to the original intention of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan in terms of the delivery of services?</p></speech>

There is an indication from a number of senior stakeholders in the system, to such an extent that they resigned.  Obviously, they resigned due to disappointment, whether it related to frank exchanges, pockets of resistance or whatever.  That is a fact.  I asked the question about where the resisters were now, and nobody knows where they are.  They could still be buried in the system and could continue to obstruct and frustrate progress on Sl&aacute;intecare into the future.  I do not know.  However, the Minister can direct.  He is going to form a new board now and, presumably, that board will take directions from him.  It is time to let the committee and the stakeholders know exactly what will happen in the future.  Will there be changes?  Are some of the proposals set out in Sl&aacute;intecare going to be reversed?</p></speech>

The sole focus of this Government, the Department of Health and the HSE in healthcare is universal healthcare.  That is it.  There are three elements to universal healthcare.  One is affordability, and we are moving on that.  We are also moving on access and clinical quality.  That is what defines universal healthcare.  If we were meeting now and half of the Sl&aacute;intecare projects were not being implemented, if beds were not being added to the system, if GP diagnostics was not being rolled out, if advanced nurse practitioners were not being ramped up and if real activity was not happening, I would absolutely say this committee should be pushing and saying that it needs a commitment that things are going to get better.  I am saying there is an absolute commitment.  As I said previously, I believe this is the single most important project for our country.  I am totally committed to it, and I am in charge politically of its implementation.  We have a 97% rate of implementation from the Sl&aacute;intecare office.  Across the board we have added record levels of additional capacity this year.  We are moving on affordability and record investment in clinical quality.  That shows a Government that is absolutely committed, is investing and is delivering.  That is the starting point.</p> <p>  On top of that, am I making additional changes to go further and faster?  Yes, I am.  I am appointing the most senior team possible to ongoing implementation.  That team reports directly to me and I report directly to the Oireachtas, this committee and the Cabinet on that.  I hope that we will have a very favourable budget package that will focus on our priorities with regard to capacity, reform, women's health, access and clinical quality.  I am absolutely committed and, yes, I have made some very significant additions to the work that is already taking place to ensure we move as quickly as we can towards the goal of universal healthcare.</p></speech>

Regarding what we are hearing this morning, there are two narratives.  There is the narrative of those who resigned that there was resistance.  The Minister and the Secretary General are saying that we are on track, with 97% progress and so forth.  People were asked about where the resistance is coming from and the Minister and his officials are saying that there was no resistance or that if there was, they are not aware of it.  That is the conundrum for this committee.  I presume that if we can get some of the people who resigned before the committee, we will get a better sense of what was happening.  The only real answer we got this morning was that any cause of delay was basically down to Covid-19, and that if there was a resistance at all it is down to Covid-19.  Am I correct in that summary so far?  The Minister is not aware of where the resisters are.  Are they in the HSE or in the Department of Health?</p></speech>

Whatever resistance there may be, it typically would not be aired in front a Minister.  Let us be clear about that.  Would there have been and is there resistance within the system to large-scale programmes of reform, including this?  Of course, there will be.  If we were engaged in large-scale reform in the Oireachtas, there would be resistance.  There also would be resistance in companies.  People resist loss or perceived loss.  When the ambition for reform is as big as ours is for the healthcare system, of course there will be people worried, scared or threatened by that and who do not agree with it.  I want to be clear.  I am not suggesting for a moment that every single person across the health system is lined up, shoulder to shoulder, reading through the committee report and saying, "This is how I am going to do it".  That is not how it works.  Of course, there will be resistance.  Do the Sl&aacute;intecare team and the director, Mr. Patterson, encounter resistance to change within the system?  I bet they do.  Of course, they do.  Anybody who is trying to drive large systemic change comes up against resistance.</p> <p>  We can take that as a given in any ambitious programme of reform.  The question that is most important for me is: is whatever resistance may be there slowing us down and is it making us fail on behalf of men, women and children in this country?.  To answer that question, I have to return to the Sl&aacute;intecare progress report I get.  It says 97% were on track or on track with minor issues.</p><p>That was in the report I got.  When I ask that question, of course there will be resistance.  However, is the change happening because ultimately that is all that matters?  The answer l have is the score of 97%.  If any of us, in any aspect of life, was handed a progress report with a 97% figure, we would be able to see a lot of change happening.  There are areas where more needs to be done.  We have talked about ehealth, for example.  We are laggards in ehealth and have to do more on that.  We have talked about regionalisation at length here.  My view is that it was paused for the right reasons, and we are now moving on that again.  The third project in the report was waiting lists.  We have an ambitious plan of work on waiting lists.  That is what is happening.</p><p> As I said to Deputy Durkan earlier, if I had come here today to account to the Oireachtas, with Mr. Watt, as the Accounting Officer, and the Oireachtas said to us that it had allocated us &euro;1.2 billion, but we had not added the beds, the people, or the diagnostics, we would be having a different conversation.  However, that is not the case.  As Deputy Cullinane pointed out, the money has not all been spent, and we all understand why that is.</p><p> I was handed a report from my project team giving a 97% score.  At the same time, the HSE has reported back to me about record numbers on beds, staff, diagnostics, and on all of these areas.  Therefore, while we can all say this bit or that bit has not been done, I think in the round, we have to accept the overwhelming evidence that not only is change happening and progress is being made, it is being made at measurable record levels.  That is my sense, although I do not want to give the impression that I have come in to say that there is no resistance anywhere.  Of course, there will be resistance, as there is always resistance to big, ambitious change.  However, it is not slowing us down.  I would argue that we are going faster than ever.</p></speech>

The Minister has not asked the members to stay on, so it has clearly run its course.  The advisory committee for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare has run its course.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</p></speech>

By its own terms of reference it was coming to an end.  I want to acknowledge that some members of the group sought an extension.  We will have a more focused version of the advisory committee.  We will have a smaller group.  It will be focused on the issue on which we have spent most of our time today, which is regionalisation.  That group will be important in giving a perspective from a group of people who are not at the centre of implementing that change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-06a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021100600002#Q00400"><p>The Minister is talking about some of the issues with Sl&aacute;intecare, such as the waiting lists.  We are talking about 900,000 people on a waiting list.  Part of the difficulty in dealing with that will be that Minister will have to buy in private elements.  Sl&aacute;intecare was supposed to be moving towards a one-tier rather than a two-tier system.  The difficulty is that most people who are looking for medical supports or to get into the system see that if they try to get an MRI, for instance, there is a long waiting list.  Their only other option, then, is to go the private route for their MRI.  We are still at that level.</p> <p>  We will be bringing in BreastCheck shortly given the month that is in it and so on.  At one time, if a woman had her breast removed, she could have reconstructive surgery within six months.  Now there is a waiting list of two years.  The delays are occurring right across the health service.  A lot of that is down to Covid-19 and I accept all that.</p> <p>  The implementation committee said it had to resign because of resistance and so on.  People are not seeing the roll-out of services.</p> <p>  The Minister said that Ireland is a laggard in relation to the ehealth and that we have old and antiquated systems.  Is there any movement on the individual health identifiers, IHI?  I imagine that should be standard practice across the service, if we are talking about tackling lists.  It is all the more challenging if we have multiple people on them.  How many of the individual systems are still running on the operating system, OS, which is out of support and is vulnerable to cyberattack?  The Minister might come back to the committee another day in relation to that, as part of this report.</p> <p>  The biggest challenge we face are waiting lists which are getting longer.  The Minister started off this morning by saying that he is being ambitious, and he mentioned the increase in number of ICU beds.  Yet, a report from the HSE, going back to 2009, talked about a goal of 579 ICU beds.  There are currently only 321 beds.  We were talking about that years ago.  Covid-19 has shown the weaknesses in our system.  Clearly, one of those weaknesses is the number of ICU beds.  The additional numbers of beds are, of course, welcome.</p> <p>  While I will not speak on the behalf of other members of the committee, we are all concerned about why there have been so many resignations from the high-level advisory committee, because the members feel as though there is a resistance to change.  I do not get a sense from the questions that were posed to the Minister this morning, or from the answers that we received, that we are any nearer to finding out who those resistors are, what they are resisting, and what is the reason for the pushback.</p> <p>  I wish the Minister well with his new implementation committee.  Will he use those people who have that experience as part of the new advisory committee moving forward?</p></speech>

I believe there are ten minutes each for myself and Deputy Shortall.</p> <p>  This been a long meeting.  We started the meeting by trying to get answers as to why these people resigned, because these are key people.  Second, we wanted to get answers as to whether we were on the right track in relation to healthcare reform.  Leaving testy exchanges and differences opinion we might have in the committee aside, many people looking in at this committee, or even people who are not looking in because they are working in healthcare, or are one of the 900,000 people who are on a waiting list, might see the healthcare service as not working for them.  They feel that the healthcare service does not work for them and that their experience with it is not a good one.  If they get into the health system, it is a great experience, but it is getting in that is the problem.  They are concerned about what we are going to do, what our next steps will be, and what big changes we will see in healthcare.  That is the starting point for me.  Far too many people do not see the public health service working for them.  This is why the Oireachtas made a commitment to create a single-tier health service for universal healthcare.  One of the first things the Minister said in his opening remarks was that we are a long way away from universal healthcare, which we are.</p> <p>  My commitment is to work with everybody, including those Government and people in the system, to make universal healthcare happen.  However, when people resign from the programme that is designed to bring those changes on the scale that they have been resigning, and when these people are in senior positions, it calls into question in public's mind, at least, whether or not there is something more fundamentally wrong.  If one listens to what the Minister and Mr. Watt have said today, there is to some degree an air of bewilderment and puzzlement as to why these people resigned.  The Minister has given us his view as to why they resigned.</p> <p>  If I am reading this right, the Minister said that given that progress was made, there was an air of puzzlement or bewilderment as to why Ms Magahy and Professor Keane, in particular, stepped away from their positions.  Would that be a fair assessment of the Minister&rsquo;s view? </p></speech>

I was surprised and I was genuinely disappointed.  Of course, frustrations have been discussed.</p><p>We are all involved in something important, big and difficult, namely the move to universal healthcare.  Ms Magahy has added tremendously to that process so, yes, I was surprised.  What I have been able to share today, in the context of why any of us does anything, was what was shared with me.  There may have been other reasons, but I can only share what was shared with me.</p></speech>

It is more important than ever now for us to hear from these people.  A standing invitation has been issued to many of the people to whom we have referred.  We will have to revisit this issue next week.  Returning to some of the things said on the public record, however, let us start with Laura Magahy.  She was quoted saying that there had been "&ldquo;slow progress in three key areas requiring dedicated, focused, reform effort: [regionalisation]; ehealth; and waiting lists".  Does the Minister share Ms Magahy's concern in that regard?  Does he agree that there has been slow progress in those areas?  </p></speech>

On waiting lists, those were too big before the arrival of Covid-19, they are much bigger now and we have a serious and funded plan in place until the end of this year in that regard.  We are seeking funding through the budget process for next year.</p></speech>

He continued by saying that it was clear that, "our advice is no longer required, valued or respected".  He has now gone, as have several other people.

Turning to Ms Ro&iacute;s&iacute;n Molloy, one of the patient advocates, she expressed concern that the Government will implement a "diluted version" of Sl&aacute;intecare.  She continued by saying, "I need to know how the people that convinced me to stay, through expressing so much conviction and belief in the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, could somehow, in a short space of time, walk away.  What obstacles led them to this position?&rdquo;.  Would the Minister agree with her analysis?</p></speech>

He was one of the people on the advisory council.  He is gone now, but he said that he was "not surprised but disappointed" regarding the new group now being set up.  He went on to say that ultimately the council had been "set up to monitor and comment on the ongoing implementation of the totality of this Sl&aacute;intecare report" and that "Members of the council [...] view progress as impossible because of the lack of governance and accountability and commitment".  Mr. Doran continued by saying that "we now have a Minister", and I assume that he is talking about Deputy Donnelly-----</p></speech>

Yet what we are hearing from the Minister and from Mr. Watt, and I said this earlier, is that there is nothing to see here in respect of the fundamental concerns expressed by the people to whom I have referred.</p> <p>  I turn to one element of the reforms, universal GP care.  This will be relevant to Mr. Watt as well because I am sure that he oversees the responses to parliamentary questions.  I submitted a parliamentary question seeking information on the cost of this reform and how it will be done.  The response stated: "Such a calculation would require a complex and detailed modelling exercise to account for a range of demographic changes, future projections of service demands and variation in the number of GPs and allowances that could be paid".  It was also stated that "It is not possible to give an estimate of the cost of extending GP care".  I will put myself in the Minister's position and ask how anyone can reasonably provide answers here if that modelling has not been done.   How can the Minister give us any confidence that we are going to deliver universal GP care in the timeframe that was agreed?  How can the delivery of universal GP access be guaranteed if the Department has not done the modelling in respect of demographic changes, the increase in demand which might arise as a consequence and the additional number of GPs that will be needed?  How is that telling me that the Department and the HSE are serious about the provision of universal GP care?  I ask that question in the context of being the leading Opposition spokesperson on health and not even being able to get a cost and an estimated timeframe concerning how long it would take to do that because, as the answer to my parliamentary question stated, the requisite modelling has not been done.  </p></speech>

We are still far away from that, however, let alone anything else.  I have one last point.  I ask the Minister to hold the line on public-only contracts for consultants.  That is the core of this issue for me.  We need a centralised referral system and an integrated waiting list management system.  There are things that can be done and the Minister will get the support of the Opposition if he makes the right changes.  I fundamentally believe that if we do not make those changes, then we are always going to have a two-tier system where people are treated unfairly.</p></speech>

That is a reasonable thing to say about last year, even though the people who were charged with doing the detailed planning for regionalisation were different people.  They were not involved in the response to Covid-19 at all.  Whatever about last year, then, on 12 May this year the Minister launched the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023.</p><p>What was contained in that plan was that progress would be made on the development of the business case and submission to Government in quarter 2 this year, there would be detailed scoping of the process for the regionalisation plan in quarter 3 and quarter 4 would involve commencing implementation of RHAs and change management programme in line with the Government decision.  In May 2021, the Minister announced that the Government had decided to go ahead with regionalisation and set out a clear timescale for quarter 4 this year, which we are now into.  The Government was to commence implementation.  What happened between May and now?  </p></speech>

We were supposed to be on track, he announced that we were on track and now it seems we are not.  There are certainly grounds for understanding why all the people who have resigned were saying the same thing.  The fact that we are not on track regarding what the Minister set out as the regionalisation plan would give credence to the concerns expressed by various people involved.  What happened at the meeting with the representative group from the advisory council last Wednesday that resulted in Professor Anthony O'Connor tendering his resignation immediately afterwards?</p></speech>

Other people involved in that meeting included one particular patient advocate.  A lot of thought went into the make-up of that advisory group, which represented people across the board and the different interests in health.  This morning, the Minister tells us that he is setting up various groups.  They seem to be mainly staff groups, which is fine.  There should be provision for staff involvement in this.  Where is the voice of the patient in all of this?  At least two people, if not more, were chosen for the advisory council as patient advocates.  Where does the Minister see the voice of the patient being brought into all of this?</p></speech>

Surely the patient's voice and the public's voice should be heard but the Minister has made no provision for that.</p></speech>

It was my amendment to the establishment of the HSE board that looked to include patient voices and indeed front-line clinical voices as well so I agree fully with the principle.  However, it is not the purpose of this advisory group.</p></speech>

We had learned from the experience in Scotland where the Scottish Government took over one private hospital and was building a second to be elective-only hospitals so that we could make quick progress through the waiting lists.  What happened to that proposal?  It has now been downgraded to three day hospitals rather than fully functioning elective hospitals.</p></speech>

When I discussed this with the Sl&aacute;intecare team because the local clinicians have a different view and want inpatient beds, the rationale I was given was that these elective hospitals are about seeing as many patients as possible.  The problem with emergency departments is that it throws all that off-----</p></speech>

A surgeon arrives for his or her list on a Monday morning and all the patients are there.  However, they need beds at the far side of the operating theatre but because there is a finite number of inpatient beds, they are not there and the list has to be cancelled.</p></speech>

It related to excessively long waiting lists for procedures such as hip and knee operations, which predominantly require inpatient care.</p></speech>

No final decisions have been made.  It is an ongoing debate and I am receiving strong views from two different groups.  One is the Sl&aacute;intecare team, which is saying it should be day case only, while the other is the clinical community and now the Deputy today, who are saying it should be inpatient as well.</p></speech>

The Department of the Taoiseach cannot implement universal healthcare.</p></speech>
