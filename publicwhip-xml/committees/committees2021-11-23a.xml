It looks to me that regardless of whatever court process, resolution or victory fishermen may have through this process, the fishermen will still have the penalty points on their licence.  That is a very significant issue here.  The last day we spoke about the unfairness of the situation where a fee has not been set yet for a fisherman who wants to appeal a decision.  I tried to get the Taoiseach to intervene but he does not want to do so either.  It looks like it will be a decision for the Minister of the day as to what fee will be charged if a fishermen wants to appeal a wrongful decision being made.  It is a terrible situation to think fishermen are going to face the highest court in the land to fight their case, perhaps in a very genuine situation.  They will also find themselves in a situation where they will not know how much it will cost them to appeal the decision in the High Court.  This is totally at the discretion of the Minister who can say from &euro;5 to &euro;500,000, if he or she wants to.  That has to be resolved before anybody or any politician can support this.</p><p>Fishermen are exasperated.  I have spoken to them, including over the weekend, about the situation they find themselves in on many fronts.  The Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is obviously a breaking point for many of them.  It is almost a year since Brexit was agreed between Michel Barnier and Lord Frost but no work has even begun between the Government&rsquo;s civil servants and fish producer groups on this critical Common Fisheries Policy review.</p><p>Fishermen are angered and have a right to be.  Since the disastrous Brexit decision we are spending the bulk of our time on seeing how we can bring the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill through the D&aacute;il.  Instead of sitting around at these committee meetings to see if we can get a better deal for the fishermen in regard to quotas, their livelihoods and overturning some of the decisions the task force seems to have agreed on in respect of the decommissioning of vessels, which is another issue in itself, we are here talking about the High Court and the wording and we not even being able to establish how much the fishermen who appeal their decisions will be asked to pay for their appeal.</p><p>These issues are causing so much disquiet among the fishing industry that the recent report drawn up by the task force is not being supported by the Irish South and West Fish Producer's Organisation, led by Patrick Murphy, and rightly so.  He sees the destruction of the fishing industry in this country and that there is little or no hope at present.  Unfortunately, we in the D&aacute;il are pandering to this rather than spending hours fighting to get extra quota for fishermen and seeing if there are any opportunities are out there?  Have we thrown in the towel?  That is what we should be focusing on instead of spending time on the final minutes of another nail in the coffin of Irish fishermen.</p><p>Regardless of a fisherman's innocence in respect of the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, as I have said often enough, if they are caught, they do not even know how much they are going to be charged if they take a case?  If they take a case, are they still going to have the points added to their licence afterwards?</p><p>I mentioned Patrick Murphy.  With the indulgence of the Chairman, he might give me a few seconds to express my sincere sympathies to Patrick and his family on the death of his father, Danny Murphy, who had a serious accident a few days before his death.  He was another great man of the sea.  This is an upsetting enough time but I would like to express my sympathy to Patrick who has appeared before the committee on many occasions.  The passing of his father in the past couple of weeks has been sad.</p><p>I will certainly be pressing this amendment.  I plead with the Minister to consider our amendments.  It looks like no amendments I, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others will put forward will be agreed to.</p><p>Nobody was listening to us either 12 months ago, and we saw the disaster that led to with the shocking deal for Irish fishermen.  It now looks like the only deal on the table is decommissioning, after a task force was set up to look at the future of Irish fishing.  If that is the future for Irish fishing then the industry is damned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#B00200"><p>When the Minister was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture and food, his colleague, the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, was the spokesperson on the marine.  As the Minister knows well, he had serious problems with the penalty points system that was being introduced in a statutory instrument by the then Minister, Deputy Creed.  He worked with the industry to try to find a formula that would be reasonable and fair.  The industry is not opposed to penalty points being introduced.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, spoke in the D&aacute;il in the annulment debate where the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, put forward the annulment motion and he supported it.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, now Taoiseach, and other colleagues of his supported it.  For the first time in the history of the State a statutory instrument was annulled.  That was the right course of action considering that the Supreme Court and the judicial system had found what was put forward previously as repugnant to people's rights and our laws.  That was the stance the Minister took at that time and it was the right one.</p> <p>  The then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, worked with the industry and put forward changes that would be fair and balanced, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in its wisdom, continued on that path again.  This time, the Taoiseach, who was the acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, introduced pretty much the same penalty points system as Fianna F&aacute;il had voted down in opposition and now we have this legislation which is in the same spirit.  The fundamental issues are that any person in this country should have a right to be presumed innocent and not be charged with an offence unless it is beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the threshold that is there in law to protect citizens, but what we have stated here is the "balance of probabilities", and the problem with that phrase is that it captures the cultural attitude of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other people who work for the State towards fishermen.  They are presumed to be committing offences and if, on the balance of probabilities, we can find them guilty, we will convict them.  It is a shocking state of affairs.  I do not believe we would accept citizens being treated like that anywhere else in Europe, in particular people who have to risk their life to earn a living.  Fundamental anger is caused by this legislation.</p> <p>  If a case is taken to a court of law and an appeal is made and the person is successful, the points still remain in place.  I have given the Minister an analogy previously.  If any citizen is charged with a speeding offence and issued with provisional points subject to appeal and the appeal is successful, yet the points remained on the licence, could the Minister imagine the outrage, but that is how we want to deal with fishermen?  What my amendment speaks to is the barrier to their right to appeal.  The Minister cannot be immune to the anger in the fishing community.  He has done online town hall meetings and a physical tour of harbours.  He is meeting with fishermen on an ongoing basis.  He knows how they feel and the anger at the weighing system on piers and harbours, which again was the outworking of a cultural attitude to fishermen that they are criminals.  Now we have this arbitrary system in place, which I hope will be reversed very soon.  We have a culture in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority which I hope to God changes very soon.  One has to work with any industry.  I accept there must be regulation and a penalty points system, but they must be fair and balanced, as all laws have to be.  That is what we are getting wrong here.</p> <p>  I do not think the Minister is going to accept any Opposition amendments and that he is going to ram the Bill through Committee Stage today, he will ram it through on Report Stage and proceed on the path he is on.  I ask him to take on board what I say to him today.  He should know from all the meetings he is having that there is a real sense from the inshore fleet, the offshore fleet, the approximately 2,000 boats we have in the fleet around the island, that they are being criminalised.  They are being viewed as criminals.  They feel constant anxiety about what they are doing.  That is wrong.  This legislation gets the balance terribly wrong.  The Minister knows that in his heart.  He took the right decision at the time with the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher.  This is the wrong approach now.</p> <p>  That is the commentary I want to put to the Minister today.  I appeal to him to change direction.  If he does not do so today, I appeal to him to reflect on the debate today and to change direction.  Many good people in the fishing industry are speaking to him and telling him this.  He should listen more to them and less to the departmental officials who are advising him.  That is the best favour I can do him, to advise him to listen more to fishermen around the coast about their real-life experience and less to the departmental officials who advise him, because to be frank about it, they are completely out of touch with fishing communities.  I have discussed the amendment.  I will not take the opportunity again to talk about the wider problems with the Bill and will focus on dealing with each amendment in turn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#B00300"><p>I will speak to the technical details relating to the two amendments.  To accede to Deputy Collins's amendment No. 16 and to confer on the Minister the role of final arbiter in the context of the masters' points system would be to risk politicising decision-making in a manner that is in my opinion contrary to good practice.</p> <p>  The determination panel and appeals officer have both been established to deal with serious infringements which attract points.  The Bill allows for a master to apply to the High Court regarding a decision of the appeals officer on a point of law only, which the Minister of the day is in no position to determine.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister, as opposed to the High Court, to determine a matter after the independent determination panel and appeals officer have already adjudicated on it.   This would take the independent evaluation and decision-making back into a political realm and is completely contrary to best practice of having serious infringements determined on an objective and impartial basis overseen from a legal perspective by the courts.  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment for these reasons.</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 17 proposed by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, in the context of the licence holder's points system, as provided for under SI 318/2020, it was suggested by the industry that the licence holder should have a right to a full rehearing of the case before the High Court.  The legal position is clear that under the Constitution, the High Court has "full original jurisdiction" and can hear all matters of law brought before it.  The legal position is that it would be highly anomalous, if not unprecedented, to provide such a full High Court rehearing of a matter first governed by the procedures which were set down in the 2020 statutory instrument.  In addition, it would delay the application of points, which would run up against the timeline set down in the EU regulation that points apply for three years with a commencement date of the date of detection.  To that extent, it would hinder the effective implementation of this EU law and would not meet Ireland's obligations to implement these provisions.  The High Court retains a supervisory and review capacity, which provides for an appeal on a point of law to the High Court, which is entirely in keeping with statutory review and appeal procedures of this nature.  Accordingly, the legal position is that while the High Court retains the constitutional authority to enjoy full original jurisdiction over any legal proceedings, this authority has been circumscribed by the specific appeals mechanisms set down in primary and secondary legislation, which overwhelmingly limit just High Court appeals to reviews on a point of law.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment for those reasons.</p><p> To take it in the round, particularly given the points made by the Deputy, as he knows, the introduction of these statutory instruments has been subject to a comprehensive process, including rigorous assessment in the D&aacute;il.  As he also said, there was the annulling of the previous statutory instrument and the subsequent tabling amendments for consideration coming out of that.  All of those amendments were considered in great detail to see if it was possible for them to be accommodated into the statutory instrument while introducing a statutory instrument that would have us compliant with our obligations as a control authority under the CFP.  Any amendments that could be accepted and accommodated were accommodated.  Any that were not accommodated were not accommodated because they would have undermined and made the regulations that are being brought into place non-compliant with our obligations.</p><p> We are the very final member of the common fisheries control area to introduce a penalty points system for licence holders and masters.  It is not that we are the best boys in class.  We are the last boys to deal with our obligations in this regard to the extent that enforcement proceedings have been commenced against us by the European Commission for not living up to our obligations under the CFP to have a penalty points system in place, and that our funding European funding has been suspended because we have not dealt with this issue.</p><p> The Deputy&rsquo;s party in opposition followed very much the lead of Fianna F&aacute;il at that time and again followed the lead in the various amendments that were proposed.  Those have all been considered in great detail, with some accepted, and those that have not been accepted were not accepted for very good reason.  It comes to a stage where decisions have to be made and things have to happen.  That is something that is a responsibility of being in government.  As the Deputy outlined in his contribution, it follows a comprehensive process, which was much too lengthy really, because it has left us in a position where this has gone on far too long, where we are not compliant and where funding has been suspended, and that must be addressed.  We must put in place a fair and equitable penalty points system that meets our obligations as a control authority.  That is the approach that was taken.  That is the reason the Taoiseach signed the statutory instrument, namely, to reflect the need for a penalty points system for licence holders, and that is why I am now bringing forward the legislation in regard to masters.</p><p> It has been extensively considered and teased out, and we are now at the endgame of having to introduce appropriate legislation that does the job.  It is open to the Deputy to propose that he would do otherwise.  It is open to him to give commitments that he would do something else were he in government.  We rarely hear him say that.  He criticises many things but never, ever lays his cards on the table as to what he would do and never makes commitments that might bind him.  It is open to him today to make a binding commitment as to what it is he would do if he had the opportunity in the future, and then to hold himself to that.  It is much harder to do that and to step up to the mark in terms of being responsible, than it is to simply oppose.</p><p> All of this has been given very significant and detailed consideration.  This is appropriate.  It is something I am bringing forward as Minister.  It is not appropriate or fair to be blaming anyone else for it or to blame the officials.  Again, it is an oft-used mechanism of opposition to blame someone else.  Every decision that comes forward from me as Minister is something that has been vetted, considered and put forward by me.  That is my responsibility and duty as Minister.  Again, as the Deputy outlined, this follows a comprehensive approach taken in regard to where we have got to today.  Each of the amendments that has been tabled has been comprehensively considered and the answers today will reflect all of that consideration.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, there was a letter from the industry.  When there was this hiatus between ministerial appointments and the Taoiseach signed this statutory instrument at, I assume, the request of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s senior officials, there was correspondence from the four major producer organisations in the State at that time, outlining their profound concerns about what had happened and that there needed to be changes.  Nothing was done about those profound concerns.  No changes were made to the statutory instrument at that time and this legislation reflects that.</p></speech>

Amendments were proposed and considered.  Some changes were made and some were not because the consideration was that they would not meet our obligations.  Again, as I said, it is open to the Deputy to outline clearly what he would do and what he is committing to do.  I do not hear any of that.</p></speech>

Here is the thing.  Given the speech the Minister gave during that statutory instrument annulment debate, people can see his position then and his position now.  This is our position.  We will be tested in government at some stage, hopefully, the sooner, the better, and certainly for the fishing community.  We will be tested on where we stand based on these amendments.  That is our position.  There they are.</p></speech>

The first stage is to put forward an appeal.  The Minister wondered whether it was going to be the &euro;25 that the Rural Independent Group put forward in our submission.  He did not have his mind made up at all before he came into the meeting as to what was going to happen.  At the end of the day, if a fisherman is going to go to the High Court, he needs to know he can afford to go to there.  If the Minister cannot, even at this stage, look at that type of an amendment and come in here beforehand to say he is accepting it or not, and that it is going to be &euro;100,000, &euro;10,000, &euro;5,000 or &euro;5, he has not comprehensively considered these amendments at all; rather, he has chucked them in the bin before he came in here.</p> <p>  I am astonished and many fishermen who have listened to this and their organisations are astonished.  We need change.  We need to go back to Europe.  There need to be laws but there need to be laws that are agreed to initially by the fishing industry in this country.  The Minister said we are the last boys in the class.  Let us be honest.  We were the first boys or the whipping boys in the class in the Brexit negotiations, and we got a fair whipping, of that there is no doubt.  Now, we need to be the last boys in the class.  We certainly do not need to comply with and pander to everything that Europe wants.</p><p>We need to be able to put in our own amendments here and our own safeguards for our fishermen who are fishing the waters.  They are in a dire situation as we speak.  The Minister has said these amendments in respect of the High Court have been comprehensively considered but I am in complete disagreement with that because I can see the way these amendments are just being thrown out one by one.  Regardless of what changes we ask for, the Minister is totally opposed to them.  I will definitely press these amendments because they are hugely important.  Changes need to be made to this before we take the legislation any further.  It is the first piece of work that has been done on fishing since the dreadful Brexit negotiations.  This is another dreadful thing for fishermen.  I will certainly not be in any way, shape or form supporting this.  I will be asking to go back and to support the fisherman on this one here.  We should go back out to Europe and fight for the Irish because as far as the fishermen are concerned, the fight is being lost.  That is my take on it. </p></speech>

Can the Minister tell me what other countries have implemented this legislation to back up the penalty point system?  What other country has used the words "beyond a reasonable doubt" in their legislation?  Is there any other example in Europe where they have used on the balance of probabilities?  To be clear, can the Minister point to another European country that has in their legislation said that the person can be convicted on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond a reasonable doubt?  Second, where did the phrase "on the balance of probabilities" come from?  Who came up with that phrase?  Why was "beyond a reasonable doubt" not used?  It is, as I am sure the Minister will agree, the international standard for conviction of an offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#D00300"><p>The penalty point system is supposed to be an administrative law system as opposed to a criminal law system.  The standard level of proof for civil law is the balance of probabilities.  The level of proof used for criminal law is beyond a reasonable doubt.  Across Europe and across the Common Fisheries Policy, the approach of the penalty point system is supposed to operate in parallel to the criminal law.  Somebody, for example, who gets a penalty point could also be subject to, depending on the severity of the offence, a criminal proceeding.  In a criminal proceeding, the threshold is beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, this is not a criminal system.  This is an administrative law system.  Therefore, the appropriate benchmark for that is "on the balance of probabilities".  That is certainly the terminology that is used in our systems in Ireland.  Across the board, other member states all have their own definitions as to what applies to administrative law, criminal law etc.  They will apply that as appropriate to their particular systems.</p></speech>

The UK has a common law system similar to our own.  The Minister will appreciate that I am not trying to be a smart alec here and  I know he cannot have every possible answer at his disposal.  However, his colleague might want to avail of the opportunity to speak.  The UK has a common law system.  Has the UK introduced a penalty point system?</p></speech>

Perhaps, if we cannot get the answer today, it could be sent on to committee members.  To be clear, I am asking about Britain and the Common Fisheries Policy, before they left the European Union.  Did the system they have in place refer to the balance of probabilities?  They have a similar legal system to Ireland so I make a comparison.  I want to know if there is anywhere in the European Union now, or had Britain implemented it before, where on the balance of probabilities is specified, rather than beyond reasonable doubt?  That is the big issue.  Fishermen see that as being treated differently from every other citizen.</p></speech>

This would run in parallel to the criminal system.  They are the appropriate benchmarks in our country for that.  Obviously, if one were to introduce a threshold which was particular and appropriate to the criminal law system - which uses beyond a reasonable doubt - and introduced it into the civil law system, it would be a threshold that would not be standard for an administrative system.</p></speech>

That is a pretty severe sanction.  Obviously, it would impact on their reputation if they were issued with penalty points.  There are all sorts of implications here.  It is quite a big deal.  I ask again, if this information can be given to the Minister, for him to articulate it to the committee, now or soon.  I want to establish if there is an example anywhere in Europe where a member of the European Union - or Britain before it left the European Union - implemented this legislation.  The Minister said we are the last to do it and that is regrettable.  It should not have to be like that.  However, is there an example where they use the phraseology "on the balance of probabilities"?   Was there any such phraseology used in any other country's implementation of these penalty points into its own laws?  I want to establish that because my understanding is that the international benchmark is "beyond a reasonable doubt".  I would like to know if any other country has breached that threshold, as we are doing here with this legislation.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, it is going through massive struggles.  We have put together a very bad sea-fisheries Bill.  We are tabling amendments to see whether we can clean up what is a mess.  It looks like none of the amendments will be accepted.  If they are not accepted the writing is on the wall.  I was aghast to see Deputies from the Government voting in favour of earlier amendments.  They were very much not rural Deputies.  I know it is a holiday time but certainly they did not know what they were voting for.  I heard one of them state he did not know much about agriculture.  This is about fishing and the marine.  It is a bad reflection on the Government that this is the attitude out there.  Marine has been the poor relation for many decades.  The proof of the pudding is the dreadful deal on Brexit that was agreed running into Christmas.</p><p>The balance of probability has come up here so many times.  Fishermen have said to me that it looks like the Bill will condemn fishermen because no matter whether they are innocent or guilty they will end up with penalties on their licence or on the licence of the skipper.  That is a very serious worry.  I am not at all in agreement with this Bill.  It could be renegotiated and we could get a better deal for Irish fishermen certainly after the raw deals we have got continually down through the years.  My amendment focuses on the need to change what has been agreed at government level with, I presume, Europe holding a stick over our heads once again in the fishing industry.  As much as &euro;400 million plus in blood money is earmarked to be spent across the fishing communities on projects ranging from pier upgrades to processing grants to aquaculture tie-up schemes.  All of the funding is to be taken from the &euro;1 billion EU slush fund out of the &euro;5 billion in total that has been set aside by the EU.  This paltry sum is designed to shut up the fishing industry as compensation for the theft of future billions of euro from Irish fishing communities and from the Irish people.</p><p> My amendment and the other amendments that I have put forward are meant to, in some way,  lift the burden from fishermen.  The offshore fleet has now been reduced to just over 100 boats so the waters are being cleared of Irish fishing vessels forever in preparation for the hundreds of foreign vessels that will replace them and fish away happily while plundering 85% or more of the pie.  This continues to leave our coastal fishing communities with just under 15% of all of the fish and it is patently clear that 15% is not enough for fishermen to survive.  It looks like this Bill will be foisted upon us so it will lead to further devastation and I will press my amendment.</p></speech>

At that time he was very critical of the Department and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  The big issue for him then was the balance of probability.  The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued.  At that point he was very much on the same page on which I am now and he clearly understood that this is a serious issue.</p> <p>  The amendment is a good one in that if a person has been successful in his or her appeal then penalty points should not be assigned.  I would love to get a comparison.  I have seen a document, which I  referred to during committee meetings on pre-legislative scrutiny, that compared the implementation of penalty points across the European Union.  Again, I put it to the Minister that I am not aware, but I could be wrong and I am happy to be proven wrong, of anywhere in the European Union where there is the potential for a person to lose their livelihood with a threshold of the balance of probabilities.  Indeed - and the Minister has talked about the fact that administrative law and criminal law run parallel with each other - one can take action if one feels it is serious enough in the criminal law system.  If a person wins his or her appeal then that would not lead to his or her points being removed.</p> <p>  This is a good amendment and I ask the Minister to return to the spirit that he demonstrated a couple of years ago on this issue.  At that time he was entirely right in his assessment and criticised the Department in the approach that it had taken at that time, and he said that its approach was a bad reflection on the Department.  I ask that the Minister accepts the amendment as it refers to natural justice in terms of the penalty points.  The Minister asked about the policy of Sinn F&eacute;in.  These points concern natural justice and should not be the subject of debate but, unfortunately, in this country fishermen are seen to be fair game, which is a situation that has been allowed to go on for too long. </p></speech>

This is one of the amendments which I find it very hard to believe the Minister or the Department has taken seriously.</p> <p>  The amendment is simple.  The earlier amendment set a target of just &euro;25 for the cost of lodging an appeal.  Now, we are saying if someone wins his or her appeal in the High Court that his or her penalty points will not be taken off his or her licence.  All we want is for fishermen and fisherwomen to be treated fairly and in the exact same way as any other citizen in this country.  I mean if I win my appeal in the High Court against fines imposed against me then the penalty points would be struck off but in this stance we are talking about points being left on a licence for three years.  Like Deputy Mac Lochlainn, I ask the Minister to rethink and implement this fair amendment that has been tabled by Deputy Collins.</p></speech>

In essence, the High Court already has the power to do what is proposed by the amendment tabled by Deputy Collins.  The court has a wide discretion in this regard and the amendment, if adopted, would have the effect of restricting or limiting the role of the High Court.  In this context, it is not open to the Minister of the day or, indeed, the Government to do this.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Such portals are used throughout other parts of my Department to communicate with customers.  These electronic portals facilitate more secure transmission of communications, including multifactor authentication, which is the highest standard of data security, to customers where they must log in to the portal to receive a message.  Such portals also provide an appropriate audit trail for customer and user engagement and allow for improved management of customer relations more generally, as well as facilitating team-based management of customers.  Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 are consequential drafting amendments to amendment No.19, while amendment No. 22 provides for a necessary definition of &quot;electronic interface&quot;.</p></speech>

Regarding the operation of this mechanism and notice to and engagement with fishers, the objective will be to support them and to strengthen the capacity to engage in that regard.</p></speech>

A number of months ago, there was an attempted ramming of an Irish fishing vessel by a Spanish trawler near Castletownbere and there was no communication whatsoever available for the fishermen.  It was a terrible experience.  It took between 12 to 16 hours before the trawler that was causing the issue and fishing illegally was impeded.  Communication is a major issue.  It looks as if we are going to improve communication when it comes to imposing penalty points on a fisherman and that is the reason for the proposed amendments.  I would like the Minister to explain if there is any other way improvements in communications can be made along these lines to save the lives of fisherman and ensure that when they are threatened at sea by another boat that is illegally fishing that safeguards are in place.  We do not want to hear afterwards the Taoiseach denying he knew anything about it, everybody running scared and nobody giving a straight answer.  I would like the focus of the amendments to be on communications and safeguarding Irish fishermen.</p></speech>

It is important that we use modern tools and capacities in how we engage across the board with all citizens.  It is also important that the legislation we introduce facilitates that.  We want to provide easier means of communication for everyone across the board, especially for fishers when they are in challenging situations.  We do not want them in a situation where legislation obliges a means of communication that might not be as effective for them.  This is an appropriate amendment to ensure we can use the best possible means to communicate.  Ultimately, it is about improving communication and having all tools at the disposal of fishermen to make it is as easy as possible and to have information available.</p></speech>

Every amendment from Sinn F&eacute;in and the Rural Independent Group, which I represent, has been ruled out of order.  We find ourselves in a very unfair situation.  As I said earlier, this amendment provides for further discussion.  We are in a dire situation after a shocking Brexit deal that has inflicted the most horrendous cuts on the fishing industry.  To be honest, the industry is still mesmerised and shocked at the astonishing way we threw away our quota and pegged it out to the foreign fleets of the world.  It looked like, and I always said it in the D&aacute;il, Michel Barnier was doing a deal for France.  He truly proved that.  We should have had stronger engagement, and I pleaded for that to the previous Government many months before this Government took office.  Brexit was coming towards us and all the signs were negative with regard to what the Irish fishing industry was going to lose.  Up to the dying minutes I pleaded with the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to make sure that he forced an intervention, but we see the consequences of a poor judgment and a poor call.  Obviously, I congratulate Michel Barnier for cutting a deal for the French, but it is much to the demise of the Irish fishing industry.</p><p>As regards this amendment, we have to force discussion in the D&aacute;il and at committee level about the Brexit cuts and the quota for Irish fishermen into the future.  I read out some of the statements earlier and I do not wish to keep going back over what I said, but this Bill is a bad deal for Irish fishermen.  It is supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Fianna F&aacute;il was seemingly opposed to almost the same deal a few years ago, but has changed its mind now while in government and is railroading ahead with it regardless of what amendments we put forward.  Surely to God some of these amendments could have been better examined.  The Minister said earlier that there was comprehensive consideration of our amendments in detail but he continued to throw out each amendment brought before the House.  The very least we should get out of this is full debate in the future about the fishing industry in Ireland.  It is at the verge of collapse.  The best deal coming from the task force is decommissioning, which is shocking to say the least.  It is going to deplete the fishing industry further in Ireland.  All we seem to be doing is making way for foreign fleets to come to Ireland and take our fish out of our seas.  That is what it comes to.  That is the way it has been for the last number of decades.  Nothing has changed and things have got worse.</p><p>We are in the dying minutes of discussing these amendments.  I am very disappointed that the Government did not see fit to support any of our amendments even though they were meant to work with this difficult Bill.  All I can say is that we would have full debate in the D&aacute;il, as is provided for in this amendment, prior to this legislation coming into operation.  There are Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies from coastal communities who have not been seen here to answer for themselves.  They should be here and hold themselves accountable because they will have to knock on the doors of their constituents.  If they have failed, and the fishermen are telling me that they are failing, they will be run from the doors.  That is the bottom line here.  Many of these fishermen are now unemployed; many of them have lost their income.  Many of them are going to lose their boats, their future and their livelihoods.  That is what they know.  That is how they grew up and educated themselves.  They have been let down repeatedly by continuous governments, and this Bill is the death knell.  Decommissioning and everything else is being laid out on a pathway of destruction for the Irish fishing industry.</p><p>All I can say, and I am providing for this in the amendment, is that if we do not give more time to debate this prior to this legislation coming into operation, it will be a further infliction on the fishermen.  We might have a stay or reprieve in respect of this sea fisheries Bill.  We might be able to go back to Europe and forge a better deal for the fishing community.  It is time for Europe to understand that we will no longer be its whipping boy, which is what we have been.  I have spoken to the fishermen in Castletownbere, Union Hall, Glandore and throughout west Cork over the last number of years and particularly over the last six or 12 months.  In spite of visits from heads of state, nothing has happened.  They have seen not one improvement.  How can members of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael come here and continue to pound hardship on these people and have no solution?  All I am seeking is a solution.  Is anything going to happen to the bluefin tuna quota or will we have to talk about it for the next ten years?  Is there a general acceptance that Europe can get any quota it wants, but Ireland cannot get the quota?  What is wrong?  Where is the weakness here?  Do we need changes in the Department from the top to the bottom?  Do we need to look at the SFPA?  Where are the supports for the fishermen?  They have not been there to date, and the fishermen feel it and understand it.  They are losing their income.</p><p>Fishermen and fisherwomen were born, bred and reared to work their hands and work in the sea, and they have been terribly let down.  It is our richest resource and we seem to be damned to destroy the fishing industry.  We are attacking agriculture as best we can too, but today we are discussing fishing.  It surrounds me in my constituency.  I have inshore boats and pelagic fishermen.  They are losing their income and they are asking me what is there for them.  Decommissioning is not a way out.  That is only getting rid of the problem so that maybe we can lick up to the Europeans and tell them we have done our best to let them come in and take a bigger slice of the cake.  We must have further debate on this issue.  We need the Taoiseach to get personally involved on this.  This is what I am seeking in this amendment.  A full debate prior to the legislation coming into operation must take place.  It must be a detailed, not rushed, discussion on where we intend to take the fishing industry of this country and where its future lies.</p><p>Since Brexit was implemented last year, fishermen are saying no hour of work has begun between the Government, civil servants or the fish producer groups on the critical Common Fisheries Policy that is to come.  In all that 12 months, no hour of work has begun on looking at the future.  We are continuously locked into what we want to give away and what further difficulties we want to foist on our fishermen.  Deputies come in here and are quite happy to support all this.  Do they see the future?  Do they see any future in the fishing industry?  Is that gone and is it time to hit the agriculture industry?  That is where we are going.  When I knock on the doors I talk to people, and I continue to meet and talk to people.  The fishing industry is on its knees and it is pleading with the Government, regardless of what is the Government of the day, to make sure it tries to turn this around.  There is nothing in this Bill or in anything I see that will turn this around, other than decommissioning, decommissioning, decommissioning.  That is what the task force has come up with.  I am proud of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation for rejecting that task force report.  It was 100% correct.  Decommissioning is not the way forward.  We have enough seas.</p><p>We have enough fish in Irish waters to keep thousands of people employed.  Instead, we are wiped out.  We need to debate that and that is what this amendment is about.  It is about further debate.  Some Deputies that come in to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann know what fishing is about.  I certainly have a lot to learn.  I am not a fisherman but come from the agricultural sector.  In my time in the D&aacute;il, regardless of what parties are in power, there has been little or no debate on or understanding of how we can turn things around for the Irish fishermen and fisherwomen that local rural communities are totally dependent on.  We can decommission them, strike them off and make them unemployed, which is what the Government is going to do.  What is going on here in this House will never be forgotten.  I plead with my colleagues to accept this amendment and fully debate every detail of what is going on in the fishing industry, including the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the task force, the decommissioning and the quotas.  We hear so much about quotas but we are getting little or no quota.  All we are getting is wiped out through less quotas and fishermen are asking why.  What is wrong with the political system in this country that we cannot understand the richness of the resource that we have, our seas?  Is it the Department that is wrong?  Does it need changing from top to bottom?  What is wrong?  Why is there not a focus on this?  Why, when we are out in Europe negotiating, do we throw fishing to the wind and let it float its own boat?</p></speech>

Section 15 simply lays out the Long Title to the Bill.  All legislation should have some review procedure within it and some method of reporting on its operation over time.  That is vitally important and particularly so regarding the fishing industry.  We need to debate it because it is going through a very difficult time at the moment.  As Deputy Collins has said, in a couple of years' time we may not be having a debate at all because there will be nothing to talk about.  The Government's attitude to the fishing industry and its position on it is made clear by the &euro;66 million decommissioning scheme which will get rid of one third of the whitefish fleet.  From this point on, the fleet will only be two thirds of its current size and next year we may be talking about another decommissioning scheme.  That seems to be the height of the Government's response to, and focus on, the fishing industry which is sad and wrong.  It is doing a disservice to fishing communities right across the country.  The fishing industry has potential but only if the Government fights for it at European level to try to ensure that EU policies respond to our needs.  It is sad to say that, as Deputy Collins outlined, Mr. Michel Barnier seems to have fought hard on behalf of the French fishing industry but let Ireland down.  He was supposed to be negotiating on behalf of the entire EU.  For that reason, I am taking this opportunity to speak to this amendment.  It might not be in the right place but it should be accommodated in the Bill.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, this Bill cannot be taken in isolation.  The reaction of fishing communities to this Bill reflects their anger at the long-standing culture of not helping them to build their industry but of holding them back.  The approach that is taken in this legislation and by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, reflects a culture that is not replicated across Europe.  I do not believe there is the same level of enforcement and monitoring of other fishing fleets as we see with our own fleet by our own authorities.  Regulators and law enforcers have a job to do but there is a way of doing it which involves respecting the people they are working with, including them in what they are doing and agreeing an approach.  This is about the management of a precious resource.  Anybody with a brain knows that over-fishing is a damned stupid thing to do.  The resource has to be managed, nurtured and replenished but people are intelligent enough to see that under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, we have super trawlers around our coast hoovering up fish while the authorities are chasing inshore fishermen and challenging them on their practices.  Fishermen are looking out at cities of lights.  Famously, in the documentary "Atlantic", a fisherman refers to a super trawler as a "city out there".  These boats are 140 m. long; they are massive and are hoovering up fish while we talk about sustainability and enforcement.</p> <p>  As the Minister knows, our fishing communities are really intelligent.  Fishing is in their genes and is intergenerational.  These communities know that what they are being asked to do makes no sense when one looks at the bigger picture.  I understand there will be a debate in the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks on the seafood task force report and our approach to the CFP.  The Minister and the Government will be challenged to at least call out what is happening in terms of super trawlers and the fact that we get 15% of the fish under the CFP.  Under the quota system, we get 15% in our 200 mile exclusive economic zone.  Indeed, in a number of species, it is even more derisory than that.  We have a situation where we are going to decommission, potentially, another 60 boats of over 15 m. to 18 m., which means that the fleet will be dramatically reduced from 2006 levels.  This dramatic reduction is happening at a time when other European countries are investing in their fishing fleets.  Belgium, for example, stands out in that regard.  </p> <p>  We will get a chance soon to debate this at length in the D&aacute;il and all of us will contribute to that debate but the seafood task force report, from the perspective of our fishing industry, our catchers, is a white flag of surrender.  It demonstrates an unwillingness to confront the injustice that is happening.  We have the richest fishing grounds in all of Europe.  We are the only island nation in the EU right now.  We have a massive resource staring at us.  There are lots of Deputies on the Government side from coastal communities and I know they agree with me on this.  We have an immense resource but we are giving it away.  What we are doing goes against the principles of the European Union.  If we were to speak about what is happening in Ireland, not with the political decision makers or some of the huge corporations in the industry but with the average French, Belgian, Spanish or Dutch person, they would not agree with it.  I do not believe this is what they stand for but this is what is happening.  </p> <p>  All our fishermen can see is more and more barriers and difficulties and they are being driven out of the industry.  That is why a number of fishermen will probably avail of decommissioning because they do not see any future for themselves.  They do not see any future, which is terrible.  If one looks at the size of our fleet in 2006 in comparison with what it will be if fishermen avail of decommissioning, it is a terrible indictment of our country.  That is why this legislation cannot be taken in isolation and why Deputy Collins is right to ask that it be seen in the wider context.  We are asking for a change of direction from the Government.  We may not win the battle today but we will continue this dialogue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>Like me, he represents a coastal community.  In his heart, he knows that the points we are making are correct.</p></speech>

All the committee's amendments are being ruled out of order and are not being entertained.  That is very sad and very bad.</p> <p>  It is on record that it was the UK that first taught coastal communities how to fish back in the 1600s.  Since then, Irish fishermen have developed, modernised and kept coastal communities going through the years, decades and centuries.  Fishing has provided a living, sometimes part time and more often full time, all along our coasts.  All we can seem to offer fishermen now is to decommission them.  The Government is saying it can pay fishermen to cease and give up, but who will replace their income and employment in coastal communities?  This will have a devastating effect, for evermore, on those communities that depend so much on fishing for their livelihoods, whether it is the small shop, chemist, bed and breakfast or whatever, which all benefit in some small way.  </p> <p>  We are closing down one of the only things we have.  It is the same as closing down Bord na M&oacute;na.  This Government is closing down all the things we have and are good at; that will be its record.  The sad thing about it is that it is not just Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il individually but both of them together.  This is what is happening.  Every day we see that the only racket about fishing now is between the French and the UK.  That is where the fight is because they have something to fight about.  We have nothing to fight about except for the Government turning on our people and our own flesh and blood, who are trying to operate, do their jobs, earn a living and employ people.  All we do and all we offer is to decommission them.  We then further penalise them with penalty points.</p> <p>  I very much appreciate, from the bottom of my heart, what Pat The Cope Gallagher tried to do.  He was of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, but he got us to rescind the penalty points only a few months ago.  He left the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's chair, went to the back benches and put forward a Bill, which we all voted for, including Fianna F&aacute;il members who are voting for this penalty points system now.

I have been listening to the debate in my office all day and trying to do other things as well.  It has to be pointed out that Irish fishermen are only fishing 15% of Irish waters.  We all remember the great presentation they made when they came up the River Liffey.  They did that in the most ordinary and thoughtful way and gave their presentation outside the convention centre.  We will remember them forever but I do not think members of the Government listened or really care about them.  Even though they seemed to be talking to fishermen that day and seemed to want to listen to them, they did not take heed.  I am very sad we are going down the road of hurting them more with penalty points.  There will be a weighing system whereby Irish fishermen have to weigh their catches on the port or pier they come in to while foreign fishermen can load up their lorries and go home.  All that is wrong.</p></speech>

This technical Supplementary Estimate is required to make use of savings on the Department&rsquo;s Vote to provide for spend over several headings.  To allow a technical Supplementary Estimate to take place, a token &euro;1,000 will be added on to my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  No additional funding is being requested.</p><p>I propose moving &euro;49.8 million in savings across other subheads.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve changes to the original 2021 voted allocations, I believe that it is important to seek the members' input and approval.</p><p>The areas where savings have emerged reflect the dynamic and uncertain environment in which the sector and the Department have operated in this year.  Despite the continuing challenges of the pandemic and Brexit, we have continued to carry out our business as usual.  Since September 2021, more than &euro;960 million has been paid to farmers in respect of this year's basic payment and areas facing natural constraints, ANC, schemes.  The Department issues these advance payments at a rate of 70% and 85%, respectively, to farmers at the earliest date possible under EU regulations.  The remaining balancing payments at a rate of 30% and 15%, respectively, are due to commence in early December.  Payments under the sheep welfare scheme, the protein aid scheme and the straw incorporation measure are also due to commence in the coming weeks with the sheep welfare scheme due this week.  Targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, payments are ongoing, with some &euro;56 million paid to date this year.</p><p>I will outline where the savings, which we propose to use, have emerged, starting with the information management technology saving of &euro;5 million.  In December last year, the Department issued two new procurement competitions for the upgrade of the Department's core systems and the development of systems to cater for the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post 2022. </p><p>The incumbent company for the existing contracts was not successful in either of the two new procurement processes and initiated High Court proceedings in the matter.  This resulted in the Department not being able to source the additional resources identified for a significant lead-in period, circa five months in total, until the High Court proceedings were resolved as a result of the company withdrawing the proceedings.  This delay resulted in the Department being unable to progress system development as planned, which also had the effect of resources from other contracts not being taken on in both the number and at the time originally envisaged. </p><p>Savings of &euro;3 million in travel and incidental expenses have also been identified due to the reduction of the volume of travel undertaken by my Department during recent months understandably as a result of the pandemic.</p><p><b></b>Under the subhead B3 agri-environmental schemes, total current savings of &euro;21.35 million are being redistributed.  The savings set out below are offset by an increase in the subhead's capital allocation by &euro;2.5 million.  Some &euro;1.55 million of these savings arise from the organic scheme and &euro;22.3 million are from schemes due to be funded by the EU&rsquo;s recovery instrument funding, EURI.  Some &euro;56 million of EURI designated funding was provided in 2021 to cover a suite of new agri-environmental schemes, including a new organics scheme, a straw incorporation measure, new European innovation partnerships, EIPs, and for an environmental tranche of TAMs.  Funding for EURI schemes is provided by the Exchequer in the first instance, then reclaimed at a rate of 100% from the EU.  Commencement of these schemes was delayed until an amendment to the rural development programme could be fully approved by the European Commission, which did not happen until mid-year.  EURI funding is subject to what is known as the N+3 rule, which means it can be spent in the three years from the date of programming.</p><p>I assure the committee that the EURI funding will spent over the coming years and that the money available to farmers has not been lost.  The Exchequer funding attributed to these EURI schemes as part of the Vote will thus be utilised under other subheads.</p><p> In the areas of natural constraint, subhead B4, there are savings of &euro;1 million due to of the level of eligible claims received.</p><p> Under capital expenditure, my Department continues to operate the large on-farm investment scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II.  TAMS is made up of a suite of seven measures and was launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 with a budget of &euro;395 million over the full period of the rural development programme.  Payments under the TAMS II scheme continue to issue on an ongoing basis.  To date in 2021 we have issued payments of &euro;56 million.  However, there have been some impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on investment works, particularly building works, during the restrictions.  As a result, I am utilising a saving of &euro;3.3 million from the 2021 allocation to fund expenditure elsewhere.</p><p> My Department has actively encouraged all approved applicants under the scheme to submit payment claims including by contacting approved applicants individually by text message on a number of occasions and reminding approved participants to submit their payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  However, as TAMS II is a demand-led scheme, the timing of the completion of works and submission of payment claims within the timeframe set out in their approval letter are matters for the farmers themselves.  In general, participants have 12 months from the date of approval to complete works and submit a payment claim with a shorter timeframe of six months for the equipment involved.</p><p> Also on the capital side, we are seeking to move &euro;7 million in capital expenditure from the forestry allocation.  This saving has arisen because new planting has been much less than anticipated at the beginning of the year.  I am aware that the current licensing delays are a contributory factor to the reduced levels of planting.  We are addressing the current delays in a robust way with additional resources, a dedicated project plan and a reformed appeals system.  We are also looking at ways to re-engage farmers so that they see forestry not as a displacement activity but as complementary to their farming enterprise.</p><p> In the subhead B12, market volatility, a capital saving of &euro;300,000 has been identified.  Subhead C11, other services, has savings of &euro;2 million coming from a number of areas including savings on legal expenses.</p><p> Projected savings of &euro;4.9 million are available in the fisheries subhead.  Fisheries expenditure will be monitored on an ongoing basis over the remaining six weeks of the year to ensure spend is maximised in 2021.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority subhead has savings of &euro;2 million as a result of Covid-19 pandemic impacts on recruitment and travel.</p><p> Regarding how the reallocated funding will be used, utilising savings from TAMS and forestry this year will ultimately free up funding for 2022 as we prepay some commitments relating to next year now.  This will leave us better able to take on the many challenges that face the industry next year.  Some &euro;7.3 million of the capital savings described will allow my Department to provide access to finance.  Finance is a crucial business need and, as well as liaising with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, we work closely across Government to provide important supports for businesses, including farmers, fishers and food businesses.  Most recently this has been to ensure that they have access to finance during the pandemic and also to help deal with the challenges brought about by Brexit.  These supports have been delivered with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p><p> My Department co-funds the future growth loan scheme with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It supports strategic long-term capital investment by small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers and fishermen.  It has been in high demand and 1,595 loans or 46% were drawn down by the agrifood sector, with a value of &euro;235.8 million or 32% of the overall pot.  The transfer of &euro;7.3 million in my Department&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate will facilitate an advance payment for my Department&rsquo;s contribution under the scheme for 2022.  The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme provides an important source of working capital finance.  The 2021 allocation of &euro;800,000 has been converted to capital funding to align how this scheme is accounted for by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p> We recently launched the Brexit impact loan scheme, which is a medium-term, lower-cost scheme to fund working capital and investments for businesses, including primary producers and food businesses, impacted by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  The scheme opened for applications on 14 October. The remaining capital funding of &euro;2.5 million has been allocated to the soil sampling scheme to cover 2021.  The soil sampling programme will provide information to farmers on their soil fertility and also soil pathogen assessment.  The programme will measure baseline soil carbon levels which will guide future actions to support carbon farming.  It will also provide the basis for the next generation of soil-specific nutrient management advice and underpin targeted fertiliser and organic manure applications, ensuring the right nutrient type, right application rate, right time and right place across all farming systems.</p><p> Some &euro;11 million of the reallocated funding will go to a Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme.  The scheme will help mitigate the impacts of quota cuts on the fishing fleet arising from the trade and co-operation agreement agreed between the European Union and the UK.  The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the seafood sector task force and is targeted at white fish vessels in the polyvalent and beam trawl segments.  The scheme will be managed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and under it, vessels would tie up at the quayside and cease all fishing activity for that month.  In return, the vessel owners would receive a payment compensating for the lost fishing income during that month.  The vessel owners will in turn be required to distribute one third of that payment to crew.</p><p> The Marine Institute is seeking a once-off allocation in 2021 of &euro;5 million to enable costs related to the data collection framework, DCF, which is funded on an annual basis by this Department under subhead D, to be met on a current-year-payment basis with effect from 1 Jan 2022.</p><p> Due to the timing of approval of the 2014 to 2020 DCF programme and funding, a position developed whereby the Marine Institute receives funding for a particular year&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund-funded DCF expenditure one year after the spend is incurred.  Therefore, funding is received one year in arrears.  As it currently stands, the 2021 Estimate includes &euro;5 million for the 2020 costs, and the 2021 costs would be paid in 2022.  If the proposal is approved and the savings are available, the 2020 and 2021 costs could be paid in 2021, with the 2022 costs paid from the 2022 allocation.</p><p> The sheep welfare subhead B.8 will be increased by &euro;1.5 million under today's submission.  The reference period, which determines the maximum number of animals paid under scheme, was recently changed from 2014-15 to 2017.  This change is also in line with existing commitments set out in the programme for Government, which includes the commitment to build on schemes such as the sheep welfare scheme in a way that enhances farm incomes and animal welfare objectives, recognising their significant contribution to net farm incomes.  This commitment reflects that sheep farming contributes to both economic and environmental sustainability, in particular on more marginal land, with sheep grazing being an important land management tool in parts of the country where land usage options are relatively limited.  Given that this change requires additional funding of &euro;1.5 million for 2021 above the allocation agreed in this Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2021, I am increasing the allocation from &euro;17 million to &euro;18.5 million.</p><p> The United Nations World Food Programme is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian organisation, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.  The World Food Programme assists 115 million people in 84 countries through food or cash distributions in emergencies and nutrition support programmes.</p><p>The World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its efforts to fight hunger and its contribution to enabling conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas.  It relies entirely on voluntary funding, with governments being its principal donors.  Ireland has long been a supporter of the World Food Programme and my Department is the lead Department for the relationship with it.  The aggregate value of Ireland's contribution to the World Food Programme in the 30 years from 1991 amounts to some &euro;550 million.  Ireland commits funding through three yearly strategic partnership agreements with the World Food Programme, which for the period 2019 to 2021 committed &euro;70 million.  My Department is currently finalising the strategic partnership agreement for the years 2022-2024 under which it is proposed to commit &euro;75 million.  This &euro;25 million allocation represents an advance on that commitment and it will help save lives by supporting food security and nutrition, and rebuilding livelihoods in fragile settings.  It reaffirms Ireland's role as one of World Food Programme's most engaged partners.</p><p> I believe this is a necessary and important Supplementary Estimate which I earnestly recommend to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for being here and for his comprehensive opening statement.  On animal welfare and the sheep welfare scheme, the original allocation was approximately &euro;20 million per annum.  The new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan provides a similar allocation.  This allocation has never been fully spent.  There has been an historical underspend in this scheme.  I note this Supplementary Estimate essentially reflects the new reference year.  Is the Minister pursuing particular measures to ensure this scheme is fully utilised and drawn down in the next CAP?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#P00800"><p>I have updated the reference year this time around to try to make it as reflective as possible of current circumstances on family farms and on sheep farms.  I picked 2017 because that is the year we had the most sheep in the country.  I wanted to maximise the payments to farmers and to ensure the sheep welfare scheme would be the strongest support it could be.  The committee will be aware I have proposed an increase from &euro;10 per ewe to &euro;12 per ewe as part of the CAP strategic plan 2023-2027.  Many people had hoped for more, and while I would like to do more, this is a significant improvement on the outgoing CAP under which no schemes or programmes were provided for, with most of them evolving later on in the CAP.  I am now programming this in for the full five years.  In setting it at &euro;12 per ewe and the reference year at a particular year, yet to be decided in regard to the next CAP, I am trying to find the most optimal way to facilitate take-up and participation levels as well.</p></speech>

We had a debate on this last year as well.  Would it not make more sense to move this into the normal budgetary process?</p></speech>

We often receive requests for this to be forward paid.  The budget across my Department is significant and we try to manage it as tightly as possible, but as situations can evolve over the course of the year some departments will spend more and others will spend less.  Where there is capacity at the end of a year to forward-pay, it makes sense to do so.  This means we have met a commitment due and budgeted for in a previous budget and it gives capacity to as strong as possible support for the sector next year.</p></speech>

In most instances funds are drawn down within days.  I learned from Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment officials at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that there is undersubscription with regard to some of the loan schemes operated by that Department.  Has the Minister engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with regard to the transfer of unused liquidity in the microfinance scheme to the agricultural sector?  If not, will he do so?  The record of SBCI is impressive in terms of repayment rates, which are among the highest within the agriculture sector.  This illustrates a low-risk profile and a good investment on the part of the State.  While the increased capital is welcome, it still falls short of the 2020 allocation.  We could, perhaps, meet what is a clear demand here through the transfer of funding from other undersubscribed schemes.  Have there been any efforts in that regard as of yet?</p></speech>

I will be looking at the options and opportunities as part of that review.  This scheme has been a positive for the agrifood sector and a welcome enabler of low-cost loans and better competitive options for farmers.  It is a scheme I am committed to continuing while also looking at what options would strongly support farm families in the process.  The future growth loan scheme, which my Department operates in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has worked well, with 46% of it being drawn down by the sector.  I hope the Brexit loan scheme, which we launched and opened for applications about a month ago, will be strongly supported too.  In terms of the upcoming review with the SBCI of the streams, I will be looking to see how we can continue to use this as a support mechanism for the sector.</p></speech>

This is a demand-led scheme.  The saving arises because applications have not been submitted on time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#P01600"><p>On TAMS, I am dealing with a number of farmers who are currently in appeals.  It is a very strange scheme in the sense that farmers will have outlaid a great deal of money in terms of building sheds or concrete pits and so on.  For example, in a situation where a 100% penalty is applied, it would not be possible to return concrete.  Some of the cases I am dealing with are in regard to technical anomalies.  One case involves a husband and wife, returned emigrants and new farmers, whose receipts were in some cases paid to him, in others to her and to a company they both own.  They now face the prospect of losing their farm if their appeal is not successful.  Has the Minister had any interaction with his officials in regard to this area?  We need to ensure there is no fraud - that is very important - but where it is clear that money allocated has been spent for the purpose for which it was granted but an anomaly, mistake or a little negligence is detected, I would hope there would be some flexibility.  Does the Minister know the number of outstanding applications that are subject to appeal at the moment?</p><p>Is there anything the Minister can do in terms of working with his officials to address the anomalies I mentioned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#Q00200"><p>I am not aware off hand where the appeals specific to TAMS would be but I very much hear the Deputy's point.  It is something I have come across on too many occasions.  In terms of existing TAMS schemes, whenever farmers enter contracts, the terms and conditions are set and must be adhered to.  Where they are not adhered to, that can lead to real challenges and circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy.  Looking not just to TAMS but across the various schemes that will be there in the next CAP strategic plan, it is really important we ensure there is proportionality regarding checks and balances and that any penalties are proportionate to what went wrong.  TAMS is a very specific example of it.  The figures involved can be quite high.  The stakes can be really high for the farm family.  In many instances, it is its once-in-a-generation investment and if someone is left in a situation where he or she cannot avail of it, it can have nightmarish implications for a family.  I am very conscious of that, particularly in terms of how we structure the schemes as part of the CAP strategic plan.  The terms and conditions of existing schemes are there, are auditable and are part of the contract signed up to.  In terms of the schemes we are putting in place, it is something we must be very conscious of.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#Q00300"><p>It is vital for the existing scheme because we know that when there are negative experiences with one round, they can impact future applications coming through.  I will not deal with the specifics of this case because it is subject to appeal in the coming weeks but I ask the Minister to urge all officials involved.  Auditing is about ensuring there is no fraud.  There has been an acknowledgement of that in some cases, this was not fraud but - I use the term very loosely - &quot;negligence&quot; or involved mistakes on the part of the applicants.  In one case, we are talking about &euro;45,000, a huge sum of money.  Twice that amount was spent but that was what was due to be recouped.  They are repaying loans.  It is unique in the sense where one spends first and receives one's grant.  If one meets that type of difficulty, one is up to one's neck in it.  Therefore, I make that appeal to the Minister without delving into it.</p><p>Regarding forestry because it is probably the subject we discuss most here, I do not think any of us would have been surprised to see an underspend relating to afforestation because to be kind, the numbers are underwhelming in terms of the targets <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the actual outputs.  Without going into the intricacies of it, I met some constituents from west Cavan earlier who have an issue with what they see as the over-proliferation of Sitka spruce plantations in their areas.  The Minister would have heard similar stories coming from parts of Kerry and Leitrim.  This committee is very clear that we need to promote and expand the forestry sector.  What is the probability and possibility of ensuring that we have a balanced forestry strategy that works for the economy, the timber industry and the environment but also works for local communities in that it is regionally balanced across the board?  I think the next agri-environmental scheme will be pivotal when it comes to doing that and enticing farmers to re-engage with the forestry sector.  Does the Minister intend bringing forward any other immediate proposals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#Q00400"><p>I agree with the Deputy about its importance.  There is no doubt that the licensing backlog has been a very real drag regarding progress and meeting our targets.  It is something the Department has made a massive effort to address.  How it evolved has been well documented and discussed in this committee?  Very significant resources are in place in the Department.  Over the course of this year, we have been making increasing progress regarding licensing.  Around 3,500 licences have been issued this year compared with just over 2,500 for all of last year.  The dial is going in the right direction over the course of this year and is continuing to progress.  Over the past 11 weeks, an average of 113 new licences have been issued.  Afforestation has not been keeping pace with felling.  We have allocated ten ecologists specifically to afforestation.</p> <p>  Regarding getting things right in the long term and making them as streamlined and effective as possible, the implementation of the MacKinnon report is well under way through Project Woodland.  The board recently published its second interim report.  Two important recommendations from it have been approved, the first being the regulatory review of the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forest activities.  Work on that has begun.  The board has also agreed prioritisation and effective and inclusive consultation on a shared vision and plan for a new forestry strategy.  Work on this has commenced.  This will be really important in terms of driving things forward.  There is significant potential for improving forestry nationally and there is a very real imperative to deliver on it as well given what it can deliver from a climate change and carbon capture and sequestration point of view and the potential to drive up farm income.</p></speech>

One thing we all agree on is that the Minister as the senior Minister needs to have a strong handle on the forestry section within his Department because none of the targets are being met.  The rhetorical answers we get are very strong but the reality for people involved in the sector and communities, particularly the farming organisations, is very different.  The backlog is extending and there are still very real concerns about whether we will meet the target of 8,000 ha of afforestation any year over the lifetime of the next CAP unless we see some really substantive measures.</p> <p>  I have some points about some of the figures.  Under B12, there are savings of &euro;250,000 against a budget of &euro;601,000.  The Minister mentioned that it related to market volatility.  Could he explain what that scheme relates to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#Q00600"><p>Which one is B12?  Regarding forestry, this is something in respect of which I have been working with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  It is something that has been a real priority for the Department.  It is a real crisis.  This time last year, in particular, we were in a very difficult position.  The supply chain was starting to dry up and it was a very difficult situation.  We know the background regarding how it emerged and how the backlog developed.  The important thing is that we have been making progress and improving things.  The way we will do that is by lifting and increasing the licensing output.  We saw the side impact over the summer regarding the change in the consultation process where appropriate assessments are required and through a statutory instrument from another Department that changed the nature around that.  We will keep the pressure on to keep those licences up.  It is a real priority for everyone.  The way we will address it is by at least matching what is coming in the door with what is going out the door and pushing on past that in terms of driving down and eradicating the backlog.</p></speech>

I understand that he plans to introduce a statutory instrument relating to the veterinary medicines regulation.  I do not know where his deliberations on that are.  The committee has met on the matter a number of times.  The two main issues that have been raised with us are, first, the ability of farmers to receive a 12-month prescription under which they could go to their local trader or merchant if needs be and there would not be a sense of obligation and, second, the need for some types of medicine to be stockpiled on farms in areas where they might be needed quickly, for example, during calving season.  Is it the Minister's intention to cater for these two issues in the statutory instrument and does he plan to publish a draft before he enacts it so that committees such as ours can interact with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#R00900"><p>We have had considerable engagement with stakeholders.  I recognise the work and submissions of this committee, which has examined this matter in great detail, as have the Department and myself.  Our objective is to put in place a regime that is robust from the point of view of addressing microbial resistance and ensuring we avoid a situation that has unfortunately arisen over the years, namely, a growing resistance to many medicines leading to their increased ineffectiveness in performing the functions for which they were designed.  Not managing the medicines strongly also has implications from a human health point of view.  This is about trying to have good practice in place to ensure there is strong professional advice and guidance on how antibiotics and antimicrobials are administered while also being practical and having safeguards from a farming point of view without creating additional costs.  It is a matter of balancing these.  We are close to an outcome that will work.  We have engaged closely with all stakeholders and taken their points on board, including this committee's.  The Chairman has advocated strongly on behalf of the committee about the need for a good and balanced approach.  We will achieve that.</p></speech>

They are distinct, but they impact on my constituency in particular.  Unfortunately, there has been an avian flu outbreak in my county.  It has affected the turkey flock, which could not have happened at a worse time.  Does the Minister envisage a compensation scheme or is he confident that there are measures in place to contain the flu's spread?  What precise actions does he believe can be taken?</p> <p>  My second question is on the use of horticultural peat, particularly in the mushroom sector.  We understand that a report has been with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for more than a month now.  We have seen some leaks of what might be contained within that report, but it has not been published yet.  Has the report been shared with the Minister?  Speaking on RT&Eacute; last weekend, the Minister of State more or less indicated that he did not plan to implement the report's apparent objectives, which would be concerning.  Is there a route by which this issue can be resolved in the short term?  It has been reported that the recommendation is to introduce emergency legislation allowing for the emergency cultivation of peat next year.  Is that an achievable objective and will the Minister engage with the Minister of State and other Departments relevant to the matter on resolving the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#R01100"><p>Regarding the avian flu, it is a distressing situation for the affected farmers, particularly given the time of year.  There is a farm in County Monaghan that has had a case in a commercial flock.  Where there is highly pathogenic avian influenza, a compensation package is in place that requires a full cull of the flock concerned.  Steps have also been taken to put in place restriction and monitoring zones around the farm in question.  Nationally, I introduced a regulatory instrument requiring the housing of all commercial flocks for the coming weeks.  It is the riskiest time of year in terms of highly pathogenic avian influenza.  We have had a number of individual instances in the wild bird community across the community, so the risk is high.  We had an incident in a flock in the middle of the country around this time last year as well.  This situation is something that all flock owners are taking seriously.  The Department is also taking it seriously in respect of the precautionary measures that are being put in place and the monitoring mechanisms being employed by it, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the likes of BirdWatch Ireland.</p> <p>  I have had significant ongoing engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on the peat matter.  I will not pre-empt what is in the report, which it will outline for itself.  We have come at it from the point of view of trying to find a solution to this issue.  It does not make sense for us to import peat into Ireland.  The situation has arisen because the issue was not addressed in a timely fashion, in that many of our commercial extraction bogs were operating without the necessary licences and permissions and the necessary infrastructure was not in place to facilitate that happening.  I believe the report will be important in that regard and I will continue to liaise with the Minister of State on trying to get a solution.</p></speech>

I have two questions that will pick up where Deputy Carthy finished.  One is on peat.  I take a different slant to Deputy Carthy as regards what I heard on Radio 1 over the weekend.  My understanding is that this is now a Government decision, in that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will bring the report to the Government and it will then be for the Cabinet to decide what to do, be that to introduce emergency legislation or whatever.  When does the Minister envisage the report being before the Government and has he seen it?</p> <p>  It has been reported today that there might be a scarcity of turkeys for Christmas.  I am not asking a joke question in any way.  Does he believe that this will be an issue because of the avian flu?  How long ago was he made aware of the case in Monaghan and is he aware of any other location where there is a similar situation?</p></speech>

It will be up to him and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to bring it to the Cabinet, but I expect it will be managed and expedited promptly.  I have not seen the report, but I have had numerous engagements with the Minister of State on it.</p> <p>  Regarding the avian influenza, the timelines are eluding me at the moment, for example, of when the suspected case was identified in Monaghan, but it was certainly brought to my attention in the latter part of last week.  Testing was carried out and a positive result came back.  Immediate steps were taken to put in place protections and precautions around that flock.</p><p>It is certainly the case that there is ongoing vigilance across the country because there is real risk with a number of incidents of wild birds identified as being infected.  It is also something we have seen in many countries right across Europe now where the same position applies.  Vigilance is the order of the day over the next number of weeks along with exceptional precaution and attention to detail at farm level so as to ensure biosecurity measures are in place.</p></speech>

I spoke to a number of people in different farm organisations over the past number of months.  Has the Minister or his Department considered any farm retirement scheme?  In the same vein, we hope the Department will be putting in place environmental schemes over the next short while.  Will the Minister bring us up to date on their current status?  When does he expect publication of the details of any environmental schemes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#S00900"><p>The first question was on farm retirement, which was given consideration as part of the development of the CAP strategic plan to take us up to the end of 2027.  It existed before, in the CAP before last, as a targeted measure to try to bring about generational renewal and specifically as a support for young farmers.  The assessment was that as expenditure targeted at a support for young farmers, it was not necessarily the most effective way of doing that.  While it acts as an encouragement to land turnover, at the same time it was targeting farmers who were between the ages of 55 and 65 for early retirement.  We have many more farmers at pension age already than we would have in the category between 55 and 65 years.  The assessment has been made, taking into account the schemes put in place and the direct support of young farmers, that it is better and more effective to steer the funding directly to young farmers, as opposed to the funding of an early retirement scheme.  It has not been part of the draft proposals I have put out for consultation.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, I have travelled the country over the past couple of months and participated in public meetings in each county.  The issue came up on occasion but it was not raised very strongly in that public consultation.  The rationale for not including such a provision is that we want to try to use the funds available to support most strongly young farmers.</p> <p>  My mind seems to be going.  What was the Deputy's second point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#S01000"><p>It concerned environmental schemes.</p></speech>

The next environmental scheme will kick off in January 2023 and run to the end of 2027.  We are still in the consultation period in that respect.  The national plan outlines the bones of the environmental scheme and it will be submitted to the European Commission by the end of this year.  The infrastructure for running that scheme will be put in place over the course of next year, with the plan to have it started from January 2023.  In the meantime, we have the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, continuing this year.  In the budget just passed for next year, we have funding to run GLAS and the results-based environment agri pilot programme, REAP, again next year for all existing participants.</p></speech>

On the single farm payment, I have been contacted in recent weeks by farmers included in some remote sensing satellite inspections.  I know this can cause a delay in payments for many farmers.  I know they may have achieved good prices for their commodities in recent months but they totally depend on the single farm payment as well, which is due.  Does the Minister envisage any delay in payments to farmers who have been selected for satellite inspections?  Will he and his Department do everything possible to get these over the line before Christmas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#S01300"><p>Yes, we will do everything we can.  It is a challenge every year for those who might be randomly selected for spot checks and satellite inspections, which may have an impact on payments.  We will expedite the process every way we can to try to ensure farmers can get paid promptly following the completion of inspections.</p></speech>

Is there any way the Minister could provide assistance to farmers so when they contact the Department, the officials can give them an estimate of the time of payment based on the stage of their assessment?</p></speech>

Sometimes it may not be possible to bring clarity until an inspection is completed.  I take on board the Deputy's point, which is important.  It is significant for the affected farmers, particularly running up to Christmas and all the pressure around that.  I will speak to the team further about the procedures in place to ensure as much information as possible is made available to farmers.</p></speech>

He knows that a large number of people are totally frustrated by this.  I know the Minister has had an additional appointment to the forestry division in the Department.  Does he have further legislative plans for the forestry sector?  Money has been left over in the forestry area over a period, which does not reflect well on the Department because it is a key area with respect to climate change and everything like that.  We are totally behind on the targets.  Has the Minister any further legislative plans for the sector?</p></speech>

There may be recommendations arising from that and currently a number of working groups are in place assessing the best way forward.  The overall review will also affect how we go forward.  We will be informed by that work and we are really determined to ensure the process put in place can be as streamlined and effective as possible.  We want, as quickly as possible, to get away from the challenges and difficulties we have had over the past couple of years.  We are going in the right direction in that respect.</p></speech>

We have established Project Woodland to implement the findings of the Mackinnon report.  In that there are three work streams with project teams to drive the implementation of the report.  I do not have the up-to-date note on the implementation across each of the measures but the people in those work streams meet regularly and drive on that work.  One of the key elements established is the independent review of the position in other European member states and how their systems work.</p><p>Obviously, they have to comply with the same international and European law and conditionality as we do.  We have to see if there are ways in which we can adjust our system to make it more efficient and, at the same time, make sure it is compliant with various obligations.  That review is up and running and will inform how we go forward.</p></speech>

It is very important because farmers are totally frustrated.  Many farmers who were planning on planting forestry have changed their mind because they see what is happening within the Department.  They are very frustrated.  It is going to take a huge amount of work in the coming months to turn this whole thing around and to encourage farmers to plant forestry again.</p> <p>  With regard to the farmer organisations, like every other Deputy in the House, certainly rural Deputies, I have met with the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICSA and the different farming organisations in various counties in recent weeks.  They have huge concerns over climate change.  On the specific issue of the climate change targets the Minister is going to be setting, the farm organisations want to work with him and his Department to achieve them.  Has the Minister sat down with the presidents of, say, the IFA or Macra na Feirme and their officials to try to flesh out what can be done on the climate change targets?  I believe it is only by working with and talking to these farm organisations, with everybody singing off the same hymn sheet, that we can get everybody working in unity together.  I encourage the Minister to sit down with the farm organisations to see where we are all coming from and ensure we are all singing off the same hymn sheet.  There are huge concerns out there.  If the Minister is meeting the leaders of these farm organisations, he is keeping their members happy and content that, at least, he is sitting down with them and that he wants to work with them as they want to work with him.</p></speech>

I spent four and a half hours last Wednesday with all of the national presidents of the farm organisations and some of their key officers, along with all of the members of my own team.  I did a full four and a half hour session on CAP and climate change, dealing with these issues and where we are at the moment.  I also made it very clear in terms of how we step forward that, obviously, the first starting point was getting the sectoral targets right and getting them set for Irish agriculture in a way that was appropriate to what the sector can deliver.  I believe the range we have is ambitious but deliverable.  It will enable Irish agriculture to continue to produce the food - the milk and meat proteins - that we produce but to do so in a way that reduces the overall footprint and, in the process, adds value to that product and profitability at farm level for those producing that product.  Central to delivering those outcomes and those reductions in emissions is working with farmers to implement the various measures they can deliver and, in particular, working with farm leaders.  All of us must show the leadership that is required to deliver all of that.</p> <p>  I fully believe that will make Irish agriculture stronger and that it will get stronger over the next decade.  Any sector of the economy, or any national economy that is efficient from an emissions point of view and environmentally sustainable, can expect to do well in the next decade, and that is where Irish agriculture is at.  By international comparisons, we are a very sustainable food producing nation, and that is something we will continue to develop and double down on over the next decade and, in doing so, we will become stronger as an agricultural producing nation and as an income generating sector, particularly for farm families.</p> <p>  Central to that is working with farm organisations.  As I said, I spent a full afternoon with all of the national leaders last Wednesday.  I have had ongoing engagement throughout the CAP process with all of the national leaderships of all the farm organisations.  Obviously, that is something that has always happened within the CAP process and it happened again this time around.  Of course, I have supplemented that by having public meetings in each and every county in the country and speaking directly to every farmer who wanted to speak to me as part of the process to further develop that.  That has been in addition to the very significant ongoing engagement with the national farming organisations.  Now that the county-by-county meetings have concluded, we will continue that engagement with all of the farm organisations at national level to conclude the process of finalising the CAP strategic plan, which, legally, has to be completed by the end of December and submitted to the Commission.</p></speech>

There is huge worry and concern out there among the farming community about their future.  I stress the importance of keeping up that consultation between their national presidents and the Minister&rsquo;s officials.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to some &euro;7 million for forestry.  Last week, at this committee, Teagasc officials gave a fairly sobering assessment that in the first five years after trees are planted, there is damn all in terms of sequestration.  We are in bother between now and 2030 because, basically, from 2016, although it is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility as he was not in office, we failed to plant even 50% of what we were projecting for several years and just 75% for the other few years.  The Teagasc officials made a damning statement that would frighten the daylights out of anybody when they said we would need to hold up the cutting of trees towards the end of this decade because we will be cutting a lot more than we are planting.</p> <p>  What responsibility do the people in the Department take for what has gone on?  Is there any such thing as accountability?  The job the Minister and his officials have at hand, with the climate Bill and all of that, is basically to offset one thing against the other and to make sure we are in tune.  Is it not frightening that while it is not the farmers&rsquo; fault and it is probably not any Minister's fault, this has been let linger on?  I know what the Minister said and everyone supported last year&rsquo;s Bill in regard to cutting trees and the licences for felling.  However, the dashboard shows we are still stragglers when it comes to giving out afforestation licences.  I was looking at the figures just yesterday and while they suggest we will have 4,000 licences this year, and that will be the headline, the fact is Coillte is getting a good shot at them at the moment, although I am not saying it does not need them, and it will have its environmental impact statements, EIS, done and all of that craic, and will be zooming them through fairly quick.  However, we need licences outside of that and we are struggling.</p> <p>  Does that concern the Minister?  There was a new appointment lately but can the Minister leave the same people playing the same tune over a six-year period?  This is going to cost the farmers and our country down the line, if we are to believe what we heard from Teagasc.</p></speech>

It does take time but it then gathers pace as the years go on.  That is why, in the climate action plan, we have looked, for example, at the balancing out of the sequestration potential between this decade and the next decade, so credit for plantations that happen this decade can be based on what it will average out at over the 2020s and 2030s.  That is important because it further incentivises that drive to afforest from the point of view of delivering our targets.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that, even this year, the afforestation is not replacing the felling, which is not a sustainable situation.  The Deputy knows the backdrop in regard to the change.  Licensing had been operating in a timely fashion and then, as a result of legal decisions and court decisions, that significantly and radically changed and led to the very significant backlog, and also the very significant increase in staffing and resources that we put in place to try to address that.</p><p>The time involved in any one application is a multiple of what it was previously, which has meant farmers have not been getting the service they deserve or should be getting in respect of licensing.  We have tried hard to address this.  It is now going in the right direction and improving.  Progress is not as quick as we would have liked but we are getting there bit by bit and continuing to drive it.  The Deputy is right that afforestation has lagged behind.  We assigned ten ecologists to try to drive afforestation on.  It is a weak spot that we want to see addressed.</p></speech>

With regard to moneys left over, why do we not consider ideas such as starting a solar grant scheme for farmers under TAMS?  I fully understand the hold-up owing to Covid and the lack of builders in places.  Is the Department actively considering systems to reduce methane emissions from tanks, for example?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was in Ballinasloe looking at a new idea by Easyfix to reduce methane emissions from slurry tanks.  Is the Department considering innovative ideas so that if it has money left over, there could be a quick win and quick hit?</p></speech>

It is a really innovative company that is bringing technology and research to bear on housing materials and investigating how they can be most effectively used.  As the Deputy knows, in the recent budget I increased the solar energy allocation under TAMS for next year to 60%.  An important component will be the feed-in tariff.  We expect to have it in place early next year.  That will see a significant drive regarding solar energy.</p> <p>  With regard to moving forward with our climate action plan and targets, we are considering all the different options that will contribute.</p></speech>

On the veterinary medicine regulation, we hear that vets are telling farmers at meetings around the country that if they are getting dosing materials for the cattle, it will involve a dung sample.  Members of this committee understood that, at a herd test, a farmer would acquire the doses for fluke and do out a plan with the vet.  That does not seem to add up based on what we are now hearing on the ground.  If a problem arises whereby a vet has to come out to look at a lock of cattle every time a prescription must be written, no farmer will be able to afford it.  Before anything is done, the system should be made workable for farmers.  The Minister should not allow a situation where they are caught with one person.</p> <p>  In the dairy sector in January, February and March, when many cows will be calving, the cows will need injections for scour and all the various problems that arise.  You cannot be going down the size of the biro for one calf and then going down the next day and the next day.  It needs to be put into perspective that farmers do not just give injections for the craic and that they need to be covered in this regard.  I ask the Minister to address this before anything is signed off.</p> <p>  The Minister will know better than I do, from his own area, what is happening in the organic farming sector.  I was talking to farmers from a few hills in Galway and Mayo in the past few days.  In my opinion their lamb is organic, but the problem is that they cannot get organic certification because their sheep are in a commonage where someone else might have sheep and because some farmers have had to destock because of designation related to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Their farming is like a brother or sister to organic farming because it is so close to it.  Could any sense be applied to increase our organic figures?  It would help the farmers a lot with their situation.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his time.  I support him on the CAP he has had a part in.</p></speech>

I appreciate his comments on CAP.</p> <p>  On making sure we get veterinary prescribing right, there is a difficult challenge but it is one that we have to get right.  We must ensure there is common sense.  We cannot continue to have circumstances in which everybody is the leading expert on medicines and anthelmintics in his or her own world because the matter is not as straightforward as that.  We need to ensure the most appropriate research, science and advice are part of the equation.  We have had genuine and unsustainable challenges owing to growing resistance.  We will all be left in a very bad place in a number of years if we are not responsible in the attitude we take to this.  It is about trying to put in place a system that is robust in avoiding resistance and that works practically for farmers in respect of cost and on-farm implementation.  That is the balance we are trying to get right.  There have been many meetings and much engagement on it.  We hope to bring the matter to a conclusion soon in preparation for the changeover next year.</p> <p>  On organics, we have significant ambition under the next CAP.  There is a big step up.  We will be considering the schemes that are in place to ensure they support that.</p><p>I take the point on hill lamb, in particular.  We will reflect in advance of the next Cabinet meeting on those schemes coming into play.</p></speech>

I have only one thing to come back on, which we discussed over and over during the summer, because other speakers have covered the other issues.  The issue I come back to is forestry.  In May, we were told forestry and bio-energy had a total of &euro;103.2 million.  Now there is &euro;7 million savings there.  Is that not saying the licence system has failed to such an extent that there is &euro;7 million left over after this year?  To put it in context, we were told in the D&aacute;il that by the end of 2019 more than 1,000 ha of ash dieback had been cleared and was being replanted with alternative species at a cost of &euro;7 million.  We are now told that an identical &euro;7 million, the cost of the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, has been saved.  That will drive farmers who have been planting and so on absolutely crazy.  Farmers involved in the sector are struggling to cope with a busted licence system.  There is no point in calling it anything else because it is just not working.</p> <p>  At the same time, we are seeking to improve our carbon storage abilities and increase the spread of woodland.  Should we not make every effort so that the Department spends that money in that sector every year?  Does the Minister expect to come back to the committee this time next year with the same story?  We had a good organisation in at the last meeting looking for funding and a letter went out.  Does the Minister remember the husband and wife?  They are looking for money.  The Minister might pass on some of that &euro;7 million to them.</p></speech>

There is a letter gone.  To think there is &euro;7 million savings and we discussed it over and over at the committee during the summer.  The licence system is a busted flush.  It is frustrating for us in the committee so I can only imagine what it is like for farmers.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice and others said, we are trying to encourage others to plant.  The way it is going, there is not a hope in hell we will entice them in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#V00700"><p>There is no doubt that the licensing challenge in the Department has been a drag on progress in relation to afforestation and felling over the last year or two.  We have been making progress and it is an improving situation, thankfully.  We are in a different situation compared to this time last year, when we faced an increasingly challenging and disimproving situation in terms of supply.  While there is much work to be done, it is improving, progressing and going in the right direction.</p> <p>  Some of the steps we have taken have made a significant improvement.  At the back end of last year, we introduced the changes to the forestry appeal legislation.  At that stage, there was a backlog of about 1,000 cases on the forestry appeals committee's books.  We split that committee into four and resourced it more significantly.  As of today, it is hearing appeals of 25 cases, rather than 1,000.  That has been a significant improvement.  On the licensing system, progress continues to be made but there is undoubtedly a backlog which has led to delays and which we are addressing.</p> <p>  On the budget, I believe we will make the targets over the time ahead.  We have to drive on with that and key to that is the licensing system.  I outlined the work that is under way on reviewing what additional steps could be taken to improve it further.  The implementation of the Mackinnon report will also be important.  There are many different streams, including ash dieback, maintenance payments and roads building, that come under the overall forestry budget.  There is underspend this year because our licensing has not been what it should be but we have to reverse and address that as we get into next year and take it forward from there.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#V00800"><p>I thank the Minister for being before us with his officials.  I was looking at different savings through the organic scheme, TAMS, forestry and fisheries.  The Minister explained where the savings have been made.  We are talking about sheep welfare and going from &euro;10 to &euro;12 per ewe.  That will not happen this year for farmers who are getting payments.  The &euro;1.5 million saving from the organic scheme was mentioned.  I have a conflict of interest as my son is an organic farmer.  However, I have not seen an increase of any sort in the last 15 or 20 years in relation to the organic scheme, other than the increase of the registration fee for the farmer every year.  There is very little to be got out of that and it is difficult to look at &euro;1.5 million being saved and not being pumped back in to participants to encourage them to carry out their organic works even stronger than they are.</p> <p>  The Minister said &euro;3.3 million expenditure was saved from TAMS.  There are many people appealing their TAMS and it will be frustrating or upsetting for them to hear there is a saving of &euro;3.3 million when they have a genuine spend and have not been able to get their hands on their money.  The &euro;7 million savings in forestry is mainly due to there being no new planting.  I accept that the licensing delays were a factor, as the Minister said, but it is astonishing to think that &euro;7 million has been saved because we have not been able to sow forestry.  Every opportunity needs to be worked on to resolve that.  It is a crisis of huge proportions which will come back to bite us down the road.  We are not meeting any targets.  We are way off every target set in relation to forestry this year.  Somebody needs to put their hand in the air and take full responsibility.  The buck stops somewhere.  It is not with the landowners or the people who want to fell forestry.  It is held up all the way back to the person who wants to sow forestry.  There is no confidence among the public in relation to forestry sowing.</p> <p>  In fisheries, &euro;4.9 million was saved, while SFPA stated it had savings of &euro;2 million.  It is a tough time for fishermen.  Bar the decommissioning and talk of &euro;1 million on the fleet tie-up scheme, there is no compensation out there.  I have said for the last two or three years that a fund needs to be put in place for the many inshore fishermen who lost their material or equipment a couple of years ago due to bad storms.  There was not a brown cent for these guys and ladies who are trying to fish the seas in difficult times.  If we have &euro;4.9 million plus &euro;2 million in SFPA savings, that is a lot of money that could have been tied into a scheme.  Maybe a new scheme needs to be started like the rural social scheme which would be much easier for fishermen to get into.  Many of them are losing their jobs and scratching their heads at the moment.  They need answers and see none coming, only decommissioning, which means even more of them will be outside the system and out of work.</p> <p>  I see the Marine Institute is seeking a once-off allocation of &euro;5 million for data collection.</p><p>That is a lot of money for data collection.  What kind of data collection is the institute intending to carry out that requires &euro;5 million?  Is it looking at data collection in relation to quota that we are not getting out there?  Is it going to undertake some kind of research in that area?   What is the story?  It seems to me that &euro;5 million is a lot of money.  Perhaps the institute genuinely needs the money, but I am interested in hearing where it intends to use that money.  </p></speech>

On the &euro;5 million allocated to the Marine Institute for data collection, we are reallocating some of the unspent funds from other sections to rectify what could be called an anomaly, or the situation whereby it was previously paid a year retrospectively.  We are using that &euro;5 million to bring it into line to ensure that it is paid in the year when it falls due.  I addressed that point earlier.</p> <p>  On supports for the fisheries sector, as the Deputy is aware, the fleet tie-up scheme is in place until the end of this year.  Some of the savings that I have identified are going specifically towards supporting fishermen in that sector, and in the whitefish sector, in particular.  It has been a really important scheme for supporting fishermen over the course of this autumn.  The introduction of the scheme was one of the first recommendations of the task force which I have brought forward and implemented.  It has been widely welcomed by those who have availed of it and take-up has been very strong.  It has been an important support.  As the Deputy is aware, the seafood sector task force was made up of fishers' representatives.  I brought the representatives together, as those who are in the sector and who make their livelihoods from the sector, to advise on the challenging outcome of Brexit and to advise the Government as to how we can best support and invest in their livelihoods, and how we can best battle on their behalf at European level in the years ahead.  There will be significant funding under the Brexit adjustment reserve to support the sector through that, and importantly so.</p> <p>  Otherwise, on the smaller savings that we are making, when a Department has an annual budget of &euro;1.9 billion and in addition, &euro;1.2 billion in direct payments which it administers, some changes always will be made in respect of what is profiled at the start of the year as the year progresses and life happens.  It happens in every walk of life and every profession.  In a Department with almost &euro;2 billion of spending, you will see things that do not quite work out as profiled.  That is why it is important to redirect and manage the Vote, and to involve the committee members in accounting for why that is happening.  On the reprofiling of funds, some of it is going directly to fishers through the tie-up scheme.  </p></speech>

In his opening statement, the Minister mentioned looking at ways to re-engage farmers so that they see forestry not as a displacement but as being complementary to their farming enterprise.  Could the Minister give us an idea of what he has in mind there?</p> <p>  On the TAMS payment. I note the Minister is seeking to use the &euro;3.3 million in savings from the 2021 allocation to fund expenditure elsewhere.  Does the Minister have any initiatives in mind, in particular, for that &euro;3.3 million?  I am not sure whether the Minister outlined that earlier.  If he did, I apologise.</p></speech>

We want it to be seen as a farming activity as well as, for example, farming the land through grassland.  It can be incorporated into the overall holding.  That is what we see happening internationally, in many cases.  There is great potential for that here.  We will look at how we set up the environmental schemes, for example, the eco-scheme under Pillar 1.  The introduction of measures such as those encouraging farmers to plant three trees per hectare on an annual basis can help to address that.</p> <p>  I believe Ms Chapman will respond to the Deputy's question on the &euro;3.3 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rebecca Chapman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#W00700"><p>In relation to the &euro;3.3 million, we are addressing two issues with that.  First, there is a soil sampling scheme profile for 2021, which was originally allocated current expenditure.  There is a much larger allocation for it for 2022.  On reflection, as we developed the scheme, we decided that it was more appropriate for that scheme to be funded from capital funding rather than from current expenditure.  We are using the savings from TAMS to convert that scheme to capital expenditure in 2021.  It will be funded through a capital allocation from 2022 going forward.  We are creating a very important soil database with that funding.  It is a capital asset.</p> <p>  Similarly, the 2021 allocation for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme,  which is co-run with our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is &euro;800,000.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had classified the scheme as a capital-funded scheme; we had classified it as a current expenditure-funded scheme.  That was an anomaly, so we are converting the 2021 allocation to capital funding to match the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's accounting.  It is a technical issue and we are utilising TAMS savings for that purpose.  The scheme will be classed as a capital-funded scheme going forward.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-23a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021112300002#W00800"><p>I have a few questions that I would like to put to the Minister.  The first concerns ash dieback.  I, like many others, have campaigned vigorously on the issue of ash dieback.  I believe that what has been done for the plantations to date is inadequate.  The farmers' plantations suffered a disease that was completely outside of their control.  I will not go into the biosecurity issues or the question of who is at fault or whatever bit it is not helping our battle to get the afforestation figures up.  In my part of the country and that of Deputy Browne, there are many plantations with ash dieback.  It has left a sour taste in people's mouths.  The ash crop was going to be a very valuable cash crop, usually sown on relatively good land.  Now, the crop is worthless and in some cases, 30 years of growth has gone down the Swanee.  I have made the point to the Minister previously that if these plantation owners decide to replant, they should have access to premiums going forward.  It would be a huge gesture on the part of the Department.  It would give confidence back to the forestry industry that they are not the poor relation.  If an outbreak of TB or brucellosis occurred on a farm, the farmer would get compensation.  Ash dieback is a disease which, in many cases, has devastated farmers' pension plans.  I believe we have not done enough for them.  I would like the Minister to give thought to what I have said as regards premiums.  We all want to see afforestation figures going up.  If we could do something on ash dieback, it would start to give a feel-good factor back to the forestry industry.</p> <p>  The next point I wish to make concerns the agri-environmental schemes going forward.  I have spoken on the issue in the D&aacute;il and we spoke on it the other evening when we presented to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, the report that the committee put together last spring.  It is essential that agri-environmental schemes are married with afforestation.  Looking at the fact that farmers in GLAS were prohibited from going into afforestation in the last five years of GLAS makes a mockery of where we are trying to get in respect of climate change and reducing our emissions.  The farmers who would want to join an agri-environmental scheme would be the ones that we would be targeting for afforestation as well.  Those two schemes have to be married together in this round of CAP if we are to make any serious impression on our afforestation targets.</p> <p>  If needs be, I urge the Minister to meet the forestry groups.  They have developed proposals on this issue which they have sent to the committee.  We can pass them on to the Minister.  As I have said, it was the point we made very strongly when we presented the report in the D&aacute;il last Thursday evening to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  It is essential that we get it right this time round.  The number of farmers who opted for afforestation in the last five years of GLAS went down by around 80% to 90%.</p><p>Therefore, it is clear that the schemes as they were designed the last time around prohibited farmers from going into afforestation.  </p><p> Deputy Martin Browne spoke about money being left over in TAMS.  The rate of grant and most definitely the ceiling are out of touch with reality, given the increase in building costs.  A sum of &euro;80,000 would do very little work as we try to meet our emissions targets, try to improve water quality and all those issues.  With the price that chemical fertiliser will be next spring, the utilisation of slurry will be paramount for farmers.  All these things will require significant investment on farms.  Given how costs have increased, &euro;80,000 is out of touch with reality.  I urge the Minister to increase the ceiling of &euro;80,000 to make investment on farms more attractive for farmers.  In 2007 there was a far more attractive investment scheme for slurry storage.  I am not suggesting we go back to the scheme we had in 2007, but definitely the current scheme needs to be reviewed and revised upwards.  </p><p> I do not believe any other members picked up on a point relating to ANC.  I saw that &euro;1 million was not taken up because of stocking rate.  Is that &euro;1 million in total in ANC or is it &euro;1 million extra in the year of the Estimate we are discussing?  Is it possible to get a breakdown by county of what farmers do not meet stocking rate requirement on ANC?  I do not expect the Minister to have this this evening.  </p><p> While "penalised" might be the wrong word, I have been inundated by farmers who have had to return the money they received under the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme for 2019.  What will happen to the money that will be returned?  Could we give a fresh reference year for farmers to try to meet the stocking rate requirement?  Many farmers did not understand the intricacies of the scheme they went into.  It was an extremely complicated scheme.  Many people I am dealing with now felt if they reduced their stocking rate by 5% for a given period of the year, they would qualify.  Very few recognised that it was a calendar-year reduction.  It is galling for farmers who lost significant money in feeding cattle in that year.  The scheme was introduced at &euro;100 per head and now they are required to refund it.  I have raised this with the Minister before and I know it is not a simple request.  The scheme was 50% EU funded.  Could anything be done to give these farmers another opportunity to meet the stocking rate reduction requirements?  </p><p> The Department needs to have a fresh examination of designated land.  Land that has been designated has had its capital value decimated.  There are some schemes for hen harrier land etc.  However, none of these schemes has restored the capital value of this designated land.  If we are serious about meeting our afforestation targets, we need to look at the blanket ban on designated land.  I understand this was a national decision.  I have seen evidence showing that different stages of afforestation can enhance habitats rather than diminish them.  There is evidence to show that different stages of afforestation can actually help the species we are trying to protect with these blanket bans.</p><p> If we could plant a percentage of that designated land over, for example, a three-year window and then do more in the next three-year window, it would go a long way towards meeting our afforestation targets and would also restore the capital value of that land.  I am aware of designated land recently sold in my county for &euro;1,200 per hectare.  If it were eligible for planting it would make quadruple that amount.  The land has lost its capital value completely.  We are shooting ourselves in the foot in meeting our afforestation targets with a blanket ban on that land.  </p><p> As usual, I have a few simple questions for the Minister for some of which he may not have the answers available immediately.  </p></speech>

I take the valid point the Chairman is making and it is a matter that the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I have discussed and we are reflecting on it.  It has been devastating for the farmers affected.  As the Chairman will know, a scheme was introduced in March 2013.  To date, the uptake has been low.  Earlier this year, &euro;7 million was paid out under the scheme in respect of approximately 1,000 ha.  In April 2018 the Department suspended that reconstitution scheme and announced a review of it.  A new scheme was opened on 22 June 2020.  We have had limited uptake on that so far with 268 applications received and 19 approvals issued to date.  The Chairman makes his points well and we are reflecting on the matter.</p> <p>  The Chairman's point about the agri-environmental schemes and afforestation is fair.  It is important for us to look at that in the context of putting together these new schemes for 2023 to 2027.  It is important both for afforestation and for organic farming that we do not have inbuilt unintentional disincentives making it harder to achieve our objectives.  The thinking must be cross-sectional and the objectives must support each other.  That is something we are aware of and I take the Chairman's point.  We will be keeping it closely in mind.  </p> <p>  I have proposed that the ceiling for the new TAMS be increased to &euro;90,000.  I have launched an updated cost review.  I take the Chairman's point.  Many people feel that ceiling should be larger.  As it currently stands, I have plans to increase that to &euro;90,000 and the costings will be updated when that is completed.</p> <p>  The &euro;1 million for ANC is to ensure we provide enough funding in the funding envelope to be able to cover ANC.  Every year up to 5,000 potential applicants do not meet the stocking requirements.  We allocate enough for what we believe will meet all applications.  However, that &euro;1 million saving reflects the fact that not as many people met the stocking requirement as we had provided for.  We were cautious in seeking to slightly overprovide to ensure we would definitely have enough funding to do it.  </p></speech>

Overall, 33,000 farmers applied in the first instance.  Of these, 18,700 have exited the scheme clear, having met the 5% reduction.  Out of the 33,000 farmers, 18,700 are out the gap and are paid.  They will keep that payment.  Approximately 10,700 participants deferred and are still in deferment period.  The new reference period I set runs from January this year to December this year.  I set it in acknowledgement of the fact that many were off course, to try to give people the opportunity to reset.  I think it was in February that I put it in place.  It gives people a second chance to get straightened up and try to meet the 5% threshold if they were in trouble.  A total of 10,700 farmers availed of this extra year-long participation time.  There were 3,600 who did not opt for the extra year and had not met the 5% by the end of the original 12 months.  The total to be recouped from them is just over &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  We have 10,700 still in the scheme.  The analysis until September shows that out of the 10,700 in the new reference year, 2,100 of them are on track to meet the 5%.  A further 300 are between 4% and 5%.  They will have a partial recoupment.  This leaves 8,300 who are not on track to meet the 5% reduction.  Of the 8,300 who are not on track, 7,100 of them have increased their nitrates over the course of the reference year.  A total of 10,700 took the new reference year and, out of these, 2,100 will be okay, another 300 or so are above the 4% and, of the 8,300 who are under 4%, the vast majority have increased nitrates during the reference period.  It is not marginal.  It is likely that many of them made a decision they will not meet it and have taken a different pathway.</p> <p>  Looking at these figures as they stand, the total of 7,100 farmers would mean a potential recoupment of &euro;15 million when administrative checks are repeated in February.  Most are on track.  Money has been recouped from 3,600 because they did not avail of the new reference year.  Of those who took the new reference year, more than 2,000 are on track.  Up to 2,500 are likely to be okay.  Nitrates have increased for more than 7,000 of them.  A new reference year would be unlikely to change their direction of travel.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and Senator O'Loughlin are being substituted respectively by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Senator Clifford-Lee.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent mode.  Are the minutes of the meeting of 16 November 2021 agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Beaglaioch, oifigeach oideachais iar-bhunscoile, an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta; F&iacute;ona U&iacute; Uiginn, Gaeloideachas; Julian de Sp&aacute;inn, ard-runa&iacute;, Conradh na Gaeilge; Sorcha N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair, Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta; agus Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; hEaghra, ard-runa&iacute;, an Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  Our witnesses are here today to discuss leaving certificate reform, with reference to the Irish language and Irish-medium education.  I will invite P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Beaglaioch to make a brief opening statement, followed by F&iacute;ona U&iacute; Uiginn, Julian de Sp&aacute;inn, Sorcha N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair and, finally, Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; hEaghra.  This will be followed by questions by the committee members.  Each member has an eight-minute slot to ask the questions and for the witnesses to respond.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in making him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by the Chair to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  A translation into English is provided for members who want it.  I call P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Beaglaoich, followed by the rest of the speakers.  They have four minutes each.  I ask the witnesses to watch the clock because we are on time limits due to Covid.  I ask them, therefore, to stick within the four minutes.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad rud ar fh&eacute;ach muid air n&aacute; oiri&uacute;nacht an mh&uacute;nla T1 agus T2 don ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.  Th&aacute;inig an m&uacute;nla nua seo at&aacute; ann, an m&uacute;nla T1 agus T2, isteach ag leibh&eacute;al na sraithe s&oacute;iseara&iacute; in 2017 ach, mar a d&uacute;irt P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Beaglaioch ansin, n&iacute;l aon scr&uacute;d&uacute; d&eacute;anta bunaithe air f&oacute;s de bharr na paind&eacute;ime.  N&iacute;l aon athbhreithni&uacute; d&eacute;anta air, c&eacute; go bhfuil ceann tosaithe anois ag an CNCM.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an t-athbhreithni&uacute; seo d&eacute;anta agus an t-aiseolas curtha ar f&aacute;il sular socra&iacute;odh ar an m&uacute;nla c&eacute;anna a &uacute;s&aacute;id don ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.<br/><br/>Faoin m&uacute;nla nua ardteistim&eacute;ireachta, n&iacute; bheidh aon scr&uacute;d&uacute; ag an mbonnleibh&eacute;al ar f&aacute;il.  Is scr&uacute;d&uacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; sa bhonnleibh&eacute;al do choh&oacute;rt dalta&iacute; nach bhfuil chomh l&aacute;idir sin sa teanga.  Mar a d&uacute;irt P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Beaglaioch, gan c&uacute;rsa bonnleibh&eacute;il, t&aacute; an baol ann go mbeidh ard&uacute; m&oacute;r ar l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; a bheith ag lorg d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine &oacute;n nGaeilge san ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.  T&aacute; an l&iacute;on seo ag coth&uacute; imn&iacute; mar at&aacute; s&eacute; i l&aacute;thair na huaire.<br/><br/>C&eacute;ard faoi rogha idir T1 agus T2?  N&iacute;l s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir &oacute; na dr&eacute;achtsonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; an mbeidh an tsonra&iacute;ocht nua seo T1 roghnach n&oacute; &eacute;igeantach do na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; i scoileanna Gaeltachta agus l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  Gan an t-eolas seo, t&aacute; an tuairim ag teacht chun cinn sa diosc&uacute;rsa poibl&iacute; go mbeidh ar scol&aacute;ir&iacute; i scoileanna T1 tabhairt faoi ch&uacute;rsa Gaeilge at&aacute; n&iacute;os d&uacute;shl&aacute;na&iacute; gan aon ch&uacute;iteamh a bheith curtha ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh as an obair bhreise a bhainfidh leis seo.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th go dtabharfadh aon dalta i scoil T1 faoin gc&uacute;rsa seo?  Mura mbeidh an c&uacute;rsa T1 &eacute;igeantach, cad a chuirfeadh orthu an scr&uacute;d&uacute; n&iacute;os d&uacute;shl&aacute;na&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh?  Ar&iacute;s, n&iacute;l aon eolas sna dr&eacute;achtsonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; faoi seo.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla beart luaite sa pholasa&iacute; don oideachas Gaeltachta ach n&iacute; bheidh na bearta at&aacute; luaite ansin tarraingteach go leor le dalta&iacute; a mhealladh le tabhairt faoi ch&uacute;rsa ag leibh&eacute;al na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta - scr&uacute;d&uacute; at&aacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach sin don dalta - agus an obair bhreise sin a dh&eacute;anamh d&aacute; ndeoin f&eacute;in mura mbeidh c&uacute;iteamh ceart ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.<br/><br/>Cad iad na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agam f&eacute;in agus ag an Ollamh Hyland?  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir leis na dr&eacute;achtsonra&iacute;ochta&iacute;, mar at&aacute; siad leagtha amach faoi l&aacute;thair, freastal ar na riachtanais at&aacute; ag na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ar fad.  Is g&aacute; f&eacute;achaint ar an m&uacute;nla T1 agus T2 seo ar&iacute;s agus ceist a chur faoina oiri&uacute;nacht do scr&uacute;d&uacute; na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta.  N&iacute;l an <i>status quo</i>ag freastal ar riachtanais na gcainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais n&aacute; cainteoir&iacute; cumasacha Gaeilge.  T&aacute; deis ann anois, le sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; nua, dul i ngleic leis an gceist seo agus sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a dhearadh at&aacute; in oiri&uacute;int do na spriocghr&uacute;pa&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la ar fad den ch&eacute;ad uair.  Chuige seo t&aacute; fr&aacute;ma n&oacute; m&uacute;nla eile, seachas an c&oacute;ras T1 agus T2, &aacute; mholadh againn.  Dar linn, t&aacute; dh&aacute; bhealach ann leis seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  Feicfidh na baill sna c&oacute;ipeanna den r&aacute;iteas tosaigh at&aacute; acu an d&aacute; rogha.<br/><br/>Faoi rogha 1, beidh bonnleibh&eacute;al, gn&aacute;thleibh&eacute;al, ardleibh&eacute;al agus leibh&eacute;al nua, s&aacute;rleibh&eacute;al, ar f&aacute;il.  Bheadh an scr&uacute;d&uacute; s&aacute;rleibh&eacute;il d&iacute;rithe ar choh&oacute;rt dalta&iacute; at&aacute; cumasach sa Ghaeilge.  Bheadh deis acu caighde&aacute;n n&iacute;os airde a bhaint amach i labhairt agus scr&iacute;obh na teanga.  Chun dalta&iacute; a mhealladh le tabhairt faoin leibh&eacute;al seo, caithfear point&iacute; breise CAO a bheith ag dul leis.<br/><br/>Maidir leis an dara rogha at&aacute; curtha os comhair an choiste againn, bheadh bonnleibh&eacute;al, gn&aacute;thleibh&eacute;al agus ardleibh&eacute;al ar f&aacute;il, mar at&aacute; siad faoi l&aacute;thair, ach dh&eacute;anfa&iacute; &aacute;bhar nua, sa&iacute;ocht agus litr&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge, a fhorbairt freisin.  Bheadh an t-&aacute;bhar sin ar f&aacute;il do dhalta&iacute; a mbeadh sp&eacute;is acu tabhairt faoi &aacute;bhar mar sin ar an mbonn c&eacute;anna le mata agus mata fheidhmeach.  T&aacute; na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaineann leis an d&aacute; rogha sin sonraithe agam sa r&aacute;iteas tosaigh.  N&iacute; rachaidh m&eacute; isteach iontu anois. <br/><br/>Mar fhocal scoir, d&eacute;arfaidh m&eacute; gur scr&uacute;d&uacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach i saol an scol&aacute;ire &iacute; an ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.  Is scr&uacute;d&uacute; &eacute; a bhfuil go leor ag brath air.  N&iacute; ceart athr&uacute; chomh m&oacute;r leis an gceann seo at&aacute; beartaithe sna dr&eacute;achtsonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an nGaeilge - &aacute;bhar a bhfuil t&aacute;bhacht n&iacute;os leithne ag baint leis - gan na himpleachta&iacute; a mheas go c&uacute;ramach.  Is &eacute; an chomhairle at&aacute; ag Gaeloideachas ag an bpointe seo n&aacute; go gcuirf&iacute; aon chinneadh faoi shonra&iacute;ocht nua Ghaeilge sa tsraith shinsearach n&oacute; san ardteistim&eacute;ireacht ar leataobh go dt&iacute; go mbeidh an t-athbhreithni&uacute; ar an tsraith sh&oacute;isearach d&eacute;anta agus na tortha&iacute; ar f&aacute;il.  Nuair a bheidh s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta, iarraimid ar na baill, polaiteoir&iacute; ar sp&eacute;is leo todhcha&iacute; na teanga, a chinnti&uacute; go gcuirtear na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agam f&eacute;in agus ag an Ollamh Hyland sa phl&eacute;ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is san &aacute;ireamh agus go nd&eacute;antar fr&aacute;ma nua a dhearadh don Ghaeilge ag leibh&eacute;al na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta, fr&aacute;ma a fhreastal&oacute;idh i gceart, don ch&eacute;ad uair, ar riachtanais fhoghlama gach dalta sa t&iacute;r.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an moladh seo loighci&uacute;il, ciallmhar agus bheadh s&eacute; faillitheach gan glacadh leis.  T&aacute; sprioc uaillmhianach leagtha amach i mBille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019, at&aacute; le hacht&uacute; roimh dheireadh na bliana, go mbeidh 20% de na daoine a earc&oacute;far san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; faoi 2030 inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge.</p><p>Is &eacute; leibh&eacute;al B2 ar an FTCE an caighde&aacute;n is m&oacute; a luaitear go hidirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta mar bhunriachtanas le go mbeadh duine in ann feidhmi&uacute; i dteanga ar bith i gcomhth&eacute;acs gairmi&uacute;il.

D&lsquo;fheadfadh na leibh&eacute;il &eacute;ags&uacute;la ar an bhfr&aacute;ma agus na pr&oacute;if&iacute;l teanga a bhaineann leo freastail ar chumas dalta&iacute; le Gaeilge mar a gc&eacute;ad teanga agus dalta&iacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge mar dara teanga.  D&rsquo;fheadfadh an fr&aacute;ma freastail ar dhalta&iacute; scoile a thagann isteach sa ch&oacute;ras d&eacute;anach; mar shampla d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh dalta ag teacht isteach sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais in &Eacute;irinn don ch&eacute;ad uair i rith na tr&iacute;&uacute; bliain sa mhe&aacute;nscoil an leibh&eacute;al A1 a dh&eacute;anamh sa Ghaeilge agus na point&iacute; cu&iacute; CAO a bhronnadh air n&oacute; uirthi.  D&rsquo;fheadfadh an fr&aacute;ma freastail ar dhalta&iacute; scoile le deacrachta&iacute; foghlama; mar shampla d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh dalta le deacrachta&iacute; scr&iacute;obh d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar labhairt na Gaeilge amh&aacute;in ar an bhfr&aacute;ma agus na point&iacute; cu&iacute; CAO a bhronnadh air n&oacute; uirthi.

Bheadh aon dalta nach nd&eacute;anann an Ghaeilge don ardteistim&eacute;ireacht ag cailli&uacute;int amach ar go leor leor deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta agus gairme.  Ba cheart na fadhbanna leis an nGaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais a dheisi&uacute; in ionad iad a sheachaint.</p><p> Chuige sin, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtac&oacute;idh an coiste leis an &eacute;ileamh eile at&aacute; againn go mbeadh polasa&iacute; don Ghaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais &oacute;n r&eacute;amhscoil go dt&iacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al.

Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th, roimh an olltoghch&aacute;n in 2020, gur chuir an feachtas "#Gaeilge4All" moladh chun cinn leis na p&aacute;irtithe polaiti&uacute;la gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh polasa&iacute; don Ghaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais &oacute;n r&eacute;amhscoil go dt&iacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al ann.  Chuimseodh an polasa&iacute; an Ghaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais ag gach leibh&eacute;al agus i ngach earn&aacute;il, leis an tr&iacute; chro&iacute;-pholasa&iacute; seo a leanas san &aacute;ireamh sa pholasa&iacute;: an polasa&iacute; oideachais Gaeltachta reatha; polasa&iacute; don Ghaelscola&iacute;ocht, a f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus at&aacute; le forbairt; agus polasa&iacute; don oideachas a fheidhm&iacute;onn tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n an Bh&eacute;arla.

Ar nd&oacute;igh, caithfimid oibri&uacute; laistigh den ch&oacute;ras at&aacute; i bhfeidhm faoi l&aacute;thair.  Caithfidh athchomhaireamh teacht ar sin.

I gcomhth&eacute;acs na sraithe s&oacute;iseara&iacute;, bhraith m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; gur tharla se sin faoi dheifir, nach raibh d&oacute;thain ama le hacmhainn&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il n&oacute; don oili&uacute;int chu&iacute;.  Is &eacute; ceann de na h&aacute;bhair bhuartha freisin a bh&iacute;onn ag m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; i nGaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, ach go sonrach ag m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; Gaeltachta, n&aacute; go mbraitheann siad nach bhfuil d&oacute;thain baill foirne &oacute; ch&uacute;lra&iacute; Gaeltachta agus &oacute; ch&uacute;lra&iacute; sna Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; agus a bhfuil taith&iacute; chu&iacute; sa seomra ranga acu ag cuid de na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; taca seo at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh a ngn&oacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.

Mar a luaigh an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh, t&aacute; an t-&aacute;bhar seo pl&eacute;ite go maith ag Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge roimhe seo.  Seasann dh&aacute; abairt amach as na cuir i l&aacute;thair go l&eacute;ir.  Mar a d&uacute;irt F&iacute;ona U&iacute; Uiginn, caithfimid freastal ar riachtanais foghlama gach dalta sa t&iacute;r.  D&uacute;irt Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; hEaghra gur c&oacute;ir freastal ar chearta teanga gach duine sa t&iacute;r.  Mar a tharla&iacute;onn, t&aacute; beirt Dh&eacute;iseach anseo: Sorcha N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair agus m&eacute; f&eacute;in.  N&iacute; mar an gc&eacute;anna na riachtanais a bh&iacute; againn nuair a bh&iacute;omar sa mhe&aacute;nscoil.  T&aacute; Gaeilge ag Sorcha N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair &oacute; dh&uacute;chas agus d'fhoghlaim m&eacute; mo chuid Gaeilge i gcathair Phort L&aacute;irge, i scoil nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh l&aacute;idir sin inti i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  N&iacute; mar an gc&eacute;anna na riachtanais foghlama a bh&iacute; againn ach t&aacute; na cearta teanga sin f&oacute;s ann di agus dom f&eacute;in araon.  Is fadhb amh&aacute;in at&aacute; agam maidir leis an gc&oacute;ras T1 agus T2 &eacute; sin.  N&iacute; thugann s&eacute; deis do gach dalta sa t&iacute;r an t-&aacute;bhar c&eacute;anna a dh&eacute;anamh.  Braitheann s&eacute; ar Ghaelscoil a bheith sa cheantar.  T&aacute;im f&eacute;in i mo ch&oacute;na&iacute; i dTr&aacute; Mh&oacute;r agus n&iacute;l me&aacute;nscoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge ann.  M&aacute; chuirtear i bhfeidhm an c&oacute;ras T1 agus T2, is amhlaidh nach mbeidh deis ag dalta i dTr&aacute; Mh&oacute;r an c&uacute;rsa T1 sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p> <p>  T&aacute; fadhb eile agam maidir le c&uacute;iteamh n&oacute; point&iacute; b&oacute;nais a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Caithfimid a bheith mac&aacute;nta.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go dtabharfadh dalta&iacute; faoi &aacute;bhar n&iacute;os d&uacute;shl&aacute;na&iacute; gan c&uacute;iteamh n&aacute; spreagadh &eacute;igin.  De bharr sin, aonta&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; leagtha amach ag F&iacute;ona U&iacute; Uiginn sa phl&eacute;ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is agus an d&aacute; rogha at&aacute; ann.  Ceapaim f&eacute;in go mbeadh s&eacute; sin i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr.  T&aacute; muintir na Gaeilge ag caint le haon ghuth amh&aacute;in ar an &aacute;bhar seo agus &oacute; thaobh an phr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in de.  Caithfear na cosc&aacute;in a bhr&uacute;.  N&iacute;l go leor taighde d&eacute;anta againn go dt&iacute; seo ar an tsraith sh&oacute;isearach.

T&aacute; an t-&aacute;bhar seo pl&eacute;ite go maith ag an gcoiste Gaeilge, go h&aacute;irithe agus muid ag pl&eacute; Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019.  T&aacute;im ag tagairt don cheist chro&iacute;l&aacute;rnach sin: c&eacute;ard is inni&uacute;lacht ann?  Baineann s&eacute; seo leis an FTCE.

Ba mhaith liom deis a thabhairt don chonradh labhairt faoi sin.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil taighde d&eacute;anta ag Ollscoil Mh&aacute; Nuad faoi seo.  Conas gur f&eacute;idir linn &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os fearr sna scoileanna?

I thank the witnesses for their contributions and submissions.  All of the answers are covered there.  It seems to me the problem is the implementation of those suggestions and ideas.  I apologise to Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair but I have to go back to the points that she and Mr. &Oacute; Beaglaoich raised.  They say there has been recent engagement with the NCCA on the curriculum changes.  As far as I am aware these engagements included looking at associated points.  Have the witnesses had any more engagement with the Department of Education since then on the allocation of points?</p> <p>  Within the Gaeltacht areas I am concerned about the reducing numbers in some of the Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;.  What would the witnesses propose to do about that?  Some of that is due to the depopulation of rural areas but I am particularly concerned that we may end up losing the Gaelscoileanna within the Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Beaglaioch spoke about the literature and said we need more interesting, engaging and modern literature for young adults.  Where does the responsibility for that lie and how can we progress that?</p> <p>  I hear what Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair is saying about the love of the subject and how we instil that in young people so they can see a purpose for it.  How do we do that and create a pull factor for post-primary students?  How much of an impact could the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 have, given that it would mean that 20% of new recruits in the public service would need to be proficient in Irish?  Do we have adequate provision in third level through the medium of Irish in further education and in apprenticeships?  Could more courses be provided there as an important incentive and how might we do that?</p> <p>  I am interested in the comments that were made on the European framework of languages.  That needs to be communicated to the wider public beyond the Irish language conversations.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; m&eacute; amach getting my vaccine.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; l&iacute;ofa agus mar sin, I will speak in English.  However, freagra&iacute; as Gaeilge are, obviously, desired and more than welcome.  I have missed some because I was out at the doctor's.  Dr. Hyland was here last week and we discussed the issue of this change that is proposed to the leaving certificate.  Dr. Hyland explained that all 12 organisations involved with the Irish language were not in favour of what was being proposed, and many of us would share those concerns.  One of the difficulties is that when things are very segregated, disadvantage may then be recreated.  That is one of the concerns that was highlighted by one of our guests last week.</p><p> Not only is there siloing between different Departments when it comes to education, but also within education itself.  The NCCA is doing one thing, we are doing another, and the Department is doing another.  This is in addition to the programme for Government commitment to a citizens' assembly.  Should we be waiting until some of those processes are complete before making any decision about the leaving certificate in the context of the Irish language, when we may be changing the leaving certificate overall following our report, the citizens' assembly or different recommendations?  We still have not seen a draft of the NCCA report on leaving certificate reform, which the Chair raised last week, and yet there is this separate activity going on to reform Irish language.  It seems strange that the two would be separate.  That is my main question and I thank witnesses for coming in.</p></speech>

T&aacute; c&oacute;ras ann le fada an l&aacute; nach bhfuil ag breathn&uacute; ar aghaidh &oacute; thaobh na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta de.  Luaigh m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe go bhfuil sprioc leagtha s&iacute;os ag an mBreatain Bheag chun 40% de na scoileanna a bheith mar scoileanna Breatnaise amach anseo.  N&iacute;l aon sprioc mar sin againne &oacute; Dheas anseo in &Eacute;irinn.  C&aacute; mbeadh muid anois d&aacute; mbeadh a leith&eacute;id de sprioc tar &eacute;is a bheith againn &oacute; na 1970aid&iacute; ar aghaidh, mar shampla?  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh muid n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; na Breatnaigh agus imithe ar aghaidh go 50% n&oacute; 60%.  An t-easnamh is m&oacute; at&aacute; againn n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon phlean ann ag r&aacute; go bhfuil an oiread seo Gaelscoileanna ann faoi l&aacute;thair, beidh an m&eacute;id seo iar-bhunscoileanna ag teast&aacute;il agus t&aacute;imid chun na hacmhainn&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il chun a leith&eacute;id a dh&eacute;anamh.</p> <p>  Ceann de na ruda&iacute; is m&oacute; at&aacute;imid ag cloiste&aacute;il le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas n&aacute; go mbeidh na haonaid mar r&eacute;iteach ar an sc&eacute;al seo.  T&aacute; go leor fadhbanna a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh a bheith ag baint leis an bhfreagra sin.  Sin ceann de na freagra&iacute; a tugadh sa D&aacute;ilcheantar againne.  D&uacute;radh go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; an mhe&aacute;nscoil nua a bhronnadh ar Educate Together agus go bhf&eacute;adfadh siad aonad l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a chur ar bun ann.  An fhadhb is m&oacute; a bhaineann leis na haonaid n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon chinnteacht go mbeidh gach &aacute;bhar ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  N&iacute; bhfaighidh daoine an t-eisp&eacute;ireas c&eacute;anna tumtha &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga de i measc na ndalta&iacute; m&aacute; t&aacute; siad i scoil ina bhfuil an B&eacute;arla timpeall orthu chomh maith.

Is teanga &aacute;lainn &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; Fraincis agus Sp&aacute;innis agam ach n&iacute;l m&eacute; chomh l&iacute;ofa as Gaeilge.  Is as B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha na Sluaighe m&eacute; agus nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; &oacute;g n&iacute; raibh a l&aacute;n roghanna &oacute; thaobh Gaelscoileanna sa bhaile sin, ach t&aacute; Gaelscoil ann anois agus t&aacute; Gaelscoil i Ros Com&aacute;in freisin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach agus t&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht ann don Ghaeilge mar &aacute;bhar sa leaving certificate.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam, as B&eacute;arla if that is okay, leis na freagra&iacute; as Gaeilge.</p> <p>  T&aacute; cumas sa teanga agus cumars&aacute;id an-t&aacute;bhachtach.  Language and communication skills were mentioned as being extremely important and reference was made to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, the CEFR.  How do we ensure students doing the leaving certificate have that capability to speak fluently?  I say this because I studied French and Irish at leaving certificate, with French at pass level, and I went on and studied it at degree level in Galway.  I was very fortunate to be able to go on Erasmus and spend a year abroad when I was young.  I did not have the chance to get to the Gaeltacht, unfortunately, despite being from Galway.  How do we ensure our children and students are left with that capability?  It is very difficult to become fluent.  I only know this from French.  I am doing the Gaeilge classes here in the Oireachtas so I hope I increase my level of fluency as Gaeilge as well.  It is nearly like having a bath.  It took six months when I was abroad before I had the ear and was able to speak.  How can we improve that to reach the CEFR so our students can leave school with the ear as Gaeilge?  Perhaps this happens more now that we have Gaelscoileanna at primary and secondary level but how do we do it for other schools as well?  How do we make sure all our schools are able to provide that?</p> <p>  I liked the idea of the subject on sa&iacute;ocht agus litr&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge that Ms U&iacute; Uiginn mentioned, which would teach Irish culture, heritage and literature.  It is absolutely great and wonderful.  I am guessing it would be tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  This particular subject would be of immense interest, particularly to a lot of our newer students.  I am referring to people who have arrived from abroad and settled in Ireland and are now coming into our schools.  I am sure Ms U&iacute; Uiginn is seeing more and more first generation Irish at primary and secondary level.  Would this also be available to them?  Would it only be tr&iacute; Ghaeilge?  I am just curious.  I am just putting it out there because it is something that would be of immense interest to so many.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios agam anois go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; oscailt&iacute; ann le traen&aacute;il mar mh&uacute;inteoir tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge leis an gc&uacute;rsa i nGaillimh, ach ba cheart go mbeadh ar Ollscoil Luimnigh agus ar na hollscoileanna eile a chinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anfadh na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; c&uacute;rsa ar theagasc tr&iacute; Ghaeilge mar chuid den oili&uacute;int at&aacute; ar bun acu.  T&aacute; a fhios agam gur thosaigh Col&aacute;iste na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide, Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath &eacute; sin, agus ceapaim go raibh s&iacute; ag &eacute;ileamh caighde&aacute;n B2 chun dul isteach ar an gc&uacute;rsa.  Is &eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist agam go mbeadh an c&uacute;rsa ar f&aacute;il i ngach institi&uacute;id a chuireann oideachas tosaigh m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; ar f&aacute;il - i Luimneach , i gCorcaigh agus i ngach &aacute;it.</p></speech>

Aonta&iacute;m leis an Teachta.  T&aacute; an fhianaise ann nuair a fheictear an l&iacute;on dalta&iacute; a dh&eacute;anann teanga eile seachas an Ghaeilge, c&eacute; go bhfuil d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine faighte acu &oacute; thaobh fhoghlaim na Gaeilge.

Bheadh s&eacute; in ann freastal ar dhalta&iacute; a thagann isteach go d&eacute;anach sa ch&oacute;ras n&oacute; ar na dalta&iacute; le deacrachta foghlama.  Is &eacute; an sampla is &eacute;asca a thabhairt faoi sin n&aacute; go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; an ardteistim&eacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh sa scr&uacute;d&uacute; b&eacute;il amh&aacute;in m&aacute; ta deacracht mh&oacute;r scr&iacute;ofa ag an dalta.</p> <p>  Ina ionad sin, t&aacute; an c&oacute;ras faoi l&aacute;thair ag seachaint na faidhbe agus ag cruth&uacute; c&oacute;ras d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; nach bhfuil i dt&iacute;ortha eile, go bhfios d&uacute;inn.
