    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#A00200"><p>No apologies have been received.  Deputy Paul Donnelly is substituting for Deputy Martin Browne.  Before we begin, I remind members that in the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room.  All committee members must join remotely from elsewhere within the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate from outside the parliamentary precincts.  Members should mute their microphones if they are not making a contribution and use the raised hand function to indicate.  Please note that messages sent via messaging chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  On the agenda for today is regulation of the sale and supply of pets and animal welfare.  Today's meeting will be in two sessions.  The first will be from 3.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. and will include engagement with representatives from Dogs Trust.  The second, from 4.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., will include engagement with representatives from Horse Care Ireland.</p> <p>  I welcome, Ms Becky Bristow, executive director, and Mr. Conor Brennan, adviser, from the Dogs Trust.  We have received their opening statement and briefing material, copies of which have been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions.  The committee has agreed that opening statements will be taken as read in order that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they will give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I welcome our guests and invite questions from members.  Senator Boylan has been pushing for this meeting for a while, so I will give her the first opportunity to ask questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for accepting my request for this session, particularly in light of the fact that we are more than a year into the online sale of pets.  It is a good time to take stock of the position in this regard.  I welcome Mr. Brennan and Ms Bristow.  They have done a great deal of work on the online sale and supply of pets and where matters could be improved.</p> <p>  The Dogs Trust's previous research found that 68% of the members of the public questioned were unable to spot an illegal advertisement.  Of the 62 advertisements on one online platform, only one was in compliance on a particular day.  It appears that welfare groups, organisations like the Dogs Trust and volunteers are doing the work the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be doing, which is making sure that existing regulations are enforced.  When I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, he confirmed that not a single infringement case had been taken in respect of any online sale advertisements.  That is despite five sample cases, ready for prosecution, were sent to him last December.  The advice that comes from the Department is for consumers to do their own due diligence.  If online platforms do not have access to the information to verify details, then what hope have members of the public?</p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses about the online verifiability and traceability of dogs in particular.  In their opinion, is it possible to have a single national dog breeding establishment database detailing the number of breeding bitches and the location of establishments involved?  When I looked for this information from various local authorities, it was patchy.  In some cases, I had to request it.  In others, it was publicly available.  The Department published its information but it does not have a live database so one cannot keep track of who is on it and who is not.  Can we have something similar to the register for gas fitters whereby it would be possible to go online to verify who the dog breeder is and the level at which he or she is breeding animals?</p> <p>  What is the witnesses' views on microchipping?  There are currently four databases in Ireland.  Is it possible to have some sort of system where information from the four databases is, again, in a single location, so online platforms can not only verify that this is the microchip of a dog but also the type of dog, its age and status?  Those are my first two questions.  Is this stuff possible and are there examples we can learn from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for having us here today and I thank the Senator for her questions.  To answer them very directly, yes, this technology is possible.  It is available and is used by the Government in other ways, for example, in the context of car registration.  To verify a car, its source and what exactly it is, all one has to do is type the registration number.  Plenty of stakeholders are able to access a database to verify whether details put up on an online platform are true.  The online platforms are also able to do the verification up front, which is what we would want.</p> <p>  I will say at the outset that the legislation the Department brought out last year is actually very good.  It was very well thought out.  If it is enforced and underpinned by traceability, we will be in a very good position.  We are not often in a position to do something that will be game-changing for consumers, criminality and animal welfare.  That is why we are today, to ask the committee to empower and fund the Department to put in a verification and traceability system.  These systems already exist in other parts of the Government.  This is not brand-new technology and it is very doable.  It is not acceptable to rely on public or private selling platforms to do all the work.  The reality is that enforcement has to come from the powers that actually put out the legislation.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question very directly, it is absolutely possible to have a single database of breeders and verification of microchipping.  We are very lucky in Ireland that we only have four microchipping databases.  The UK has a multitude of databases, which makes it much more difficult.  All we need to have is a piece of plug-in technology to verify if a microchip is real and whether the details match those of the dog that has been put online for sale.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#A00500"><p>I will quickly add to what Ms Bristow said.  On the Senator's point about registrations that are currently live, local authorities look after the dog breeding establishment, DBE, register.  The situation is disparate and uneven when looking for the register.  The introduction of these rules for the online sale, supply and advertising of pets means there is now a seller-supplier list, which the Department has set up.  If more than six pets are sold in a calendar year, the seller must register.  To its credit, that has been quite successful.  Approximately 500 people are registered on the latest list.  What we getting at with traceability is joining those dots together, basically.  These are two different lists, notwithstanding, say, a charity.  If it is possible to both verify the microchip number and, as is in the rules, also put down the DBE or seller licence number and verify it against the lists out there in the ether within different Departments, that would go a huge way towards traceability and all the other benefits it would unlock that we can discuss.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#A00600"><p>I will ask one supplementary question on that.  Again, for the record, if we want this to work properly, before the sale goes live this information should be verified by the platform.  When the advertisement goes up, the public should know the information has been verified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#A00700"><p>That is more a point than a question.</p><p>I call Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1691" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chair for allowing me in.  I have missed many meetings for different reasons, such as health, and I feel like King Henry IV.  He rarely visited his subjects in his kingdom, and his answer was "seldom seen but much admired".</p> <p>  I have no problem with most of what has been said here.  I agree with it.  My daughter and various family members are animal lovers and have dogs, etc., but I have just one issue.  In the last 12 months, I have been obliged to walk a lot because of my health condition.  I average probably six to eight miles per day.  I am not sure if it is appropriate to raise it here but I have one simple question.  How one can control littering by dogs?  In the significant walks that I do, it is absolutely disgusting.  I have seen my grandchildren walk into poos.  I know that 90% of dog owners are responsible, but there should be some way of highlighting the 10% who disrespect our footpaths.  This morning I walked six or seven miles around Dublin.  I was appalled by the amount of dog excrement on the streets.  I live in Schull, a beautiful place in west Cork.  As I said, 90% of people who have dogs are very honourable.  They look after their dogs and make sure that if they litter, the excrement is picked up.  However, on the 10%, it galls my heart to see a three-year-old toddler walking into this stuff and trying to clean their shoes.  It is only a small issue, but it is something that should be highlighted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#B00300"><p>I thank the Senator.  I call Ms Bristow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#B00400"><p>The Senator is right.  It is about responsible dog ownership.  The Senator may have seen local authorities around the country running much stronger campaigns about picking up after dogs.  Dogs Trust has had a &ldquo;scoop the poop&rdquo; campaign this week about that.  However, there has to be an imposition of fines to make any difference.  A very forward-thinking local authority in Leitrim is currently running a test run of genetically testing the litter in order to trace back to the dog and, therefore, dog owner who left it behind.  Of course, the dog cannot pick it up.  There are possibilities in the future.  We have local authorities in Ireland which are being imaginative and innovative in finding ways to do this.  However, at the present time, it is about trying to get people to be more responsible.  It is about the public education campaigns on how it is not only disgusting, but it is a very serious hygiene issue for people and for children.  We have all heard the ad campaigns about people who are blind or who are in wheelchairs.  Can one imagine how disgusting that must be for them?  They do not have the possibility to avoid it.  We are heavily involved in campaigning on responsible dog ownership.  However, there are other possibilities ahead.  They would tie into insuring and fining, and making sure that dogs are microchipped.  We could, at the point of microchipping, have a DNA sample to make the dog traceable in future.  There are options to consider to join up all of this, so that Ireland becomes a dog-friendly place, and so that this does not cause difficulties for the humans in the community.</p></speech>

First, I want to welcome Ms Bristow and Mr. Brennan.  I thank them and acknowledge the enormous work they do in Dogs Trust.  It is an impressive charity.  I know a certain amount about it because I know people who are involved in it.  More than 1,000 dogs were rehomed in 2020.  That is a phenomenal success story in itself.  The two areas on which I want to concentrate today are about the funding of Dogs Trust and on the mechanism for funding.  I know it gets many voluntary contributions, but does it get State funding or funding from the local authorities?  The reason I ask is that I carried out a survey of all 31 local authorities about two years ago.  It first identified what money they had received from the Department.  It tried to identify where the allocation was.  What was very clear was that many authorities had not passed on money they had ringfenced for animal welfare.  That raised a number of concerns.  We had serious issues in regard to animals in a number of counties, which were documented in the local and provincial press.  Again, some local authorities were not proactive.  Other authorities are exceptionally proactive.  I would like to hear about the funding mechanism and how it secures funding.  I am sure it never has enough.  The witnesses might talk to us about that and about their relationship with the 31 local authorities.  I do not expect them to take me through all 31 local authorities but, generally, the relationships Dogs Trust has with designated people involved in animal welfare, dogs and related issues.  That is important because I detect inconsistent and patchy commitments in different local authorities.</p> <p>  Where does Dogs Trust get its funding?  What percentage of its funding comes from voluntary sources as opposed to State, agency or Department funding?  Could the witnesses address those two issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#B00700"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  Dogs Trust is a little unusual in that all its funding comes from public donations.  We do not apply for Government funding for animal welfare work at this point in time.  We have a relationship with all local authorities, because we take dogs directly from local authority pounds.  The relationships vary.  On the whole, they are positive.  It comes down to resources in local authorities, where they are applying those resources and what their priority is at this point in time in relation to dogs or dog welfare.  There can be tension between dealing with strays and issues in the community with dogs, versus dogs they have in their care, what they need to do with them, and being proactive to prevent the problems in the future.  I am not sure if this answers the Senator's question.</p> <p>  On the funding side we are a little unusual.  Virtually every other dog rescue and animal welfare place probably accesses considerable State funding, but I do not know of any that are fully State funded.  They all rely on fundraising to do many of their activities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#B00800"><p>Ms Bristow might give us an idea of the cost to run its operations for the year.  If that is sensitive information, I will not push it.  I am pleased that all its money is coming from the voluntary sector, but is it its intention to seek State funding?  It does good work but maybe it is happy enough.  I would like to have an understanding, because we hear of animal welfare groups which are challenged, which say that they have to shut down, and which are under-resourced.   I am thrilled to see that Dogs Trust can manage.  It says something about the Irish people that they are committed to support animal welfare.  I think this is brilliant.  I would like to get a sense if it is cash rich?  Does it not need any money?  Is that what Ms Bristow is telling us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#B00900"><p>I would not say that at all.  The Senator may not be aware of it, but we are part of the wider Dogs Trust group.  We are the Irish subsidiary.  We certainly would not have been able to do any of what we have been doing for the last 15 years, as we are not raising all the money we need in Ireland.  We are being funded by donations from other parts of the Dogs Trust group.  There is a big priority on dog welfare in Ireland.  This is because ten to 15 years ago, we saw an enormous rate of destruction of dogs in dog pounds.  We are part of a much bigger charity.  I could not say that we are cash rich in Ireland, but the Irish public is very supportive of us.</p> <p>  The cost of running our operations is public information and is in our annual report.  I would struggle to put my finger on the exact figures for everything at this point in time, but I am happy to send that on and share it.</p></speech>

In my own part of Cork South West, many people will appreciate this discussion today on the care and safety of dogs.  Dog theft has become such a huge issue.</p><p>What is the reason for the delay?  Why has the Department taken no dog theft case to date?  Is it to do with proof?  What is slowing up this process because it is vital that a clear message is sent to those seeking to engage in this nasty crime that they will get a serious rap on the knuckles for it?  Could the witnesses give their insights into why no case has been taken?</p></speech>

This is why the traceability and verifiable checks in advance are needed.  Enforcement is not really possible without this.  Take the case of a dog that is stolen or is of unknown origin.  An advertisement is put on an online platform and the dog is either sold or the advertisement is taken down without any fuss before one could really gather the evidence and search to see whether there is an issue.  Trying to track would be an insurmountable job for anybody, which is why it must be automated.  It relates to the quantity of what is happening.  Yesterday, we looked at one website with 48 pages containing over 400 advertisements for dogs for sale with an average price of &euro;1,500.  This is &euro;3 million worth of money on one website on one day.  To find one case quickly enough to track it down and force something is very difficult.  This is why automating and verifying in advance would bring about traceability and much easier enforcement because all the data would be there tracked and gathered.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Boylan for making sure this issue was raised in the committee.  Sometimes time is very limited and we all have our own priorities.  As a farmer, this issue would probably not have been top of my priority list so I compliment Senator Boylan for making sure it was raised here today.</p> <p>  Earlier in the year, I raised in the Seanad the issue of sheep worrying.  When I researched it, I was dumbfounded to find that the last report on the implementation of the Control of Dogs Act stated that while there are an estimated 800,000 dogs in the country, only 217,000 of them are chipped.  This is unbelievable.  That is the thrust of my questions.  In any walk of life and in any instance, it is very easy to police the compliant.  How do we overcome non-compliance?  Reading the briefing note, I was confused by the jumping from Department to Department.  They say that too many cooks spoil the broth.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is responsible for the Control of Dogs Act in conjunction with local authorities, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible for the micro-chipping of dogs.  It is frustrating for me to even get my head around the briefing note going from one Department to the other.  What would be the ideal solution?  How can we bring this under one umbrella?  Would that improve things?  </p> <p>  When I spoke about sheep worrying, what seemed to come to the fore was an ignorance, for want of a better word, on the part of even responsible pet owners about how their dog would perform off the leash.  It was a case of "my dog is a pure pet".  They did not realise what their timid, tame and loveable dog might do once it met up with another dog once it was off the leash and took on a pack mentality.  Somebody suggested to me that when a person went to license his or her dog, there should be a simple theory test along the lines of the driver theory test.  It would be a tick-box exercise that would highlight the responsibilities of responsible, dedicated and, for want of a better word, good owners so that a person would have to take something similar to the driver theory test to get a licence.  If nothing else, it would highlight the responsibilities owners are taking on as registered pet owners.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#C00500"><p>That is a problem we came across a number of times.  As regards the Senator's question as to whether there could be an umbrella group, the different pieces of legislation are working in their own way.  If we were to strengthen or modernise the DB licence list so that each local authority digitises and updates the list and ensures it is updated on a regular basis and contains sound information, in a similar way, if we make it accessible for the seller and supplier list, which has now been live for a year and a half, we would then empower the person looking to buy a dog online to do his or her own research.  Once a consumer knows the micro chip is verified and has a dog breeder, DB, licence number or potentially a seller or supplier number, he or she can easily access where they are on the list and where the dog is coming from.  If it is DB licensed, the consumer will have the information that should be available on local authority websites.  Instead of what I can imagine might be a convoluted process of bringing the list together, which would be great, the tools are in place and it seems there is a modernisation of these lists so that gives a consumer power and he or she knows where he or she is getting the dog from and that the micro chip has been verified.  The second part of that goes back to the idea that where someone is selling online, and it is in the rules that a person needs to list a legitimate micro chip number, that person must verify that before it goes live.  The person must put in the details, get a one-time code and put that code in.  The code is verified against the person's PetNet and only then can the advertisement go live.  That mechanism can verify that the dog is correct and unlock a significant amount of information that is legitimate and verifiable that the consumer can use to make his or her decision.  This where we are coming at it from.  That would be a game changer for us.</p></speech>

I was a member of the committee dealing with dog ownership in Fingal County Council for six years.  We had a very serious issue regarding the pound.  Would it be better for one Department to have overall control of all issues relating to dogs and pets?  A simple "Yes" or "No" will do.  Would it make a significant difference?  If too many people are involved in it, it just confuses things.  Senator Boylan and I spent a bit of time trying to figure out who is responsible for what and at what stage.  If we are doing that here, I am sure the ordinary lay person would be totally confused.</p> <p>  I am very interested in how we could ban cash sales.  It is regulated to a certain extent but is not really enforced to a great extent so how would that work?  My next question concerns the rate at which dogs are destroyed.</p><p>Ms Bristow has mentioned that this has improved.  Has that improvement been seen across the board or are there certain areas in which it is still an issue?  </p><p> My last question is on a matter in which I have an interest.  How do we define dangerous breeds?  One German shepherd might be an absolute pet and a dote while another may be trained to be a guard dog.  There is a local guy who lives around the corner from me who trains German shepherds for movies and television.  It is incredible how intelligent and well-trained his dogs are.  The issue relates to how certain breeds of dogs are perceived.  I have a husky and some perceive her as a dangerous dog.  She would be more likely to lick a person to death than to bite someone but there are other huskies that have caused problems in our local park.  How do we get around that?  How do we improve the definition?  I always say that it is a matter of bad owners rather than necessarily one of bad dogs.</p><p> In addition to the different Departments, we also have all of the local authorities, some of which operate in a better and more effective way than others with regard to dogs.  Would it be better for such matters to come under one organisation or Department, separate from the local authorities?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#D00200"><p>There were a number of questions there.  I thank the Deputy very much.  At the end, I will let Mr. Brennan pick up on the questions regarding the local authorities and a single Department.  On cash sales, the big-picture thinking going on in the UK on these matters is quite interesting.  Discussions are under way there regarding the possibility of banning cash sales of pets.  I am not sure if people would be clear as to why this is such an issue.  The cold hard reality is that once cash is involved, criminality is allowed for.  This results in a lack of revenue for the Government and allows poor welfare to be hidden.  That is our concern.</p> <p>  How would one go about banning it?  It is quite an interesting question.  If one made a lot of noise about banning cash sales of pets, members of the public might start to ask themselves why they are being asked for cash, so quite the same level of enforcement as is needed for other legislation might not be required.  Even just talking about it enough and getting people to stop and think about why legislation and a ban on cash sales is being considered might cause them to ask why that is the case.  Then, when they come to pay for a pet, they may say that they do not wish to pay cash.  We all know that people sometimes choose to pay cash for various reasons but in this space, people accept it so readily that they do not realise what is wrong with it.  As to how such legislation would be brought in, I have to respectfully say that is not my area of expertise but I believe the mere fact of bringing in such legislation and talking about it would make an enormous difference.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about the rate at which dogs were being destroyed.  It is really about where they are being destroyed.  Fifteen years ago, 26,000 dogs were put to sleep in local authority pounds in one year.  In 2019, fewer than 400 were.  That is a massive sea change for which we are deeply grateful.  A lot of work went into that in terms of what happens to the dogs.  They get rehomed and there is also more neutering going on so there are fewer accidental litters.  However, Dogs Trust research has uncovered that part of the problem has moved to private vets.  People are acquiring dogs from low-welfare breeders.  These puppies are not socialised and have health issues and, unfortunately, are having to be put to sleep by vets at quite a young age because of behaviour and difficult veterinary issues.  That is a problem. </p> <p>  Although I will own up and say that I do not have specific research on this, we also question what happens to some dogs.  We have 90 licensed dog breeding establishments in this country, some of which have 100, 200 or 300 breeding females.  What happens to them when they are finished?  We do not know.  The issue has, therefore, improved as it pertains to the local authorities.  They have really got on board with the improvements that can be made.  We feel that the problem has moved elsewhere and that it is still a problem that needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about dangerous breeds.  Dogs Trust is very clear in saying that it is about the deed not the breed.  I would say that it may be a matter of a dangerous owner rather than one of a dangerous dog.  We are not in favour of the restricted breeds list.  We feel that one of the things it does is suggest to people that a German shepherd is a problem while a Labrador is not.  It is about how owners socialise dogs as puppies, how they treat them, how they interact with the dogs and how they teach people to interact with them.  It is about learning about dogs' behaviour and knowing the warning signs so that bites do not happen.  A very big part of what we do in Dogs Trust is educating children and adults about dog behaviour.  I strongly believe it is not appropriate to categorise particular dog breeds as dangerous.  It is very much a question of the individual dog and the circumstances in which it has been bred and trained.  Sadly, it is often being badly treated that leads to those behaviours.  I will hand over to Mr. Brennan because the Deputy had some questions about the single Department and the local authorities.</p></speech>

Does Ms Bristow have figures on rehoming for the last couple of years?  Have the numbers being rehomed increased significantly in recent years?  To go back to a point made by Senator Boyhan earlier, if Dogs Trust had extra resources, would it be able to get more dogs rehomed?  If Dogs Trust is involved in this rehoming, could Ms Bristow tell me whether those dogs are being rehomed in Ireland or if they are being exported to be rehomed?  If I caught her correctly - and the sound quality on these Zoom calls is not always perfect - I believe Ms Bristow said that there were 100 breeding establishments in the country.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Are they breeding greyhounds?  Are they what we consider to be puppy farms?  Is there a breakdown of the different breeds involved?  It is my understanding that it takes six breeding bitches to be considered a breeding establishment.  I believe that is included in the legislation.  Does Dogs Trust have figures as to how many breeding bitches each individual breeding establishment has?  Is there a register?  With regard to greyhounds, if one has more than six brood bitches, one has to register as a breeding establishment.  Is there a register for other breeds as well?  I have thrown a good few questions at Ms Bristow.  If she has the answers, well and good, but if not, she might supply them to the committee later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#D00800"><p>Certainly.  I thank the Chair for those questions.  We are heavily involved in rehoming.  We have been rehoming an average of 2,000 dogs a year from Ireland via Dogs Trust for the last decade.  In the last year, we rehomed 1,200 in Ireland.  Prior to the pandemic, we did have to rehome some via our rehoming centres in the UK.  We are not the only charity to do so.  It is better to have them travel a little distance and be rehomed than to have them face the alternative.</p> <p>  What could we do with more resources?  The reality is that any more resources should be used to tackle things upstream.  Rather than getting to the point at which dogs are surrendered and end up in pounds for rehoming, I would encourage the provision of more resources to tackle matters upstream, including low-welfare breeding and the lack of traceability.  These are the dogs that end up needing rehoming.  I encourage the provision of resources to deal with these matters.  I hope that answers the Chair's question on rehoming.</p> <p>  In the figure of 90 dog breeding establishments, DBEs, I quoted, I excluded greyhound breeders.  These 90 DBEs are specifically those that breed what we categorise as pet dogs.  Each local authority has its own list.  Less than half of these are online so I would have to travel to the local authority and request the list to see who was registered and for how many breeding females.</p><p>One central online list is something that would be absolutely paramount to get.  It is a licence issued by the State so I do not see any reason it should not be publicly available to be searched.  They were the questions I noted.  Members may let me know if I missed anything.</p></speech>

The figure she gave for breeding establishments is fairly strong; I would not have thought it was so high.  The fact there is not an active register available is definitely something that should be rectified because it is very hard to keep proper welfare standards in place if we do not know exactly what we are dealing with.  I thank Ms Bristow for that information.</p> <p>  I am sorry for keeping Mr. Brennan waiting.  Will he give the rest of the answer to Deputy Paul Donnelly's question?</p></speech>

The key Departments involved are Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Rural and Community Development.  That in itself is not the issue though.  We would hope that if they were under one Department there would be more joined-up thinking.  The fact they are under say, two Departments, mainly, is not in itself the issue.  We encourage more joined-up thinking, crucially around something like the dog breeding establishment, DBE, licence register as it relates to say, the online advertising of dogs.  There is a connection there; it is in the rules that if a person has a DBE licence he or she must list it but more joined-up thinking is needed about how compliance is really strengthened because at the moment, I do not know if it is lack of education but there is a severe lack of compliance.  Therefore, we really urge that there be joined-up thinking.  The Department is hoping to review the DBE Act.  It had a consultation on the Control of Dogs Acts and we are continually telling it to ensure this fits in with the legislation from other Departments.</p></speech>

When I went looking on some of the platforms, I saw one particular seller had &euro;60,000 worth of dogs for sale in one week alone.  That gives an idea of the scale we are talking about and the revenue potentially lost there as well.  Mr. Brennan has probably addressed some of that but does that traceability help with the Revenue keeping track of this?  Of course, we all want people to go for rescue dogs.  However, if a person chooses to buy a particular breed of dog from a supplier, what sort of consumer protections are in place if there are no companion animals to find, because they are in this no man's land?</p> <p>  I also want our guests' opinions on something else.  Senator Paul Daly was talking about sheep-worrying and so on.  One of the Bills I have been working on with the DSPCA relates to linking the microchip to the licence system as a proof of ownership.  In the current situation, a person can get a dog licence within a matter of hours online and there is a space for a microchip number but he or she is not obliged to fill it in.  Does the trust agree it would be helpful to have that joined-up approach?  That way we are not denying the local authority the revenue from the licence fee but we are bringing that joined-up approach to it, whereby the microchip and the licence are the proof of ownership.  Those are the two points I wanted to raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Becky Bristow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#E00700"><p>We would absolutely support linking the microchip to the licensing.  Anything that joins up the traceability and the ownership can only be a good thing.  I will give the committee a sense of the size of the market, and this is only a vague estimate.  Last year, 125,000 dogs were microchipped in Ireland, and at an average price of &euro;1,500 that is &euro;187 million.  That is &euro;187 million, primarily in cash transactions, which is not traceable.  This is a big deal.  This is an industry.  It is not about someone's friend's dog having the occasional accidental litter.  From a consumer protection perspective, a person has no idea who he or she is getting this dog from.  If there are any issues with it, be those health issues or that it is not the dog people thought it was - we have numerous cases where it is a different type of breed, older, very sick dogs - a person may be going back to a phone number that may no longer be connected.  Therefore the issue of traceability and consumer protection is huge.</p> <p>  The same is true for the lost revenue angle, in the form of lost VAT, income tax and corporation tax.  Obviously, we are here to say that for us it comes back to dog welfare but all of this interconnects.  When people can hide behind all this lack of traceability and verification, they can breed dogs in utterly deplorable conditions.  We got 37 dogs in recently from a puppy farm, which was an illegal one, and we had to get a counsellor in because the staff were so traumatised by what they saw of these breeding females.  We accept breeding is a necessity but it must be done in good welfare conditions, which is completely possible.  It is possible to make a profit from it given the price of dogs these days.  Obviously we say: "Adopt, don't shop" but we completely understand people may want a particular breed or a puppy but at the moment there is no way for the public to know where they are getting the dog from.  There is no way for them to do the right thing when they want to do the right thing.</p></speech>

It is my experience on this committee that when we deal with any issue that crosses multiple Departments, problems and complications arise, which simply would not happen if there was a very clear demarcation of responsibility.  We are dealing with a scenario where obviously the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a very clear role and the Department of Rural and Community Development seems to have a less clear role and then the role of local authorities is mixed so it is almost as if there are three Departments involved.  I note from some media reports that the staff of the dog control unit in the Department of Rural and Community Development have raised concerns about where they are.  What does Ms Bristow consider to be the best way to approach this issue holistically with respect to what type of structure should be in place?  My view is that local authorities have a very important role to play.  They are the bodies that are on the ground with staff on a county-by-county basis so should there be a role for them at State-wide level and how should it operate if we were starting with a blank sheet?</p> <p>  Finally, I understand Dogs Trust Ireland is a charity and there are a number of different charities, which I am sure all have their own distinctions in terms of policy priorities and so on.  Again, it has been my experience that when a public service, which is essentially what we are talking about here, is outsourced, even to charities, problems arise, errors can happen or gaps will emerge.  Is there a way whereby all the charity organisations and other stakeholders can work together such that the work of ensuring dogs, the public and everybody else are kept safe and that these things are happening in a transparent and clear manner, is guided at departmental level?</p></speech>

I would love to speak as if we had a blank page but I am going to operate on what we do have.  The cold, hard reality is that although there are multiple stakeholders in this, it must start with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>It has to start with taking responsibility and creating the ability to verify those details.  Even if we just started with the verification of microchips, that would be a big step forward.  Where the Department of Rural and Community Development comes in is in having that one list of licensed DBEs.  That would be its key input.  A critical issue for both Departments is to also request a tax registration number for the DBE licence, for getting on to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's list.  All of this will allow traceability for the Revenue Commissioners, which can only be a good thing from the Government's perspective.</p><p> The charities are all aligned on this issue.  I have been getting comments all day from the DPSCA, the ISPCA, Blue Cross and MADRA.  We are fully in agreement that this is the game-changing measure that is needed and we will all row in behind it.  One of the big things the charitable sector can do is educate the public.  Some 52,000 people signed a petition asking for this legislation to be enforced.  The public want it to happen and we can help support charities in educating the wider public about what responsible dog ownership is and how to acquire a dog responsibly.  Verifying the online sale information is the critical action that is needed right now and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to take responsibility for that.  There is literally no other way.  For a year, all the various stakeholders have been talking about this, pointing out different issues, and saying it should come under another Department or the different platforms.  The reality is that the owners of the legislation have to take the next step.  I know they are interested.  I ask the committee to empower and fund them and hold them responsible for doing this.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Anthony Collins, Mr. John Joe Fitzpatrick and Mr. Mich&eacute;al Leahy from Horse Care Ireland.  They are all joining us remotely from a witness room in Kildare House.  The witnesses' opening statement has already been circulated to members.  We are limited in time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions and so the committee has agreed that the opening statement be taken as read, in order that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and publicly available.</p> <p>  Regarding parliamentary privilege, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Michael Collins.</p></speech>

If not for his co-operation this debate might never have taken place so that is much appreciated.  I welcome the witnesses from Horse Care Ireland.  I have a few questions for them but appreciate that they might not be able to explain the whole system to us.  It looks like a good proposal but I need to get it into my head.  The opening statement states:</p> <blockquote> 	The online passport is similar to all other farm animal identifications, with one powerful addition of DNA being used to identify and trace all canine and equine animals dead or alive.  This system puts a person and a location with every animal. </blockquote> <p>I ask the witnesses explain how this can happen.  I come from an area where a lot of dogs have attacked sheep.  The opening statement also notes, &quot;The farming community has seen first, hand the shocking attacks on sheep and the worrying of other farm animals by out of control dogs&quot; and that it was during discussions about these problems that the concept of an online passport was brought up.  I ask the witnesses to explain that further.  The submission also states that &euro;6 million is being spent annually on unidentified animals and the different issues that have to be dealt with in that regard.  The taxpayer has been exposed.  Can the witnesses see a solution to that in their plans?</p></speech>

With the online passport, the person will be linked through a PPS number, the location will include the equine number or canine number and dogs will have their microchip and the DNA.  Then we will have a situation where every animal has a person and a location to its name.</p><p>That will ensure that irresponsible ownership will be reduced, at least. </p><p> What was the Deputy's second question?</p></speech>

Mr. Collins stated that in discussions in respect of these problems, the concept of an online passport emerged.  Perhaps Mr. Collins can explain that further and how its introduction might eradicate the attacks on sheep by dogs.</p></speech>

If a dog leaves its DNA on a carcass, it is traceable to a location and to an owner.  That would be a big step forward for us.  In the case of worrying, if the sheep are not actually killed, it may prove more difficult.  However, it is the best we can do right now.  Perhaps the dog industry can come up with something more robust.  The DNA is the key.  The DNA will enable us to trace the owner and the location of the dog.</p></speech>

The taxpayer is being exposed.  Does Mr. Collins see a solution here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#G00500"><p>The equine and canine industries are driving the &euro;6 million spend.  The one single factor in both of those cases is irresponsible ownership and possibly the lack of ownership.  Operators are buying and selling in the black economy and animals have become valueless, particularly in the equine industry where horses are stamped out of the food chain and the taxpayer is responsible for the disposal of the carcass.  An equine animal that ends up in the knackery has lost its value to the food chain. According to our figures, the cost is almost &euro;2,000 per animal.  On top of that, these horses must go to the knackery.  That costs another &euro;800.  Therefore, every equine animal that is stamped out of the food chain costs the taxpayer almost &euro;3,000.  The Irish taxpayer was never alerted to any of this nonsense in respect of the equine industry.</p> <p>  In the canine industry, with the online passport, we will be able to regulate the breeders.  We are tackling the black economy in the industry through the stipulation that no animal can move from one ownership on the online passport to another, without that owner having a registered premises.  It cannot be transferred on the system.  The domestic units that are breeding puppies are contributing hugely to the animal welfare issues in the canine industry.  With the online system, we are proposing that every owner has a canine premises.  Moreover, in respect of both the canine and equine industries, a yearly census is to be carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is the policing tool for both industries.  Every movement of a horse or a dog will be traceable.  There will be traceability of where the animal is coming from and where it is going, more importantly.  With an online passport, the animal cannot leave the owner's premises to go to an unregistered premises.</p> <p>  With the online system, in the case that animals that are found dead, whether they are canine or equine, it does not matter when they are found.  If, for example, they are found 15 years later off the cliffs of County Clare, or wherever they are found, the DNA remains, and the last person who owned the dead animal, whether dog or horse, will be subject to sanction because he or she can be identified.</p></speech>

I am interested in the issue of traceability, and in particular, the DNA situation which would apply to both the equine and canine issues that we have discussed.  As somebody who hailed from a farm and was fairly involved with sheep, albeit mountain sheep, I am aware of the huge damage that was done and is still being done by a minority of careless dog owners who do not secure their dogs, particularly at night, when these attacks occur.  In cases of the worrying of sheep, sometimes the sheep abort, are injured or killed.  That issue is perhaps not as prevalent as it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it still happens.  It is an important issue.</p> <p>  In respect of the equine industry, Mr. Collins made a point on the cost to society and the taxpayer in the case of dead animals being dumped or horses being sent to the knackery   It is much more significant than I had realised.  What does Mr. Collins envisage the cost being to a horse breeder or owner?  I am not talking about the likes of Shergar.  I refer to the people who are hobbyists and have perhaps seven or eight horses, ponies or even donkeys, and who are not making huge money out of it.  It is a hobby and they are very caring and loving to their animals.  They make sure they are looked after in winter and summer.  What sort of cost would be involved for a person in west Cork, for example, who perhaps has six or seven horses and a few donkeys, leaving out the canine side?  Will there be extra costs involved in delivering the traceability and microchipping of all animals?  Does Mr. Collins envisage there being extra costs for the farmers with this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#G00700"><p>The cost involved is absolutely prohibitive for many horse owners.  We want the introduction of a cost system that is similar to that of all other farm animals.  Bovine, ovine and porcine animals are all fully identifiable and traceable at a cost of less than &euro;5.  If I wanted to register a foal tomorrow morning, it would cost me between &euro;120 and &euro;130.  The fact that it is cost prohibitive is the single issue that has brought our horse industry to where it is today.  Only 48% of our horse population is identified.   Currently, 52% of the horse population is not identified.  These are the Department's own figures.  The main reason for that the horses are not identified is because it is cost prohibitive.  That cost is used a fundraising mechanism for the passport agencies.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must take back control with our proposed online passport system.  It is a system that will identify and trace both groups of animals but it must be at a cost of less than &euro;5.</p> <p>  I listened to the previous committee session with representatives from the Dogs Trust.  Going forward in the canine industry, I would be cautious of the expense that is involved with the online passport, the DNA and the dog licensing.  If all of those expenses are piled onto dog owners, we will be doing exactly what has been done to the horse industry.  That is how it will end up.</p></speech>

Is he saying that the registration cost of &euro;120 per animal is an encumbrance and is in fact driving some of these horse owners, who are probably not making much of a living out of it, underground?</p><p>It would cause problems down the road.  I am alarmed at the percentage of animals that are not properly registered.  Perhaps the witness might comment briefly on that.</p></speech>

This is unsustainable.  There are moves currently in the EU concerning the horse industry with regard to the way horse regulation is applied in Ireland, the cost of the regulation and the way the regulation was introduced in 2009 for identifying horses.  All of these have contributed to the black economy in the horse industry.</p></speech>

If there is any basis for them at all, they are very concerning figures.</p> <p>  I thank our guests for being here today.  I would also like some clarification following on from the opening statement.  With regard to the costs to the Exchequer and the taxpayer, it would be useful if we were to delve a little into the reference to millions of euro having been lost due to horses being stamped out of the supply chain as a result of poor databases.  Will Mr. Collins explain how one relates to the other?  I imagine that we are talking about the uncertainty of, for example, a horse that is registered late or that there would be a lack of clarity on whether a horse had been treated with bute for inflammation and it would be stamped out.  How exactly and precisely does it result in millions being lost to the taxpayer?  Reference was made to &euro;3,000 being lost to the Exchequer for a horse entering the food chain.  Will Mr. Collins explain how the Exchequer ends up assuming responsibility there?</p> <p>  There is also a reference to funeral expenses and a taxpayer liability, as a critique of the system.  Will Mr. Collins explain how this liability exists, and will he put any potential estimate on where this stands currently?</p> <p>  Going back to the point about the costs of microchipping, why is the cost so high in comparison to the cost for other animals?  What would need to be done at a central level to bring it down to the &euro;5 described by Mr. Collins?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#H01300"><p>The cost of the registration comes mainly from the passport agency and the vet.  In the case of a horse, the vet must come out to insert the microchip at a cost of &euro;60 or &euro;70.  The passport agency then gets anything from &euro;35 to &euro;60, depending on the pedigree status of the foal.  This is where the cost is coming from.  That does not happen across the other farming sectors.  The difficulty we have is that this level of identification is not necessary.  We want a level of identification that delivers for a farm animal.  We want the horse to be clarified as a farm animal in the beginning.  Later in its life, from a three-year-old upwards, if the horse enters the sport industry it comes under the remit of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  This is why there is a breakdown in the identification.  The horse has two different parts to its life.  We are concerned with the first part of the horse's life at farmyard level.  This is where the horse is to be identified, and at that cost.  Would Deputy Carthy remind me of the first part to his question?</p></speech>

My question looks for clarification as to how the taxpayer ends up losing millions of euro through that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#H01500"><p>That process came into effect on 1 July 2009, when Regulation 504/2008 came into effect.  At that time, we were entitled to a run-in period, whereby the passport agency, which is Horse Sport Ireland, moved to remove 52,000 horses out of the food chain for late registration.  It was not for any medicinal reason; it was just for late registration.  The owners of those horses were never told that as a result of the regulation coming in on 1 July 2009 the horses would be sanctioned out of the food chain.  We were told that it would be illegal for the owner, but not that the animal would be sanctioned.  It was the owner who was to be sanctioned.  Because they were unidentified at the time those horses were supposed to be given a run-in period of six months, which we never got.  The Government did not give us this.  We did seek it.  Because that run-in period was not delivered, over the following 12 months some 52,000 horses were put out of the food chain for no other reason.  A horse that is out of the food chain runs up a bill of up to &euro;3,000 for the taxpayer.  This happens because if the horse is in the food chain and is fully processed and on the EU market, be it the French market or wherever, that horse is delivering more than &euro;2,050 for the Exchequer and the Irish economy.  That is lost if the horse does not make it to the food chain.  At the end of its life, before getting to the knackery, the horse may even travel through an animal welfare station.  The horse will end up in the knackery to be processed.  From the time the horse is delivered, through to the processing in the rendering plant, there is a cost of up to &euro;800 from start to finish, at the very minimum.  If you dig into those figures, it will not remain at &euro;3,000.  It will go much above that, but we are taking the lowest figure.  It is &euro;3,000 for each horse.  That can be multiplied by the number of horses that are out of the food chain for no medicinal reason.  How can the taxpayer lift that?  It is too much weight.  It must be questioned and we must get more clarification on it.</p></speech>

I have three or four questions to ask.  I acknowledge the important work that Horse Care Ireland does.  As I asked the previous witnesses, Horse Care Ireland's representatives might outline its sources of revenue in terms of keeping the organisation afloat and covering its costs.  They might also share with the committee any knowledge they have about culls of horses organised or authorised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am thinking in particular of commonages where there are large groups of horses, interbreeding issues and challenges.  What knowledge have our guests of those culls?  They might share that with the committee because it is important.</p> <p>  Does Horse Care Ireland monitor, look at or engage with local authorities?  I am thinking particularly about urban areas where there are many horses, including places in Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Cork and Clare.  Many people keep horses in inappropriate conditions at inappropriate sites or are without sites.  There is an issue in many parts of the country and I would be interested if our guests could share with us any knowledge or synergies on which they are working with other welfare groups or local authorities.</p> <p>  Our guests might also share with us their professional relationship with the local authorities.  Many local authorities have substantial funding earmarked for animal welfare issues and not all of it has been drawn down by many of the local authorities, as I said earlier.  Our guests might just touch on their professional working relationship with local authorities, the challenges involved and any recommendations in that regard.</p></speech>

We were founded in Ballinasloe just after the implementation of Commission Regulation No. 504/2008 in 2009.  We found an awful lot of people had serious problems in recognising there was regulation in respect of horses, that the area was going to be controlled and that sanctions were going to be introduced.  We got those people together and had meetings.  We started off with a voluntary committee, which we still have.  More than 700 members contributed small donations in the first year.  We had an awful lot of meetings throughout the country, giving out information and trying to help people.  We set up a service with one or two local veterinarians and we did horse registration to bring them into compliance for a nominal fee of &euro;30 at that time.  Horses were microchipped in tens.  We went out and gathered them up with farmers and we got them all registered.  Since then, our committee has wound down.  Approximately eight or ten of us work on a voluntary basis.  We have not had funding from anybody.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about working with local authorities.  I am a bit different to the other two members of Horse Care Ireland here with me because I run a horse abattoir for animal slaughter.  We did a cull, destruction killing for the local authorities for Kildare and Laois for a while in 2011 and 2012 when there were many unwanted, low-value horses.  In recent years, the animal welfare people have been taking those horses and rehoming them.  It is not the most economic way for the taxpayer to do that but that is what is happening to most horses.  I had a horse that was removed from lands and went through three welfare establishments before he was found in Cork.  There was obviously money drawn off him for collection three or four different times.</p></speech>

Did all those horses go to registered knackers' yards for culling?   Was the culling overseen by veterinary and animal welfare people?  Mr. Fitzpatrick runs a private practice so he has a lot of knowledge of all of those matters and might share that with the committee.</p></speech>

As the Chair said earlier, we need to seek clarification on the numbers of unregistered horses that have been mentioned because I would question that.  There may be confusion between the categorisation of thoroughbred, non-thoroughbred or whatever.  Thoroughbred foals that will be registered eventually do not have to be registered until 31 December of the year of their birth.  There is good reason for that.  The insertion of a microchip in a very young foal may hinder or stop that foal from suckling its mother.  Unless these figures can be massaged to reflect a time of year when many foals have not yet been registered, I would seriously question the numbers that have been mentioned here today.  We will seek clarification on that matter.</p> <p>  In their submissions and contributions, our guests have talked about the online passport.  Their submission referred to the concept of an online passport.  I would like further clarification as to where Horse Care Ireland is on this matter.  Has it done any worthwhile, thorough research on the possibilities?  Has it had any communication with the powers that be, including the Department, that might progress the implementation of the online passport?  Is it an issue on which our guests have done a lot of constructive work or is it, for want of a better word, a kind of pipe dream?  While our guests have referenced the other animals on the farm and how it works with traceability, I would point out a difference between cattle, sheep and horses.  I am on our guests' side and am playing devil's advocate here.  The difference is that nobody would buy a cow as a pet and nobody will put a sulky cart behind a cow.  A cow will be born onto a farm and will die there or be sold to another farmer, an abattoir or a meat plant.  It cannot be sold again without being registered.  However, some horses are not on farms.  People use horses for events or use them in different ways to farm animals.  While in theory it sounds good, as I said in the earlier session to the representatives from the Dogs Trust, it is easy to police the compliant, the problem is with the non-compliant.  The people who are not registering the horses now will still not comply with an online passport system.  A horse, of any category, must end its life somewhere.  If people are selling horses without a passport, that means people are buying horses with a passport.  Those are the real offenders and that is the root of our problem when it comes to untraceability and the issues we have within the horse community.</p> <p>  The debate over the past couple of minutes seems to have gone down an alley I did not foresee, that is, the exclusion of horse carcasses from the human food chain.  I do not see the relevance of that at all.  If we are solving the issue of unregistered and unlicensed horses, we cannot allow them into the food chain because other than identification, the main purpose of registering a horse through the horse licence is the recording of any veterinary medicines that are applied or administered to that horse during its life.  They all have to be recorded on the licence and if we do not have that record, we do not know what we are allowing into the food chain.  I am not of the opinion that opening up the inclusion of horse carcasses to the food chain will in any way be a solution to the problems we have with horse cruelty and the lack of registration of horses.</p><p>I do not know how we ended up going down that avenue and I am at a loss trying to follow that train of thought.  Will Mr. Collins elaborate on that?  Has work been done on the online passport or is it just a concept or an idea at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mich&eacute;al Leahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060100002#K00200"><p>Nobody is advocating putting horses that are out for late registration back into the food chain.  There is another category of horses for which there are no figures, namely, horses that are out for medicinal treatment.  An unknown number of horses receiving medicinal treatment are out of the food chain.  Many of these horses are on holdings that are drawing farm payments.  They are considered a farm animal and the raising and breeding of horses is considered an agricultural activity.  There is nobody advocating putting horses where we cannot verify them.</p> <p>  Even in the case of horses that go into the food chain, when we compare them with other farm animals, audits for dairy and beef farm animals are carried out under the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, SDAS, and by Bord Bia, but no questions are asked about the medicinal treatment, traceability or registration of horses on the same farm holding and in the same enterprise.  Farm payments will be drawn down for the herd number and horses are on the farm.  As the Chairman has said, our online passport is entirely voluntary.  We have liaised with people with online expertise about how to do this.  </p> <p>  With regard to cattle registration, for instance, a calf can be registered in 20 days.  That cannot be done with a horse if there is DNA and a microchip because the microchip has to be inserted by the competent person.  Personally, I believe a farmer or breeder would be able to do that but, as matters stands, this is not allowed.  Nobody advocating putting horses back into the food chain.  It seems we do not want to have figures on the number of horses we have.  Horses are being registered without pedigree.  They could be of any breed, whether an Irish draught horse or a thoroughbred.  </p> <p>  Every enterprise that is sustainable has an entry and exit and we should improve the entire sector.  This year, we have three teams going to the Olympics.  They are not a reflection of the full industry.  We want to include everybody and make horse ownership affordable to everybody.  Horses are used for people with autism and special needs.  They are as good in their line of work as the horses going to the Olympics.  They have a world-class talent and DNA.  We should not front-load the price to disadvantage people.  Where there is a scheme, there are schemers.  Through ignorance and its application, the legislation has unintended consequences. </p> <p>  In the cattle sector, there is one central database and one entity deals with it on behalf of the Department.  It deals with all of the registrations.  There could be 40,000 calves registered within a week at peak times and the database can deal with that.  The number of horses being registered, both  thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, is much smaller and they are registered over a large part of the year.  We want an online database that handles movements and registrations, as is the case with cattle and dogs.  People should have a registration number and be educated as regards ownership, be that for dogs or equines.  While people's hearts may be in the right place, the unintended consequence of owning a dog is that something might go wrong when the owner lets a dog go for a run while out for a walk.  If the dog does something wrong, is it the dog's fault or that of the owner?  </p> <p>  We have no interest in putting horses into the food chain that cannot be accounted for.  At the moment, medicinal treatment can be bought without prescription and given to a horse without the supervision of a vet.  The problem is that it may not be given to the horse to which it is supposed to be given.  If a horse is stamped out of the food chain, that horse can have medicinal treatment bought for it in compliance with the relevant regulations and with an appropriate passport because it is alive and well, on a holding and has an equine number.  However, phenylbutazone or bute can be administered to another horse, including by mistake.  Horses could eat out of the same feed containers and it could be administered through the feed.  Another horse could actually ingest the medicine.  When that horse goes for inspection, it will have a clean passport and will be eligible for the food chain.</p> <p>  We have owners in the upper end of the equine industry, both the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred sectors, who have stamped horses out for medicinal treatment.  That is fine.  They can afford these horses and they can compete in the Curragh, the RDS or wherever.  If something goes wrong, however, why should the taxpayer subsidise these horses' end-of-life care if the owners who can afford to do so are knowingly putting them out of the food chain in order that they can administer whatever medicinal treatment is deemed necessary by the keeper on a given day?  Why should the taxpayer be potentially left facing a bill for a horse that the owner is fully capable of paying for to compete at international level?  At the end of its life, it is not worth anything.  What difference will it make to the taxpayer when nobody knows about it and the cost of caring for it is indirect cost?  Nobody realises the taxpayer pays that cost.  </p> <p>  We have an unknown number of horses, possibly running in the thousands.  There is more medicinal treatment on the competition side of the sector.  We have a big thoroughbred industry and a good number of horses competing in the non-thoroughbred sector.  It is in that side of the industry, rather than the breeding side, that more medicinal treatment is given.  That does not excuse anybody who makes that decision.  These people are drawing down farm payments of up to six-figure sums and areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments and it is the taxpayer who pays.  </p> <p>  Another point about the practice of stamping animals out of the food chain is that donkeys can be included for the purpose of drawing down farm payments, whereas horses were excluded at one stage.  That has created a problem because if anything happens to those animals, they have to be cared for by animal welfare.  For how many years into the future will that be a cost?  These farmers still have an entitlement of up to 50% for the ANC payments.  </p> <p>  We have several passport issuing offices in the current system.  We have no central hub or database, as exists for cattle.  That is the problem.  As long as we have that system in place, we will have fly-by-night operators, for want of a better term.  Front-loading the cost would mean a charge of between &euro;60 and &euro;80 to call out a vet and another &euro;62 plus &euro;22 charge for a pedigree passport.  The total cost would be nearly &euro;170.  The cost would be significantly higher for a thoroughbred horse.  The cheap option is to register the horse without any pedigree.  A thoroughbred horse can be registered as a non-thoroughbred animal.  There is also the issue for the stallion owner who has covered the mare and supplied the semen.  Stallion owners have no way of knowing if a live foal is born because they do not monitor what happens.  With a DNA base, where an animal cannot be registered without a DNA record, the person would be able to claim back the money to which he or she is entitled.  Some very good horses have been born and registered with white passports, as they are called, without any breeding being recorded.  Some have competed to a very high level in the sport horse industry.</p> <p> No one is advocating threatening food security.  We are trying to rehabilitate that.  All inspections, SDAS and everything else should include horses at farm level, the same as with cattle, and there should be a full record of medicinal treatment.  I hope that explanation brings clarity.</p></speech>

Some very strong statements have been made about medicines being bought on one horse identification licence and being administered to another horse.  That may be the exception but it is not the norm.  It would be remiss of me not to defend myself and my colleagues in that regard.  There are rogues in every sector of life, unfortunately.  We seem to have deviated significantly from the topic, which is Horse Care Ireland and cruelty.  We have gone down many different channels.  The carry-on Mr. Leahy mentioned, if it is happening, would be the exception and not the norm.</p></speech>

I must take issue with one of the comments made.</p><p>There was a warning about linking the dog licence and the microchip in terms of proof of ownership and increasing cost.  A dog licence costs &euro;20.  The current online system has the space for the microchip.  It is the law that the person selling the dog must microchip it.  There is no extra cost to the person who is buying the dog, whether they are getting it as a result of a rescue or from a dog breeder.  The law says you cannot sell or supply a dog that has not been microchipped in advance.  Even then, the microchip costs &euro;20.  Linking the two does not increase those costs.  What it does is ensures that some rogue individual can go to an animal welfare place, finds a dog it likes the look of, goes online, downloads a licence and then walks up and says &quot;That's my dog&quot;, which is what is happening.  It is happening regularly because there is no verification process around the dog licensing.  Anyone can go online and just pay for a licence and get it.<br/><br/>The proposal in this regard is very well thought out.  A very reputable dog welfare organisation has informed me that this is an issue, including when it goes to court in respect of animal welfare breaches.  Unless the two are linked, there is a real issue regarding proof of ownership.  You are obliged to have a microchip, you are obliged to have a licence, but it is the licence that is proof of ownership.  I just wanted to clarify that.  I am not <i>au fait</i>with how it works with horses and so on.  There is no extra cost involved.  This is just bringing the two things together so that there is cohesion.<br/><br/>I am familiar with the work of My Lovely Horse, an animal welfare organisation.  One of its campaigns relates to a ban on online sales.  Most online sales and advertisements are actually for horses, they are not for dogs.  What is Horse Care Ireland's view on the concept of free to a good home?  There are concerns that many adverts are going up online.  These are not just in respect of horses, but those relating to horses are predominant.  The horses involved are described as being available as &quot;free to a good home&quot;, but we do not know what happens to them after that.  Does Horse Care Ireland support the call to ban these ads or does it have an opinion on the matter?</p></speech>

There would have to be change of ownership.  It would have to go to an equine premises that was registered, not some fly-by-night person buying the horse and pretending.  There are flaws in the present system that they might hand over the passport but the change in ownership might never be done.  If there is a microchip and DNA behind the horse, it is the seller's responsibility to protect himself or herself in order to make sure that it is transferred to the next owner so that the DNA can be traced any time from then on.</p></speech>

My experience with the dogs is that you report an ad and that it takes a couple of hours because it has to be reported a number of times for the algorithm to pick it up.  By the time the ad is taken down, the dog has been sold.  Would a solution come from making this information verifiable, so that people cannot put fake information online and adverts will just not go live if the information is incorrect?</p></speech>

It gives me pleasure to welcome Her Excellency Ms Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz, the ambassador of Colombia to Ireland and Mr. Emilio Jos&eacute; Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa, Presidential Counsellor for Stabilisation and Consolidation in Colombia, to discuss matters relating to the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement in Colombia.  I particularly welcome Mr. Emilio Jos&eacute; Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa, who is joining us from Bogota at something of an early hour there.</p> <p>  We will hear opening statements from Ms Cort&eacute;s Ortiz and Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa before going into a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.  As we are somewhat time limited due to Covid restrictions, I ask that members and witnesses be conscious of the time constraints when initially addressing the committee to allow each and every member an opportunity to contribute.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks and it is imperative that such a direction is complied with.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely, outside the Leinster House campus, should note there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present currently does.  I do not anticipate that will arise in the context of this meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex or in the Convention Centre Dublin, where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting today.</p> <p>  For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everybody to bear with us in the event of any technical issues arising.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Go raibh maith agaibh.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement in Colombia.  I have met with some committee members before and we have always had a fluid and open conversation.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to make a brief reference to our bilateral relationship, to the historic gesture of Colombia in receiving 1.8 million Venezuelan migrants and to update the committee on the most significant advances and challenges in the implementation of the agreement.</p> <p>  Both Colombia and Ireland opened embassies in the past three years.  We have a rich agenda, focused on developing economic and social opportunities for our people and co-operation.  Our relationship is based on our shared values such as the essential role of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p> <p>  The political dialogue has been always permanent and open.  President Higgins, visited Colombia in 2017.  The former Colombian foreign Minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, who sadly passed away recently, paid a visit to Dublin in 2019 as the first Colombian foreign Minister to visit Ireland in the 20 years since the establishment of our diplomatic relations.  He visited the D&aacute;il and had a meeting with the committee.</p> <p>  Colombia sees Ireland as a partner that is aligned with the multilateralism scenario.  We highly value Ireland's voice at the UN Security Council and the European Union, especially because Ireland understands the challenges and complexities of implementing a peace agreement.  We are working on mutually beneficial economic opportunities, especially considering the need to reactivate our economies affected by Covid-19.  Colombia has been greatly affected in this regard.  We also are working on strengthening ties in education, innovation and science, among others.</p> <p>  I must highlight the key role that Irish investment has in Colombia.  It includes companies such Smurfit Kappa, which has been in the country for more than 75 years, and Viva Air Colombia, owned by the Irelandia Aviation group, which is the second largest airline in Colombia.  There are many others which have opened recently in the sustainable energy, infrastructure, forestry, fintech, aviation service and pharma sectors.</p> <p>  There is wide room to improve our opportunities.  Visa flexibilisation from Ireland to Colombian citizens will unlock many possibilities to reinforce our people's ties and increase our exchanges in education, trade, investment and tourism.  We hope there could be advances on this matter once the Covid-19 restrictions are reduced.</p> <p>  I want to briefly discuss the historic gesture by the Colombian Government regarding the Venezuelan migrant crisis.  The massive exodus of Venezuelan migrants due to a multidimensional crisis in that country is the world's second largest refugee wave only after Syria.  More than 5 million Venezuelans have fled their country in the past five years.  It is unprecedented in Latin America and has regional and even global implications.  Colombia hosts approximately 1.8 million migrants, almost 30% of Venezuelans leaving their country in the past five years.  Last February, the Colombian Government announced the granting of a temporary protection status to Venezuelan migrants including those in irregular status, which comes to nearly 1 million.  This historic step is widely recognised by the international community and organisations, such as the UNHCR, and other agencies.  The status will grant them access to health, work, education and other public services.  This reflects the Colombian Government's commitment to protecting human rights.  We highly welcome the role of the international community through co-operation in this matter.</p> <p>  I will turn to peace implementation.</p><p>The Government of Colombia is fully committed to the 2016 peace agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, under the peace with legality policy.  My Government has honoured the agreement and the results and measures taken have been recognised in every sphere, including the United Nations Security Council.  The agreement is comprehensive, and covers topics on areas such as rural development, political participation, the end of the conflict, the problem of drugs, victims, implementation and verification.  It is a transversal component of the current national development plan and it is incorporated into the Colombian constitution.  It is estimated that implementation of the agreement will take at least 15 years, and we are in the fifth year of the process.</p><p> Ireland's support for the agreement and its implementation is fully recognised by all Colombians.  I express my gratitude for the public support of President Higgins, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish ambassadors in Colombia and New York, the Houses of the Oireachtas, of course, and, in particular, this committee.  We also recognise the role of Eamon Gilmore as the EU representative for the peace process in Colombia.  Furthermore, we highly value the co-operation of the Irish Government in the implementation, through the UN and the EU, of the trust funds for peace and its sharing of lessons derived from its own experiences and challenges regarding the implementation of a peace agreement.  It has taken Ireland more than 23 years to implement the Good Friday Agreement, GFA.  Today, Irish authorities recognise that peace implementation is an ongoing process, especially in difficult areas such as truth, justice and reconciliation.  The voice of the Irish Government regarding the required permanent commitment and recognition of the advances and challenges in the implementation process is of great importance to us.  </p><p> I have the honour to be accompanied today by the presidential counsellor for stabilisation and consolidation, Mr. Emilio Jos&eacute; Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa, the highest-ranked officer in charge of overseeing the agreement's implementation.  He will share with the members of the committee the concrete results of the integral implementation of the agreement's focus on the victims, as well in the areas of integration, political participation, victims and gender, territorial development, truth systems, among others, and he will address some of the current challenges.  Counsellor Archila visited Ireland and met with this committee in September 2019 and he has also headed the Colombian Government's delegation in the current national dialogue with the leaders of the recent social mobilisation protests in Colombia.  </p><p> As I shared with the committee in my recent updates concerning those protests and the accompanying context, I reiterate that the Colombian Government protects and guarantees the constitutional right of citizens to protest peacefully.  We condemn all types of violence impacting Colombians, without distinction as to its origin, including vandalism and blockades.  I reiterate that my Government has zero tolerance for violations of any human rights and any excessive use of force.  The corresponding authorities are investigating all alleged cases with full autonomy.  We appreciate the support for the call made by President Duque for this meaningful dialogue and encourage the maintenance of a responsible and constructive approach.  I will hand over the floor to Counsellor Archila now.  I am sure we all appreciate him taking the time to address the members of the committee, especially given it is 6.30 a.m. in Colombia.  The counsellor also has a press engagement at 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m.</p></speech>

The ambassador mentioned the visit of the then Foreign Minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, to Ireland in 2019.  We note that he recently passed away.  On behalf of the committee, I extend our condolences to the ambassador and we would be grateful if she would pass on those condolences to the appropriate authorities in Colombia.  Counsellor Archila is welcome and, as the ambassador said, the floor is now his.</p></speech>

I am very grateful for this invitation to address the committee.  I reaffirm what our ambassador just mentioned regarding the political willingness and commitment of President Ivan Duque to the full implementation of the agreements with the former FARC through our policy of peace with legality.  I reiterate how grateful we are for the co-operation we received from Ireland.  The Irish ambassador in Colombia is a wonderful woman.  I feel very acquainted with her.</p> <p>  Obviously, we, the Government of Colombia and President Duque, appreciate the role of Eamon Gilmore, his experience, knowledge and generosity in sharing with us all that experience and knowledge.  We feel Ireland's presence in the Security Council is a key element in the understanding at that level of the complexities involved in the implementation of a peace agreement.  We think it is important to be aware of the magnitude of what has been accomplished and those challenges which remain.  President Duque understands that the agreement was signed not by a government but by the Colombian state.  The agreement was incorporated in our constitution and, therefore, part of the presidential mandate is to implement the agreement in good faith and to do it in accordance with all other political policies.  That is the reason it was so important for us to issue our policy of peace with legality to enable the transparency that will allow Colombians and the international community to be aware of what we aim to accomplish during these first years of the implementation of the agreement.  As the ambassador pointed out, this will be a long-lasting effort.  </p> <p>  We have worked on every aspect of the implementation of the agreement and, in each of those elements, we have been committed by President Duque to ensure we take advantage of the 15-year period of implementation.  An opportunity arises for Colombia in that regard, because many of the issues that must be addressed are ones that should have been addressed decades ago, with or without the agreement.  However, those issues require a longer period of work and consistent advancement to enable what is involved to be achieved.  Therefore, in every area of the peace with legality policy, it will be found that we have worked to have long-term planning in place.  In addition, no money appeared when the agreement was signed and, therefore, it is necessary for us as a society to focus our resources so they match with the importance we give to the accomplishment of every aspect of the agreement.  </p> <p>  This is true in respect of the political guarantees we have granted to the ex-combatants.  The committee will be aware that in less than four years the Colombian state changed its constitution and Colombians who were participating in violence and fighting other Colombians are now in the congress.</p><p>During this period, we granted them security and guarantees so that they could participate in their local elections.  We did that efficiently.  We had the most peaceful local elections in Colombia of the past 60 years.  Many ex-FARC members participated and are now on their local councils as mayors or governors because people voted for them.  We worked on granting the legal guarantees that changed our constitution.  Now, all of the institutions of transitional justice are working, fully financed and producing results.</p><p> At the core of our efforts are the victims.  We work in line with what was agreed in the agreement.  It was believed that victim law needed to be renewed so that we would have another ten years to compensate the victims.  This was done after listening to the victims and learning their expectations.  We went to their representatives and took their doubts and expectations to the Congress of Colombia.  Now we have a new law.</p><p> We have worked on trying to incorporate the ex-combatants, of whom there are a little more than 13,000.  We have been able to support them.  This was illustrated in our most recent survey of them, which showed that more than 75% viewed their future with optimism.  That is far above the level of optimism in the rest of Colombia and probably far above the level of optimism in Ireland.</p><p> We understand that working to stabilise the 170 municipalities that were more affected by violence and poverty is crucial.  Therefore, we have the development programmes with a territorial approach, PDETs.  These are long-term plans with a territorial emphasis grouping the 170 municipalities into 16 subregions.  We have not only produced long-term planning, but we have also focused significant resources compared with the investments that these municipalities received over the past 200 years.  We will leave this planning in place until it reaches the point of providing no returns.</p><p> We understand that, for Colombia, coca crops are a severe menace and that drug trafficking is the source of many of our country's problems.  We have not only maintained the voluntary substitution programme that we received, but we have also created another three programmes, allowing us to move a little more than 100,000 families from growing coca to substitute crops.  That is 400,000 Colombians who are no longer involved in an illegal business that produces so much violence and pain.</p><p> We have addressed the chapter on rural development and rural reform through productive factors, infrastructure, social development and the environment.  We have done all of this with an emphasis on the cross-cutting issues of women, gender and ethnicity.  We have been able to implement the most ambitious and successful demining programme.  We have addressed every aspect, implemented long-term planning and produced results.</p><p> Regarding reincorporation, we have been able to take 98% of ex-combatants into the health system and 98% of ex-combatants are within the financial system.  They are in our national pension system.  If we count how many of them are involved in a productive project that has been implemented or in are long-term jobs, it amounts to more than 50%.  More than 85% of them have attended the type of education that meets their expectations.  We have included additional guarantees in respect of, for example, housing.  Housing was not foreseen in the agreements, but President Duque understands that we need to work on their housing.  We have delivered housing solutions to many of them and we have a plan to ensure that the 13,000 are covered.</p><p> Regarding the PDETs for the 170 municipalities that were more affected by violence and poverty, we are investing approximately 5 billion Colombian pesos in those municipalities.  This is ten times the budget of the National Roads Institute, INV&Iacute;AS, the entity that provides for arterial roads in Colombia.  We have supported the transitional jurisdiction by not only not interfering with its work, but by providing the financial support it needed.  In line with that, this committee will be aware that we approached the UN Security Council and asked that the UN accompany Colombia in overseeing the completion of the sentences that should start being awarded this year to people who were involved in that violence.</p><p> I am glad to be attending this meeting, although I am sorry that it is not in person.  I enjoyed my visit to Ireland and I would prefer to be there for this meeting.  I hope that a visit can be arranged in the near future.  If there are specific questions, I will be more than glad to answer them.</p></speech>

I want to home in on three areas in respect of which I have specific questions for both witnesses.  They relate to the ongoing protests urgently taking place across Colombia, human rights in general and the peace protest.  We saw major mobilisations commence on 28 April right across Colombia.  That was initially to reject the proposed tax reforms that ordinary Colombians would have said disproportionately increased living costs for the lower and middle classes.  The protests also focused on long-running demands in response to increasing poverty, corruption, the murder of social activists and the failed implementation of the peace process.  Since the commencement of the national strike we have seen gross violations of human rights, arbitrary murders and killings of protestors.  Video evidence has been widely circulated on social media showing that the police are guilty.  I have seen it as have many other people, including those in human rights organisations.  It shows the shooting of live ammunition and the firing of gas canisters at people&rsquo;s faces right into their eyes.  That is a practice borrowed from Chile.  We have seen where there have been arbitrary arrests, sexual assaults and young people committing suicide as a result of sexual assaults being perpetrated on them by state players.  We have also seen many videos of people being shot at by people wearing civilian clothes and these are protesters.  In one incident we have seen several men exit from a truck and open fire at civilians, protestors, and later police IDs and jackets were found in that vehicle.  It has been widely established by human rights organisations such as Temblores that between 28 April and 21 May it is estimated there have been more than 2,900 cases of police abuse, more than 43 apparent killings by state forces and 39 reported cases of eye injuries mainly as a direct result of the purposeful firing of gas canisters into protestors&rsquo; eyes.  There have been more than 1,200 arbitrary arrests and more than 21 cases of sexual assault.  Also, worryingly, there have been reports of hundreds of protestors who have gone missing, having been taken into police custody and whose whereabouts is unknown.  There is considerable video evidence online of people who had been taken into police custody having been summarily executed and their bodies having been dumped in rivers by state forces, which is concerning.</p> <p>  I wish to make some specific points regarding that.  Only last week the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Michelle Bachelet, asked for an independent investigation into what is happening in Colombia regarding the state crack down on protestors.  Will Colombia support an independent investigation into what is happening there?  I listened intently to what the ambassador said.  She did not explicitly condemn any human rights abuses against the protestors, including the killings and firing of projectiles into people&rsquo;s faces, but she might take the opportunity to do so.  There has been a massive international response to these atrocities.  It is not something that happened without being looked upon in horror by the world, hence the welcome statements from the UN High Commissioner.  Will the details of all the people who have been taken into police be made public?  There is great concern that people who have been taken into police custody have subsequently been found dead on roadsides and in rivers.  It is crucially important that full information is made available on people who have been officially arrested and subsequently released and those who are still missing.</p> <p>  I wish to express my solidarity and support for the national strike committee on the need for meaningful negotiations to take place between the Colombian authorities and the committee.  I support the national strike committee's principal demand, namely, to stop all violence.  </p> <p>  I wish to focus on the issue of human rights in general.  With the protests commencing earlier this year Colombia has unfortunately been in the international eye for gross human rights violations over many years.  According to the UN verification mission, 133 human rights defenders were killed in 2020, 117 were killed in 2019, 115 were killed in 2018 and 105 were killed in 2017.  Unfortunately, more human rights defenders are being murdered on an annual basis and those figures are growing.  That is a major concern.  There needs to be full engagement with the National Commission on Security Guarantees and participating organisations to ensure the definition and implementation of a public policy to dismantle parliamentary successor groups, which must take place.  I look forward to hearing the response to that.  There is a need for total reform of the police services.  People have called for moving responsibility for the police from the ministry of defence to a civilian department, disbanding the anti-riot force and other measures.  Can the witnesses advise if there will be any reform of the police services within Colombia?</p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the peace process.  Since the commencement of the peace process in Colombian some positive strides have been made but there are areas of serious concern.  The implementation of the peace agreement has been slow in many areas and some opposition politicians in Colombia are concerned about the gross underfunding of the process.  Human rights organisations and opposition politicians suggest a different picture compared to that portrayed by the Colombian authorities and they single out the areas where slowest progress is being made, which are the chapters focused on the root causes of the armed conflict, namely, the rural issue and land reform.  There is also concern about the number of former FARC combatants who have been assassinated to date.  It is estimated more than 270 FARC members have been assassinated since the commencement of the peace process in 2016.  That is deeply concerning.</p><p>We need to see the full implementation of peace and renewed efforts by government to bring an end to attacks on former members of FARC and on the peace process in general.  There needs to be maximum protection for former members of FARC and increased attention to the legalisation of land titles, provision of land to peasant farmers and measures to provide former FARC combatants with access to land to facilitate development of socioeconomic projects.</p><p> I will touch on the prioritisation of the mutually agreed coca substitution.  I listened intently to the figures given there but more needs to be done in terms of programmes, financial payments, access to alternative economic projects and an end to the forced eradication programmes in communities where manual substitution has been agreed.</p><p> There are many points there but, to sum up, I ask about human rights, the protests and the huge concerns around the peace process.</p></speech>

Having regard to Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa's engagement in the negotiations to bring parties to the national strike and the protests together, I turn to him first to deal with the issues raised, and then I will move to the ambassador.</p></speech>

We feel sorrow for people affected by the strike and by protestors who did not behave according to the standards.  We feel sorrow and solidarity for people who have been affected by police or other authorities that have abused their power.  We are committed to the investigation of all affected people.  We feel the same in relation to policemen and public servants that have been attacked.  There is no distinction between our commitment to the investigation and the resolution that those actions that were outside the rule of law need to be investigated.  All people who have acted outside constitutional and legal standards need to be investigated and, if found guilty, punished.</p> <p>  We are committed to the highest standards of human rights in the regular life of Colombia and, in particular, in the time of protest.  We are open with all our attitude to co-operate and facilitate the investigation by all the independent authorities in Colombia.  The general attorney's office is an independent branch of the Colombian state, as are the procuradur&iacute;a and the contralor&iacute;a.  They have been accompanying this process and are doing their job in relation to the people affected.  Vice President Marta Luc&iacute;a Ram&iacute;rez was in Washington and Ambassador Cort&eacute;s Ortiz will go into detail on the timing of the visit of the human rights mission.  We added that to the presence of the United Nations representative for human rights.  We agreed to that and have been acting to have those guarantees for the people who are peacefully protesting.  </p> <p>  In accordance with President Duque's instructions, we are hearing the voices of the national strike committee and having regional talks in all areas of Colombia with people who are marching and expressing their opinions.  At this moment, we have more than 42 of these dialogues and negotiating processes around the country.  I will meet the national strike committee again in a few hours and we have been more than open to their expectations that we enter a negotiation sphere.  However, we have said that the blockades of our roads need to come to an end.  The blockades of our roads and communication systems have caused a huge amount of sorrow and pain.  They have affected all Colombian people.  They have affected people in the countryside.  They have caused people not to receive medicines and made food and supplies very costly.  They are more costly than they would have been if the tax reform was passed.  There is no provision in our law, Ireland's law or any country's law to permit protestors to decide who goes through the country or decide which products can pass or not.  That has been our demand.</p> <p>  It is not only the Government's demand; it is what the people that marched two days ago asked.  There were thousands of people representing millions of Colombians who have been seriously affected by this unlawful practice.  I received a letter yesterday from the union that embraces more than 98% of Colombian entrepreneurs requesting that we do not enter the negotiation phase if these blockades do not come to an end.</p><p> In regard to the inquiries on the implementation, I will be glad to provide information.  We have an English version of the report.  I point out that, according to the Kroc Institute, which surveys the advances we have made, it was remarkable what the Duque administration accomplished in the last year, taking into account the restrictions that we have, in particular the pandemic and also the immigrant problem coming from Venezuela.  Notwithstanding those restrictions, there has been no limitation of the resources that were assigned to the implementation of the agreement.</p><p> In some of the areas to which Deputy Brady referred, we have had the most significant advances in the multipurpose cadaster project that Columbia has seen.  It is foreseen that we need to have 3 million ha in 15 years for that land bank and we have provided 1 million in less then 35 months.  We need to give title on more or less 1 million ha to people who are in need.  We have presented to the Congress and the special jurisdiction a ruling on these issues, which is something the Colombian people have been expecting for a long period.</p><p> We have implemented co-ordination between all the agencies that have responsibility for the safety of Columbians so they focus on the protection of ex-combatants.  That was analysed by the special jurisdiction and after the one year that it studied, of the 35 special measures that we have for their protection, it made a recommendation in regard to two.  It is obviously our goal that no ex-combatants are attacked or killed, and we are working to fully protect them.  It is illustrative that, last year, the number of people who were attacked or killed reduced by 10%.  If we compare this process with other peace processes that have been implemented in Colombia, this is the one with fewer casualties per 100 ex-combatants.  I emphasise that this is not enough and we are working hard to take that figure to zero.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Ms Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021060100002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, Mr. Archila and Deputy Brady.  As I said, I have had previous meetings with the committee and I have tried to provide contextual information, which I think is important.  I invite Deputy Brady and all of the members to consider the contextual information on the process, not only one side but the whole reality.  Unfortunately, these protests, which have seen more than 10,000 activities and social protests, have been affected by violence.  I do not want to add to what Mr. Archila said, but I invite members to take into account that there has been a lot of vandalism and this violence has heavily affected our policemen.</p> <p>  In my recent communications, I shared with the members of the committee the specific words of President Duque, in which he highlights the solidarity with all the victims in Colombia during this protest.  I want to highlight this point, so I will repeat what he said and I have shared it with the committee previously.  President Duque said that we genuinely and wholeheartedly unite with all the victims of violence and express our solidarity with them.  The message is clear.  Colombia must unite to overcome the ravages of the pandemic and reject violent acts and unlawful ways.</p> <p>  I have shared with the committee members information on the investigations that are currently ongoing in terms of the public purse, with more than 163 investigations having been opened.  Yesterday, I shared with the committee information on one formal complaint about missing persons dealt with by the Fiscal&iacute;a General, which is our authority.  There is a unit search for some 200 people who are missing but where there is not a formal complaint.  It has already established where they are through that unit search body, given it is not only a fiscal&iacute;a but contains other institutions.</p> <p>  It is important that I invite the committee members to keep this in mind.  We understand the role of social media and how media outlets may support democracy.  It is a reality.  However, it is interesting that in supporting democracy and freedom, social media often does not provide the necessary context that needs to be understood when looking at any issue.  It is no different anywhere and I have seen it here in Europe sometimes, although not necessarily in Ireland.  As I share with the committee members information not only on this moment of the protests but what we are doing, it is important to read that part as well.  This is an invitation to all the members.</p> <p>  The same probably applies to the implementation.  I remember my first meeting with the committee and we have had virtual meetings, although, unfortunately, we have not always been able to meet personally.  We always share not only what we are doing and the level of engagement and commitment but, when we have this conversation, some of the committee members have mentioned how impressive it is what Colombia has done and how difficult it has been for Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement was signed but it took close to ten years for the arms surrender and there has been another ten years or more since then.  We understand there might be different contexts.  That is why I always highlight that I am happy to be here because the committee members can definitely understand the challenges and understand that it takes a long-term process.  In Colombia, we would all love to see everything done in two, three or five years but what is very clear is the commitment, in particular the commitment of the government.</p> <p>  I want to highlight the presence of Mr. Archila and say how much we are always committed to sharing information with the committee on where we are.  I will not add much more.  I mention the visit of the current Vice President and Foreign Minister of Colombia, Ms Ram&iacute;rez, to Washington.</p><p>She had a very comprehensive visit with members of government, civil society, the US Congress, the US Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, and Samantha Power, who is of Irish origin.  In one of these meetings she met the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, IACHR, and she was very clear in extending an invitation to the IACHR.  At present, the institutions in Colombia, including the prosecutor's office, the attorney general's office and the ombudsman's office, have this on the agenda.  A delegation has already accepted an invitation to Colombia between 8 and 11 June.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Brady, perhaps Colombia is different from many other countries in the region.  I do not know whether he has been in the region but Colombia is a very open country.  It is always open to having this type of transparency and scrutiny.  We also have strong institutions that are working.  This is why I always highlight the constructive approach.  I guess the committee has experience of what it means.</p><p> I want to speak more about the pandemic.  It is important to understand the context.  We are very heavily economically affected by the pandemic.  People are tired of lockdowns.  We saw protests here against lockdowns but there was respect and statements in support of the Garda because some protestors had flares and fireworks.  People are tired and we see this in Colombia.  Of course, it can happen in any country of the world.  We are working on this.  Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa took time out of his work to share this with the committee.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his efforts to ensure national dialogue.  In doing so, however, I wish to acknowledge recent very serious reports of an escalation of violence.  I echo what Deputy Brady said earlier about disturbing reports of the disproportionate use of force.  We acknowledge Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa's good work and his attempt to bring the parties together.  I want to say to the ambassador in the presence of Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa that the reports furnished by her to the committee are regular and most useful and informative.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of our ambassador in Bogota, Alison Milton.  This is a fairly new posting on the part of Ireland in Latin America.  It also symbolises the Colombian peace process as a priority for us and our willingness to help and assist in any way we can.  In recent times, I have to say we are most concerned at the disturbing reports of acts of violence.  I thank Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa for being with us and for dealing with some of Deputy Brady's issues.  Perhaps we may have an opportunity to return to him later in the summer.</p></speech>

It is of great relevance to us that the committee is fully informed of the political situation and of the details of our progress and the challenges we have in fully implementing a solution.

Not unlike part of my country, emerging from a stage of conflict is never easy.  The old wounds die hard.  As people try to cope with the injustice of the past, there will be many opportunities to fall on the path to full peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>  It is not so much that I have questions for the ambassador as I have things I would like her country to do.  My colleague, Deputy Brady, has outlined a number of serious matters of concerns.  It is my belief that when these allegations are made, it is vital that the Colombian Government openly and honestly addresses each issue as it arises.  The investigation of issues that arise from time to time, particularly in the area of human rights abuses and violence, is extremely important.  If the country cannot be certain of an impartial investigation from among its own people, it should bring in international people to investigate human rights abuses or issues where there is some doubt with respect to the violence.</p> <p>  We have the Good Friday Agreement and some people would say we have not come an awful long way since the day we signed it.  There are still difficulties and those difficulties will be there for many years to come.  I ask that the public of Columbia be made aware of every instance of abuse or violence, and that they are dealt with openly and honestly in the local communities, as well as satisfying the international press and watchers.</p> <p>  I wish Colombia well.  I want to see it emerge and become the type of place the ambassador spoke of, where we would want to holiday and engage on a full-time basis.  It will never be an easy road for Colombia but as it walks this road, the people of Ireland are with it.  As good friends can, we will challenge it from time to time and ask the ambassador to explain issues, such as my colleague, Deputy Brady, has raised this morning.  I thank the ambassador for coming before the committee and ask her to pass on my thanks to Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa who had to leave the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Ms Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021060100002#G00800"><p>I thank Senator Craughwell for his questions.  First, I recognise particularly the importance of this session and I will always take the committee's questions very seriously and I am open to share my answers, and in the case I do not have an answer, of course to make sure the Colombian authorities know that.</p> <p>  Second, Colombia is a country that has transformed in recent years.  Perhaps Senator Craughwell is looking at one difficult picture at present.  We recognise this but the country is completely changing in how we are recovering and the socioeconomic fabric.</p><p>For example, for the past 20 years we have been working hard to fight poverty.  Unfortunately, a week before the strike started there was a report to say that 2.7 million Colombians had gone back into poverty.  This is mostly due to the pandemic, even though the Government has been working at double capacity on health, the ICUs and the programmes for the poorest of the poor but the reality is that we have been heavily affected.</p><p> I invite the committee to recognise that Colombia is a country that has already transformed its health.  Before the pandemic, we were the country in Latin America that was growing the most.  We received nearly 6 million tourists and we were really working well but now the Government understands that the young people are asking for more.  There are historical demands, which are fine because we understand that people are in the streets in Colombia and maybe in other countries as well.</p><p> That is why, for example, as the national dialogue is going on, the Government of President Duque is already engaging in a specific programme for the youth to provide zero fees to enter third level education and a programme for the poorer young people to access housing, for example.  He just launched a housing and work programme because we understand that we have to engage in this dialogue but we are listening to the concerns of the people.  They are mostly economic concerns but there are many historic concerns.  Unfortunately, in Colombia, like in many Latin American countries, there is inequality but we are not going to solve inequality in one year or in one day.  This is something that is an ongoing process so that is why we are working as hard as we can in this agenda of recovering.</p><p> On vaccinations, so far we have 10 million people vaccinated in Colombia.  We are a country of 50 million so we are ten times the population of Ireland but we are working hard on that.  We need full respect for the protests but we must also condemn the violence and I want to reiterate that.</p><p> On the investigations, I may have said this already but I want to reiterate that in Colombia there are independent institutions already.  Our attorney general's office is not part of the Government.  It is an independent institution and it is the only institution that really can account for the violations in that process and of course there will be sanctions.  I will give the specific information on the investigations.  The investigations are into the alleged misconduct of policemen.  There are 163 disciplinary investigations open, including: 77 for abuse; 11 for homicide; 31 for battery; 18 for injury; two for sexual harassment; and 24 for misconduct.  The policemen have been very affected.  During the protests, there were people injured.  We are all Colombians.  More than 1,000 civilians and more than 1,000 policemen have been injured.  Two policemen were killed as well.  That is why we are engaged in this dialogue with the complexities that Mr. Archila mentioned.</p><p> Perhaps the timing of this debate is good because it is a great opportunity to hear the members.  I have always been open.  I do not know if other ambassadors do this but I have asked for meetings with all of the members and I have met some of those who have responded to my request.  I have permanent contact with Deputy Brady and the Chairman and I will always be open.  As I say, Colombia seeks to provide an example of how open we are to listen to all sides, to talk and to convey the messages we receive because we know how important this dialogue is.  Colombia is a country that is transforming and that will move on.  It has been resilient and the members will be a part of this success story through engaging with us.  Colombia has been a success story.  We have faced many challenges, we are facing this one and we are confident that we will move on with the respect for human rights but also with this conscience of stopping all types of violence, not only one side.</p><p> On the implementation, Mr. Archila mentioned that it is a long-term commitment for 50 years.  It is part of our Constitution and it is a long term commitment.  This Government has so much to say about results, which is what one wants in the end.  Many people may want more, even perhaps including the members and that is fine but we have to understand the complexities and the long-term investment and commitment as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021060100002#H00200"><p>I welcome the ambassador.  It goes without saying but merits repeating that Ireland has been and is a strong supporter of the Colombian peace process and we have given practical expression to that support, as the ambassador will be aware.  We remain strong supporters of the Colombian peace process and as the ambassador has said in reverse, we will remain strong friends of Colombia.</p> <p>  Having said that, I share the sentiment that, as friends, it would be unhelpful if we were not open and straight with the ambassador.  I share the deep concerns of colleagues about the human rights situation in Colombia.  I would argue that Colombia cannot achieve the rule of law by extrajudicial methods and that there must be standards in law enforcement, the judicial process and the penal process.  I am heartened to hear the ambassador say that there are approximately 160 individual investigations in process.  That is welcome.  We would be concerned, however, as a country and based on all of our experience, that Colombia has to maintain the peace process through the rule of law.</p> <p>  Having made that point, I am at a little disadvantage in that I was in transit in the car during some of the ambassador's presentation.  I was trying to listen to it and to manage to do some city driving as well so I did not pick up on everything the ambassador initially said.  I want to make a further comment that the ambassador's remarks on housing and education were priorities are so crucial.  The way Colombia will achieve a real, profound and lasting peace is by addressing the housing and education question.</p> <p>  It is hoped that tourism into Colombia can be restored.  It is crucial economically, socially and in every other way.  I do not have to remind the witnesses that Colombia's tourism product will be greatly improved by a rigorous addressing and upholding of the rule of law, democratic principles and proper judicial principles.</p> <p>  I would have missed this point so I ask where Colombia is with the pandemic and where the witnesses see the implications of that for the country.  The ambassador is not in the Executive wing of the Colombian Government but Colombia's new budgetary requirements are arising from the pandemic.  Where is Colombia with vaccinations and caseloads in the context of the pandemic?  Where do the witnesses see that going?  This is an Executive function but it would seem logical that in the achieving of a budgetary situation to deal with the pandemic, the Colombian Government would try to achieve a level of consensus and societal buy-in to its tax methods, which should help to deal with the demonstrations.</p><p>We are strong supporters of the Colombian peace process.  We firmly believe in it and want it to succeed.  We want to visit a prosperous and successful Colombia in future.  There is no reason we should not do so.  I wish Colombia well in its endeavours in that direction.  As friends, we have to strongly make the points we made and it would be negligent of us on a number of fronts not to do so. </p></speech>

They are very welcome and it has been a pleasure to hear from them both.  Their statements about providing a future for the youth of Colombia in terms of work, housing and education are very positive and I welcome them wholeheartedly.</p> <p>  On the pausing or pushing back of non-Covid medical care because of the demands Covid placed on the health system and health and medical care for women and children, are there plans to conduct an assessment of the impact of Covid on these services across Colombia?  Has an assessment been carried out?  What are the plans to address this issue?</p> <p>  I will address Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa's statement on the local elections.  In terms of gender equality and female participation in politics, Colombia has done very well at a national level.  I am curious to note that there has not been the same level of progress at a national level.  What was the rate of female participation in local elections in terms of the candidature and gender balance of elected representatives?</p> <p>  I refer specifically to an OECD report from 2019 which referred to violence against women candidates and the impact that may have on women seeking a career in politics.  The committee has heard substantial reports from various organisations on how countries can emerge from Covid in terms of the societal and political changes that will be needed.  Globally, we are now in a place where we need to address the pre-existing disadvantages that women experience in terms of educational attainment, business and economic participation, political representation and activism, both at the national and local levels.  I would be grateful if the ambassador would address those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Ms Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021060100002#J00300"><p>I thank Deputy Clarke and Senator O'Reilly for their questions.</p> <p>  Before addressing the questions related to Covid and the social impact on women when it comes to their participation in local elections, I do not want to miss the opportunity to reiterate that we are a democracy.  When we say Columbia is a democratic country, it is not because it is a label but because we know that democracy is based on values, one of which is human rights.  We fully believe in that.</p> <p>  On this issue of international scrutiny and transparency, members may not know that Colombia has had a UN office for human rights since 1996.  There are more than 20 UN agencies in Colombia working on different areas.  I will mot mention other countries by name but not many countries would be comfortable with such a presence or with working with these agencies.  When we talk about investigations and human rights defenders, the UN office in the Colombia works with the fiscal&iacute;a in identifying these cases.  The institutions are independent and we work fully with the UN agencies.  That is why we care so much and are always explaining and listening.  We respect the seriousness of the issues driving the protests and guarantee that mobilisations are free and without stigmatisation.</p> <p>  As with all parts of the world, the security forces in Columbia have a role in protecting the rights of citizens.  That is in the constitution and they cannot go further than the constitutional law.  That is clear.</p> <p>  Colombia has faced the scourge of the drugs problem.  Let me tell the members something from my heart.  We see huge consumption of drugs in many countries, particularly in Europe.  People cannot imagine the level of violence that is behind the consumption of drugs.  Perhaps members may know this if they go to areas in Dublin such as Ballyfermot.  Behind all of these drugs, there is always violence and the Colombian police have faced that for many years.  The police has strict training in human rights.  Could it be better?  Of course, and it has to be better.</p> <p>  The security forces in Colombia have a constitutional responsibility to guarantee the rights of citizens to participate in demonstrations, which they have done.  Their duties and obligations cannot go further than what is in the constitution and in law.  I assure members that is the case.  That is why I give an update on our investigations every two weeks.  The Columbian police force is very legitimate.  We are recognised for co-operating with many countries, including in Africa and Central America, for example, in providing training.  We are at a difficult moment but I assure members that we are working within the law and the constitution.  Any violations that have happened are being investigated and will full sanctions will follow.</p> <p>  I appreciate the question about Covid.  As I have said, it has had a serious effect.  The first thing the Government of President Duque did was to more than double the capacity of intensive care units, ICUs, and of the health sector in terms of medical doctors.  Colombia is a very diverse territory of over 1 million square kilometres, extending from the Caribbean coast to the Andes Mountains and the Amazon.  Colombia has 32 departments which are equivalent to Irish counties.  In each department, there was a particular supply for ICUs to make sure we had capacity.</p> <p>  Colombia has had one of the longest lockdowns.  As a result, many people are tired of the lockdown and the economy has been very heavily affected.  The Government of President Duque made sure no one had to make a horrible decision about who could or could not go into an ICU.  The Government also ensured the health sector could work by providing support.  We were not as generous as Ireland has been with its population but we are providing this support.  That was one of the reasons for the tax reforms.  We are now having fiscal difficulties so we had to make sure we had enough resources.</p> <p>  I ask members to bear in mind that Colombia has ten times the population of Ireland.  We have had more than 3 million cases of Covid whereas there have been approximately 260,000 cases in Ireland.  Covid has caused 88,000 deaths in Columbia.  We have started vaccinations.  Colombia is experiencing a peak of Covid and the strikes have taken place during this peak.  Imagine massive protests in Ireland in January this year.  I just give that as an example.  That is why the death rate has increased.</p><p>We have been very focused on vaccination and have already vaccinated 10 million people.  We have already started vaccinating people of 40 years and older.  Our population is not as old as it is here, perhaps, but it is important to keep in mind that we are focusing on this.  We are actually vaccinating the teachers because we want to make sure that schools, although open, operate in a flexible way.  There is a focus on students and members of the military.  With regard to those associated with the peace implementation and reintegrated people, all of the people are being enabled to have access to the vaccine and healthcare.  We have been heavily affected, as can be seen from the numbers.  Colombia is now the country with the third highest number of cases.  The is the kind of ranking a country never wants.  We know the reality on the mobilisations but I am not according blame in that regard.  I am just stating the reality.  We are working hard on how to recover the economy, our main focus being on the social programmes.</p><p> On the question on youth and problems with education, we are now making sure that we provide subsidies to companies to make sure they hire staff between 18 and 28 years.  On the matter of elections, there is to be an election in November for local, regional and national youth districts.  This is new for us.  It is to give a greater voice to the youth.  This is what we call the pact for youth.  There is a very ambitious programme for housing.  Historically, Colombia has had very solid policies on housing but now, given that many people are on the streets asking for jobs and more opportunities, we have to be mindful that we cannot just achieve an economic recovery in terms of numbers.  It must be in terms of people because this is what we know.  We do not just talk about figures or GDP because we have to make sure we listen to the people.</p><p> On the impact of Covid on our health system, there was a health reform I wish to mention.  The strike committee decided to ask the government to take it out and we did.  The reform was to address some of the difficulties.  In the cities, 97% of the people have access to healthcare.  There is a public system and also a private health system.  There are some issues because we have had to invest in more resources over the pandemic to make sure a long journey will be very stable.  We are working on that.  The Colombian Minister of Health and Social Protection is the vice president of the COVAX mechanism.  Our Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Washington, where one of the first points on the agenda was to ask the US Administration to support us better in terms of vaccinations.  Unfortunately, as we see, those who were able to get most of the vaccines got them.  The reality, since we are not all vaccinated, is that it is very difficult to talk about a recovering economy.  We have a solid plan.  With the protests, some of the vaccinations in some areas were affected but we are now on track.</p><p> On the question as to whether there is a study on the long-term effect on our health service, we will share what we have with Deputy Clarke.  I am not aware that we have a study.  Maybe there is one but I am not sure of the information.  Knowing the Deputy's interest, I will make sure she gets the information.</p></speech>

The first concerns the allusion to the blockage of roads and the destruction of property by some of the protestors.  Is the indiscriminate targeting of protestors by the police and other actors a legitimate response to some of the actions of the protestors?  To my mind, it was not a legitimate response.  Could the ambassador comment on that?</p> <p>  My second point is on the investigations that have been launched.  While I fully welcome the commencement of investigations, I note that in 2020 and 2019, there have been many deaths at the hands of police forces targeting protestors.  About 13 protestors died at the hands of police as a direct consequence of their direct involvement in protests.  There has been total impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes.  I ask the ambassador to state what sentences have been handed down to the perpetrators of the crimes.  What is being done to ensure there are thorough investigations?  Full, thorough and independent investigations are critical.  </p> <p>  On the broader issue, on the end of the systematic use of police violence, I asked a specific question on the reform of the police services within Colombia.  Maybe the ambassador will touch on those points briefly.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Cort&eacute;s Ortiz to deal with Deputy Brady's points.  In her opening statement, she said that among the many serious and complex challenges being faced by Colombia, there is the added issue of the refugees from Venezuela.  There are in the region of 1.8 million, or almost 2 million.  The ambassador might refer to how this has further stretched the Colombian economic response, bearing in mind what she said in response to Deputy Clarke on Covid.  We very much acknowledge in Ireland the complex nature of the current circumstances in Colombia.  As Senator Reilly and others have said, we speak this afternoon in solidarity, notwithstanding the very serious and urgent issues Colombia is facing.</p></speech>

Ms Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021060100002#K00500"><p>I thank the Deputy and the Chairman.</p> <p>  Regarding the blockades, it is so important to hear from the committee the condemnation of all types of violence on all sides.  The public force has the duty to protect not only the protestors but also all other Colombians.  There have been some dramatic events that I am sure many do not regard as peaceful protests.  There was an attempt to burn alive a group of ten police officers by setting fire to a station.  There was the burning and looting of an hotel in Cali where police officers were staying.  There was an attempted sexual assault of a woman police officer in Cali.  The unfortunate case of Allison has been mentioned.  Protestors have set fire to local criminal courts in Tulu&aacute;.  In those criminal courts, more than 1,000 firearms have been taken by people.</p><p>I assure Deputy Brady that those are not legitimate, peaceful protests.  Having pacific protests with the youth talking and singing are good for us and we are listening but the other matters are criminal actions.  Pretending to burn alive a group of ten garda&iacute; is not what we would call a peaceful protest.  That is why in those cases, under the constitution, the police have to intervene, because we cannot just let the country burn itself.  Under the limits of the law and the constitution, there is no doubt that crime gangs have a role in promoting that cause.</p><p> While I do not want to go into it, the context that Colombia will have elections a year from now is important.  People in Colombia are saying this and that.  It is important to take into account that there will be both elections to congress and general elections.  There is no doubt that crime gangs are promoting this cause and anything that weakens the Government may be good for those purposes.  I am sure that members agree with me that burning and looting a place is not a pacific protest.  This is unfortunate.  We have seen the reality with civilians.  I reiterate not only that we express solidarity, but also that we want to move on from that with our institutions and the right investigations, listening to the people.  That this is what we are doing.  Most of the reasons are economic.</p><p> In 2019, we had protests in the region.  There was a long protest in Chile as well.  Thirteen people died.  There are currently five sentences from the attorney general.  I can send further information about the type of sentences.  We have been working on that.  Regarding investigations, while I have not yet mentioned it, according to the attorney general's office, 17 civilians associated with the protest have been killed during the protest and two police officers have been killed and we are investigating that.</p><p> I want to clarify that there is no systemic abuse by police.  We have police who have to act under the constitution.  This is what we are doing, with all the limits, scrutiny and transparency.  Criminals have taken more than 1,000 firearms from the criminal courts and Fiscal&iacute;a.  The authorities have to be there.  That does not mean that we are not having a dialogue but these are criminal activities.  The blockades have been bad.  I mentioned to members of Sinn F&eacute;in last week that two babies died in an ambulance because of a blockade.  That is terrible for us.  One baby who was supposed to go to a hospital could not get to a hospital because there was a blockade and then died in an ambulance.  Imagine being the mother.  That is why, as recently as last weekend, there was a protest called a silent protest.  Millions of Colombians went on to the main streets of the main cities in Colombia, supporting the role of the police and calling for the end of violence and the end of blockades.  This is the type of information that I invite the committee to have.</p><p> The police are part of the ministry of defence in Colombia.  I remember that the director of the national police mentioned that police themselves presented reforms that I understand are in congress.  We have a congress like Ireland has the Oireachtas.  Those discussions have to be in the congress.  Those reforms cannot be through killing policemen or trying to burn them alive.  I appreciate the committee's solidarity with the situation.</p><p> I appreciate the Chairman's question and want to move from the historic gesture of Colombia.  In this context, we are implementing a peace agreement and moving forward.  Of course we are facing a protest.  No country in Europe has done what Colombia is doing, receiving 1.8 million migrants and having refugees really integrate.  The Irish Government has supported some efforts.  A particular NGO called GOAL is working on that.  I invite the committee to look at that.  Colombia is an example with regard not only to solidarity but also to respect for human rights.  It is a significant challenge for us.  How to have solidarity with Venezuelans is a significant challenge for us.  In the last five years, we have tried all measures to facilitate refugees.  Colombia has a border of more than 2,000 km with Venezuela.  Nearly 1 million Venezuelans have had access to healthcare in the Colombian system.  Imagine the strain on our resources from that.  That is why we wanted to avoid the abuse of migrants' human rights and why we are trying to reintegrate people.  Just the process of identification costs us more than $35 million.</p><p> That is why we say we are progressive.  We have challenges, as all countries have challenges.  We have institutions which are working.  We are confident, as President Duque has said, that this opportunity to listen to the people and the youth will make us more resilient and make sure that we move on.  Human rights and respect for law are so important for any country.  We need to make sure that we are a stable democracy.  Nobody wants to see an unstable country.  Venezuela is already unstable with no democracy but a dictatorship.  Colombia wants to be clear about democracy and human rights.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his work and wish him well in ensuring that the national dialogue can get under way.  I understand that he has gone straight to a meeting in that regard.  I thank the ambassador for keeping in contact with us.  Once again, I reiterate the solidarity of Ireland and indeed this committee for the peace process in Colombia, acknowledging the serious social, economic and political challenges that are currently being grappled with.  I acknowledge in particular what Ms Cort&eacute;s Ortiz said about the rule of law and ensuring that every effort is made to reduce tension and to reject the use of violence.  If investigations are under way regarding the disproportionate use of force, they should continue to achieve the objective of justice.  I trust, having regard to the interest shown in the Colombian peace process and indeed more recent protests and events in Colombia, that there will be further opportunities for this committee to engage with Ms Cort&eacute;s Ortiz.  In the meantime, I welcome the documentation that she has furnished us with from time to time.  I suggest that we have another meeting in the early autumn.  I thank the ambassador.</p></speech>

The evidence of witnesses physically present from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chairman and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Murphy and Ms Harmon to make their opening statement.</p></speech>

The focus of my opening statement is on the questions that have arisen in regard to the constitutional future of our shared island in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  I am the secretary of Ireland's Future.  Our organisation was established to advocate for and promote debate and discussion about Ireland's future, including the possibility and viability of new constitutional arrangements on the island.  We are guided by the values of the Good Friday Agreement and are dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights and equality and fostering mutual respect between all views and traditions that share our island.  Ireland's Future considers that any move to new constitutional arrangements requires serious thought, consideration and planning.  We believe the requisite planning for these potential changes must be broad, inclusive, detailed and comprehensive.  Constitutional change must be, or can only be, on the basis of consent of citizens of the island of Ireland, as informed by the Good Friday Agreement, and I have forwarded a copy of our mission statement, outlining our values and objectives, for members' consideration.</p><p> I would like to give an overview of some events and activity which we have been engaged in with Ireland's Future.  Prior to the event of the pandemic, we had organised a series of conferences and town hall meetings, all of which were exceptionally well attended to give expression to the ongoing societal conversation in relation to constitutional change.  Our Beyond Brexit - the Future of Ireland conference was organised in consultation with the then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was addressed by the leaders of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Green Party in the North, the deputy leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Dara Calleary, and the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh.  The event was attended by more than 2,000 people.  There was a very stressful couple of weeks in the run up to it.  We did not know how well attended that might be but were overawed by those in attendance and the mutual sense that swept through that hall that day.  That was followed in 2019 by well-attended events in Newry and also in Croke Park which were addressed by, among others, High Court, Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys and Professor Seamus McGuinness of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  I have included copies of the event literature for the committee's collective attention.</p><p> Our events were complimented by public letters to the Taoiseach appealing to the Irish Government in the first instance to consider the position of Irish citizens in the North in the context of what was then an emerging rights vacuum, then latterly with regard to the then deepening Brexit crisis.  Ours has been an evolutionary experience, I should add, addressing concerns at they occurred at that moment in time.  Our most recent letter, in November 2019, urged the Government to convene an all-island citizen's assembly as a forum to enable discussion on future constitutional change.</p><p> That letter of November 2019 was signed by 1,000 prominent Irish citizens two thirds of whom were resident in the South and also by many citizens of the Irish diaspora.  Prominent signatories included actors Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea, film director Jim Sheridan, the mayor of Boston and now US Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh, writer Eoin Colfer, poets Paula Meehan and Theo Dorgan, musicians Christy Moore, Aoife Scott and Sharon Shannon, economist David McWilliams and commentators Fintan O&rsquo;Toole and Martina Devlin as well as our own Frances Black, whom we are proud to have as chairperson of our organisation.  I should say "our" in the greater collective because Senator Black is obviously a member of this committee.  All of our public correspondence are included in the event literature, for the Waterfront, our event in Newry and Croke Park and they can be reviewed at the members' convenience.</p><p> With the event of the pandemic, our activism was required to go online as Zoom became our new normal.  Indeed, this has permitted us to increase our reach and to deepen the meaningful conversations that are ongoing.  The calibre of contributors that we have been able to attract, aligned with the breadth of viewer participation, has been remarkable.</p><p> The standing, range and influence of people involved with Ireland's Future and the vast reach that we benefit from is evident from our most recent series of podcasts, which I have included in my submission.  They have attracted exceptional viewerships for both live and post views of these webcasts and addressed, among other issues, in May 2020, the implications of the pandemic for health provision across the island and the consideration of an all-island health service, which was Dr. Ilona Duffy, Professor Gabriel Scally and Professor Jim Dornan, who, regrettably, has since passed away.  I would like to take this public moment to express our sympathy with the late Professor Dornan's family.</p><p> Later, in May 2020, we held a webcast on the economic recovery beyond Covid and considered an all-island economy.  That webcast was addressed by the economist David McWilliams as well as economist, author and adviser to the SDLP at Stormont, Paul Gosling, and Patricia McKeown, a trade unionist from Unison.  In June 2020, we held a webcast on Brexit and the Irish Protocol which was addressed by our own Brian Feeney, Tony Connelly, the renowned expert from RT&Eacute;, and Owen Reidy.</p><p> In October 2020, we held A Vision for Ireland - the next generation of Irish voices, which was an exceptionally vibrant and future-thinking webcast whereby all of the participants were under 30, and included Senator Eileen Flynn, Laura Harmon who, I think, was having technical difficulties and I hope has been able to join us, Conal &Oacute; Corra, a language activist, Neil McManus, a county hurler for Antrim and Denise Chaila, the rapper and performance artist from Limerick.  In December 2020, our own Martina Devlin held an online interview with Congressman Richie Neal, chair of the influential US House Committee on Ways and Means.</p><p> Most recently, in February 2021, we held A New Ireland &ndash; Warm House for All.  That was, I am proud to say, was our most successful webcast.  It has attracted more than 40,000 viewers across all platforms.  It was unique in so far as all of the participants were from a traditionally unionist background.  Belfast born, award winning television and radio broadcaster Andrea Catherwood chaired the conversations with Mark Langhammer, a trade unionist-----</p></speech>

This was a significant event as it gave evidence of an ever-widening range of people who are contributing to the conversation about Ireland's Future.  New voices are speaking up.  They are from all backgrounds and they are asking questions and joining us in the conversation about the future of Ireland.  We are delighted and proud that Trevor Lunn MLA has since formally joined the research and publication sub-committee of Ireland's Future.  Indeed, last week Reverend Sethuraman also formally joined Ireland's Future.  I am so privileged and proud that people of such talent have joined our organisation.  Obviously, the committee will be familiar with their contributions have heard their evidence recently.<br/><br/>Ireland's Future appeals to everyone, but particularly to the Government in Dublin, to listen attentively to this conversation and to begin planning and preparing for constitutional change.  We accept that we have taken a public position on this sensitive topic and to do so, we feel that we have to put our indepth thoughts and analysis on the record.<br/><br/>Insofar as that is concerned, we have conducted our own research, are in the process of conducting more research and have produced literature by way of publications setting out the deliberate steps that require to be taken to effect constitutional change in a responsible, legal fashion consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.  I have attached with the literature to this opening statement our three published research documents to date: Principled Framework for Change, published in November last, which was followed up by Advancing the Conversation, The Way Forward, in January 2021, and, most recently, Planning for a Strong Economy in a New Ireland, which was published on 25 March.  All such publications were also joined with an in-depth conversation in our own webcast.<br/><br/>Chair, might I inquire as to whether Laura Harmon been able to join us.  I know that Ms Harmon had some technical difficulties there.</p></speech>

Such an assembly would be rigorously impartial from external political influence.  It will commission its own research, reports, and economic modelling.  It is a well-worn constitutional path.</p><p>Members will all be familiar with its benefits.  This path has already led to successive civic movements and has been decisive in securing positive outcomes for progressive changes through referendums.</p><p> The civic assembly is a forum in which political issues would be discussed by its membership and, ultimately, voted upon.  Typically, it would be made up of citizens selected at random but could also include a number of elected politicians.  It should hear expert evidence and produce recommendations.  In addressing the models of reunification it would serve to counter some of the mythology and fears that surround Irish reunification, namely, the block grant, issues around healthcare provision, taxation and education standards.</p><p> The civic assembly could be set up to allow a government to entrust the people with setting the direction on a controversial subject, for example.  The result is then one that can be kept at arm's length or embraced depending on the political temperature of the day.</p><p> The most notable recent example is the constitutional convention of 2012 to 2014 and the Citizens' Assembly of 2016.  The convention recommended the extension of the presidential voting franchise and received wide support in the Oireachtas but the matter has yet to be put to the electorate for approval.  I am sure we will return to this topic in our discussion.  The Citizens' Assembly sat for 18 months.  Among other things, it recommended the repeal of the eighth amendment's prohibition on abortion in the State.</p><p> With regard to what a citizens' assembly on Irish reunification might look like, if a citizens' assembly were to consider proposals for Irish reunification, it should and could include political representatives and citizens from both jurisdictions on the island and possibly Britain.  Non-participation by elected unionist politicians has been flagged but should not prevent it taking place.  The conversations of this committee are illustrative of that fact.</p><p> Constitutional change is already upon these islands; Brexit is constitutional change.  The only responsible course of action for the Irish Government is to undertake what it reasonably can to prepare for the next stage of Irish self-determination, whatever choice that may be.  I assert again that it this would not be a preconditioned citizens' assembly but a genuine organ that we must listen to.</p><p> A citizens' assembly would also consider what constitutional amendments would be necessary to the Irish Constitution to ensure continued adherence to the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  It would be an opportunity to examine the competing models of reunification on the basis of reliable information and data.  It should, in particular, consider the responsibilities on the Irish State to adhere to the obligations of the sovereign power in Northern Ireland.</p><p> With regard to practical arrangements, in the Republic, the citizens' assembly would be set up by a resolution of the Oireachtas and be funded by the Department of Finance.  Its terms of reference would be set out in that resolution.  It would have no formal role to require or even recommend constitutional or legislative change in the Republic but would command considerable political importance.  The Irish Government would be required to respond to its suggestions and it is our view that this is a project that must be initiated by the Irish Government.  The possibility of a joint Irish-British constitutional convention modelling reunification is unlikely.</p><p> In conclusion, the event of Brexit has changed everything forever.  The constitutional security of the North, as part of the United Kingdom, has been thrust into terminal decline by Brexit.  Brexit was not something that anybody in Ireland, North or South, proposed, argued for or wanted.  A border poll is the constitutional pathway back to the EU for all citizens resident in this island to reset the democratic deficit that Brexit represents.  The Good Friday Agreement, which was overwhelmingly mandated by the people of Ireland on both sides of the Border, provides an inbuilt democratic and legislative pathway out of this madness with a Border poll.</p><p> The debate is happening.  It has been acknowledged by the former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, among other senior members of the Judiciary.  It is a conversation that is happening in staffrooms, coffee shops, school car parks when people drop their children at school and at the side of football pitches up and down the country.  This debate needs to be informed by rationality and planning because it cannot be characterised by the recklessness, ill-preparedness and arrogance of the Brexit debate.  The Irish Government, the European Union and the United States Administration need to begin planning for what I consider to be the inevitable.  A reminder of this is to be found in the growing number of initiatives that are producing useful research output, much of which accords with our established positions and supports our efforts or assists our thinking.  The preparations are now well under way and gathering pace.</p><p> We note the valuable work being undertaken by the analysing and researching Ireland North and South project, ARINS, a collaboration between the Royal Irish Academy and the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at Notre Dame's Keough School of Global Affairs.  This work includes, for example, an excellent contribution by Dr. Adele Bergin and Professor Seamus McGuinness on living standards and quality of life on the island of Ireland.</p><p> The shared island unit and the ESRI have launched a significant new research programmes which will explore areas such as health and education on the island.  We also note with interest that the University College London's working group on unification referendums has essentially followed our lead in calling for extensive advance planning and preparation.  The report notes that the years of acrimony over Brexit highlights the real dangers of calling for a vote without adequate advance planning.</p><p> If the Good Friday Agreement really does underpin new relationships, no one needs to be anxious about this invitation to a conversation about how we share our island in the future.  A border poll is wholly consistent with the vision laid out in the Good Friday Agreement.  Our island is on a path towards concurrent referendums on whether people would prefer a united Ireland, and thus EU membership, or wish to retain the union with Britain.  It is the fundamental outworking of democracy.  This is acknowledged within the internal constitutional legal orders of both states, underpinned by international law, and recognition is implied by the EU in its endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  Making use of the arrangements to test the principle of consent or the right to self-determination at the appropriate time and with proper preparation should provoke no one.  Planning has commenced and the Governments must catch up.</p><p> I am more than happy to attempt to address any questions, queries or concerns that may arise.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I must leave around 10.40 a.m. to attend a meeting of another committee of which I am Chair.  I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  It is difficult to speak on one's own and not have the support of Ms Harmon.  It is a pity we lost her due to technology problems.</p> <p>  I work with Ireland's Future and Mr. Murphy and love the vital work that they do.  The group represents civil society whose voice needs to be heard.  I will never forget my first time in Belfast when I attended the Beyond Brexit event.  It was unbelievable.  The energy I felt in the room that day and the fears felt by people about what was going to happen with Brexit rang a bell for me.  Ireland's Future developed from that event, which was held on the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  There were many speakers, including the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I will never forget the panel of speakers who spoke on that day.  One of the panel, a man from the unionist community, said that nobody had contacted him to have a conversation about what new constitutional change would look like.  He was, he said, open to that conversation.</p> <p>  I remember another occasion when I visited Belfast as a member of the committee on Brexit.  As members who were on that committee will remember, we met various people, including representatives of cross-community groups and the farming community, who expressed concern about the impact of Brexit on their business.</p><p>There was so much fear from people regarding Brexit.  Ireland's Future plays an important role in that regard.</p><p> I want to thank Mr. Murphy for attending.  I have one or two questions I want to ask him.  How would he see Ireland's Future working alongside the Irish Government's shared island unit?  How does Mr. Murphy see this committee supporting what he is doing or what would he like us to do?  How does he see this best going forward?</p><p> I want to highlight the Warm House For All event.  It was one of the most inspiring and informational events I have ever seen of all of the events that Ireland's Future has run.  It was so powerful.  How can we engage with the 20% of the people in the North who are classified as undecided and also with unionist communities?</p></speech>

It is a privilege to have Senator Black as our chairperson.  I am cognisant of how busy she is and of how attentive she is to her role in the Seanad.</p> <p>  Taking matters one by one, the shared island unit is something that we welcome.  It is convincing, we collaborate with its work and we are obliged to be one of the official consultees, specifically when the shared island dialogues are convened.  We have been asked to contribute and we have contributed speakers to each shared island dialogue which has occurred.  We have undertaken consultation with and offered advice and opinion to the civil servants within the shared island unit.  However, more needs to be done by the Irish Government.  The unit is welcome and it seems to be well resourced, albeit some of the finance has been recycled from previous commitments.  Insofar as its work is important, we do not consider that it is consistent with where the conversation is in real terms.  Real evidence-led research to inform more concrete planning needs to be undertaken but it is welcome as a first step and we wholly embrace the opportunity to work with it.</p> <p>  This committee has an important role in setting the agenda and in holding the different mechanisms of the Good Friday Agreement to account.  In my day job, I work as a solicitor in Belfast and I have enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the various academic research models that have been ongoing.  I most thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to work with Professor Colin Harvey at Queen's University Belfast and have observed the rulings in the High Court in Belfast regarding Raymond McCord's application for judicial review.</p> <p>  I understand and appreciate the law relating to schedule 1 of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to understand and communicate that whereas the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call a border poll at any time, he or she must call a border poll if it appears likely that a majority would: "express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."  I would respectfully submit that the threshold of evidence for that has already been reached in terms of electoral results.  The Northern jurisdiction returns 18 MPs to Westminster and the majority of those represent a united Ireland constituency.  When it comes to city and county councils in the North, there are four councils which would broadly have a united Ireland perspective and four which would broadly have a United Kingdom perspective.  Belfast City Council, the largest council in the North, would genuinely have a neutral constitutional preference but one which we would consider leans more towards reunification.  Electoral results would inform us that the evidence threshold has been met for the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to discharge his obligation under schedule 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p> <p>  On what this committee could do, whereas we consider that the evidence threshold has been met, we want to know what evidence the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is judging.  It would appear that he is not using what should be the most fundamental parameter in a democracy, namely, electoral results.  Therefore, what is he using?  There are difficulties with polls.  When a poll is broadly in line with one's thinking, it is to be welcomed.  When it is not, then one contests its reliability.  We respectfully consider that this committee could usefully correspond with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to ask him what evidence he is using to discharge his obligations under schedule 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p> <p>  The evidence sessions that this committee has been engaged in have been very productive and insightful and I trust they have been beneficial to its members.  It might be time that this committee considered producing its own report on the prospect of constitutional change on our island during this decade.  There has been great benefit from the five evidence sessions that have been convened so the committee may consider appointing a rapporteur to pull together its published opinion on the topic.  I would urge the committee to write to the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to publish his response, if and when received, and to comment on and debate how it considers the efficacy and the constitutional politeness of his response.  The committee should consider if the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is taking the issue seriously or if lip service is being paid to what is a fundamental part of our Good Friday Agreement.  Those are two action points which could be sensibly addressed by the committee.</p> <p>  I mention the Senator's final point.  She correctly observed that our Warm House For All event was transformative insofar as it provided a neutral, honest and genuine space for voices that perhaps do not often find expression in political unionism to be heard.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are so proud that Trevor Lunn, MLA, and the Reverend Karen Sutherman found it within themselves to consider that our organisation was one they felt they could contribute to and one in which their voices would be honestly cherished, which they are.  We want to continue that work, take it forward and maintain the level of outreach which we have undertaken in good faith to date.  The most organic, natural and responsible place for those conversations to take place is in an all-island citizens' assembly with the space and the subject matter being completely neutralised.  In that way, we can get the gloves on, get down and dirty, get the facts, commission, assess and review the evidence and make recommendations.</p><p>I hope I have answered the Senator's question.</p></speech>

I do not know whether Mr. Murphy can answer my next question and I ask him not to worry if he cannot do so.  What does he believe will be the main issues that will have to be considered by the proposed citizens' assembly?</p></speech>

It is our firm view, and two of the research publications we have published speak to this, that the full outworking and expression of the Good Friday Agreement resolves itself in the respect for the principle of consent.  It is almost 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent has not yet been tested.  What would anybody have to fear from getting a barometer on testing the principle of consent?  I have spent my entire life observing the principle of consent.  Generations older than me and younger than me deserve the opportunity to test it.  Within the lawfulness and the constitutionality of a border poll being reflected in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the Good Friday Agreement with regard to its success, we then must examine the minutiae of all of the systems and how we would meld them and truly become one new unitary state sharing one island, and what this means for a civil service, a police service, a health service or an education service.  I have to say I was very enlightened to read the observations of Deputies Neale Richmond and Jim O'Callaghan in their public essays and lectures to the university in Oxford.  There was some very blue-sky thinking.</p> <p>  Discourse is defined by people who are willing to take a public position and seek comment on it.  The most natural constitutional place for this to occur in a democracy and a republic is within a citizens' assembly.  I do not believe we would find time to assess any of these issues in a morning's session in a committee.  They all require the appropriate expertise and data.  It really is only the southern Government that can critically test tax yields, demographic population shifts and where services will be required.  If one were to attempt something as significant as a realignment of constitutional arrangements, all of these things must be very well tested in advance.  We have seen the madness of an ill-prepared and ill-defined question on an unsuspecting public.  We have seen how it convulsed the body politic in Britain.  We must learn from this experience and undertake not to repeat it, which is why we feel our call for work to be done now is critical and appropriate.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; iontach maith.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis freisin as teacht os comhair an choiste.  Mr. Murphy made a compelling presentation on the sheer volume of work that Ireland's Future has been involved in.  The research it has been doing leaves so many others in its wake with regard to the necessary work and the very impressive and positive engagement and outreach it is doing with other communities.  I acknowledge this and it is very important that the committee does so.</p> <p>  The volume of work and range of engagement is reflective of the discourse and debate that is live in our society.  In many ways, the Oireachtas and the Irish Government in bringing together a citizens' assembly would need to catch up with this discourse and the debate out there already.  Recently, we took a positive step when the Seanad agreed an amendment to call on the Irish Government to establish a citizens' assembly.  I want to get Mr. Murphy's views on the political and symbolic importance of this and where it rests in the broader discourse.</p> <p>  Much of this relates to aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the various grounds.  Within this context, unilateral decisions can be taken and moves can be taken by the Irish Government, one of which would be the convening of a citizens' assembly, and a range of others that are non-threatening and would in no way undermine the structures of the Good Friday Agreement.  They would be entirely in keeping with constitutional and other political obligations.</p> <p>  What are the views of Mr. Murphy on a call for the Irish Government to hold a referendum on extending presidential voting rights to citizens outside the State, obviously to include those of us who are Irish in the North?  The Government tells us that in the course of the pandemic it is unable to hold a referendum, and we all accept this given the restrictions placed upon us.  It is a necessary and required obligation the Government needs to fulfil.  Is this something on which Ireland's Future will engage with the Irish Government?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.177" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021060100002#E01000"><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has raised several issues and I will address them one by one.  The recent motion that included the amendment was exceptionally welcome and was perhaps the first time the concept of a citizens' assembly was publicly validated by a political motion.  I am wholly cognisant of the fact there is an element of symbolism to this but it must be noted it is indicative of a political reality and responsive to the growing momentum.  There is a wider, deeper and more engaged conversation going on with regard to our collective future.</p> <p>  There is more that can be done.  The Irish Government, in our respectful analysis, should publish a Green Paper on Irish unity that identifies steps and measures to inform a successful transition to a single island unitary state.  There should be an Oireachtas joint committee on Irish reunification with the task of outlining, driving, monitoring and reviewing the transition towards Irish unity.  We had hoped the incumbent Taoiseach might have appointed a dedicated Minister of State with specific responsibility for developing strategies to advance Irish unity.</p><p>The South Korean Administration has a Ministry dedicated to the potential for reunification.  Scotland established a constitutional unit within government to do this.  The opportunities and challenges for Scottish independence were previously outlined in a 670 page document called Scotland's Future.  People sometimes wonder where we got our name.  That outlined the Scottish Government's vision of how Scotland could and would transition towards independence.  That was in 2013.  It set out the implications of independence across monetary, fiscal, industrial and social policy and set out its position with regard to constitutional issues and defence policy.  There are explicit nuts and bolts that need to be considered in the discharge of this issue.  Whereas the motion was obviously welcome, it should be considered as a starting point to a long line of governmental work which needs to be undertaken.</p><p> With regard to presidential voting rights, I recall attending the launch of Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad, VICA, in EPIC.  I was inspired by the ambition and the articulate nature of the advocates who wanted to take on responsibility for being the persuasive voice for that referendum.  That referendum will happen and I am confident that it will pass.  I do not note any political party in the South that objects to it and all of us have family all over the world.</p><p> My father is from Blackwatertown on the border of Armagh and Tyrone.  I see Michelle Gildernew, who will understand the tension between Armagh and Tyrone.  He was the youngest of 12 and all of his older brothers and sisters had to emigrate, so I have as many cousins in America as I do in England, and more than I have in Ireland.  They are proud of their Irish heritage and would welcome the opportunity to be engaged in the election of our next President.  I am personally aware of the necessity of Covid restrictions.  I spent 17 days on a ventilator last March and April.  I almost died on 30 March.  I absolutely understand and will always respect the need to be cautious but that does not inhibit the preparation for that referendum.  We are hopefully emerging from the worst days of this pandemic.  Brighter days are literally and metaphorically ahead of us.  Now is a responsible time to begin to undertake the preparation for that referendum, which I hope, trust and expect should pass with gusto.</p></speech>

It is good to see him looking so well after Covid.  It certainly has not dampened his enthusiasm.  I have been fortunate enough to attend a number of meetings that Ireland's Future has organised.  The Warm House For All meeting and the great response to that has been mentioned a couple of times.  What response is Ireland's Future getting from the broad unionist, loyalist and Protestant community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021060100002#F00300"><p>We have engaged with people from a cultural Protestant, unionist, loyalist background who are democrats and understand and appreciate what the Good Friday Agreement means.  All of us collectively appreciate and will protect the peace which is so valuable to all of us.  There is sometimes reticence in some of the consultations that we have had.  We have a series of ongoing confidential conversations that we have undertaken, which will remain confidential, with a view to building confidence, increasing levels of understanding, and dismantling some fears and myths which are honestly and genuinely held.  It is a positive opportunity to do that, which we embrace.  There are many misconceptions about what a new nation might look like but there is also an opportunity in those conversations to provide assurance that there will be an honest and genuine respect for the British identity in a new Ireland.  We have to recall and appreciate the political reality that that will be a substantive constituency in a new political arrangement and that that, in and of itself, means that their own voice may be significant in the mechanics of the electoral cycles.</p> <p>  I will not attempt to speak for unionism other than to say that I will publicly observe that unionism and unionist people are noble.  They are my friends, neighbours and work colleagues.  I do not want any new constitutional dispensation to be one where there is any sense that they feel that their citizenship is being eroded, much less denied, or that their identity is not cherished.  We need to work with those important concepts to understand and appreciate what their concerns are.  Whereas we will undertake and continue to undertake public and confidential conversations, the most natural and appropriate place for those concerns to be articulated is in an all-island citizens' assembly.  Political unionism will grapple with the potential for a constitutional change.  That difficulty needs to be respected and given as much understanding and latitude as possible.</p> <p>  Changes have happened and are happening on our island.  Brexit has changed everything forever.  Constitutional change is already upon these islands by virtue of Brexit.  Our democratic expression was ignored, which is a grave difficulty that we have had to endure on this island.  We need to work together to make sure that all voices and identities are genuinely heard.  I emphasise the word "genuinely".  It cannot be lip service.  I would not want to encourage the inception of any new constitutional arrangement where anybody felt that their identity was lessened, cheapened or not afforded appropriate respect because that is an experience that I have lived.  It is a lived experience for people of an Irish identity in the North.  I would oppose that as strenuously in a post-reunification scenario as I promote the enrichment of our own culture at present.</p></speech>

I wanted to ask the Ireland's Future representatives to speak to the significance of resolution 117 by the US Senate foreign relations committee.  That committee has spoken in one voice on accountability, reconciliation, prosperity and its unwavering support for the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> I note what Mr. Murphy said about the role that legislators can play.  In particular. I am interested in the European Parliament and what it can undertake by way of research on the implications of the reunification for the EU.</p><p> Mr. Murphy spoke about the fundamental barometer being electoral results.  I wanted to ask about the significance of the results of the census when they come out and combining these with the electoral results.  He will not have time to answer that in this section but perhaps after he answers the other questions, he might address those points.</p></speech>

We all know and understand the important role that American Administrations have played in negotiating and securing our peace.  Those involved take great pride in their role.  I have often travelled to America wearing different hats in my professional work.  There is a genuine and in-depth understanding and defensive self-pride in the role that America has played in its foreign policy.  This assuredness really stood up for the Good Friday Agreement at a sensitive time during Brexit.  That is why we took the view it was important to conduct the interview with Congressman Richard Neal, who is chairman of the ways and means committee.  It was not the then US President, Mr. Trump, who would sign the trade deal with post Brexit Britain but the ways and means committee.  The committee made it crystal clear, as did Ms Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Brendan Boyle and Mr. Marty Walsh, that if one hair on the head of the Good Friday Agreement was ruffled, there would be no trade deal.  That is an important critical resolution and one that should give us collective confidence for the path we are currently discussing.  I am unsure what time I have left.</p></speech>

If they understand and appreciate that their British identity will be respected and maintained then they would prefer to be members of the EU rather than the UK.  It is not necessarily membership or citizenship of a new Ireland but their British identity within the EU that they would like to see reflected.  Considerable work should be undertaken with the European Parliament.  If there were a public declaration as to the support that might be afforded to the inception of a new state, it might give more assurance to all of us on how that process of transfer might be undertaken.</p></speech>

They seem to have done considerable work in the recent years.  I find the conversation interesting because we are on a similar pathway but we seem to have different concepts of how we get there.  We have agreement that unionist and Protestant communities on either side of the Border and their rights and British identity need to be respected and enshrined in any future arrangement.  Where we part ways is how we get to a conclusion.  I want to delve into that element of it.  Please do not shoot the messenger but there is a train of thought that Ireland's Future is aligned to Sinn F&eacute;in.  That view is not only held by unionists.  That is also a view held down south and it is important that Ireland's Future addresses that.  There is a fear in unionism.  This train of thought is feared in unionism circles.  I would like to know the response of the Ireland's Future representatives to that.</p> <p>  The work up to the Good Friday Agreement was crucial.  There is no way that the agreement could have been established and pulled together under the terms of the citizens' assembly.  The work behind the scenes was vast and went on for years.  An extraordinary volume of work was done by many people behind the scenes to build trust in unionism.  We seem to forget that unionist parties came to the table and agreed to the make-up of the Good Friday Agreement.  They agreed to what was in the agreement.  They agreed on the constitutional wherewithal for a referendum.</p> <p>  We have this idea that we need to drive on with the citizens' assembly, that it represents everyone, that we will have a border poll and all will be rosy.  That is where I separate from Ireland's Future because we have a great deal of work to do to build trust in Northern Ireland.  We cannot afford to have a border poll without gaining that trust.  That is achievable.  We have one shot at doing this right.  I do not disagree on the question of a citizens' assembly but I believe the work being done at the moment by the shared island unit, as presented to us two weeks ago, is over and above what a citizens' assembly would do.  Currently, the unit is reaching out to more than 130 community groups.  I would like organisations such as Ireland's Future that represent nationalist views to take on and do more of what the shared island unit is doing by going into unionist and loyalist communities or to consider going into loyalist heartlands and have these conversations with the people there.  They should bring in speakers from those backgrounds.  Ireland's Future could do tremendous work by taking that approach.</p> <p>  Mr. Murphy's colleague, Colin Harvey, came in.  I was critical of him when he presented an EU paper because it was not an EU paper and he had not consulted widely with unionists.  Mr. Murphy and Professor Harvey could do critical work.  I would like to hear Mr. Murphy's opinion about that.  Is he open to doing that kind of work?</p></speech>

However, I want to correct immediately the assertion that the Senator has now made in this public forum that Ireland's Future is connected to a political party.  I took time to prepare the detailed literature we have published to allow it to be circulated to the members of the committee in advance of this meeting.  I am not sure if Senator Blaney received that literature in time or if he had the opportunity to read and reflect on it.  All our public pronouncements, made on the public record, make crystal clear that we have no affiliation to any political party.</p> <p>  It will be appreciated, however, that our focus is on the constitutional future of the island and in so far as that is the case, we will of course consult political parties.  We have consulted Sinn F&eacute;in, as we have consulted the SDLP, the Alliance Party and Fine Gael.  I had an exceptional couple of hours in Belfast two years ago with a delegation of ten members from Fine Gael.  I have not had the opportunity to speak with representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il on that same basis and I would welcome the opportunity to do so.  If Senator Blaney is able to pull together a delegation for me to meet, I will come to the South.  As a Donegal man, the Senator is from the north.</p></speech>

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss our organisation in more detail with representatives from Senator Blaney's party.<br/><br/>On the Senator's more substantive point, we will do all we can, we will speak to anybody anywhere and we are open to any invitation.  We have never refused an invitation.  As I said, we have undertaken and are undertaking confidential conversations and I hope we will be able to take those conversations into the public sphere.<br/><br/>One concept on which the Senator touched was the issue of fears, concerns and sensitivities.  I wholly appreciate that as we step into a new era, we must be genuinely sensitive to people's fears and concerns.  That works two ways, however.  Some of the irrational, illogical fears the Senator expressed in respect of our organisation might be true of how people in the North sometimes consider that our sensitivities are assessed and managed in the South.  In recent months, we have seen Irish citizenship being made a mockery of, with citizens born on this island being told that while they might think they are Irish, they are not and are actually British.  That Emma de Souza had to go to court to confirm that and was exposed to great financial jeopardy for asserting that most fundamental principle was a disgrace and a mockery.  That happened in court.<br/><br/>We have seen the Good Friday Agreement all but torn up in front of our eyes at the despatch box by a member of Her Majesty's Government when he said the British Government would break international law to do what it wanted.  We have seen our rights as European Union citizens discarded against our democratically expressed wishes.  We have seen victims of our conflict treated with contempt by the British Government when it tore up the Stormont House Agreement.  We have seen our cultural rights being bartered in respect of Acht na Gaeilge, the Irish language Act, in circumstances where that had been agreed by all the political parties in the New Decade, New Approach document.  Sensitivities operate in both directions.  When one sees the Stormont House Agreement, New Decade, New Approach and the Good Friday Agreement being cherry-picked, <i>&agrave; la carte</i>, that is a very difficult position to tolerate.</p></speech>

I hope everyone can hear me.  I am in the convention centre.  I welcome this debate.  Any day that I can have a conversation on working towards one island and a united Ireland is a very welcome one.  I congratulate the witnesses on the work they have done.  Why does Mr. Murphy consistently fail to recognise the work the Irish Government is doing?  Why does he downgrade the research undertaken by the Irish Government and the actions it has undertaken to work towards Ireland's future?  Why is it thought that the research of Ireland's Future is on a different level and that it is the only way forward?  It is surely the case that there is nothing more legitimate in working towards a shared future than the work being done by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Murphy not recognise that an incredible amount of research is being conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to scope how we can converge as an island in areas such as healthcare, education, an all-island economy, foreign direct investment, FDI, and services?  The NESC is doing research, with the title "Digging Deeper, into how we can work together, considering public policy on the environment and social and economic issues.  The groundwork is being done but I feel it is consistently being downgraded and not being recognised.</p> <p>  I am from the Cooley Mountains and this is my world.  All my life, I have dreamt that we will get to a point where the Department of the Taoiseach would be creating and developing documents on how we work properly on a shared island and towards a future united Ireland.  In that context, does Ireland's Future recognise that more than 400 people have already engaged in an all-Ireland conversation on policy?  Legitimate and well regarded non-political researchers are working towards creating policies on how we can converge as one island.</p></speech>

I will avoid the preliminaries because I have so little time.  I welcome Mr. Murphy and I am sorry that Ms Laura Harmon is not here because I have great respect for her, especially in the role she played in the referendum campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment to the Constitution.</p> <p>  Originally, Ireland's Future was mooted as a kind of an open forum and a neutral voice to facilitate debate and discussion.  Mr. Murphy just said that the organisation had now adopted a position.  Did it take it long to come to that position?  It seems to have been a little rushed if the group was originally just a neutral forum.  Suddenly, it is not a neutral forum but a lobby group for a united Ireland and a border poll.  Does Ireland's Future have credibility at this stage to put itself forward as a vehicle to encourage unionist, loyalist and other points of view through its auspices?</p> <p>  I respect the answer Mr. Murphy gave to Senator Blaney in respect of Sinn F&eacute;in involvement.</p><p>I must put the following to Mr. Murphy.  Several commentators and journalists have noted, and one, in particular, has stated that he sees Ireland's Future as an outreach programme for Sinn F&eacute;in.  Mr. Murphy has stated otherwise.  I will not go into detail, but anyone who studies the organisation's social media accounts, the likes, dislikes and comments and regular columns of its members, will note that there is a Sinn F&eacute;in flavour about them.  I am a countryman.  I believe that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.  Mr. Murphy needs to provide more answers.  </p><p> In respect of the funding of Ireland's Future, in particular, where does the funding come from?  Obviously, the organisation has a fairly big budget for a voluntary, non-State organisation.  Can Mr. Murphy assure us that the funding does not come from Sinn F&eacute;in or any of its subsidiaries, friends or any such group?</p><p> My final question-----</p></speech>

Does he agree that the primary function of the agreement was to enable people to live together in the one space, as Seamus Mallon said?  Does he agree that the politics of the North for the last 20 years have been a futile waste of time, insofar as neither of the main parties has tried to address the challenge that was put in front of it?  Now, while we have a fractured and fraught situation, with so-called peace walls around the cities, the organisation is now proposing that we have a constitutional border poll.</p></speech>

I fear that the Senator has not fully appreciated our aims and objectives and our intentions, which are crystal clear from our website, webcasts, public meetings and research documents.  I fear that the Senator has a deep misunderstanding and misapprehension in respect of our organisation.

We started late, so I will allow time for that.  However, we must still stick to the two-hour limit, as per Covid rules.</p> <p>  I invite the Fine Gael members to contribute.</p></speech>

This is fourth time that I have met representatives of Ireland's Future in the last year.  Any contribution in this area is to be valued.  That is the case not just in respect of Ireland's Future but also the other groups that we have met and the work of the shared island unit.</p> <p>  I must say that I am concerned about some of the language used.  I hear people talking about playing catch-up and the need for the thinking of one side to catch up with the thinking of the other.  That is not helpful language.  It presumes that there is a right and a wrong.  That is not what we are all trying to do.  What we are trying to do here is to build consensus and agreement.  Senator Blaney made a very good point about the work that went into the Good Friday Agreement that was about building consensus and relationships.  That is what the focus should be.  I do not think that it is valuable for people in this conversation to say that one group needs to catch up with another group, irrespective of what group that is.  That is one point I would like to make.</p> <p>  I am sorry that Ms Harmon is not present, as she was deeply involved in the work to repeal the eighth amendment.  I would ask her and perhaps Mr. Murphy, how they feel, when we put so much emphasis of the promotion and protection of human rights, that 14 months after women's healthcare services were made legal in the North, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is now going to the High Court about access to women's healthcare?</p><p>Is there a role in all of this for an all-island discussion on that issue?  Is any work happening in that area?  </p><p> Presidential voting rights were mentioned.  I too look forward to a referendum on that issue but, within that, we must also discuss the funding of political organisations on an all-island basis and how all of that works.  Is there a role for that within all-island discussions and as part of Ireland's Future work too?  </p></speech>

I accept he may not be able to answer them but, perhaps, it will be possible to get written responses from Ms Harmon at some stage in the future.  I will go ahead with my questions on Ms Harmon's statement, which Mr. Murphy read out.  What is his view on the citizens' assembly?  Should it include politicians or only ordinary citizens?  Both were mentioned.  Previous citizens' assemblies in Ireland, on repeal and marriage equality, were made up of ordinary citizens.  Is that better than including politicians in them?  What is Mr. Murphy's view on that?</p> <p>On funding, what type and amount of funding would need to be set aside to make a citizens' assembly meaningful and to get a bang for our buck?  What type of finance do we need to put behind it?  In terms of the practical arrangements, points a) to e) in the opening statement provided by Ireland's Future refer to how it must be a project led and initiated by the Irish Government.  That is fair enough because the possibility of a joint Irish-British constitutional convention modelling reunification is unlikely.  What will be the make-up of this citizens' assembly?  Will it just be a bunch of people from the Republic of Ireland discussing the issues?  How do we get engagement from the Northern Ireland institutions?  If they are not willing to engage, do we just go ahead with a South-Republic of Ireland-centred citizens' assembly?  Can we get more detail on its make-up and how we would proceed with that?  What role do the Northern Ireland institutions, if any, have to play in a future citizens' assembly?   </p></speech>

It is very interesting and important to listen to all the contributions.  I challenge the witnesses on what I see as some contradictions between the different statements in their contribution.  I read Ireland's Future economic paper and I respect what is in it but as elected representatives on this committee, we also had the opportunity to listen to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which presented quite different conclusions.  We have to acknowledge the different perspectives and analyses of these points.  Ireland's Future's mission statement, included as part of their statement today, is about advocacy and promoting debate and discussion about Ireland's future, but it also commits to a position.  This has been acknowledged, which is fair enough.  To be clear, whether Ireland's Future is a debate group or is a campaign group is important in the presentation.</p><p>I have a concern about tone, in Ms Harmon's provided statement in particular.  Her statement, delivered by Mr. Murphy, described an arrogance about the Brexit debate and yet the group's paper presents a border poll as inevitable.  I find the tone of those statements contradictory because, of course, while change is inevitable over time, setting the outcome at the outset is not necessarily the solution.  A border poll is not necessarily the mechanism for change.  Change will come through thoughtful, creative, citizen-led conversations about all aspects of life.  A border poll may be one outcome from that but there may be others.  I have a difficulty with setting the outcome at the outset. </p><p>On the citizens' assembly, University College Dublin, UCD, is doing quite interesting work on how dialogues can be structured and citizens' assemblies are one model of that.  I believe the issues in this are too complex for a single citizens' assembly.  I was involved in previous citizens' assemblies but they were on very net points of constitutional change and very neat issues.  This is much broader and, indeed, the constitutional point is very much a neat point, notwithstanding the complexity of it.  It does not reflect anything like the cultural conversation that necessarily needs to happen.  The work UCD does on this, in conjunction with the shared island initiative, will be very interesting.</p><p>I will raise an issue not directly related to Ireland's Future but I would like to get Mr. Murphy's perspective on it.  The new Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, leader, Doug Beattie, wrote a really good article, published in yesterday's<i></i>edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  One paragraph really stuck out for me and I ask for the witnesses' perspective on it.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	There are no column inches with me criticising either the SDLP or Sinn F&eacute;in for not taking part in the planning discussion around how to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.  I can understand [this] position, yet I find myself facing criticism because I won&rsquo;t join a discussion about how a united Ireland can be achieved.  Surely people can see that this is an unreasonable ask, and a degree of understanding, as I have shown, stops unnecessary division.  </blockquote> <p>It was a really fair point and I would love to get the witnesses' perspective on it, considering they are engaged with a broad group of people. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021060100002#K00400"><p>I will take the last comment first.  That is a fair comment by Doug Beattie.  I do not think he, or anybody, would be able to point a finger at any column inches generated by our organisation criticising him for his reticence to become involved in a conversation on constitutional change.  I understand and respect that position.  I touched upon it in my earlier remarks.</p> <p>  The fundamental issue is that a citizens' assembly might afford, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill said, the sensitive, thoughtful, citizen-led conversation that would permit the space around which difficult party-political concepts might be addressed.  The referendum to repeal the eighth amendment posed political difficulties for all parties.  The matter was somewhat devolved, almost, and became a-party political.  Through that, the true accurate voice was found and the Constitution was thereby amended.  It is really that spirit we feel might assist in assessing the true thoughts, fears, concerns and ambitions of those who repose a British identity in the North.  As such, the conversation that would occur in a citizens' assembly, informed by the evidence, might provide the political space where compromise can occur. </p> <p>  I absolutely do not recognise the contention that we are involved in a conversation with a preordained outcome.  Such an outcome would mean there would be referendums that would pass.  I have no idea whether a border poll would be voted for on either side of the Border.  However, the event of a referendum is, in itself, a demonstration of democracy.  There may be an misapprehension regarding Ireland's Future but the first line of our mission states that we aspire to Irish reunification.  For the avoidance of doubt, we hold the position that we absolutely aspire to a single-island unitary state but we want to facilitate a discussion towards that end.  Again, as reflected on our mission statement, this is in line with the principles and processes as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  We have been as clear as we possibly can be regarding our position, but a better understanding is needed of what has already been democratically mandated on both sides of the Border, that is, the Good Friday Agreement, which is given its legislative expression in the North by the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  That was part of what was mandated on both sides of the Border.</p><p>It is a logical, legislative and constitutional outworking of the Good Friday Agreement that consideration be given to a poll - a referendum - on the constitutional status of the island.  Therefore, it is not divisive to speak about that which has already been democratically mandated.  A little more credence should be given to that already democratically-mandated position.  </p></speech>

I refer to phrases such as, "The Irish Government, the EU ... need to begin planning for the inevitable" and "Planning has commenced; the governments must catch up".  I do not know if Mr. Murphy is suggesting that it is me or the committee more broadly which does not understand the Good Friday Agreement and what it states, or the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  Am I not understanding what Mr. Murphy is saying?</p></speech>

I suggested that it was not inevitable, whereas Mr. Murphy's language had it as being inevitable, and that it was one of a possible set of outcomes from a change conversation.  I never said that a border poll was impossible, rather that it was one of several possibilities.  It is also one part of an agreement which deals with a range of other issues concerning reconciliation, the building of trust and mutual understanding.</p></speech>

In so far as that is the case, therefore, it is as noble an aspiration to commit towards having as sensitive a conversation as can be held around this issue as that concerning the converse argument, which is to persuade citizens in the North that their best interests might lie within the United Kingdom.  I respect that is a conversation which has already commenced, is ongoing and I am happy to engage in and embrace such a discussion.  However, I refute the contention that it is divisive to advocate for something which is integral to the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

What I said is that Ireland's Future submission referred to there being an arrogance around the Brexit debate.  Specifically, what I said was that so much of this discussion is about tone.  I refer in that context to stating on one hand, within a couple of paragraphs, that there was an arrogance about Brexit, while, on the other hand, a border poll is inevitable.  I stated that what is inevitable is change generally and what is really important is the way in which that is done.  One possible barrier to that endeavour is to set a preordained outcome as the outcome from a process.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing to say as an elected representative and member of this committee.  There is nothing divisive about it.  We are entitled to have views and to express them; that is why we are here.</p></speech>

It may be rejected in the same way that it may be endorsed.  That is the fundamental point.  Where we find the opportunity for debate and consensus is in preparing for such a referendum.  People will then assume a position and argue and advocate for or against a particular outcome and that is the spirit of democratic discourse.  We say there is nothing to fear from engaging in that process.  All through our programme of work during the last two or three years, it will be found that we have attempted to undertake that work in as open and transparent a format as possible.</p> <p>  I am conscious that some other questions were posed to me.

They all need to contribute within the next 15 minutes.  I can see straight away that we will have Mr. Murphy back before the committee again, hopefully.  I state that because this is an important debate and we must clear the air on all these issues.  Now, I call Ms Claire Hanna MP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Hanna" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021060100002#L01300"><p>I thank the Chair and Mr. Murphy.  I am aware that other people will be contributing, so I will keep my comments fairly brief.  I thank Mr. Murphy for coming before the committee.  It has been a really interesting discussion.  Clearly, there are many views regarding tone and pace even among the members of the committee.  Before I ask two genuinely-meant questions, I want to pull up Mr. Murphy on two things.  A bit like Senator Currie said, I refer to the language about &quot;catching up&quot; - and I can understand where it comes from - that feels a little reflective of the Brexit conversation, where people were ranked by their speed, purity and longevity in adherence to that cause.<br/><br/>From the perspective of the SDLP, the North-South aspect and fulfilling all the potential of the Good Friday Agreement is something we have been dedicated to from day one.  If people are, therefore, playing a kind of <i>ma&igrave;tre d'</i>role in asking people to come into a process and then being glad that they have decided to join in it, it is important in that context to recognise that the Good Friday Agreement is multifaceted and the border poll is a crucial part of it but that people's work on all the strands and aspects of the agreement also should be respected.  <br/><br/>The other brief observation I have as an elected MP is to state that we must be cautious when talking about constituencies.  I think the term &quot;united Ireland constituencies&quot; was used earlier.  I am humble enough to say that I cannot swear to the constitutional aspirations of everybody who voted for me.  Overlaying that outcome on previous election results shows that thousands of people voted for me in the Westminster election of December 2019 who had previously voted for unionist parties.  We campaigned very strongly in that election on the issue of limiting the damage from Brexit.  Therefore, I am just a wee bit cautious, as the SDLP has always been, about people making every election a border poll.  I am also cautious about describing these as &quot;united Ireland constituencies&quot; and ascribing political views to people when they vote on different issues.  <br/><br/>I am cautious in that regard concerning not just a diverse constituency like mine but also, for example, in respect of somewhere like Belfast North.  John Finucane MP has expressed similar sentiments to what I just said, in stating that those elections in 2019 were unique and it is important to not immediately bag everybody who voted for remain as being for a united Ireland as well.  Many of those people, including many thousands in my constituency, will be for a united Ireland.  However, I am just uncomfortable for people who voted in good faith on a particular issue, like Brexit, now being put in a basket as part of a &quot;united Ireland constituency&quot; as a result.  I think that kind of presumptuousness frightens people and may not facilitate people voting outside their comfort zones.  <br/><br/>I also agreed with a lot of points from different contributions.  I have two queries about engagement with unionism more widely.  It was interesting to hear from Rev. Karen Sethuraman and Mr. Trevor Lunn MLA recently at this committee on the subject of engagement with people who do not come from a traditional nationalist background and who are not instinctively for this conversation.  How far will Ireland's Future go to engage with individuals in that regard, as well as more broadly?  We had a presentation from officials in the shared Ireland unit and they had also done good work in searching and finding people who were not already plugged into this conversation.  <br/><br/>Regarding the final report of the University College London, UCL, working group on Irish unification referendums published last week, has Mr. Murphy had an opportunity to go through it?  An interim report was published by the group some months ago.  The final report now considers some of the structural aspects which must be examined to have a good, solid and engaged debate and some of the gates that will need to be passed through.  I would like to hear Mr. Murphy's response to that report.  Has that served to crystalise his thinking regarding the timing of a possible referendum?  Those are my questions, because I know others want to come in.  </p></speech>

I will try to be brief.  I welcome Mr. Murphy to the meeting.  I do not take a position on a united Ireland, as such, or other constitutional matters but I am very happy to engage on Ireland's future and other matters on a without prejudice basis as to where things may go.  I appreciate that a fluid and open conversation is happening in many respects.</p> <p>  Mr. Murphy earlier made reference to the Alliance Party vote and the wider centre ground in Northern Ireland.  There is a certain fluidity to that.  It will be influenced not only by the offer in terms of any potential united Ireland but also in terms of the push factors and how the UK and Northern Ireland are perceived, and how Northern Ireland is seen to be working or not.  It is important to bear in mind that constituency of voters will look at practical issues and can move around in terms of potential opinions, subject to a whole range of factors.  Many of the issues of concern about how a united Ireland would look will be practical, rather than symbolic.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two particular points around process with Mr. Murphy.  I accept that at some point the Governments need to have a proposition.  If there is ever to be a border poll, the proposition would need to be very clear, particularly for those in the centre ground.  That will involve the Irish and UK Governments finessing the question and the detailed proposition that will be put to voters in both jurisdictions on the island.  Before that happens, I understand the need for a citizens' assembly as part of that process, although we are not at that stage just yet.  More work needs to be done around having open-ended conversations.  I would suggest to Mr. Murphy that the best people to do that are in universities, colleges and civil society organisations for now.  If there is a desire to bring in people from a unionist tradition, the more mutual or impartial the forum is perceived to be, the more likely conversations will get going.  If the subject areas are around practical things, such as how the health service would operate in a different situation, that is the type of conversation with which people may be willing to engage, rather than the broader umbrella concept of a united Ireland in general.  That may be a better way of getting people involved in those discussions, particularly on a much broader basis.</p> <p>  In a similar light, it is important to try to focus on practical areas of co-operation on a North-South basis.  That might just stand on its own two feet or it may become a precursor to wider political and constitutional change.  There is still ample scope for co-operation between the two jurisdictions on the island.  That needs to be explored much more in the short to medium term anyway, before the wider political and constitutional debate gathers momentum, if that happens, in practice.  I appreciate that we are seeing some very disappointing moves against that from the DUP at the moment but, nonetheless, that is where a lot of focus needs to be in the short term.</p> <p>  Those are largely comments but I am happy for Mr. Murphy to respond, including to the questions asked by Ms Hanna.</p></speech>

We can push that limit to nearer ten minutes but I am conscious of everybody here and the importance of this meeting.  If it is helpful, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party are entitled to their second round of questions.  If it is in order, would it be possible for us to bring Mr. Murphy in again within a fortnight?  That is as soon as we can get him here.  We would then continue with the rotation, starting with the representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in and followed by the representatives of the Green Party.  That would be appropriate and proper.  I do not know what the rules are about people going north to visit Mr. Murphy but perhaps the different parties could communicate with him separately through Zoom meetings or whatever because teasing out ideas is important to understand everybody's positions and respect them.  If it is in order, I would require the consent of the committee to go ahead with another meeting within two weeks in which representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in will be followed by those from the Green Party and a rotation thereafter.</p> <p>  I now ask Mr. Murphy to answer the questions from the SDLP and the Alliance Party within five minutes.  That would be the fairest way to proceed.  I call on him to summarise his remarks in the understanding that he will be before the committee again within two weeks.</p></speech>

I am obliged for the invitation.  I will first deal with Ms Hanna's observations.  I also welcome the initiatives that have been undertaken by the SDLP in convening a forum within the party that seeks to examine, receive and test opinions on the constitutional future.  The new Ireland forum is also an expression of where momentum is at and where the conversation sits.  I look forward to engaging with that forum as part of our ongoing network of output.</p> <p>  Ms Hanna also mentioned the working group on unification referendums on the island of Ireland in University College London, UCL, and other universities.  I have not read the full report but received the advance summary.  After an academically robust undertaking, UCL has ostensibly arrived at the same position for which we have been advocating.  Its position on the prospect of a referendum or when it would be held is wholly neutral but it considers a referendum is likely.  It suggests that planning would need to start in good time before any referendum is held and that planning needs to be led by the British and Irish Governments working closely with a full range of actors across the island of Ireland and in Britain.  We agree in that regard.  I have no problem confirming that our analysis is consistent with that of UCL.</p> <p>  The university has also noted the acrimony over Brexit and highlights the dangers of calling for a vote without adequate advance planning.  I do not think any person holding a view on Brexit would say the referendum was a well-informed debate on a well set out series of outcomes.  Brexit was haphazard and our lived experience of what went on is a sharp and recent lesson as to how not to do referendums.  I have no qualms in saying that.  We are appealing for planning to commence now insofar as Ireland's future exists.  UCL has done its report.  The Royal Irish Academy's ARINS project is doing work.  The ESRI is doing work, as is the SDLP.  That is what I mean when I say the work has started.</p></speech>

As for my position on the UCL, I wholly respect Mr. Farry's observations.  It is a valid perspective.  We have had constructive engagement with the wider Alliance Party, and we have learned from that and hope to continue to do so.  Nevertheless, I am cognisant of recent opinion polls that have examined the constitutional preference of those parties that are constitutionally neutral.  <i>The Sunday Times</i>examined the issue on 23 January 2021 and found that 38% of Alliance voters it surveyed leaned towards a united Ireland dispensation, while 26% were of a United Kingdom perspective.  I accept that we cannot repose too much faith in opinion polls, but LucidTalk on behalf of &quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; concluded in April that 77% of Alliance voters incline towards a united Ireland.<br/><br/>There are ever-evolving shifts and they are all responsive to the position in which we find ourselves.  We are in a post-Brexit constitutional era.  Insofar as constitutional change is already upon us, Brexit changed our constitutional status.  I am no longer able to avail of the mechanisms of the EU to express a mandate within it.  Unionism reposes a deeply held objection to the Northern Ireland protocol, concerned that it represents constitutional change.  Constitutional change is here already, therefore, and our mission is that we manage it in as responsible and as detailed a manner as possible, and to do so in a form that provides for all perspectives genuinely to contribute and to feel that their constitutional sensibilities are being respected, independent of the outcome.  I do not propose there is a preordained outcome.  The outcome will happen only through the exercise of the franchise and that is what democracy is all about.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#A00500"><p>We have had some discussion on this group of amendments.  I have given a commitment to Deputy Boyd Barrett that I will take another look at the word "undue" and I will do that and revert to him, although it is a matter for the Deputy as to how he proposes to proceed with the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 9 and 38, are jointly tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 85, are jointly tabled by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Barry.  Amendment No. 9 seeks to delete an existing part of section 2 and to substitute it with "to ensure delivery of vibrant and sustainable mixed income communities".  That is what we want and what the agency will do.  It is inherent in the Bill as drafted that fundamentally we want the Land Development Agency, LDA, to deliver sustainable communities for people, particularly in the areas of affordable and social housing.  We have already had that discussion already, so I do not propose to rehash that argument.  </p> <p>  As currently drafted section 2(c) provides that one of the purposes of the Act is to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social background.  Section 2(n) provides that the purpose of the Act is to facilitate measures designed to achieve socially integrated housing.  It is important to say that rather than picking out one element of the purposes of the Act - I have given a commitment to take another look at the phrase "undue segregation" because I can see how that could be construed as what we do not want it to mean - members need to look at all of the purposes listed from section 2(a) to section 2(s).  They should not be seeking to have one of them deleted or to highlight a particular line.  They need to be read in context and together.  Section 2(a) provides that the purposes of the Act is to enable urgent measures to be taken to increase supply of housing in the State and in particular affordable and social housing.  I imagine everyone would agree with that.  Section 2(b) reads "to ensure that public land which is not being utilised or is under-utilised, is made available for housing in the State."  That is just example of the purposes of the Act.  All of the main purposes are listed in subsections (a) to (s).  I am opposing this amendment as I believe what is sought is already adequately covered by the two provisions I referenced, that is, section 2(c) and 2(n).  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 seeks to delete the word "undue" and amendment No. 11 seeks to replace the words "social background" with "incomes".   I get that argument and I have undertaken to take another look at amendment No. 10.  However, I will be opposing it on Committee Stage but I give a commitment to members that I will look at that piece again.  These amendments do not change the intent of the provision, which is to ensure that this legislation seeks to provide and promote greater integration in housing across all of society.  Again, we all want to do that.  As I said, I will be opposing these amendments.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 seek to amend the section by removing any reference to socially integrated housing and replacing with either "make public housing available to people on a broad range of incomes" or "vibrant, sustainable and mixed income communities".  There is nothing wrong with that wording but we have to ensure that the wording in this Bill when enacted is consistent with other related Acts.  I understand where the Deputies are coming from.  My contention is that these areas are already adequately covered in the context of the purposes of the Act.  Again, I am opposing these amendments as I do not consider they add anything to the provision, which is to provide that this legislation facilitates measures designed to achieve exactly what we all want, that is, socially integrated housing. </p> <p>  All of us recognise the importance of greater integration in housing.  As Minister, I want to see the delivery of mixed tenure and affordable housing on State lands, as, I am sure, do all members of the committee.  I said last week, when we met on a number of occasions, that the predominance of the sites, in particular in our urban areas, would be 100% social and affordable, which is an issue we will come to as to move to later sections in the Bill.  It is vital that the State uses its land to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent, as well as social homes.  We need to use all means at our disposal to do that.  </p> <p>  I will come back on Report Stage in regard to the wording "undue segregation".  I take the point raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 86 in the name of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan seeks to amend section 13(1)(g) by including a reference to communities.  Section 2(d) in regard to the purposes of the Act refers to the development of communities.  This is a sensible amendment.  I am prepared to accept amendment No. 83 to add "and communities", which will take into account Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.   I will make that change further down in section 2(d).  </p></speech>

The people who live in social and affordable housing or private rented accommodation are not all necessarily from different areas.  It is important that we do stigmatise or label areas.  I come from Knocknaheeny, which is a major social housing development on the north side of Cork city.  I own my own home now.  Some of the guys with whom I went to school became carpenters, accountants and so on.  On the block where I lived, there was a real cross-section of society.  Wording is key.  I note the Minister said he is willing to take another look at some of the wording.  When drafting legislation, it is important the wording is positive and constructive and that it does not label or stigmatise areas.  I ask that the Minister be conscious of that.</p> <p>  I am proud of where I came from and grew up.  I live in Gurranabraher now, which is another social housing development.  I love my community and the people who live there.  There is a great cross-section of society.  It is important not to pigeonhole people and to say that if they come from a particular area they are in a particular section.</p></speech>

I am suggesting we take amendment No. 83 and add in "and communities" after "the delivery of housing".  Basically we would insert it as section 13(1)(d).  We would basically accept amendment No. 83 and add "and communities" to it.  I think that does what the Deputy wants to do with amendment No. 86.  I am sorry to cut across.  Does that clarify the matter for the Deputy?</p></speech>

We are seeing some new developments under Part 5 designed in a segregated way.  There is a relatively new development in the Minister's constituency that I am aware of.  The front doors of the Part 5 units go out onto a busy road while the doors of all the other homes in the development go out into a communal courtyard.  That is in the Minister's constituency.</p></speech>

To be fair to the residents in the development I do not wish to name it, but I will tell the Minister.  It is in the southern end of the constituency.

There should be no segregation whatsoever.  My point is not simply about the wording, although I acknowledge the Minister is willing to look at that.  The issue is also that we have <i>de facto</i>segregation by virtue of the fact that the income thresholds for social housing have not increased for more than ten years.  Bit by bit, the people who qualify for social housing are people on ever lower incomes.  These are working people - the bus driver, the nurse, the bank clerk and so on - whose incomes used to qualify them for social housing but no longer do.  They will continue to be moved into a different category unless we significantly increase the income thresholds.</p><p>I do not know how many times I raised this with Eoghan Murphy in the last Government.  We were told of a mythical review of the income thresholds.  Every few months we would be told it was coming but it never came.  To me that was a deliberate policy to cull numbers on the social housing lists.  People were literally thrown off the lists.  Whenever a person got the slightest pay increase, he or she was thrown off the list.  This was a source of great distress for people who had been on those lists often for ten or 15 years.  All that time waiting was simply gone.  They have been in limbo since then because there was no affordable scheme in reality and no cost rental scheme in reality.</p><p>My point is we are now saying that we need a different category for that group of people.  We end up with <i>de facto</i>segregation.  I believe that is why the drafters of the Bill referred to the word &quot;undue&quot;.  They knew in fact there will be segregation in the way we are doing things.  We are going to have different categories of affordable or social housing delivered to different people based on certain thresholds.  I believe we should be looking for ways to genuinely get rid of that segregation by saying that social housing and affordable housing should be available for everyone.</p><p>I wish to make one last point.  We see this in reality and it is not unfair to call it housing apartheid.  I know of developments in my area where the 10% social housing is all segregated into one block of a development.  Even different finishings and different quality building materials are used for the social housing parts, which is disgraceful.  In the same development a building that may look externally the same has different finishings internally and different features because it is social housing.  It is as if they are doing it on the cheap.  In most cases such dwellings are segregated from the private ones.  It makes something of a lie of the notion of the somewhat patronising term &quot;social mix&quot;.  If that is what we actually want, if we want a mix of people with different incomes and backgrounds, then it really should be a mix.  It should not be segregated into one block.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#B00800"><p>I think the Minister misunderstands or misinterprets the significance of the wording change.  The problem is that the idea of mixed tenure automatically promoting integration has become something of a dogma, especially in political circles around housing.  Many of us could take the Minister to mixed tenure housing estates where there is no integration.  Where there are multi-unit developments there will be social housing tenants who are denied the right to participate in the owner management company annual general meetings.  This creates clear divisions.  There are different service delivery arrangements for refuse collection.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, there are different finishes.  There is a practice with apartment developments of putting all the social housing in one block because it is more cost effective for the approved housing body to manage one block rather than a different layout.  It creates all manner of tensions.</p> <p>  All the evidence from all our housing policy experts, especially Michelle Norris, Tony Fahey and Mick Byrne in UCD, shows that mixed tenure is not the issue, but mixed income is.  We can achieve mixed income either through mixed tenure or in a variety of other ways.  For example, St. Michael's Estate is an important housing development that Dublin City Council is leading on and the Department is supporting.  That will not be a mixed tenure estate.  It will have social and affordable renters, all of whom will be renters from Dublin City Council.  The great value of that development is that it is mixed income.  That is why I am proposing the amendment.  I am not going to prolong the debate but I will be pressing amendments Nos. 9, 38 and 86.</p></speech>

I have said to members that they should read the purposes of the Act section in its entirety because each of the points in it are related.  In many instances what is being proposed by the speakers would perpetrate segregation by insisting on mono-tenure or purely public housing on public land.  We cannot have it both ways.  We need a mix of affordable purchase.</p> <p>  I agree completely on the design point.  It should not be a question of a different design or an apportionment of an area when we state that the area is designated for social or affordable housing.  Deputy O'Callaghan's party and Deputy &Oacute; Broin's party voted against a scheme in Donabate for 1,200 homes.  All the homes are pepper-potted within it, and rightly so.  There is no difference between any of the homes.  Areas of the estates are not picked.</p> <p>  I fully understand the phrase "undue segregation" and where it is in legislative terms.  It appears in other planning Acts as well.  I have said I will look at that.  I certainly do not want segregation in housing and I would not stand over it.  That is what this legislation ensures.  The aim is that State agency land is available to all people.  That is what it does.  It does not say that there has to be an estate purely for social housing.  In itself, that would perpetrate segregation by having a whole estate set aside as a social housing estate.  We should all want to move away from that.</p> <p>  I have explained already and I have no wish to keep going back and forth.  I respect the fact that Deputies have gone to the trouble of tabling amendments.  I will not be accepting them but I will come back on Report Stage with regard to the phrase mentioned, "undue segregation".  In fairness, there may be a misunderstanding of what we would actually do within this.  It would be perpetrating segregation of one part of our community from another part of our community.</p><p>We would simply be saying that State and public land can only be for a certain type of housing.  That is not something I could agree with and I do not think that anyone should agree with it.</p></speech>

I have posted a map of this on my Twitter page so people can see the difference between the southside and northside of the city.  It means that people on the southside of the city, where there are cycle lanes and greenways, have an option of how they go to work.  On the northside, because of a lack of this vital infrastructure, people are limited mainly to using cars, so then they are forced to pay an unfair carbon tax because there is not sustainable or equal development of cycle lanes, greenways and roads.  This is a huge issue for my constituency of Cork North-Central.  There is a lot of talk about the environment and how we are trying to reach the 2030 goals.  If you live on the northside of Cork city or in Cork North-Central, there is not balanced development.  What we want included here in the legislation are roads, cycle lanes and greenways because they are vital infrastructure.</p></speech>

You want to have a broad definition as opposed to just focusing on certain specifics like amendment No. 12 that seeks to insert a reference to "road, cycling and other active mobility infrastructure&rdquo;.  We hope to see that in all of them because it is good design.  Amendment No. 87 seek to insert this reference into section 13(g).  The inclusion of references to the development of communities well served by public transport and public amenities highlights the importance the Government places on the delivery of vibrant, well-connected communities.  That is in the definition under the purposes of the Act.  Road, cycling and other active mobility infrastructure fall under the broad categories of public transport and public amenities.  Active public transport links will provide roads and wider transport-related infrastructure while public amenities will include cycling lanes and other related infrastructure.</p> <p>  The amendment strays into the planning piece for the specific developments.  I understand the intent of these amendments.  I am not accepting them as I believe the sections, as currently drafted, cover the proposed provisions and further amendments are not necessary.  I genuinely think the broad definitions we have given fully encompass road cycling and other active mobility infrastructures.  If you were to get into defining all of them, what are you leaving out?  That is why it is better to have the broad definition we have already in the Bill.  Certainly there is no question we want well-connected and well-served communities with public transport, good amenities, cycling, walking and everything else.  The amendments simply say, "road, cycling and other active mobility infrastructure&rdquo;.  I understand the intent but the amendments are too prescriptive.</p></speech>

I made a submission on the site, and this goes to the whole heart of ensuring that when we build and develop communities, they are sustainable.  I am concerned there will be a lack of infrastructure if the description is too broad.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I are trying to be constructive.  We are saying we need this infrastructure to be put in place if we want to develop communities and make them sustainable.  We are not being argumentative.  We are trying to improve the Bill, if we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#D01700"><p>I am genuinely surprised because this is a friendly amendment, and I thought, not unlike Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment in the previous section, it was one the Minister could support.  It is important to understand about the amendment that there is a sea change in transportation policy taking place.  Unfortunately, like so many other areas, Irish governments have been slow to catch up on this.</p> <p>  Traditionally, transportation was the preserve of engineers, the people who built roads, whereas increasingly it is about active mobility.  For me, the important bit of this amendment is the reference to active mobility because that is much more than the engineering of roads infrastructure, although we need an adequate supply of that.  It also involves, exactly as the Minister said, mobility transport and planning experts to ensure the maximum possible number of options are available if we are to shift people's modal use away from cars and towards other uses.</p><p>From my reading of the Bill, it does not seem to mention active mobility anywhere, which is a real omission.  My fear is that, if it is not included, it will not get done.  It will become an option rather than a requirement.  Given that the Minister has said he hopes to see the Land Development Agency incorporate these new active mobility and updated transport policies - and we would ultimately like to see all new housing developments do likewise - I can see no reason the Minister would not accept this amendment or why he would not insert such a provision elsewhere in the Bill if he feels there is a more important location for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#E00200"><p>To follow on from that point, in his reply, the Minister said that he felt the amendment is too prescriptive.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned that transport has really been the preserve of engineers.  This could have been very prescriptive.  The proposers of the amendment could have gone into gradients and all the rest.  This is actually pretty standard.  We need to acknowledge that, at least in the constituency I share with the Minister, an awful lot of the LDA land banks are on the fringes of towns, away from train stations, traditional town centres and schools that already exist.  The promotion of active travel needs to be at the core of transport and housing policy rather than something outside it, falling into the very broad definition included in the original Bill.  The Minister has said he is not going to accept the amendment but I really do not see the harm in doing so.  It is a very reasonable amendment.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, under whose remit active mobility falls.  Two years ago, I hardly gave a second thought to escooters and they are now something to which we all have to adapt.  It is a mode of transport that is here and growing.  We are going to need the infrastructure to support it.  This amendment would have captured that issue without being too prescriptive.  I will leave it there.</p></speech>

I give consideration to all amendments that members have worked on and put forward.  I do not have an objection to this <i>per se</i>but, to look at another element, if we were to adopt the amendment we would start to become prescriptive with regard to the travel element while not being prescriptive about the public amenities element under section 2(d).  After &quot;to enable the sustainable development of new and regenerated communities well-served by schools, public transport&quot;, &quot;road, cycling and other active mobility infrastructure&quot; would be added in before &quot;and public amenities&quot;.  This could raise questions.  I am genuinely not trying to be difficult, but do we then need to start defining what these public amenities are?  Deputy Duncan Smith just made a very valid point with regard to escooters.  What other things would present themselves in a few years' time when we are operating under this legislation?  I would have thought it preferable to leave the provision broad so that it can encompass all of those elements as opposed to being too prescriptive.</p><p>I have sympathy for what the members are saying in the sense that we absolutely want to ensure that these new developments will have connectivity with the towns and cities in which they are located and that active mobility is provided for through good infrastructure for cycling, walking and other modes of transport.  I am happy to look at whether section 2(d) could be broadened in some way to encompass that.  I am genuine in asking, however, why we would not be prescriptive about public amenities if we are going to be prescriptive with regard to the type of transport or travel facilities?  It would bring a bit of imbalance to section 2(d).  I am happy to look at the issue on Report Stage.  I take the amendment as being intended constructively.  There is no question about that.  We are not just opposing it for the sake of opposing it.  The Deputy will have seen earlier that I am quite happy to accept amendments.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has an amendment that makes sense.  I can look at the issue again on Report Stage and see if we can improve the wording.  I am happy to do that but I will leave it up to the Deputies to decide whether to press their amendment.</p></speech>

They propose that references to the Land Development Agency having powers in respect of public lands be extended to include private lands.  I made many points earlier on about what a land development agency should be.  It should not be a body that essentially opens the door and gives access to the public land bank to private capital.  Rather, it should go in exactly the opposite direction.  It should be a body that takes over the building land bank currently controlled by private speculators and developers in order to use it to deliver housing to meet housing needs, particularly the need for social and affordable housing.  What I would like to see, and what these amendments aim to bring about, is an agency that essentially does what the Kenny report talked about.  It should, in an aggressive way, take control of the bank of land for building that is currently largely privately held in order to deal with outrageous site costs and the hoarding of land and empty properties.  This would be an agency which takes over land and property so that it cannot be hoarded or used for speculation and which would force that land and property into use with the social objective of delivering the housing that people need.  The logic behind all of these various amendments is to include that emphasis on going in and taking control of the land bank that is currently privately held.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 14 seeks to amend section 2(e) of the Bill, which provides for the development and regeneration of all relevant public land for housing, to include a reference to "relevant private" land.  Amendment No. 32 seeks to amend section 2(k) of the Bill, which provides for the same thing, consolidation and provision, to include a reference to privately owned land.  Amendment No. 50, as the Deputy has explained, also seeks to give the agency some control over the use of private land.  I am not accepting these amendments as the purpose of the Bill is to establish the LDA and to make appropriate arrangements for the utilisation of relevant public lands for housing.</p><p>We want to make sure that happens.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, the State is the biggest hoarder of land and we need to make sure it uses its land productively for the good of citizens and society.  The Bill is not legislating for privately owned land.  There is already a vacant site levy in place, which I do have an issue with, by the way, and which is there to activate private and public lands.  I am considering and will consider further measures, as appropriate, for private land activation.  I intend to do that because I do not think the vacant site levy operates as it should.  I do not believe it is otherwise appropriate to include such references in this legislation.</p><p> We need to get the agency up and running to develop the lands it has already, that is, the nine sites, and to get on with them.  It will have the ability under compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers to acquire other lands, and ransom strips in particular.  Section 2(p) of the Bill already provides for the establishment of appropriate mechanisms and structures for the development of public and privately owned lands for housing.  This will generally operate by consent.  I foresee that happening where the LDA will be partnering with others regarding adjacent private lands.  I have included now appropriate CPO powers to acquire certain private lands where necessary, powers which it did not have in the first draft heads of Bill that we went through in the previous Oireachtas.  I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for tabling the amendment but I will not be accepting it.</p></speech>

It just shows a fundamental difference in approach.  There is a lot of unutilised public land but, in my opinion and that of many members of the committee, that land is underutilised because central government has refused to give local authorities the money, resources and so on to develop public land.  Rather than seeing the problem being addressed by allowing private finance in on public land, the problem would be addressed by the Government giving the resources and money to local authorities to build public and affordable housing on public land.</p> <p>  I take the point about semi-State land and so on and that it is something the agency could usefully do but, again, I think it should be transferred to local authorities.  The big gap and problem is that property developers and land speculators and so on control too much of the land bank.  They manipulate the market and land prices and so on and they drip-feed housing according to what makes the most money for them.  They are fundamentally not interested in solving the housing crisis and, for the most part, they actually benefit from the housing crisis and from keeping suitable building land as a scarce resource that they control.  That is what needs to be addressed and what this agency should be doing, but it is obvious that is not what the Government wants to do because it is dancing very significantly to the tune of the speculators and big property developers.

It is about what the best delivery or development model is for housing on the lands that the LDA will be delivering.  The problem with this set of sections of the Bill is that it promotes joint ventures, land initiatives, collaborations with investment vehicles and a variety of commercial contracts, with the consequence that it will dramatically increase the development costs, not just for any portion of houses on a development that are sold at unaffordable, open market prices, but even for the delivery of affordable homes.  To take an example, Shanganagh Castle is a development that most of us broadly support the principle of because it is 100% public housing.  The difficulty is that the Land Development Agency currently cannot say what the price of the affordable purchase homes will be, because the development and financing model that it will use, which is fundamentally different from the &Oacute; Cualann model which most members of this committee actively support, means that the all-in development costs are higher.  It could be as high as we saw at the O'Devaney Gardens site where so-called affordable homes accessing the serviced sites fund will be sold for as much as &euro;310,000, plus a shared equity portion of another &euro;50,000, so an all-in cost of &euro;360,000.  That is the consequence of developing through joint ventures and land initiatives, which the sections I am trying to amend here facilitate.</p> <p>  The Minister rightly mentioned the Donabate development.  A problem with that initiative is that 60% of the homes will not be available to between 80% and 90% of the population, going by the income distribution figures of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, because according to Fingal County Council, they would sell at prices of between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  Instead of providing housing for the 80% or 90% of the population currently locked out of the market, we will see, through a joint venture land initiative, 60% of the homes made available to only 15% or 20% of the population, people who already have new homes to purchase because that is all that the market is delivering at the moment.  The Minister knows that I am not in favour of a centralised State agency.  Other Opposition parties have argued for centralised State agencies, although different from the Land Development Agency.  If one is to have one, it makes no sense to use a variety of private sector delivery models that push up prices either for so-called affordable housing or for unaffordable open market homes.  Every single home on public land should be available to the largest number of people, 80% or 90% of the population.  The Government has no business setting up an agency that will allow scarce public land to be used to build homes that will be sold at prices of &euro;400,000 or more.  That is not just bad housing but is reckless in the extreme and is one of the reasons we have a housing crisis in the first place.  That is why amendments Nos. 39, 88, 89, 90 and 93 seek to exclude those speculative private sector delivery mechanisms.  That would clear the way for using delivery mechanisms that guarantee the maximum number of affordable homes at prices that working people can actually afford.</p></speech>

The latter means that fewer people can access housing that is affordable for either rent or purchase and that obviously locks them out in terms of affordability.  It also creates a housing supply issue because if we rely on the private delivery of housing and private developers, they will develop land - and this is not just in Ireland but anywhere - at a pace at which they can achieve the kinds of full market prices they are looking for.  That means a drip feed of development over time.  For example, one of the largest developers in the country, to which the lands in Donabate have been effectively sold, has enough land for 17,000 homes, according to the developer itself, and, according to that same developer, will build just 1,200 this year.  Therefore, when it comes to land banks, yes, there is an issue with State lands, but there are also issues with private developers, how they hold land and how that fits the market prices they try to achieve.  As for the Land Development Agency, it is very important that we try not only to break that method of delivery at full market price and the slow delivery that goes with it but also to ensure a faster delivery of affordable homes.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 93, which is in the name of Deputy Pringle but which he has asked me to move, relates specifically to investment funds and seeks that the Land Development Agency not be permitted to allow private investment funds purchase land, developments or housing from the agency.  That is a very important amendment and I am happy to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#H01300"><p>This is part of a series of amendments explained by Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Broin which seek to exclude what the Bill seeks to include, which is essentially to bring in private investors to develop the public land bank.  This is a point I have made to the Minister before, and Deputy O'Callaghan has just made it too.  I would love to hear the Minister's response on this.  To me, it is not even an ideological comment; it is just a basic statement of fact about a private business.  The private developer has no interest, objectively speaking, in solving the housing crisis - none.  That is not what it is in business for.  That is what the Government is in business for.  That is what the local authorities are in business for.  That is what not-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives are for.  Private investors have one sole purpose and that is to make money.  They do not do anything that does not make them a profit.  If it is not profitable for them to increase supply, on either public land or private land, they just will not do it.  If you needed a lesson in this, you could not get a bigger one than the 2008 crash.  At the point at which the cannot make money, private investors are quite capable of crashing an entire economy because they have no interest in building.  The idea, therefore, that these people who are interested only in money would not only control the private land bank but also then have significant influence over whether public land gets developed for the public and affordable housing we need is, to my mind, tantamount to madness.  I would honestly like to hear the Minister's response.  Does he not remember how the public private partnerships, PPPs, that had been set up with certain developers in this country collapsed because the private developers just decided, "This is no longer a good deal for me so I am just not doing it".  Plans to develop part of the north inner city just collapsed because the private developers had no interest.  This Bill gives the public land bank over as a sort of hostage to private investors and private developers, who, let us be clear, and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has alluded to this point, have no interest in the price of housing or rents dramatically decreasing.  We do.  Renters do.  Ordinary workers looking to buy have a big interest in having rents or house prices they can afford.  Private investors have no interest in that.  The last thing they want is for rents or house prices to drop dramatically.  It is madness.</p> <p>  Finally, as soon as these PPPs, for want of another term - that is what they are - come into play in one form or another, then accountability and all sorts of secret commercial sensitivity issues come into play such that it is impossible to get to the bottom even of how things are financed and so on.  Rather than all that, we are trying to say that while these private interests borrow money, the State can borrow money too.  It can tax in order to increase the revenue, but it is more effective and less hostage to market forces for the State to do this itself and, of course, in the long run it will save the State money because we will not be leasing property off these guys further down the line.</p></speech>

To put all this in context, the Government is the biggest builder and the biggest investor in housing in the State.  We passed the largest housing budget in the history of the State in budget 2021, bringing forward affordability measures that I hope Deputies opposite will support when the relevant Bill comes before the D&aacute;il because those are real measures and this is the most comprehensive and significant affordable housing Bill ever.</p> <p>  We also believe in home ownership, however, and I will tell the Deputies one thing that excludes people.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about excluding people just as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan talked about locking people out.  The greatest mechanism for doing that is to object continually to schemes that have been brought forward by local authorities for real homes for real people that they need.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis, as everyone knows, and I know everyone is earnest in trying to bring about its resolution.  Fundamentally, however, we will not resolve a housing crisis with the public sector on its own.  We will need the private sector.  That is the reality of the matter.  Fundamentally, the Land Development Agency is about putting our State lands to active use.  As all members of the committee will be aware, there are far too many State lands lying idle which have been idle for years and have been subject to back-and-forth discussion and debate on ideological grounds.  Our people want to see delivery.  I reiterate that I envisage we will have 100% social and affordable housing on many of the sites in our urban areas.  Will this require us partnering in some areas?  Absolutely it will.  There is no question about that.  There are nine sites the Land Development Agency has at the moment and I want to see the agency develop them out.  That is the importance of passing this Bill.</p><p>There is no silver bullet to the housing crisis.  I put it to the committee that if some members are arguing that it is possible to tackle the housing crisis with one arm tied one's back then that is nonsense.  It cannot be done.  We need to tool up the State.  I am very aware of that.  That is why I have been to the fore in getting our local authorities building again.  What the LDA will be doing will be in addition to what the local authorities are doing.  The purpose of the LDA is to supplement the delivery of housing by local authorities, not to supplant them.  I am opposing these amendments as these provisions are needed to ensure that all avenues can be used to ensure delivery of much-needed housing in the State.  </p><p> We need to be delivering 33,000 homes per annum.  We are way off that at the moment.  The continued procrastination and blocking of measures that the Government is trying to bring forward will not help anyone.  It certainly will not help working people to be able to own or rent a home at an affordable rate.  We are trying to meet that need.  These provisions are necessary and are wholly appropriate for the LDA.  It is being established on a commercial basis and, in line with other commercial States bodies, will be able to enter into commercial arrangements.  It needs to be able to do that.  The main Opposition spokesperson has already said in previous hearings that the LDA should not be involved in building homes.  It is also appropriate that the LDA in its role as a development agency would work with other public and private sector land holders, as it is with our local authorities, to develop large areas for the provision of housing and the regeneration of communities.  These provisions are appropriate and I remind Deputies that the LDA will remain in the ownership of the State, with the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform as the shareholders.  There is no provision for any other shareholders.  In addition, all dividends will be returned for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Ministerial consent will be required where the LDA seeks to establish subsidiaries or to enter into significant capital commitments.  This will ensure that there will be a significant oversight of the LDA's operations, including its commercial activities.  There is also provision for ministerial direction to the LDA in relation to its strategic priorities.  </p><p> On amendment No. 93 in the name of Deputy Pringle, I am opposing this amendment as I propose to bring in an amendment No. 134 to section 55, which will effectively do the same thing.  This is about the disposal of land by the agency.  Section 55 already provides that ministerial consent is required where the LDA or a subsidiary designated activity company, DAC, is seeking to dispose of land but that this consent is not required where it is disposing of a single house for rent or purchase.  I am bringing an amendment to provide that the LDA will need to seek ministerial approval where more than one house is being sold as part of a linked transaction.  In other words, it will not be able to dispose of more than one house to a single purchaser without seeking ministerial consent.  On the question of why ministerial consent would in some instances be required, there may be occasions where it would be appropriate for the LDA to sell multiple units to a local authority or an approved housing body.  I will bring forward that amendment.  </p><p> The planning legislation that I am bringing forward, in respect of which a circular has issued already, prohibits the sale of more than one property in new planning applications to a single purchaser.  There are exceptions to that with which I believe all Deputies are in agreement, that is, approved housing bodies and local authorities for which it would be appropriate in some instances, but that would require ministerial approval under the LDA Bill.  As I said, I will bring forward another amendment, amendment No. 134, to address what Deputy Pringle is getting at in amendment No. 93.  For that reason, I will not be accepting his amendment.  I also will not be accepting the amendments tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould, Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#J00300"><p>I will be brief.  The Minister is factually incorrect in claiming that the Government is the largest builder in the State.  Last year, fewer than 800 new social houses were directly delivered by the local authorities and a couple of hundred houses were delivered by approved housing bodies.  Almost all other housing was purchased from the private sector as turnkeys, public private partnerships or Part V provision.  The main ask of many of us in the Opposition is not that we would have only public sector provision, but that the public sector would carry its fair share of the delivery, particularly of social and affordable homes.</p> <p>  It is also not the case that the State is the biggest investor.  This year, the State will invest &euro;1.4 billion of capital expenditure on social housing and a small number of affordable homes.  That is a fraction of the total amount of money that will be invested by the private sector, including by the Housing Finance Agency, private banks and others, in the delivery of housing.  Not only the Opposition, but the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is urging the Government to double direct capital investment in social and affordable housing.  This is at the heart of these amendments because it is what this Bill is about.  The reason almost everybody bar Government is calling for a dramatic increase in direct State investment for the delivery of genuinely affordable housing and more social housing is because the private sector, utilising vehicles such as joint ventures and initiatives, as referenced in these sections of the Bill we are seeking to amend, cannot do that.  That is why the IMF, for which I am no great advocate, increased public expenditure when Fianna F&aacute;il was last in government.  The IMF is arguing that now is the time for Government to borrow at record low interest rates to invest.  That is the right approach because if the Government does not do that it costs more.  </p> <p>  I will return to the amendments and what they seek to achieve.  Let us take Kilcarbery site in my constituency as an example, where the Minister and his Government colleagues had a very nice photo shoot recently.  As I understand it, the Minister has approved funding for an approved housing body to deliver cost rental units on that site.  The problem, however, is that that land was previously public land, but it was sold at full market value.  Unlike Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council got full market value for their lands.  The Kilcarbery site was sold at full market value and a developer built properties on it.  An approved housing body is now being funded by Government to buy that property, including the land that was originally sold.  The consequence of that rather bizarre way of funding affordable rental is that the rents will be &euro;1,200 per month, which is not that far off local rents in some parts of the suburbs.  Many of us campaigned for years to have hat site developed.  If Government had done what we are arguing for in our amendments to this Bill, that is, directly funded South Dublin County Council to deliver those homes, the rents in those units would be &euro;800 to &euro;850 per month.  That was confirmed to us in committee hearings with the Department of Finance and Dublin City Council last year.  In using joint ventures, land initiatives and commercial investment vehicles the Government is driving up development costs and, ultimately, affordable purchase and rental will be more expensive.  </p> <p>  I would also like to correct the record.  Nobody on this side of the Opposition is opposing any housing development.  What we do not accept is scarce public land being gifted, as is happening in Dublin city and Fingal, through bargain basement prices and sweetheart deals.  For example, 60% of the homes in Donabate will be sold for between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000 and the developers are being given ten years to roll out that site.  That hardly shows the urgency or affordability that the Minister claims.  The biggest objectors to actual housing in our city and county are Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in terms of their objections to between 8,000 and 11,000 homes in the Clondalkin-Clonburris SDZ and the delay of that project for a year through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That was actual votes against actual homes as opposed to voting, as we do, against sweetheart land deals for developers.  </p> <p>  I propose to press these amendments.  If we are to deliver large volumes of genuinely affordable homes to rent or buy for working people, we have to get rid of those joint ventures, land initiatives and commercial investment vehicles and do what we know works, from &Oacute; Cualann in Poppintree to Fingal County Council in Lusk, that is, direct delivery of good quality affordable homes for working people by not-for-profits, community co-operatives and our local authorities.  </p></speech>

While that is better than not having a ministerial safeguard, it is not a safeguard in terms of investment funds.  It is the case that the Minister has been a strong backer of several projects of housing being built on public lands where the sites have been sold on to private developers and where we know the housing will end up in the hands of investment funds.</p><p>The Minister has been a very strong backer of those projects.  I would not have very much reassurance there.  We need a strong legislative measure to prohibit the LDA selling public lands or homes built on public lands to investment funds.  Without that, given everything that has happened to date and given the Minister's very strong backing for projects where this is in effect what is in the pipeline, I would have serious concerns.  </p><p> The Government is certainly not the biggest builder.  It is a very large purchaser of housing.  The Vice Chairman has made the point previously that given amount of money being allocated to purchasing housing through different schemes, the State is not driving down prices and improving affordability as it should be.  That is a cost for the State but it is also a cost for wider society through increases in rents and the prices of homes.  That is what is at the heart of our concerns on this.  We have a model of selling public lands to large developers who already have large land banks in order that they can develop out housing schemes slowly over a ten-year period.  When we have a housing crisis now and need fast delivery of affordable homes now and not over a ten-year period, that is not something the Minister should be trumpeting.  I am concerned about the direction of the Land Development Agency under the provisions of this Bill.  </p></speech>

I wish to reiterate the points made by Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Boyd Barrett and Cian O'Callaghan.  With the policy under this Government and the previous Government, which the Minister's party supported, we have seen house prices increase, rents increase and the housing crisis get worse for people trying to get affordable accommodation either to purchase or rent.  These are the facts and there is no disputing that.  In Cork North-Central house prices are increasing each year and so are rents.  Bringing private developers in to develop public lands will only make matters worse.  These amendments propose that public land should be used for public houses.  These are scarce resources.  This land is badly needed to deliver homes for people who need them.</p> <p>  Along with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I attended a housing meeting last night in Cork at which Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke.  One lady described how she has rented a house for herself, her husband and her four children.  They were hoping to buy but they have been renting for 11 years.  Because the rents are so high, they have paid the private landlord more than &euro;100,000 and they are not one step closer to buying - in fact they are worse off now.  They have been given notice to quit and have five months to find a home.</p> <p>  This is all as a direct result of Government policies introduced by the past few Governments and which the Minister will now enshrine in this legislation.  For that lady, her husband and their children, and everyone else like them, we are asking the Minister to accept our amendments because we need to deliver public homes on public land.  That is what we are here to do.  Those are the fundamentals of where we are.  </p></speech>

That is why Government is introducing measures such as the Affordable Housing Bill, which I hope Deputies will support.  We will bring forward a national cost rental scheme under primary legislation for the first time that will bring for the first time in over a decade direct build, affordable purchase homes.  We are increasing the Part V provisions from 10% to 20% to encompass affordable housing.  We will bring forward our shared equity scheme, which will enable people to get on the housing ladder at an affordable rate.  I hope the Deputies will support those measures.  Deputy Gould at his public meetings with Deputy &Oacute; Broin needs to explain that they do not want the Land Development Agency to build any homes or plan to build any homes.  That is the position they have set out.  That is fine and they are entitled to that position.  I do not have to agree with it, but I respect that position.</p> <p>  I have explained very clearly that I cannot and should not accept these amendments because we need to deliver homes for our people in places such as Donabate and St. Kevin's in Cork with which Deputy Gould is very familiar.  When people look at all these sites across the country, they ask why they have not been developed yet.  This Bill will help develop out some of the sites of strategic importance throughout the country to deliver homes for people.  </p> <p>  We have had the recent example of some of the Opposition parties voting against 238 affordable homes, 238 social homes and 150 cost rental homes.  They have opposed real developments that we could get on and build.  </p> <p>  I reiterate that the Land Development Agency will be responsible for developing State-owned land in the main for the provision of social and affordable housing, cost rental housing and in some instances, in some areas of the country, private housing where that is required.  We spoke earlier about segregation and members not wanting to have segregated developments or communities.  Of course, we do not want that.  We want to have integrated communities.  </p> <p>  We fundamentally differ here.  The Government wants a Land Development Agency that will deliver homes.  Regardless of what is stated in these amendments, the Deputies have already made it clear from our hearings last week that they do not want a Land Development Agency that will build any homes.

In other words, we are in favour of affordably purchasable housing on public land as long as it always remains affordable and is never marketised.  Therefore, we are including a provision which would mean that if affordable housing is sold on by somebody who was eligible to purchase it in the first instance, he or she would have to sell it back to the local authority and would not profit from it.  In this way, the property would not become marketised or commodified.  We fully agree with people's aspiration and desire to have security regarding their home.  Given the associated security, it is entirely legitimate that people would decide at some point to move from renting a home to owning their own home.  The State should provide a stock of affordable housing but we do not believe that this housing should later become marketised.  The amendment is a very simple measure stipulating that if an affordable property is sold on at any point, it should be sold back to the local authority.  While reasonable inflation might be taken into account, nobody would make a profit from it.  It would not be difficult to come up with a formula to achieve that.</p><p>Amendment No. 219 implies that we need to define &quot;affordability&quot; having regard to people's income.  We are saying the amount should be 25% of somebody's income.  That is a reasonable amount that people would have to expend on either affordable rental or affordable purchase.  It should not be more than that.  The Government and others may argue that the proportion should be increased to one third but people are in some cases spending 50%, 60% or 70% of their after-tax income on rent or a mortgage.  Even with the affordability caps the Government is talking about, it is almost Orwellian to suggest one could still define as affordable a home whose worth is as much as &euro;450,000, or &euro;400,000 in other areas.  It is quite bizarre.  Setting that point aside, we want a reasonable proportion of people's income to dictate the definition of &quot;affordability&quot; with regard to State-provided affordable housing.  Those are the arguments in favour of our two amendments.</p></speech>

I fear, in respect of rents and prices just below the market value, that affordability would be defined based on small discounts on the full market price.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is entirely correct in stating many people are spending 50% or 60% of their income on rent, putting great pressure on their ability to afford other basics and necessities.  It is important, therefore, that our measure be worked into the legislation.</p></speech>

I will speak to Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendments first.</p> <p>  A really important principle is at play here.  One of the great weaknesses of the current affordable housing schemes, as they have been rolled out, obviously prior to the enactment of the affordable housing legislation and the introduction of this legislation, is that where homes are affordable - not all of them are, as we know from earlier discussions - they are affordable only to the first purchaser.  While there is a clawback built into the equity share that the local authority retains to ensure a purchaser cannot make a windfall profit from land he or she did not effectively purchase in the first instance, an affordable property is no longer affordable once sold.  Imagine if, instead of having such schemes, we strategically used public land to build up, over a decade, a stock of thousands of privately owned, permanently affordable, but tradeable, homes.  Whether they would be sold back to the local authority, as is the preference of Deputy Boyd Barrett, or sold directly to the next purchaser in need of an affordable home is a separate issue.  An almost secondary market would be built up.  There would be social and cost-rental homes at one end and private and in many cases unaffordable homes at the other, but there would be thousands of permanently affordable homes that people could buy or sell.  Who are these people?  Currently, they comprise 80% to 85% of the working population based on the eligibility criteria that most of us believe are necessary.  These could be altered.  The measure would ensure that, in perpetuity, we would always have homes that the category of people in question could purchase.</p><p>With respect to the proposition put forward by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, this is really important, so-----</p></speech>

There is a key difference between how some people have been talking about cost rental in the public arena to date and what cost rental actually is.  Cost rental is not a discounted market rent.  It is not based on purchasing a market price home and setting a rent to repay that.  It is based on a mixture of full cost recovery of the cost of delivering the unit, minus the developer's profit, with some relationship to ability to pay.  It is crucial that, without necessarily opening up a complex differential rent model, the initial rent setting for all cost rental must have some regard to ability to pay.  If you look at those cohorts of people above the threshold for social housing, for whom cost rental will be a key opportunity to have genuinely affordable accommodation, it cannot be above 30%.  In fact, for some income cohorts, unless the social housing thresholds are raised, it would need to be between 27% and 29% of net disposable income if we use definitions similar to those advocated by the ESRI etc.  These are fundamental amendments.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment addresses permanent affordability and Deputy O'Callaghan's addresses affordable rents.  They should be at the centre of any initiative that the Government takes on affordable housing, whether the Land Development Agency Bill or the Affordable Housing Bill.</p></speech>

The suite of housing Bills the Minister is bringing forward are intertwined, including the Land Development Agency Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill.  This suite is a market discount Bill, as our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, has said.  Linking affordability to income is vital.  It has been said in previous contributions.  It is not only about the thresholds for social housing lists, which have not been raised in more than ten years and need to be raised.  Deputy Gould said that bank clerks and people with regular jobs need to be included for social housing.  People with regular jobs traditionally would have been able to afford a house.  They are caught, unable to afford a house and outside the social housing net.  Both those thresholds need to be looked at.  It is all based on income and that is not being included adequately in the Affordable Housing Bill.  It bleeds in to how practical this Bill will be in a real way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1453" speakername="Thomas Gould" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#BB00600"><p>I support the contributions by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and other Deputies.  Affordability is at the heart of where we need to be, not a market discount.  A market discount means we are going by market prices, which are not a true reflection of affordability.  Affordability should be based on income.  Regarding what Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier, numerous people have contacted me who have been on the housing waiting list for as long as eight years.  I spoke to a lady last night who has been on the list with her husband for eight and a half years.  They got a pay increase and now they have gone off the social housing list.  How can it be right that a family waited eight and a half years and now they have gone off the social housing list?  They do not qualify or have enough income to get a mortgage.  They do not have the deposit for the mortgage and they are trapped in the middle.  That is why affordable housing has to be based on income and not on the market value, which is the core of what we are saying.</p> <p>  As Deputy Smith said, when two people had a job in the past, they could get a mortgage.  There is a situation now where even if two people are working full-time, they still cannot get a mortgage in many cases.  That is why we have to make it affordable.  We have to set the rates at between 25% and 30% of a person's income as a guide and not more than 30%, because some people are paying up to 50% or more.  That is not sustainable and it is not a life for people to have.</p></speech>

There were some technical issues on this side which have now been resolved.  I hope it did not inconvenience people too much.</p> <p>  I have listened intently to members' contributions on this grouping.  One area covered by it, as will be seen when it is discussed, and I know Sinn F&eacute;in will do so later on, is conditional affordable home ownership, where Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues in amendment No. 47 will effectively tell you to whom you can sell a home you own and restrictions in that regard.  I know Sinn F&eacute;in have published details in that space also.  I will oppose that amendment.</p> <p>  We all know that there is a major affordability issue.  We know that we want to address the issue as it applies to working people.  People have mentioned bank clerks, nurses and garda&iacute;.  We want to make sure affordability measures we bring forward in our Affordable Housing Bill work.  They will work.  That is why I intend to amend Part 9, including section 76, on Report Stage to align the provisions more closely with the provisions in the recently published Affordable Housing Bill, which is before the Seanad, and indeed Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  Members know I intend to bring forward a provision in it regarding affordability.  We will table that on Report Stage.  It is important this Bill is aligned with the Affordable Housing Bill.  We have both of these Bills before the Oireachtas and want to pass them by the summer recess, which shows the urgency the Government and I are addressing this with, to establish our affordable housing schemes which will be aligned with what we are doing here.</p><p>I will not accept the amendments and will bring further amendments to Part 9 of the Bill on Report Stage.</p></speech>

If the serviced sites fund grant is about &euro;50,000, the local authority owns about 12% to 15%.  That is the scheme and that is what is in front of us.  If the property is sold at a later time, that charge has to be repaid to the local authority.  It is the Government scheme where one does not have full home ownership.</p> <p>  The Minister is not dealing with the crucial point of Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment here, which is, why not make these homes permanently affordable?  Why not make sure every future buyer gets an affordable home?   The problem is at some point we will run out of land.  If we do not start building up a stock of privately owned, tradable and permanently affordable homes, at some point there will be a generation of bank clerks, retail workers or healthcare workers and there will be no affordable homes for them to purchase.  That is why the whole proposition is to build up a good stock of such homes.</p> <p>  I am happy on another occasion to explain the detail of Sinn F&eacute;in's affordable housing plan because it is clear the Minister still has not read the document.  If one buys a home under our plan, one owns it 100%.  However, we want those homes to be permanently affordable, not the &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000 homes that the Minister promises to deliver in large tracts of public land across the State.</p></speech>

That Bill does not define "affordability" in terms of income and ability to pay.  Instead, it re-envisages affordable housing as a percentage discount off a full market price for a home or rent.  The fundamental issue is we have to have housing available that is affordable, not something that is called "affordable" and is a slight discount on the full market rate.  That is the issue I seek to address.</p></speech>

Why on earth would the Minister not want to support that?  I accept Deputy &Oacute; Broin's addition.  My amendment proposes that, if sold, it could only be sold back to the local authority.  I accept we could amend that if the principle was established that it could be traded with other people, but as affordable housing.  There would then be a stock of housing that remains permanently affordable.  The Minister has not given an answer as to why he has a difficulty with that.</p> <p>  If he does not do that, then after the first generation of purchasers of affordable housing, the housing on public land will have been turned into unaffordable housing.  As soon as market prices kick in after the first purchase, those houses will revert in my area to &euro;450,00 or &euro;500,000, having been built at the affordable level.  There is no way to describe the consequence of not accepting this amendment other than marketising public land.  Ultimately, we are fuelling the conditions that have given rise to this crisis.</p> <p>  The Minister keeps making references to the Affordable Housing Bill but, as we will discuss in the following grouping, the Bill is littered with references to the market being taken into account and being the reference point for the setting of affordability, rather than being based on people's income.</p> <p>  Neither did the Minister come back on the point I made and Deputy Duncan Smith echoed.  Why has the Government not raised the income threshold for more than a decade?  Most of the responsibility for that lies with Fine Gael but the Minister is conspicuous in his refusal to answer that question.  I think the secret answer that the Minister will not give is that, slowly but surely, the agenda driven by somebody - I am not sure who but I suspect elements in the permanent government - is to turn social housing into housing that will effectively only be available to people on social welfare.  That is why we have not moved the thresholds upwards so, year on year, working people who used to be able to apply for social housing for no longer able to do so.  Slowly but surely, working people are being excluded from eligibility for social housing.  One has to be on the lowest of incomes, barely above social welfare rates currently, to qualify.</p> <p>  If the Minister wants to do something about avoiding segregation in housing, he should address that problem.  The way to segregate housing is to make only people on the lowest incomes eligible.  Here is a radical idea:  why could anybody at all not be allowed to apply for social housing?</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett made another startling admission that he would open up social housing to everyone regardless of income.  We have to live in the real world about delivering homes for people who badly need them.  There are many people on the social housing list we need to address.  The LDA in this legislation will help to supplement what local authorities will deliver.  It will not be instead of but in addition to, as I have said before.</p> <p>  I addressed Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment.  He is putting forward conditions on home ownership, effectively.  That is my view; he is entitled to his, and I respect it.  He would be creating another level of social housing.  I have been clear that I believe in home ownership and in public housing.  Home ownership is a just and honest aspiration for people to have.  I do not support some of the conditionality some seek to put on home ownership.</p> <p>  I am well aware of how the serviced sites fund works.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's scheme is a different one.  Of course, people have to pay.  Should the State take an equity under the serviced sites fund, they will have to pay that back.  The Deputy's proposals would put a condition on the house in its totality as to what happens with it, who it goes to or who it is sold to.  I do not believe those provisions are workable.  In the area of affordability, I repeat that Parts 2 and 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill detail what the cost-rental provisions and affordable purchase provisions are.</p><p>I will be aligning this Bill with the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is important that is done.  On Report Stage, I will bring forward amendments to Part 9.  It is open to anyone to look at Parts 2 and 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill.  As I have said before in the D&aacute;il, I will be bringing in regulations alongside which set out the eligibility criteria.  The reason for regulations is that they give more flexibility in the future to make changes, particularly when the scheme is new around eligibility.  I want as many people as possible to be able to access affordable housing.  That is what we all want.</p><p> Those are the reasons I am opposing amendments Nos. 47, 219 and 220.</p></speech>

It aims to define cost rental for dwellings by taking the value of the land out of the equation.  The value of land is the fundamental issue as to why house prices are the way they are.  It feeds into the cost of everything related to that.</p><p>That is where this amendment is coming from.  We feel that if the Land Development Agency Bill is to work it will require amendments such as this.  This amendment will ensure that, when proposals are brought by the Land Development Agency, the public, local people and local councillors can be confident that they will not be faced with decisions that they have to trade off when it comes to profiteering.  We feel that this is a way of doing that.  Will the Minister strongly consider this amendment?</p></speech>

For anybody who can go through the tedium of watching 225 amendments, or whatever the number is, being dealt with by an Oireachtas committee, I recommend they look at page 48 of the Bill as initiated.  Under section 76, Price under agreement, the Bill sets out two provisions that show the fundamental flaws in the Government's approach in trying to address the housing crisis through the use of the public land bank.  It links the price it will charge for either affordable purchase housing or for rental property that will be built on public lands to the local market specifically.</p><p>Section 76(2) states: &quot;the Minister may prescribe the price, or a method of calculating the price...and may prescribe different prices and different methods in respect of agreements relating to different geographical or administrative areas&quot;.  Section 76(3) states:</p> <blockquote> 	  	For the purposes of prescribing a price or a method of calculating the price in relation to an area...the Minister shall have regard to the likely future demand for cost rental dwellings and dwellings for sale in the State...<br /><br />(a) the prevailing market price and market rent;  </blockquote> <p>Why would one have that in the Bill?  If the Bill's purpose is to provide housing to people who are currently priced out of the market, either the affordable purchase market or the rental market, why on earth would one link the price that the Minister could set to local market conditions?  It totally defeats the purpose.  It guarantees that, in the areas which are at the epicentre of the housing crisis, the very reasons for the crisis will be woven into the structure of the Land Development Agency instead of undermining the dysfunctionality of the market.  It is not setting prices according to the actual affordability criteria for those income groups, now the majority of working people, who are excluded by market prices or market rents.</p><p>Why are these sections in the Bill?  They are there because the private developers and so on who have lobbied the Government around all these matters would be horrified at the idea that, in an area where they are selling property from &euro;450,000 to &euro;550,000, or renting property out at between &euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000 a month, the State might, on any sort of substantial scale, build properties that cost &euro;200,000 or could be rented for &euro;800 or &euro;1,000.  These measures have been inserted essentially in order to protect the property developers.</p><p>There is no rationale behind these measures.  If the Land Development Agency was actually to develop public and affordable housing on public land, one would have no references to the market or different prices being set dependent on the area in which they were located.</p><p>If the Minister can prove I am wrong on this, I would be happy to listen to his argument, but I doubt he can do so.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I will be supporting his amendment and I hope it passes.  These references should be taken out.  If his amendment does not pass, the one I am proposing should be considered.  It says that, in terms of setting a price, the Minister shall have regard to income, ability to pay and affordability.  It is quite incredible that income, ability to pay and affordability are not among the criteria set down for the Minister to have regard to when setting a price.  At an absolute minimum, the Minister should accept my amendment.  However, Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment is a good one and I will be supporting it.</p></speech>

I am looking for the affordable land value mechanism to be enshrined in the legislation.  We all need to have confidence that affordable homes built on public land will be made as affordable as possible.  That means having an affordable land value so that the prices reflect the fact these houses are on land which is effectively discounted because it is zoned such that it, or a certain percentage of it, can be used only for social or affordable housing from an affordability perspective.  That is important.  Otherwise, we are not being clear to the public, not necessarily from a legislative perspective but from a communications perspective, to make sure people understand there is an affordable land value which is taken into account and which is how homes will end up being affordable at the end of this.</p></speech>

I am repeating the point Deputy Higgins has made.  There have been many characterisations of this legislation.  In essence, it is a mechanism to take the commercial value and apply a charge to the land, which will mean it will deliver both social and affordable housing.  Doing so reduces the value of the land cost, so when housing is built, the land value has been eliminated from it.  While there have been many characterisations of what this Bill does, that is the reality of what it does.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Higgins, I am hoping to reflect that term "affordable land value".  I have no problem with the commercial value being named, because we should name the starting point of that process of devaluation, but I would like to see the affordable land value reflected in there as well.</p></speech>

To row it back a little bit, people will recall this Bill was published before the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is why I intend to bring forward amendments on Report Stage, especially to Part 9, including section 76, which will align the Land Development Agency, the affordability piece and the definitions with the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is important that is done to provide the additional clarity around this.  We will do so by way of amendments.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins and Deputy McAuliffe are correct.  You will have a heavily discounted land value based on the affordable land value and the proportion of a site which is designated affordable or cost rental.  I agree with Deputies that there is more work to be done in this space.  When this Bill was published, we did not have the full definitions of how our Affordable Housing Bill would work.  That Bill is currently in the Seanad.  The job we need to do on Report Stage is to marry the two and that is what we will do.</p> <p>  Section 76 and Part 9 will be fully aligned with the cost rental, which is under Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill, and with the affordable purchase.  That will become clearer for Deputies as we get to Report Stage.  I cannot accept the amendments before us at this stage, but we will be working through this on Report Stage and aligning it with our Affordable Housing Bill.  There is nothing sinister in this.  It is to make sure both Bills are complementary.</p></speech>

That is a good start.  However, he cannot tell us what it will be replaced with, only that it will be broadly aligned with the Affordable Housing Bill.  I would like the Minister to tell us as much as he can about that because it is not satisfactory we are now on Committee Stage of this Bill and we do not know what the Government will do on Report Stage.  We have not seen the Report Stage amendments the Government will make on this critical point of whether the LDA is capable of delivering affordable housing on public land.</p> <p>  The Government appears to be acknowledging the point of my amendment, which is to say there should not be any relationship between how you price affordablility and local market conditions.  Is the Minister accepting this is correct, that local market conditions should not be criteria for setting the price of affordable housing or affordable rental?  That would be an important step forward by the Government.  I am happy to admit when the Government puts its hands up and says it was wrong and will change things.  Is the Minister saying we are right that the benchmark against prices and rents at the local market level is not an acceptable way of defining affordability?  If that is in any way a criterion, I put it to the Minister that he essentially will have undermined the attempt to deal with the housing crisis and the affordability crisis in the areas where these crises are most acute and where the response is most badly needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#FF00800"><p>I support Deputy Smith's amendment.  I will not repeat the points other than to say we have to have a definition of affordability, particularly affordable rental, which is linked to people's income and ability to pay.  I will support any amendment which attempts to do that.  I also support Deputy Higgins' amendment in principle because there has been confusion in the public arena around much of the debate on land values.</p> <p>  There should be no reference to market value anywhere in this legislation, because market value is the open market value of land when it is sold on the open market and is determined by the zoning of that land.  The vast majority of land we are talking about has an existing use value.  The existing use value should be the guide.</p> <p>  The problem is, when you change the use of the land, the valuation changes.  Shanganagh Castle is an illustrative example.  That land had an existing use value of approximately &euro;9 million.  That is how much D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council paid the Department of Justice for the purchase of that land.</p><p>Its existing use was the value of that land, which sat on the balance sheet of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  When one decides to develop that land with a mixture of social, affordable rental and affordable sale the land values change.  Social continues to have existing use value and that does not change.  The market value if one uses the terminology in the Minister's Bill of the cost rental is now determined by the lifetime yields that can be gained from ownership of those cost-rental units and that is a separate valuation.  Likewise, the market value of the land on which the affordable purchase is not determined by the purchase price of the home today but the imputed future value of the sale price of the home, including the market value of the land because, of course, under the Minister's scheme one can sell those properties into the private market at a future point in time.  The idea that what is proposed in this Bill will give one a zero or existing use value for any lands, from public bodies transferred to the LDA, is simply not the case.</p><p> The Dundrum central sites are also very important.  Let us imagine a portion of the Dundrum central sites is unaffordable open market price.  We do not know what the designation will be but let us give the Minster the benefit of the doubt and let us say he restricts it right down to 10% or 20%.  In the market value of that land would be three separate calculations: the proportion of land that is social, which is the existing use value; the portion that is affordable rental for sale, the imputed yields or future value of the sale of the property; and then there is the open market value, which would be the full market price.  That is the way this is going to be calculated.  The suggestion that I have heard from some Government backbenchers, not on this committee but in my conversations with them, that they have been told not to worry and that the provision is just a way of getting around EU state aid rules and to avoid a legal challenge from some private developer who wants to buy one of these pieces of land but fears that the LDA is getting illegal state aid is, I think, a risky road to go down.  We should only be talking about existing use value or the book value of the land, whichever is the lowest because no one should profit from land that is currently unused and sitting with the HSE, the Office of Public Works or Irish Rail and transferred to any public entity whose job is to deliver social and affordable homes.  I say that because any increase in the value of the land, and it is transferable, increases development costs and the prices of those homes to rent or buy.</p><p> I would not have drafted the amendment as Deputy Higgins has done but her point is an important one.  We need to make sure that if land is to be transferred then it must done at the lowest possible price and that is the existing use value or the book value of the land, whichever is lower.</p></speech>

We are going to align the parts that relate to definitions so cost rental and affordable purchase will be aligned exactly with the Affordable Housing Bill that is in the Seanad at the moment.</p> <p>  Let us consider cost rental for argument's sake.  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill, which is where it should be because the main piece of legislation is the Affordable Housing Bill in terms of the provision of affordable homes be they for rent or purchase.  That Bill sets out in great detail the details of the estimated total cost that was referred to and the definitions for cost rental itself.</p> <p> The criteria around eligibility will be published by way of regulation.  I expect that members will agree that that makes absolute sense because should levels change within eligibility then one needs that flexibility to be able to change them but they will be published alongside it too.</p> <p>  There is no admission of any issues here whatsoever.  It is very simply that the Land Development Agency Bill was published in advance of the Affordable Housing Bill.  Both Bills are now moving through the Houses.  We want to align one with the other and that is exactly what we are going to do by way of the Affordable Housing Bill itself.  We will also make sure that the LDA uses the definitions of the Affordable Housing Bill for both affordable purchase and affordable rental.</p> <p> To get to the point made about affordable value and a discounted land value, it will be the case that they will be heavily discounted on the market value based on the proportion of affordable and social homes on the State agency's site.  That is a fact and is what will happen.  That is the whole purpose of being able to drive affordability and use our lands to deliver social homes.  This will help in the provision of those affordable purchase units, in particular.</p> <p>  Some of these amendments may be more appropriate to the Affordable Housing Bill.  They are certainly not appropriate to this Bill.  I will bring forward further amendments to Part 9 of this Bill, including section 76, which we have talked about here, on Report Stage so that there is that exact alignment between both pieces of legislation. </p></speech>

The intent of my amendment is to highlight the potential hazards of the LDA Bill as it is written.  I refer to the potential for its impact on public lands under the definition of &quot;relevant public land&quot;.</p><p>My amendment seeks to insert into the Bill and highlight, in terms of the setting up of the LDA, that lands belonging to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, nature reserves, heritage sites and, indeed, the Phoenix Park, which is one of the most well known sites, protections that are required to ensure that the LDA does not mutate in ways that are unforeseen by anyone.  I accept the Minister's bona fides on this.  He does not expect the LDA to go this way but I believe that we should back that up and put it in the Bill.</p></speech>

One of the things that has caused confusion across many areas is that the LDA  has a geomapping facility on its website that identifies land but the way in which this is presented gives the impression that lands which have a certain colour coding may be lands of interest to the LDA.  As the Minister will know, because he knows the map as well as I do, lots of those lands are not even zoned for residential use.  They are greenfield sites or green sites inside other sites.  It is not that I think the LDA has its sights on these lands, but I would like a clarification on the matter in the context of the Minister's response to Deputy Duncan Smith's question.  The LDA's website, including that mapping function, needs to be changed in order that only lands that are clearly zoned for residential use would even appear on it.  That would clear up a lot of the confusion.  I say this just by way of being helpful.</p></speech>

I think everyone knows there is no intention that any lands such as the Phoenix Park would be used by the LDA, nor will that ever happen.  The Bill deals with relevant public lands, which are lands in the ownership of public bodies in population areas of more than 10,000.  Section 3 of the Phoenix Park Act 1925 confirms that the park is for the general purpose of recreation and enjoyment by the public.  The majority of parks and heritage sites will be outside the scope of the definition in this amendment.  Where such sites are in more urban areas, however, they are included on the register of relevant public lands.  That is all.  I take Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about the website, but that is a prototype.  It may have led to some confusion, which we have flagged.  Senator Moynihan raised this a number of weeks ago.  There is absolutely no question that any of our public parks, including the Phoenix Park, would be taken over by the LDA.  Let us look at all the checks and balances in the Bill.  It is important to note that the inclusion of land as a relevant public land on the register does not mean it is to be used for housing.</p> <p>  As for the aim of the register, and going back to our disagreements at the start as to whether or not the LDA should build homes, everyone has said the agency should have a register of public land.  One would have thought we should have had that quite some time ago.</p> <p>  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  Too much focus has been given to this alleged issue over recent weeks.  I genuinely think most people understood completely that this is something that would never happen.  The register of public lands is important.  I do, however, take the point about the website.  That is being worked on.  However, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The key issue is that there are many sections of this Bill which give the Minister significant powers to introduce regulations governing the operation of the LDA, land transfers and acquisitions and other matters.  As the Minister well knows, when, for example, there is a proposed change to planning regulations, there is a very straightforward procedure whereby the Minister consults the relevant Oireachtas committee and then a motion is laid before the D&aacute;il to approve or not approve said regulations.  I fully understand that regulations are primarily a function of the Minister and the Government, but the Minister was before the committee recently to consult on changes to planning regulations in the context of Covid-19, which he discussed and which we strongly welcomed, and that level of transparency and accountability is very important.  These four amendments are in the spirit of greater accountability, transparency and respect for the functions of the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister will be able to support them or to give an undertaking that he will examine them to see if it is possible to bring forward amendments of his own on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In the previous Oireachtas, we went through very detailed pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the previous LDA Bill.  We have made sure in this Bill that there is full oversight on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as oversight from and a report to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and FOI provisions, and rightly so.  This is significant change, the latter provisions in particular, from the first iteration of the Bill.  I imagine that any Minister will consult committees, but what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is seeking here is that every time a Minister made a regulation that relates to the LDA or a direction to the LDA, he or she would have to consult the Oireachtas committee on every single one of them.  It is a standard provision that a Minister may make regulations or issue directions as and when required without prior consultation with the committee.  Regulations and ministerial directions will be made in accordance with the Bill and will be enacted following the approval of the Oireachtas.  However, it is normal practice as part of the governance of State agencies - I am not just talking about the LDA - that a Minister may issue a direction to an agency.</p> <p>  I know where Deputy &Oacute; Broin is coming from, but to propose that an agency and, in addition, in this specific instance, any future Minister would have to consult before giving a direction or issuing a regulation for the agency would, I think, result in a very heavy burden being placed on the Minister in making decisions relating to the agency and would slow down the process.  Having said that, these directions generally relate to the implementation of government policy, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin will know, and the LDA will absolutely be required to comply with any direction issued to it under this section.  As I said, the LDA and the Minister will work with the Oireachtas committee in the normal course of events, but having to consult the Oireachtas committee before issuing any direction or regulation is not something that is done with other State agencies, so I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

I apologise.  I was confusing two groups of amendments.</p> <p>  This is a good example of the Minister going native.  It is always very unfortunate when Deputies in opposition argue for the maximum level of Oireachtas oversight and committee participation and then quickly forget those arguments when they go to the Custom House.</p><p>Given the significance of this agency and the size of the land banks the Government claims it will have transferred to the agency and the enormous role the latter will have when given development authority status, as well as being able to develop strategic development master plans and directly develop, then we must have the maximum level of scrutiny.  If we had this level of scrutiny over the National Asset Management Agency, which was the last time a Government created an agency of this size, we may not have had some of the problems or scandals that Government Members rightly highlighted and were concerned about when they were in opposition.  If the Minister were willing to work on this and come back with some better scheme to ensure regulations of a certain significance or land transfers or project developments of a certain size could be covered by Oireachtas scrutiny, I would be happy to withdraw these amendments.</p></speech>

I have been very clear.  Why would this agency be treated differently from any other?  We have taken on board many of the concerns raised during pre-legislative scrutiny in the previous Oireachtas.  It should not be forgotten that annual reports and regulations will be laid before the Oireachtas.  The Minister has recourse to the Oireachtas committees.  There is also the Comptroller and Auditor General and the freedom of information legislation.  These provisions would only add a further burden of decision-making for an agency which we must ensure gets up and running to deliver homes for our people.  I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

They are a response to concerns raised on Second Stage about subsidiary designated activity companies, DACs.</p><p>The amendments provide for the inclusion of "or a subsidiary DAC" in a number of sections.  I am introducing the amendments to provide clarity and absolute certainty and to remove any lingering doubt whatsoever that the provisions of the Bill that apply to the LDA will also apply to any of its subsidiary DACs.  That was raised on the Second Stage debate.  It was always the intention of this legislation when it was being drafted that references to the LDA would also refer to a subsidiary DAC, but for the avoidance of doubt, in the interests of trying to be helpful and to provide clarity, I am moving these amendments today.  There has been some misleading commentary on the establishment of the LDA and its subsidiaries as designated activity companies under the Companies Act, as if to imply that this is in some way irregular.  I take the opportunity to clarify again that it is standard practice to establish newly created State companies as DACs.</p><p> I will now highlight the sections that are being amended so people are clear.  Section 7 relates to directions of the Minister.  The making of directions by the Minister to the agency in the performance of its functions will also apply to subsidiary DACs.  Section 21 relates to membership of either House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or local government.  The provisions regarding board members and staff ceasing or being seconded from their roles if they become a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or a member of a local authority will also apply to board members and staff of subsidiary DACs.</p><p> Amendment No. 134 deletes section 32(2)(a) and replaces it with a new provision in relation to the establishment of subsidiary DACs that provides that the LDA must obtain prior ministerial consent for the provisions in the constitutions of such subsidiaries that relate to the ownership and control of it.  It was always the intent of this section that the LDA would need ministerial consent, but I want to clarify that ministerial approval is required in relation to the establishment of DACs as well as the ownership and control of them.  In effect, the LDA will need to seek consent before it establishes any subsidiaries and clarify the ownership of them.  It has always been intended that the LDA would establish subsidiary DACs, as this is in line with similar provisions for other commercial State bodies.  There is nothing sinister in this, it is standard practice.  A range of controls is in place in this legislation and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies in relation to the oversight of the LDA and its subsidiaries.  In addition, NewERA will continue to provide advice to my Department on the oversight of the agency.  Again, this is in line with provisions for other commercial State bodies.</p><p> Amendment No. 184 deletes section 55 and replaces it with more detailed provisions regarding the disposal of land by the LDA or a subsidiary DAC.  First, it clarifies that a subsidiary DAC, in line with the LDA, must seek ministerial consent to dispose of land, but that this consent is not required where it is disposing of a single house for rent or purchase.  We discussed the issue to some extent earlier.  This had always been the intent of the section but it is important to clarify it.</p><p> Second, I am bringing an amendment to provide that the LDA or a subsidiary DAC must seek ministerial approval where more than one house is being sold as part of linked transactions.  In other words, it will not be able to dispose of more than one house to a single purchaser without seeking ministerial approval.  Of course, there will be occasions where it would be appropriate for the LDA or a subsidiary DAC to sell more than one unit to a single purchaser such as a local authority or an affordable housing body.  Again, we discussed this earlier.</p><p> Amendment No. 194 inserts a new provision in section 59 to provide that in relation to compulsory purchase, land owned by the agency includes land owned by a subsidiary DAC.  This again is for clarity, if needed, and the avoidance of doubt, and does not change the intent of this section in any way, shape or form.  It ensures that the LDA may acquire land compulsorily where it is required to provide access to relevant public land and land owned by the LDA or a subsidiary DAC or is required to facilitate the provision of infrastructure on relevant public land or land owned by the LDA or a subsidiary DAC.</p><p> Amendment No. 231 is a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment so I will not speak to that one.  The other amendments in this group are Nos. 228, 229 and 230, which amend section 78 to clarify that freedom of information will apply to subsidiary DACs.  This is a point I made very strongly when in opposition with regard to the need for the agency to be subject to FOI, which it is.  I am making sure, for the avoidance of any doubt, that subsidiary DACs are also included.  Section 78 of the LDA Bill provides that the Freedom of Information Act 2014 will fully apply to the LDA from establishment day and also provides that records held by the dissolved LDA body will continue to be subject to FOI.  That is important as it is will ensure transparency in the agency's operations.  These amendments amend this section to provide that they will apply to subsidiaries of the LDA, which will be subject to FOI with effect from establishment day.  That has always been my intention.  I said that previously and I do not want to repeat it, but this is a belt and braces to ensure that people are really clear and refrain from making remarks to the contrary in future now that they are fully tied in.</p><p> The effective date for FOI for both the LDA and its subsidiaries will be 13 March 2019.  This is the effective date, when the existing interim LDA entity's records became subject to FOI, and by applying this effective date to both the commercial LDA and its subsidiaries it will ensure that all LDA functions and operations will be subject to FOI.  That is important for the sake of transparency.  I want to make it clear that the LDA will be fully accountable to FOI and will come fully under the remit of FOI from establishment day and the normal provision whereby a new State body is not accountable under FOI for a period of six months from the date it is established will not apply to the LDA or any of its subsidiaries.  It is important that the LDA is fully transparent in its operations and the amendments to this section will further clarify that.  The management of the LDA is also fully committed to this principle.  I acknowledge that Deputies have introduced amendments on this issue and I hope they will accept these amendments to clarify that the LDA and its subsidiaries will be fully accountable under FOI, as this is in the interests of all involved.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#LL00300"><p>I will speak to the full group if that is okay.  I warmly welcome all of these amendments.  From the very outset I had a genuine concern about the extent to which FOI, but also other provisions of this Bill, fully applied to the subsidiary designated activity companies.  As some Members will be aware, the original design of the LDA Bill under the previous Government separated its commercial and non-commercial activities.  Its non-commercial activities were to be subject to FOI and the commercial activities were to be excluded.  When I got the draft of this Bill, I wrote to the Information Commissioner asking in particular for his expert opinion on the extent to which the FOI legislation would apply to subsidiary DACs in the pre-amendment section 78.  He confirmed in writing that because there was not a date of establishment for the subsidiary DACs, there would be a window - the Minister referred to the exact same six-month period - where they would not be covered.  In the first instance, I am more than happy to withdraw my amendment No. 231 because the Minister's three amendments before that adequately deal with it much more eloquently than I would have done and his previous amendments also capture a series of other loopholes.</p><p> This is very important.  While it is welcome, there is a big difference between the extent of transparency from a commercially established designated activity company, albeit one that is publicly owned, and a State agency that is non-commercial.  For example, I can submit a parliamentary question or a question to a local authority manager on the full costings of live social and affordable housing projects, full costings on land transfers and full costings on the details of residential development and they are obliged under law or practice to provide those.  Unfortunately, a designated activity company or a subsidiary DAC does not have the same obligation.  The minutes of the LDA have been put on the website and I welcome the fact that the agency put them on the website but they are largely redacted.  It is important that members fully understand this.  I genuine welcome the Minister's move on this but it does not mean there will be the level of transparency in the operations of the LDA, the principal DAC or subsidiary DACs.</p><p> There will be members of this committee - some of them may be in government today, but they could be in opposition in future - who will want by right access to information about public land and public money.  We will not get it.  The best example is if we look at public private partnerships.  All the financial details around the first and second tranche of PPP social housing is withheld from elected members on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.  That would be the case with the LDA and with LDA subsidiary DAC activities.  Elected members in local authorities and Members of this House will at times be asked whether to support large residential developments without having any visibility of public finance.</p><p> This is good news but it is not the same level of transparency or accountability that we would have from a non-commercial state agency.  It is important that members understand that.  That is the consequence of a commercial DAC and it is one major limitation in the way in which this project is being structured.  Anyway, I fully support the Minister's amendments and I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 231.</p></speech>

I will underline it.  Even if subsidiary DACs are subject to freedom of information law, the commercial sensitivity issues kick in as soon as we involve private commercial interests.  In negotiations between State bodies and local authorities and publicly owned agencies or entities and any form of private commercial interest, those commercial sensitivity issues come in to play.  As a result, we do not actually get to see the financial detail.  I have been through this saga.  I will cite as an instance in this regard the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  We successfully campaigned to get the company dissolved and reintegrated into the council.  For the years it was in operation, however, we could not find out anything about what it was doing.  Notionally, permission had to be sought from the Minister for Transport but in actuality the board of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company decided everything and got everything rubber-stamped from the relevant Ministers.  The truth is that the local councillors or Deputies could not get any information.  Commercial sensitivity was wheeled out for everything.  We were told we could not be given certain information because it was commercially sensitive.  That is what will happen here.  It is one of the key flaws and follies of the whole enterprise as conceived by the Government.  Once we bring in arrangements with private business through these DAC structures, commercial sensitivity issues will kick in.</p> <p>  The Minister may claim some credit on amendment No. 184 for requiring ministerial approval for the disposal of land by the DACs but it does not take away from the fact that the cardinal problem is that the DACs will be able to dispose of public land.  There are some safeguards but to my mind the safeguards against that are not adequate to protect against the slippery slope or the fact that in reality the driver will be the LDA and not the Minister.  Councillors will be last to know.  It will be the LDA driving things and getting them rubber-stamped by Ministers.  That is my experience of these bodies.  To be honest, I do not believe that as time goes on anything will be different with the LDA and these DACs.</p></speech>

They expressed significant concerns about large parts of this legislation.  While they were not opposed to the principle of a land development agency engaged in land management and residential development they were genuinely concerned that it would see a sidelining of the role of local authorities.  The fear was that the important work of our local councillors representing local communities would not be taken into account to the same extent as it would be currently with the likes of city and county development plans, strategic development zones, local area plans and Part 8 planning applications, not to mention the thorny issue of section 183 land transfers, which councillors come up against.</p><p>The AILG submitted a significant number of amendments and I was more than happy to table them.  These are the first two.  Amendment No. 57 specifically has a requirement that a direction from the Minister will be published in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il</i>and at least one nationwide newspaper as well as on the websites of the Minister and the LDA.  This is important.  This is the argument of the AILG not of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The AILG makes it clear that this is to ensure transparency.  The fear of the AILG representatives is that with the section as currently worded local authorities would not have visibility of a ministerial directive relative to the LDA.  That could have significant implications for the local authority, elected members and the wider community in terms of housing and planning operations.</p><p>I will set out the position with respect to amendment No. 58 as someone who argued strongly against the strategic housing development legislation in 2016 when others abstained and allowed it to go through.  One of the reasons we are seeing an increasing number of large residential housing developments being challenged in the courts is because they are over-riding the city and county development plans.  They are actively excluding not only elected members but, crucially, local communities from constructively participating in good planning practices.  Amendment No. 58 explicitly requires the Minister to ensure that any directive should have regard to city and county development plans, local area plans and other statutory plans made by the local authority.  Given that we now have the Office of the Planning Regulator to ensure consistency in the new round of city and county development plans with Government planning policy, I can see no reason why the Minister would not accept these two reasonable amendments.  Again, I emphasise they are not Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  They are cross-party and no-party amendments tabled by AILG.  I hope the Minister will accept both and I will be interested to hear his response.</p></speech>

I am not accepting the amendment as ministerial directions will always have due regard to the planning code.  They have to.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, will seek planning permission for its proposed developments through the appropriate procedures under the Planning and Development Acts in the same manner as any other developer.  In making decisions in respect of proposed LDA developments, the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to make its determinations in accordance with the provisions of the relevant development plans, local area plans and strategic development zones that are in force and to which the development site is subject.  A number of LDA developments have already been brought through the planning system.  Members will know the development at Shanganagh Castle very well.  Another such development, mentioned in Deputy Gould's observations, is that at the St. Kevin's Hospital site in Cork city.  All planning authorities provide access to pre-application consultations.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised the issue of strategic housing developments, SHDs.  I have been very clear that that the legislation underpinning SHDs is going to expire and I will not be extending it.  I would not conflate the LDA with the SHD process.  The Deputy is trying to muddy the water in this space.  I will not be accepting these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-01a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060100002#NN00800"><p>I again stress that these amendments were carefully considered by the largest representative organisation for local government councillors in the State, an organisation whose members include councillors from all of our parties.  Given that this legislation will have such a profound impact on the role of our local authorities, which may be for the better or for the worse depending on one's point of view, I would hope that it will get more consideration.</p> <p>  To return to my point on the SHDs, the Minister is right that he has given the commitment he has mentioned.  It would, of course, have been much better if he or his party had listened to the Opposition back in 2016 when his party colleague, Deputy Cowen, was their housing spokesperson and if they had then opposed the SHD legislation.  The Irish Planning Institute, a range of local authority sectors and we in the Opposition fully understood where it would go and we were proved correct.  My point is a different one.  The SHD legislation created a planning mechanism whereby city and county development plans, local area plans and other plans could be overridden.  That has caused considerable difficulty.  That is why, for example, local authorities are taking An Bord Plean&aacute;la to court for breaches of those plans.  That is why, in this instance, this is really necessary.  </p> <p>  I do not believe it is the Minister's intention to use the LDA in the way in which his predecessor used the SHD process.  I want to put that on the record.  However, unless we have a belt and braces approach, to use the phrase the Minister himself used with regard to the last group of amendments, to ensure that the decisions on which elected members democratically agree after substantial public consultation with regard to city county development plans, local area plans and, crucially, strategic development zones, a particularly contentious issue with regard to Dublin's docklands, are fully respected, a local authority could, in the future, potentially find itself at legal loggerheads with the LDA and the board over, for example, a strategic development zone that conflicts with a county development plan or local area plan.  That would not be a healthy place for any of us to be.  It would delay residential development and would delay and undermine good quality place making and planning.  On that basis, I again urge the Minister and members of the committee to support these two amendments.</p></speech>

In no way, shape or form do we want to allow the LDA to circumvent the planning process.  Its applications will go through the normal planning process.  If there is something additional I can do to include something of the purpose of amendment No. 58 in an appropriate place on Report Stage, I will do so.  I will come back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin in respect of amendment No. 58 but I cannot accept No. 57.  It refers to "The content of any such direction" but it may not be appropriate to publish some directions, at least in full.  Regulations are obviously published. Other State agencies do not publish the content of ministerial directions.  I have carefully considered the amendments.  I will look at No. 58 again and revert to the Deputy but I cannot accept either amendment at this stage.</p></speech>

With regard to No. 57, will the Minister outline the type of directions with regard to the LDA, public land and taxpayers' money he believes should not be in the public domain?  I am open to being convinced but I cannot see why such directions would not be a matter of public record, given everything the Minister said about wanting the maximum level of transparency when we were discussing the last amendments.</p></speech>

The amendment refers to any direction at all.  It is a blanket provision for any ministerial direction.  There may be commercially sensitive issues discussed in such directions or it may be necessary not to publish them to protect the State's interests.  We are not in a position to accept amendment No. 57 at this stage.  As I have said, I will look again at No. 58.  Of course, the Deputy will reserve the right to reintroduce it if he is not happy with what we come back with.  That is absolutely fine.  I cannot, however, accept No. 57.</p></speech>
