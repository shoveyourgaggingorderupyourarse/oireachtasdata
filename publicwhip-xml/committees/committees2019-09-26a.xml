He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  </p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.  We will hold the minutes over until next week.</p> <p>  I wish to raise an item arising from last week's meeting, the seeking of additional information.  We have discussed it, but we will consider the formal minutes next week.  At last week's meeting there was quite a discussion about the correspondence which had been received from the HSE, item No. 2334.  We discussed the breakdown of consultancy costs for the children's hospital group.  Expenditure under the heading of ICT-digital was &euro;3.6 million; expenditure under the heading of clinical operational support was &euro;3.5 million; expenditure on medical equipment was &euro;1.8 million; expenditure on corporate services was &euro;1.6 million; while expenditure under the heading of programme management was &euro;421,000, giving an approximate figure of &euro;11 million.  We said we would seek additional information, but I want us to be more specific about what we are seeking.  I want to write back to the HSE telling it that we want a description of each consultancy project and information on when it started, how much has been expended to date and the estimated total cost of each project.  We saw the payments for consultancy arrangements for one year.  Is it just part of a bigger picture?  We want to have a full picture of each item included in the figure of &euro;11 million.  If it only involves the consultancy aspect, is there a larger project to be delivered at the end of the consulting work and is there an estimate of what it will cost?  The HSE tells us that it is related to the children's hospital group which encompasses Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals and that it is integrating all of the children's hospital networks in Dublin that will form part of the national paediatric programme.  We have discussed the cost of construction at length, but we have always known that several hundred million euro is to be set aside to cover IT, patient and non-construction costs which will be significant.  Nobody had really addressed this issue.  As we have only looked at the increasing cost of construction, we want to know how this aspect fits in.  </p> <p>  We want to put the same letter to the Department of Health.  Has it been incurring any expenditure on the project that is not showing through the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board?  In particular, we want to write to Children's Health Ireland, the CEO of which is Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman.  It has been mentioned here before.  Ms Hardiman is probably involved in what we are talking about.  To my knowledge, the group was formally established as a public body on 1 January 2019.  Up until then it was operating under the HSE, but on 1 January a new board was established for Children's Health Ireland.  We want to write to it also.  We want to pull all of the strands of the extra elements together - the Department of Health, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland - in order that we can get a full picture because when the national children's hospital opens, we all want it to function properly from day one.  It is obvious that there will be extra costs.  What is beginning to happen is that there are extra costs.  When we know to ask the right questions, I want to have a comprehensive picture of all of these elements.  I think members understand from where I am coming.  It is that we will know where we are going, rather than have another &euro;100 million pop up about which nobody will have told us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#BBB00300"><p>The Chairman is right to try to get a comprehensive picture.  There is a deeper issue about consultancy costs and fees paid by Departments and State institutions, an issue on which we have focused for some time, but we need to look at it in a more singular way.  We had it with the third level institutions and the Department of Education and Skills.  It seems that some State institutions cannot make a decision without engaging the services of a consultancy firm.  Questions must be asked about the wisdom of doing so given the amounts of money being spent.  If one was to add the amounts of money spent every year by every Department and State institution, be it hospitals, schools, ETBs, institutes or universities, it would come a significant amount.  I imagine the private sector does not work on that basis.  Where is the in-house knowledge?  Much of it amounts to repetition.  It should be best practice.  Consultancy work seems to be done when the same work would have been done on change management in a different organisation.  It is sloppy and a little lazy at times.  It is easy because they are spending taxpayers' money.  I am not saying there is no justification for spending money on consultancy because there is a place for it, but it seems as if significant amounts of money are being spent on pretty much the same work.  Rather than learning lessons, they repeat the same work and hire the same consultancy firms to do it.  Is it something at which the committee could look from a value for money perspective?</p></speech>

Can any Department can find out what the total cost is in any given year and put all the information together?</p></speech>

The code of practice for semi-State bodies requires the accounts to disclose the level of spending on consultancy.  It is included in each governance report.  There is a job of work to be done to compile it, but it can certainly be done.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has always had a remit to set the framework within which consultancy work is contracted out.</p><p>We did a report on consultancy but it was nearly 20 years ago.  There is a framework and guidelines are issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for how consultants are to be used.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#C00200"><p>I never see a figure for how much Departments or the State have spent on consultancy, so it would be a useful exercise for us to do it.  The secretariat cannot do it but some Department, such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, could give us a figure or seek the information from every State body at our request so that we can look at the figures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#C00300"><p>Perhaps we could give a project to the Library and Research Service on our behalf.  I am sure they are busy people but we do not trouble them very often.  We will ask the secretariat what the options are.  We cannot do the heavy lifting ourselves, though Mr. McCarthy has done some work on it.  We will formalise that at a later stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#C00400"><p>I asked parliamentary questions about consultancy contracts in each Department just before the summer.  I asked what work they had undertaken, and the costs ran into tens of millions of euro.  Some of them are one-off projects and one can understand why they are necessary for speciality services, but there were things like internal audit etc.  I understand there is a shortage of accountants, but this was in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and they were routinely used.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was at a summer school and said it concerned him, and that there was a need to be much more thoughtful about engaging consultants from the point of view of value for money.  We should start with value for money because it has to be questioned whether people are taking a risk-averse approach or whether behaviour needs to change.  There is an issue with building up an institutional memory and institutional capacity with regard to capital projects, where we build up the expertise in the entities in question, meaning we have to engage them repeatedly.  It is almost self-fulfilling that we keep going to these companies.  There is a multiplicity of aspects to this and I will send the Chairman the replies to my parliamentary questions as they suggest an agenda to this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#C00500"><p>I agree with colleagues.  We need greater transparency but I am not sure what the best process would be.  We have to be sure that some of the breakdown of costs is not hidden behind construction inflation.  We should write to the board of the national paediatric hospital about the three layers that have now been flattened.  We should ask for an update on the status of the project because it has been brought to my attention that there are concerns about the rapid escalation of costs in the past six months, something I will talk about on another day.</p></speech>

I propose that its most recent audited accounts come back before us.  We will put it in our work programme.</p></speech>

I will liaise with the Chairman on this point.</p></speech>

I saw that a new chief officer was appointed to the board in recent weeks.  It was not a chief executive officer but a chief officer.  We would like to get all the costs that are out there and that have not been made clear to us to date.</p> <p>  We will move onto category A documents, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Correspondence No. 2390 A, dated 20 September 2019, No. 2392 A, dated 24 September 2019, and No. 2408 A from the Data Protection Commission are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take two items of correspondence relating to today's meeting from the Data Protection Commission.  They are correspondence No. 2403 B and No. 2404 B.  We have been in contact with the commission about getting the report.  No. 2403 B makes it clear that the commission was concerned about the fact it could not issue the report without the consent of the Department.  It sent the report to the Department and it had implications for it because the Department resisted.  The letter is from Mr. John O'Dwyer, deputy commissioner, Data Protection Commission, who said the Department had already written to the commission to object formally to the publication by the commission of a short summary containing details of the eight findings made in the report, and the steps the commissioner called on the Department to take on foot of those findings.  The Department had asserted that publication of this material without its prior agreement was prejudicial to its interests and, as a matter of law, was not within the commission's power.  The letter from John O'Dwyer said they believed the report should be published by the Department.  On 23 September, we received a further letter from Mr. O'Dwyer confirming the report had been published by the Department.  We will note and publish these items.</p> <p>  Correspondence category B is from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow-up to previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first is from Mr. John Madigan, head of marketing and research, Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, dated 31 July 2019, providing information requested by the committee regarding the number of jobs supported by the SBCI in Ireland.  We will note and publish this </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#C01200"><p>They have given the breakdown by region.  They should have it by county so we will ask.  There is a phenomenal amount of double counting here.  They say they have assisted companies supported by SBCI projects amounting to 148,000 people.  There were probably 148,000 people there before they gave them a loan or grant.  If IDA Ireland approves 200 jobs in a place where there are already 2,000 it states it has supported the company with 2,200 jobs.  All the State agencies count the total employment in these companies as though it had something to do with that, even if they have had a minuscule impact on some of the companies.</p><p>IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices, and the SBCI all count the same people in the same jobs multiple times just because there is some level of engagement with a State body.  The figures do not pertain to jobs specifically created by or supported specifically by SBCI.</p></speech>

I am really just saying these are the total employment figures for companies that had some contact with and support from SBCI, not necessarily the figures for jobs initiated or supported by SBCI.  The figure is just for total employment in the areas in question.  We will seek the information on a county-by-county basis.</p></speech>

We encountered this before when debating a company associated with IDA Ireland.  There was a difference of opinion on whether IDA Ireland or the particular initiative created the jobs.  Accommodation and food services might have received &euro;5,000.50 each.  It is daft to include those numbers and have them circulated as facts.  I have genuine concerns over this.  There is either rigour or there is not.  A lot more evidence has to be provided on the supports.</p></speech>

We got the organisation's financial statements in the Oireachtas.  It did not do very much.  It had a very limited number of transactions and a very limited number of loans to a very limited number of organisations.  There were a couple of big transactions.  When we asked about the employee numbers, it was said to us that employee data are gathered in two ways, depending on the kind of grant or loan the business avails of.  It is said that, by and large, employee data are gathered at the stage when a business is eligible to make an application.  It is just the total number of employees in the organisation that is obtained when an application form is received.</p> <p>  Maybe we will hold over the question of whether we want to discuss with the organisation the number of loans it has given and the number of recipient companies.  The applications probably pertained to particular projects in particular companies.  It is a question of how many employees were going to be employed or retained in respect of the projects specifically funded by the loans.  That is all we want.  We all understand that.

We will not note or publish the information at this point.  We will hold it over and include the organisation on our work programme.  We will come back to the correspondence at that stage.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 2343B, from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, providing information requested by the committee on the number of active claims for the Minister being managed by the State Claims Agency.  At the end of June 2019, the figure was 316 cases, with an estimated liability of &euro;67.9 million.  When the witnesses were here, we asked for the breakdown.  The reply we received last week stated the State Claims Agency was collating the information and that when it was available, we would be contacted.  We got information from the agency that we noted at the previous meeting.  It told us separately that Tusla cases on its files point to a figure of &euro;50.76 million.  We are told in the letter it relates to 254 cases.  When the two figures are added together, the agency has, in respect of each of the 254 cases in respect of Tusla, an average provision of &euro;200,000.  With regard to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we are told there are four cases.  The State Claims Agency told us in its meeting last week that the cases managed by it in respect of the Department resulted in a figure of &euro;460,000.  It is providing an estimate of &euro;115,000 for each of the four cases.  Interestingly, the total amount covered is &euro;67.9 million.  When one removes the figures of Tusla and the Department, the balance refers to Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  There are 58 claims in that regard.  There is &euro;16.68 million for claims in respect of the campus currently in the State Claims Agency files.  That gives an average provision of &euro;288,000 in respect of the 58 claims.  I am just putting that on the record because, unless one combines the correspondence of last week and this week, one could not work out the figure.  We will republish No. 2335B from last week with this week's correspondence where we picked our information from, if anybody is looking at it.</p></speech>

It is significant and very high.  Could we have a breakdown, in broad terms, on types of cases and perhaps a breakdown by county?

The agency does not want to identify a particular region because it might be unfair to the region in question if there happened to be a large number of claims in a certain year.  If the information on the public record is overanalysed, it could give the people who are taking the claims against the State an indication of how much it is setting aside in respect of their claims before they go to court.  That would disadvantage the taxpayer, and we need to be responsible for the taxpayer.  We will ask for the breakdown of the categories to the extent that this can be provided without compromising their defence of the cases.</p></speech>

There have been many problems managing that.  We will ask and see if we can get the breakdown of that between claims by staff or claims by children in Oberstown.  We will see what information emerges.  The agency will know not to compromise its own defence when supplying information.  It probably thinks I have overanalysed what it gave us already and might regret it.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2344 B is correspondence from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 2 August 2019, providing information requested by the committee including summary of the control processes and compliance framework re private work by consultants in public hospitals  Deputy Kelly will be interested in this because, as outlined on page 2, the percentage of work carried out by private consultants in the University of Limerick hospital group seems to be the highest.  The Deputy raised an issue in that regard.  We can see from the correspondence that the private work being carried out in that hospital is the highest of any of the groups.  Perhaps Deputy Kelly has not had the opportunity to study that particular item.</p></speech>

The figures were not a surprise to me, particularly as I had them near enough to what is outlined.

That all ties into why we have these issues.</p></speech>

We will write back for a breakdown and ask him what action the Department is taking on foot of that.  We will just deal specifically with the University of Limerick hospital group.  It is the outlier in the chart given.  We will ask him to know what action it has taken and what additional measures it is putting in place to prevent it reoccurring.</p></speech>

The correspondence also contains information on the cost of the Scally inquiry and details of the consultant contract settlement to include an overview of the 1997 consultant contracts.  We know there was a settlement with consultants recently.  However, some older employees were not part of that.  There is a detailed note.  I raised that matter.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It will be of interest to some people in this area.  There is a copy of the directive issued by the Minister and a note on the most recent directive on the specification of accounting policy to recognise HSE assets regarding obligations acquired by public private partnership concessions.  Deputy Munster may be interested in this.</p></speech>

That is broken down by prescription charges, manufacturers&rsquo; rebate and pharmacy claims.  There is a breakdown of the drugs payment scheme, the long-term illness scheme.  It is all outlined on page 19 and is useful information for people to have.</p> <p>  Then we asked for a note on the whole-time equivalent staff working in the health services.  That is listed on page 20.  It states there are 77,473 direct employees of the HSE.  The section 38 hospitals which are the big ones are St. James&rsquo;s, 25,642.  The section 38 voluntary agencies, which was the missing piece of the jigsaw, stand at approximately 16,000.  There are in the region of 119,550 whole-time equivalent employees delivering the health service in Ireland.  It is just to get the total picture because we always knew the HSE.  It does put the caveat in that the number of people brought in on agency basis from the section 38 agencies.  It takes the pay rates of what they are paid and the number of hours they work.  It converts it to a high-level estimate, as it calls it, back into whole-time equivalents.  It is as much as we were looking for.  It gives us a close enough picture that a significant portion of 16,000 out of 119,000 people delivering the health service every day are pure agency staff through section 38.  That is a significant percentage and has probably been increasing.  We will note that and publish it.  There is a lot of useful information there.</p></speech>

It is a time bomb  It is a topic to which the committee should return.  I know we spoke about potential special reports.  This area is completely underfunded.  There are loans being given out to these organisations but they do not call them loans.</p></speech>

We will have that on our work programme.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2345B is correspondence from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General of the Oireachtas Commission, on various queries put to him at the meeting of 11 July.  It gives a breakdown of expenditure on ICT in 2018 and information on the costs of disseminating output from the Houses of the Oireachtas to local media, including regional newspapers, local radio and national newspapers.</p><p>It also gives a breakdown of the costs associated with the High Court and Supreme Court cases involving Mr. Denis O'Brien and states in regard to that particular case that senior counsel, Sara Moorhead, was paid &euro;136,948, Michael Collins was paid &euro;118,824 and David Fennelly was paid &euro;85,325.  </p><p> There is a note on a range of issues regarding the six legal cases involving staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service and their cases, on which we asked for details.  Nobody is identified, but some of the listed cases have gone to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The information has been provided to members and will be published later today.  There is another note on the work of Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, involving information regarding the backlog in regard to the translation of Acts.  There is an extensive report on that backlog and the estimated cost and timescale involved in addressing it.  I understand the plan will cost &euro;3.5 million over a five year period.  </p><p> There is a note on liabilities, which were bills due to be paid at year end.  There is nothing significant in that regard.</p><p> We asked who was responsible for paying the Army.  It is covered by the Department of Defence.</p><p> We asked for a breakdown and they told us that there are 2,027 staff on the payroll system, including retired Members and retired staff.  The breakdown indicates that Members and political staff number 790, including Deputies, Senators, political personnel who work for Deputies and MEPs, former Members, political staff and MEPs and staff who work in constituency offices.  A figure of 584 is provided in regard to Oireachtas staff, including Civil Service bar and catering staff and clerical staff.</p><p> There is a further note regarding the ongoing ICT training provided by the service.  We made a suggestion that there should the some facility to provide training in the constituency offices, in particular for Members who do not have offices in Dublin.  It is easy for Members who are based in Dublin to avail of training.  It was suggested that when equipment is being upgraded the personnel delivering the new equipment would be asked to provide, say, a half day training in some of the constituencies.  That would be a major help to the more remote offices.</p><p> The final note is a response to our request for a note on the energy rating for the building that was refurbished.  The note states that an energy certificate is displayed in the Leinster House complex and the rating is D1.  The rating system is A to G, with A being the most efficient, such that D1 is a poor pass, at best.  A display energy certificate is used in this case, which is slightly different from a BER rating, but is appropriate.  It is based on the consumption of energy per square metre of the building.  It also includes the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine building and other buildings adjacent to Leinster House.  Essentially, the energy rating of the refurbished building is D1.</p><p> Some of that information comes in under No. 2409.  We will note and publish all of that information.</p></speech>

In this correspondence reference is made to certain barristers&rsquo; legal fees.  In regard to the Apple case, for some time now, through parliamentary questions and other formats, I have been trying to get the fees paid to certain barristers and information on whether they have any other public sector jobs and, consistently, I have been refused this information, citing personal information.  The State is paying these barristers significant sums with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  I understand that some of them hold other publicly funded roles.  Despite my having been previously given such information, I have consistently been refused it recently, yet this correspondence makes reference to that information.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt provides details of the percentage of female participation at various meetings at Appendix 1.  We will note and publish this item. </p><p><b></b>No. 2354 is from Professor Phillip Nolan, president, Maynooth University, dated 29 July 2019 providing information requested by the committee regarding loan guarantees in respect of a debt that the university had to write off.  In fairness, this is a 40 page document so I suggest we hold it over to another day.  I have not had an opportunity to read through it.  It is too large to discuss today.  Is it agreed to hold it over?  Agreed.</p><p><b></b>No. 2373 is from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 5 September 2019 providing information requested by the committee at the meeting on 9 May 2019.  There is some interesting information provided.  We asked why there was an increase in money for Garda masts and the response is that it was a timing issue in that it did not receive payment in one year and it came through the following year.</p><p>Members will be interested in the next note, which is an update on the approximately 14,000 people affected by the fixed charge notices to include the number of people who had lost their licences as a result.  Members will recall that an examination of summonses and charges issued between January 2006 and December 2016 identified a significant number of summonses and charges issued for persons who had committed offences, but were brought before the courts incorrectly, which required further examination.  I remind Deputies that this is nearly three years old.  The letter is detailed.  We asked for an update because the fines collected in 12,000 cases had to be repaid.  The note states that it has been difficult to track down all of the people affected and that some of the registered letters sent were returned.  They were then sent to the divisional offices for delivery but when officers tried to deliver them they found the people were no longer at the addresses.  They tried to get their new addresses and are still following up and making inquiries.  Three years on, in the cases of the approximately 12,000 people affected, more than 4,000 letters of consent have been received.  What they are saying is that they want to go back into court to get the case struck out and the points removed but they need the consent of the persons before they bring their names into court.  Of the 12,000 affected, only 4,000 consents have been granted to date.  There are a further 8,000 people who got penalty points.</p><p>Maybe some of them feel they have expired and they are not interested.  Let us be clear about that.  They should be able to get to the bottom of it.  They are saying that in the absence of the consent from the individual, they cannot do anything about it.  They are saying that in respect of the driving licences, no response received from a person affected has indicated to the Garda that they had actually lost their driving licence as a result of the extra penalty points shoving them over the figure.  People were on the radio and television stating that was happening.  The Garda states it has no proof that that happened.</p><p> It is interesting it is taking so long.  It is not a good administration system where, three years on, they have not been able to tie down two thirds of the people concerned.  It speaks for itself.  I want to be fair to the Garda.  For many people, perhaps the points are now extinguished and they are not bothered with it anymore.</p><p> Details are given of the cost of establishing a cybercrime unit, of the internal affairs unit, and of the training costs for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A note is given on prepayments and advance payments of ICT provision.</p><p> Details are also given of the collection of insurance premia by the Garda on behalf of insurance companies.  It is stated it is for medical insurance &ndash; we were worried that this related to cars that were found on the road that were not insured and premia were being collected.  It merely seems to be an internal payroll issue.  They seem to get a commission from health insurance companies for processing and collecting the premia.</p><p> The status of the canine unit is given.  It is stated that each handler has responsibility for the care and maintenance of his or her training dog.  I had raised this issue that there were nine new ones attached to the dog unit in Kilmainham.  Two of these kennels were erected towards the end of 2018 and a further seven require construction.  A year on, there are only two of the nine done.  Agreement had been reached with Office of Public Works, OPW, to provide the kennels to the remaining seven members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In some cases, they have the dogs in their own back yards at home without proper facilities.  That is not the way.  These are highly specialised, trained dogs that are of considerable assistance in crime detection.  I urge the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to spend the money, do the job, get it over and done with, and look after that area properly.</p></speech>

That is an income.  The Chairman is talking about spending money on the canine unit.  I would say there is an income that has not been recouped.  It is not only an income.  The whole point of the speeding fines is to make the roads safer.  There could be a price to pay in terms of human cost.  When there is such income-----</p></speech>

That is something we will come back to.  I am not suggesting debt collectors, because that was raised.  The point is that, in some regions people, even when they are handed down fines in court, ignore them and the fines are never paid, collected or followed up.  That is another day&rsquo;s work.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2374, from Mr. Robert Watt, provides copies of documentation released under freedom of information, FOI, pertaining to the national children's hospital.  Some members will have seen that previously.  It has been out under FOI for a period, if members want it followed up.  We note and publish that, although it is already published under FOI.</p> <p>  No. 2375, from Mr. Eoin McLoughlin, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, is regarding agri-biomethane.  We can note and publish that.  Some will want to watch that.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 2381, from Ms Louise O'Meara, head of policy and secretariat, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, dated 11 September, provides an information note requested by the committee on the inquiry regarding EU funds for training purposes in the Garda College, Templemore.  We will ask for an update on that.  The letter is clear.  We note and publish the letter stating that the commission refers to EU funds for training purposes in the Garda College.  It states there are legacy issues.  There are two different sources.  One relates to the issue and one was raised at the Committee of Public Accounts.  They state the account was maintained in Templemore with the consent of the Department of Justice and Equality but it has nothing to do with the Garda Training College - that is merely where somebody was administering it &ndash; and the bank account was sanctioned by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The last paragraph states that during its investigation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission obtained a significant amount of documentation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality, the financial institution and the European Union itself, and that as this is a criminal investigation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is limited in what information it can release at this time but, as stated above, the investigation is now at an advanced stage.  We will just have to wait, if there are criminal proceedings, for them to take their course.  GSOC confirms that criminal proceedings are being investigated in this case.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is from, Mr. Pat Smyth, interim CEO of Tusla, dated 12 September, providing clarification requested by the committee in relation to the remuneration of staff employed directly by Tusla and agency staff.  There was a little confusion and they clarify it there.</p></speech>

It sets out that the main difference between both positions, the directly employed ones and the agency staff, is the pensions.  Tusla does not have to make a pension contribution to an agency worker.  In fairness, Tusla recognises that if it directly employs people, the workers themselves have better benefits in terms of maternity benefit, career break options, shorter working year etc.  I welcome all that.</p> <p>  There is a contradiction between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s stated view that there is a big problem with pensions - it is a ticking time bomb, we need employers to be paying into people&rsquo;s pensions, and we need people to have private pensions - and the State employing agency staff who do not have pension protection.  It is something of a false economy.  There are a number of false economies involved in hiring agency staff.  There is a contradiction between one Department talking about encouraging private sector companies to pay into their employees&rsquo; pension pots while other Departments are not doing so.</p> <p>  We had a similar situation with RT&Eacute; with if-and-when contracts.  We had it with other bodies as well.  There is a price to be paid down the road for all of this in terms of people&rsquo;s pension contributions that needs to be factored in when Government organisations are looking at employing agency staff versus direct employment.</p></speech>

That could involve 40,000 staff at different stages during the year but, in breaking it down to whole-time equivalents, there were 16,000 whole-time equivalent agency staff.  It is a significant proportion.  It is the same point Deputy Cullinane is making.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item is from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, OPW, providing an update requested by the committee regarding the discussions on the rent for the Miesian Plaza, its new headquarters for the Department of Health in Baggot Street in Dublin.  He states that he had anticipated a meeting with the landlord would have taken place at this stage, that due to availability of senior personnel in both organisations it has not been possible, that a meeting has been arranged for early October, and that Mr. Buckley will keep the committee informed.  We will note that and give him a month.  On 1 November, we will write for the update.</p></speech>

I dealt with that already.  I also dealt with No. 2404.

We note and publish this.  Technically, Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll is the Accounting Officer for the Office of the Data Protection Commission.  That is scheduled to change in the coming year.</p><p>He felt that since Ms Dixon is the commissioner directly responsible for the office that is most appropriate, she is the person we need rather than him.  He has given the list of witnesses.  Technically, he could be here but I think it is reasonable that we have Ms Helen Dixon and the relevant officials from her office and the Department of Justice and Equality.  He is putting on the record why he is not here.  That is accepted and published.</p><p> No. 2407B is from the Journal Office and is a report of the Committee of Selection, dated 11 July 2019, discharging Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien from the committee.

It is No. 2352C from Brian Lynch and Associates, dated 19 July 2019, requesting the committee make inquiries to the Comptroller and Auditor General about the special report of 2017 regarding the provision of school transport.  The matters related to the accounts of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which are not examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is quite a debate here about whether school transport worked on a cost recovery basis.  There was a suggestion that it always did but it became clear recently that Bus &Eacute;ireann had a surplus in that area, which has now been moved back to support school transport in future years.  The essence of this issue was that Mr. Lynch had been involved in several court cases against Bus &Eacute;ireann and the State related to this.  We are going to note and publish this letter since it relates to the audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mr. Lynch mentions the report and the cost recovery.  He asks if the Comptroller and Auditor General will confirm that cost recovery was not the correct basis, notwithstanding that he has issued the report, and that perhaps a profit was made on it when the Department told us that it believed there was no profit, just cost recovery.  Can Mr. McCarthy comment on the letter and the request?</p></speech>

I am not the auditor of Bus &Eacute;ireann and I do not have legal rights to examine and report on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I have put what I had to say on the matter in the special report.  I do not feel that it is appropriate to comment any further on the matter.</p></speech>

Foolishly or otherwise, I read all of the case law on it.  There is a fundamental misunderstanding about what we are being asked to do in the committee.  The request is for the Committee of Public Accounts to ask or direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to confirm in writing four things which he found in the accounts.  There is a fundamental misunderstanding generally, not just specifically here, that we are being asked to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to go back to look again and find something that he has not said.  It is important that he has an independent role.  He has done a report and we have examined it.  We are now being asked to go back.  I do not think that is possible.  Issues relating to value for money for school transport need to be teased out, but those are different issues and will be addressed in due course.</p></speech>

The cost then was &euro;60 million and we included that in our latest periodic report.  It is scheduled to come back in shortly after the budget.  It is the Department incurring the majority, if not most, of the costs.  We can contact it.  Ms Dixon will not be able to answer for the Department today.  She can only give her perspective.  Do Deputies Kelly or MacSharry want to raise any correspondence?</p></speech>

It is something of a whitewash.  The letter states that the Department is liaising with Noel McGree, that it is a difficult situation but that everything is progressing.  I do not believe that there is any goodwill here.  I think we are throwing the kitchen sink at this man and that if anybody monitors this particular case, it would be a signal to never submit a protected disclosure because we would throw the person under a bus.  There is a need for goodwill.</p><p>If what Mr. O'Driscoll says was morally true, in practical terms, they would be making contact with Mr. McGree and would be trying to mediate this.  They are not.  I am aware that Mr. McGree and his family have had a horrendous time where they have been stuffed into an administrative merry-go-round to blindly protect the State.  No consideration is being shown for a person who gave 25 years of his life to public service.  I do not accept this letter.  It was written to tell the committee what it wants to hear to shut it up.  In real terms, this man and his family are suffering.  Some sort of proactive attempt should be made, rather than box-ticking exercises and superficial correspondence and engagement.  They need to deal with this, mediate it in a timely manner with some level of consideration for a man and his family who has given 25 years to the State and who has done the State some additional service by having the courage to highlight some issues, the investigation of which may be still continuing.  The person and his family are entitled to a little bit more proactivity and engagement rather than this.</p></speech>

This correspondence does not reflect what the Secretary General stated to us here.  We have met and dealt with this individual and listened honestly.  We certainly got a strong feeling from the Secretary General that these issues would be dealt with in a humane and sensible way; they have not been.  This letter is just a generic response to tick a box without dealing with the issues.  I propose that we write back to the Secretary General and state that we would like a more proactive response to the issues that this individual has raised, and to dealing with his situation.</p></speech>

Most Members will be aware that we have met the person concerned.  For those who are new to this iissue, this individual made a protected disclosure on certain issues.  This was not resolved satisfactorily within the prison service.  Through the Department and the Prison Service, the services of a retired judge were requested to do a report.  He gave a report that fully vindicated the individual.  The Department has not acted on this yet.  As a result of him being out of work, he has taken cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Public determinations have been made in his favour at the commission awarding him money.  The Prison Service and the Department, one or other or both, have appealed these determinations.  He is out of work.  He has the backing of a retired judge employed by the Department or the Prison Service to do a job.  The WRC has made a determination in his favour.  The Department has refused to pay this award and wants to appeal this decision.  He is out of work in the meantime and his family are in financial jeopardy.</p></speech>

There is a perception that when one passes legislation, the box is ticked.  The problem is that the trend suggests that there are cultural issues where whistleblowers are seen as a nuisance and are fought all the way.  Several high-profile cases demonstrated this and have put people off coming forward with information that requires to be brought to the attention of the committee and various Departments.  Unless there is a cultural change in how whistleblowers are handled, we are going to keep on seeing a repeat of this kind of scenario.</p></speech>

As a matter of policy now, the committee will write to each organisation on each occasion.  It is not good enough to have this reference buried in a governance report in a certain financial statement.  Only a few people who might be interested in money matters would look at these figures to see a minor remark in a Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.</p></speech>

I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Orders that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Two sets of accounts were required because the legal structure of the Commission changed as a result of the passing of the Data Protection Commission Act 2018 and the commencement of relevant sections of the Act on 25 May 2018, coinciding with the beginning of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, regime on that day.</p> <p>  The format of the accounts is similar for the two periods of account and was previously applied by the former Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The accounts are prepared on a cash basis and transactions are recognised in the period they occur rather in the period to which they relate.  The results for the period of account are presented in a receipts and payments account.  There is no balance sheet, but some accrual information is included in a note to each account.  The commission relies on the Department of Justice and Equality for its payment and accounting system.  As the Chairman mentioned earlier, it is planned that the commission will have its own Vote from 1 January 2020, and from then on the commission will report financially in the appropriation account format.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s activities in 2018 were funded through Oireachtas grants totalling just over &euro;8 million.  This was applied in paying staff costs totalling &euro;4.9 million; accommodation and equipment costs of &euro;1.1 million; operational costs of &euro;371,000; and legal and professional fees of &euro;1.7 million.</p> <p>  Expenditure of the commission has increased in recent years, as the staffing and activity levels have grown.  The increase in expenditure between 2017 and 2018 was around 30%.  Up to 24 May 2018, certain data controllers and data processors were required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and to pay registration fees.  The registration fee receipts were remitted to the Department of Justice and Equality and recognised in the Vote for justice and equality as appropriations in aid.  The registration and fee regime ended with the coming into force of the 2018 Act.  I issued clear audit certificates in respect of both sets of accounts.</p></speech>

As the Chair mentioned, I am joined by a number of my colleagues from the Data Protection Commission.  I am going to refer to the Data Protection Commission as the DPC from now on.  The colleagues I am joined by are deputy commissioners Anna Morgan, John O&rsquo;Dwyer and Graham Doyle and the DPC&rsquo;s professional accountant Graham Geoghegan, who has been a welcome new addition to our team in 2019.</p> <p>  The DPC is fully funded by the Exchequer currently through a subhead of Vote 24 of the Department of Justice and Equality.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General just indicated, this latter arrangement will change in 2020 when the commission is to be allocated its own individual Vote.  At that point, I, as currently the sole Commissioner for Data Protection, will become the Accounting Officer in line with section 25 of the 2018 Act.  In this context, the DPC appreciates this early opportunity to engage with the committee as it will provide useful direction in terms of an exploration of the accounts of the DPC, particularly as the budget allocation of the DPC has increased considerably in recent years and as the authority now takes on many additional new and direct responsibilities in the areas of accounting, HR, ICT and procurement.</p> <p>  The committee is aware that the DPC is the national independent supervisory authority responsible for monitoring and enforcing the application of EU data protection law.  The GDPR, the e-privacy regulations, the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018 and the law enforcement directive all provide the main legal frameworks under which the DPC regulates.  There are in the region of 20 other items of legislation under which the DPC must perform particular supervisory functions assigned to it.  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 is one such example.</p> <p>  The provision that the data protection authority in each EU member state is independent in the performance of its functions is fundamental to the GDPR.  Article 52 of the GDPR prescribes that each member state shall ensure that the supervisory authority is provided with the human, technical and financial resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of its tasks and the exercise of its powers.  Currently, based on figures produced by the European Data Protection Board, the DPC in 2018 was the eighth largest in the EU in terms of both employee numbers and budget, slotting in behind, for example, the UK with 513 staff and a 2018 budget of over &euro;51 million and France with 199 staff and a budget of over &euro;17 million.</p> <p>  The DPC operates in a very specific context at an EU level in that it is the lead supervisory authority in the EU under the GDPR for most of the world&rsquo;s largest technology companies, given their headquarter locations here in Ireland.  This brings considerable additional volumes of work, complexity and scrutiny but also grants the privilege to the DPC of handling cutting-edge cases in this important area of law.</p> <p>  It is worth recalling that 2018 was a historic year in terms of data protection.  The 2018 Act was the first comprehensive piece of national data protection legislation enacted in the State since 2003 and it gave further effect to the GDPR in Ireland and transposed the law enforcement directive.</p><p>The core functions of the DPC under the GDPR and the 2018 Act include handling complaints from individuals on potential infringements of their data protection rights.  In excess of 4,000 complaints were received in the calendar year 2018, which represented a 56% increase over the figure received in 2017.  A total of 3,366 of those complaints were concluded in 2018.  Some of the complaints are easily resolved with intervention by the Irish DPC.  For example, an organisation might fail to provide an individual with a copy of their personal data, and when the DPC intervenes, the data may be immediately forthcoming.  Other cases can be far lengthier and complex, particularly where many different laws are in play.  This has been especially the case with complaints, for example, about receiverships and liquidations and about cases involving disputes between employers and employees.</p><p> The second function of the Data Protection Commission is to conduct inquiries and investigations regarding potential infringements of data protection legislation and to enforce the law as required using corrective measures and, now, administrative fines.  In 2018, large-scale investigations that were under way included the investigation into the public services card; a finalised report and findings into non-compliance by the hospitals sector; 32 investigations into surveillance of citizens by the State sector through the use of technologies such as CCTV, body-worn cameras, automatic number plate recognition systems, drones and other technologies; and 15 investigations of a range of issues concerning so-called big tech companies.  A final report and set of directions for compliance were also issued to Yahoo! EMEA Limited in respect of infringements relating to what was at the time the largest global data breach ever notified.  Further, the DPC in 2018 issued a significant decision against the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, regarding access to personal data, and details of this decision feature in the DPC's first annual report for 2018.  There were also nine sets of District Court prosecutions taken by the DPC, which concluded during 2018.  Eight of those concluded successfully, with costs awarded to the DPC and the final case being withdrawn due to compliance by the data controller.</p><p> The third function of the DPC is to promote awareness among organisations and the public of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in the processing of personal data.  More than 50,000 contacts by email, telephone and web forms were received through the DPC&rsquo;s information and assessment unit in 2018.  A number of campaigns via the DPC website and in the national media were run by the DPC in 2018 to drive readiness for the GDPR.  These included the launch of a comprehensive public consultation on children&rsquo;s data.  By the end of the awareness campaigns the DPC ran in 2018, 80% of Irish adults had been reached and, based on an independent survey commissioned by the DPC, 90% of SMEs were aware of the GDPR.</p><p> Fourth, we have a function in co-operating with data protection authorities in other EU member states on issues such as complaints and alleged infringements involving multinationals.  In excess of 80 European Data Protection Board meetings were attended in Brussels by DPC staff in 2018.  As of last year, EU data protection authorities use a shared IT platform to transfer and exchange information on cases, and more than one third of the cases on this IMI platform were assigned to the Irish DPC in accordance with the rules of the one-stop shop.  Delivery of a harmonised implementation of the GDPR across the EU is central to the aims of the new law.</p><p> The fifth function of the DPC is to assess breach notifications from organisations that now have a mandatory obligation under the GDPR to report to the DPC and to ensure mitigation actions have been taken.  A total of 4,740 valid data breaches were notified in the 2018 calendar year, which represents a significant increase over 2017.  Each of these breach notifications was individually assessed and engagement with the reporting organisation took place, giving the DPC an opportunity to make recommendations on procedural and security mitigation measures to be put in place.</p><p> The funding of the DPC by Government has increased significantly in recent years, from &euro;1.7 million in 2013 to &euro;11.7 million in 2018, which comprised an allocation of &euro;7.3 million for pay and &euro;4.4 million for non-pay expenditure.  The allocation was further increased for 2019 with a total allocation of &euro;15.28 million.  This commitment of additional budget has allowed the DPC to grow its staff from 27 in 2014 up to 110 at the end of 2018 and now to 138 today.</p><p> The majority of expenditure at the DPC relates to salary costs.  The outturn on salaries for 2018 was &euro;4.767 million.  During 2018, the DPC added an additional 25 staff, all of whom were recruited through specialist competitive recruitment campaigns to ensure the DPC has the legal, technological, investigative and communications staff it requires to deliver on its mandate.</p><p> The DPC non-pay expenditure outturn was &euro;3.286 million for 2018.  It was composed mainly of office accommodation costs, communications costs, legal fees and costs, and business advisory services to prepare the DPC for GDPR.  Legal fees and costs represent the biggest category of non-pay expenditure, and such cases will continue be a feature of the work of the Irish DPC, particularly now as punitive fines and measures can be imposed against organisations.  Irish law allows a right of appeal by affected parties against decisions of the DPC.  Currently, the DPC has 24 live civil litigation cases active in the courts.</p><p> In addition, the DPC initiated what has been one of the most significant data protection cases in the EU when it brought a High Court application in May 2016 seeking a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, on the validity of an EU legal instrument underpinning personal data transfers in a case involving Facebook and Max Schrems, a data protection activist.  The case is of fundamental importance to the determination of core issues of data protection under EU law and has drawn global media coverage and worldwide interest far beyond the data protection community.  The outcome of the case potentially will have worldwide ramifications for data transfers out of the EU and is being closely followed by data protection regulators, law makers and the data protection community.  A decision of the CJEU is awaited in late 2019 or early 2020.</p><p> I hope I can assist the committee further with responses to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

In addition to the corrective measures that we can apply, we can impose punitive fines.  The intention is that where we do identify infringements under the GDPR, we are obliged to consider the application of the administrative fines and we have to do it in a way that is intended to be a deterrent.  It has to be proportionate, dissuasive and effective in terms of its application.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts has dealt with this issue previously, as was mentioned in the commission's report.

On foot of the findings, I directed the Department, first, to cease processing, in terms of SAFE 2 and the issuing of public services cards, where the processing was for the purposes of an individual engaging in a transaction with a specified body.  To translate that into English, the Department was to cease processing where it was for the purposes of anything other than a social welfare benefit claim.</p> <p>  The second action I directed the Department to take was to prepare an implementation plan in respect of findings Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, which are the findings the Deputy referenced that relate to data retention and transparency.  I proposed a period of 49 days to the Department by which it would set out an implementation plan for how it could bring itself into compliance with the findings.  It struck me that on the retention issue, and on the order that the Department was to delete the data and the supporting documentation it was retaining, there could be procurement issues for it or unforeseen consequences I would not be able to identify from the distance I was at.  I gave the Department time to propose an implementation plan with timelines on which we would engage with it.  They were the directions issued to the Department.</p></speech>

One of the core issues was a difference of opinion on the legal underpinnings of the card and its workings.  Did Ms Dixon rely on in-house legal advice or was she obliged to purchase an external legal opinion?  If the latter, what was the cost?</p></speech>

It was a broad-ranging investigation, given the volumes of data processing at issue.  We identified a number of issues we would investigate around legal basis, retention and transparency, as well as security and biometric personal data processing.  Over the months we conducted the investigation, we identified that we would have to narrow the scope of the investigation and corresponded with the Department to that effect.  We limited the first part of the investigation to legal basis retention and transparency.</p> <p>  In advance of issuing the draft report to the Department in August 2018 with our provisional findings, we had identified we did not have sufficient information on all the areas we were examining to make preliminary conclusions.  When we issued the draft report, we made preliminary inclusions in 13 areas and made 17 requests for further information to the Department.  To answer the Deputy's question, before we issued the draft report we sought some legal advice because it was already clear in the responses we had received from the Department that issues of legal interpretation were being raised, as were assertions that we might be erring in law.  As a result, we obtained legal advice in advance of issuing the draft report.  The legal advice, which was obtained from a junior counsel in 2018, cost &euro;10,000.</p></speech>

In a reply to a parliamentary question on the issue and on Ms Dixon's report, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, stated:</p><blockquote>The Department sought to meet the DPC on two occasions since receipt of the report with a view to outlining the basis for its conclusions and seeking to clarify a number of matters of concern relating to inconsistencies both within the DPC's report and between the report and the accompanying letter from the DPC.  The request for a meeting was declined on both occasions.</blockquote> <p>The Minister is speaking on behalf of the Department here.  Essentially, she stated Ms Dixon's commission refused to meet the Department, despite two requests being made.  Will Ms Dixon outline the rationale for why that was the case?</p></speech>

In fact, Deputy Cullinane will see from the correspondence on 22 August that I was open to meeting once that implementation plan was tabled.  I did not hear anything further about a meeting until correspondence from the Secretary General on 3 September.  The correspondence issued to me after a press statement had issued from the Department earlier that day and the Minister had done some rounds of media, all of which indicated that the findings of the Data Protection Commission were to be rejected and that the findings were to be challenged.  By the time the correspondence of 3 September landed, which confirmed that the Department did not intend to comply with any of the directions that had been issued, it was out of the question that a meeting would be appropriate.  I will quote accurately from the correspondence of 3 September from the Department:</p><blockquote>However, given the strong and sincerely held differences in opinion between your Office and both Departments, [it is referring to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform] (based on the advice received from the Office of the Attorney General), as to the correct interpretation ... of the relevant legal text and ... the import of this difference in interpretation not just for the PSC and SAFE 2 and the organisations and citizens that rely on them.</blockquote> <p>I will find the relevant section.</p><blockquote>The Minister wishes it to be known that she is anxious that her officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should engage in discussions with your office to determine if there are any measures that can be agreed, without prejudice to our respective positions, that might address the Commission's concerns and negate the requirement for any Enforcement proceedings.</blockquote> <p>It was entirely inappropriate that we would engage in a meeting where we had issued finalised findings and clear directions as to what was required to bring it into compliance.</p></speech>

I just wanted Ms Dixon to put that on the public record because I think that is important.  I used the phrase "professional disagreement" earlier.  When I read the report I think it goes a bit further than that because I am looking at the sections that talk about when Ms Dixon had a draft report and a reply was sought from the Department.  What we are looking at is process and how Ms Dixon's office interacts with Departments.  The office has a very clear role and it is statutorily independent.  We would expect that there would be a professional level of co-operation with Ms Dixon's office.  I am concerned when I read this and I see that there was, first, issues in relation to the Department seeking an extension to its response to the draft report in the first instance.  Second, what seems extraordinary to me is that when the Department first responded that it sent 470 scanned pages that were unpaginated.  From her perspective, does Ms Dixon think that is an acceptable level of co-operation from a Department?</p></speech>

In terms of a 470-page submission that was not searchable and was not paginated, which ultimately we resolved with the Department when it made a further submission at our request, I could certainly say it is not the norm in terms of what we would anticipate in a response to the report that we issued.</p></speech>

I can imagine what I would do if I was in her position and I got 470 scanned pages.  I imagine that what she was looking for was a formal, intelligible response and what she got was 470 scanned pages.  Was there a follow-up to that?  Did Ms Dixon write back to the Department and say that was not acceptable and she needed the response to come in a different format?</p></speech>

After trying to utilise what had been supplied to us, we ultimately contacted the Department and obtained a resolution when it resubmitted a submission that was searchable and paginated.</p></speech>

It says, however the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection objects to the DPC's use of such language in this regard.  That was to describe the evolution of the card in the first place and considers that it is "pejorative and sensationalist".  Again, that strikes me as not being fully co-operative, in that a Department was essentially saying the commission's office was being sensationalist.  How did the office respond to that?</p></speech>

We show how we treated those particular arguments from the Department, taking them into account but, ultimately, in that section of the report we rejected the assertions from the Department.  In part, the response was indicative of quite entrenched and strongly held views on the part of the Department in relation to the public services card.</p></speech>

We must have regard when we receive correspondence, as we do, to data protection.  We must do it as individuals and as Members of the Oireachtas.  Departments have a responsibility to take the lead.  Perhaps it is a bit strong; but was there a pushback from the Department in co-operating with Ms Dixon's office?  It might be strong to say "pushback", but when I read the report in its entirety on the process from when Ms Dixon's office first started engaging with the Department up to its conclusion, it did not jump out at me that the Department was co-operating in a fair way with the office.  Was that engagement an outlier or unusual in terms of how other Departments or organisations have engaged with Ms Dixon's office?</p></speech>

The Department co-operated with the process.  Deputy Cullinane asked if there was pushback.  In terms of the response the Department has published to the report and the responses the Deputy can see reflected in the final report, it clearly is resistant to the legal analysis and the findings of the Data Protection Commission.  There is little doubt about that.</p></speech>

I am aware that other members want to contribute as well.  I thank Ms Dixon for her responses.  A number of Departments were using the card, namely, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Education and Skills, Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Children and Youth Affairs and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Following the publication of the commission's report, how many Departments have ceased using the card and in Ms Dixon's view, are Departments still using the card outside the law?</p></speech>

It is clear that the Department has opted not to do that.</p></speech>

From Ms Dixon's knowledge - I know she cannot speak about what she does not know - which Departments have changed their practice?  She has given a direction.  Are Departments still operating outside the law from her perspective?  They might have a different perspective on the interpretation of the law, but Ms Dixon is the one who issued a report and a directive.  Are there any Departments, in her view, still operating outside of the law in respect of the PSC and, if so, which Departments?</p></speech>

Again, to the best of our knowledge, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is not requiring the PSC on a mandatory basis.  As far as we understand from the press statement issued the other day by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs appears to be pressing ahead with a requirement that individuals use a PSC to apply online for the new childcare scheme.  The only alternative option that appears to be offered is a manual, paper-based application that will not be ready until the new year and will not provide back payments.  Clearly, this is completely at odds with the findings of our report and the directions we have issued.</p></speech>

Her findings were that there was no legal basis for the card beyond the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and that data were held by the Department in a way which was potentially illegal, from her analysis.  Is that still the case today?</p></speech>

Well done to them on their work to date.  It is incredibly important in the times we live in.  My questions concern three different areas.  I have some questions about the PSC; some questions about finance and funding, which I have concerns about, scale being the big issue; and then some questions about aspects of the Data Protection Commission's work relating to its position as the lead supervisory authority in the EU and current cases that have impacts in many ways on the way in which we live.</p> <p>  Regarding the PSC, I thank Ms Dixon for the information in response to the previous speaker.  Obviously, she has her own independent advice, etc.  Does the nub of the issue come down to the interpretation of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005?  We all remember back then getting those white public services or social welfare cards.  I think I ended up with two by accident at one stage.  It was a requirement under that legislation - and I ask the witnesses to tell me if I am wrong because I am not legally qualified - to produce the card but it was not mandatory for anyone to get one.  Does the nub of the issue come down to how that legislation is interpreted versus our requirements under European law?</p></speech>

It states that a person shall produce his or her public services card if requested to do so.  The real nub of the issue is around the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection processing personal data where the necessity test has not been met.  Typically, under data protection law, for a government department, legislative underpinning will be an element of lawful basis, and there are certain provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, but it is not the only condition for lawful basis; the necessity for the processing also has to be borne out.  The issue, therefore, does in part centre on the subsection the Deputy has mentioned because under section 263(1), the Minister has an enabling power that allows her to issue a PSC.  What is at issue, looking at the analysis we have conducted, is that a number of provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act relate to social welfare benefit payments.  Under section 241, a person is required to satisfy the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection as to his or her identity when obtaining a benefit.  Section 242 sets out that there are two means by which identity can be satisfied, one of those being by means of the PSC.  In addition, section 247 sets out consequences of failing to satisfy the Minister in this regard.  There are, then, a range of provisions specific to social welfare payments that ultimately, on a fine balance, led us to a conclusion that the necessity for the processing regarding social welfare claimants is set down-----</p></speech>

My next question is to the most senior witness from the Department.  I do not know who that is but perhaps it is Mr. Fallon.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is independent but until next year the parent Department is the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is the parent relationship rather than funding and day-to-day matters.  Does the Department 100% accept the findings of the commissioner?</p></speech>

This is a requirement of GDPR, backed up by the relevant case law.  The Government, in consultation with the Attorney General, has obviously decided to challenge the findings of the commissioner's report, so I do not think this course of action is interpreted or meant to be interpreted as a criticism of the commissioner or her office or mandate.  What it points to is the importance and the need to get legal clarity on the findings of the report.</p></speech>

However, I can say that, in the context of my Department and on foot of the earlier discussions with Deputy Cullinane who raised the issue of how Departments are responding to the report, the public services card is not required in order for people to make a citizenship applications, that the relevant application forms have been amended to this effect and that our website is being updated.  We are responding to the report but this is all in the wider context of the interpretation of the application of data protection law and the Government's position as one of those stakeholders that come under its remit.</p></speech>

In layman's terms, for the benefit of the members of the public watching, who have taken a huge interest in this, and to expand on what Ms Dixon just said, was the feeling in the organisation that as the investigation evolved there was greater awareness or clarity among the Departments regarding the independent nature of the Data Protection Commissioner and the capacity of how her decision on this could impact?</p></speech>

I have to say that we were also somewhat surprised by the response to it.  We were conditioned to be surprised because it is an unusual reaction in terms of all of the entities we supervise.

That brings me to my second topic.  I have a genuine concern but in a positive way.  I admire and know the work that is necessary in terms of what the commission does.  However, in terms of the scale of its work into the future, and my third point will elevate what I am saying, a range of actions will be requested of the commission as a result of this finding.  While the commission's resources have increased over the years, will this be a issue?  As an outcome of all of this, that could be a positive development which may help the commission.  Will it be an issue in the year ahead?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#S00500"><p>To respond briefly, we have made a detailed submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform via the Department of Justice and Equality for budget 2020.  We believe we need to keep increasing our resources.  The increases we have made to date have reflected and absorbed the capacity reality and the reality of limitations of the recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service.  We have grown as quickly as we can and have been allocated a budget to do so but that cannot stop now because, as the Deputy correctly stated, the scale of the work we have to do is only going to increase.</p> <p>  There are a number of provisions in the GDPR that should assist us in terms of the scale of the work we have to do.  Accountability is required on the part of all organisations and accountability of those organisations directly to the public.  Data protection officers have now been appointed in 1,200 organisations in Ireland.  These should be assisting in raising the standards of data protection in those organisations.</p> <p>  There are many other areas of the GDPR, such as codes of conduct and joint operations, that remain to be fully unlocked and which will also drive compliance.  We will always have to take a risk-based approach and at the moment there are risks across a very significant number of areas that we are looking at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#S00600"><p>This is the last issue I will raise.  The Data Protection Commission received 4,113 complaints in 2018, which was a 56% increase on 2017.  This indicates that this is moving in a certain direction.  After the commission's findings it will require additional resources, and I support resourcing the commission's work.</p> <p>  With regard to the European Data Protection Board, the Data Protection Commission is the lead authority in a number of areas.  These include issues related to data involving all the multinational companies located here; the Privacy Shield agreement between the US and the EU; Article 47 of the EU charter and where one of them meets and the other or does not; the processing and transfer of data and the use of that data in the US; and the case the commission was involved in with Facebook and Mr. Max Schrems.  The Schrems case which, in terms of scale, has received worldwide attention.  I have deep concerns about the potential for other cases of similar scale given the geographical area the commission has to cover.  I share Ms Dixon's concerns but, while I would love to do so, we will not have time to get into data-specific issues.  I will, therefore, zone in on the position from a legal findings point of view into the future.  We have to look at organisational process, etc.  The Data Protection Commission is the lead European authority and has jurisdiction over various companies.  These cases can go on for years and can have dramatic impacts in our modern world.  I support the work the commission does but these cases can be highly costly.  Who picks up the tab for them?  Is it the Irish taxpayer or is it shared across Europe in all cases?  I have read the cost is shared but is that always the case?  Obviously, there is a lead cost given that we have such jurisdiction.  To open up a can of worms, if we lost one of these cases, who would pay?  Do we pay collectively or is there a potential issue for the Irish taxpayer?  This could be something to protect the commission into the future.  Ms Dixon might give some clarity on that whole area.</p></speech>

I will mention administrative fines before I turn to the Deputy's question, which is about the opposite costs.  Once the Irish Data Protection Commission, DPC, starts administering fines and sanctions, there has been a debate about whether all of that goes to the Irish Exchequer or whether it is shared across the EU member states.  It is our understanding that it goes to the Irish Exchequer.  Already, therefore, there is an opposite debate to the question the Deputy is raising as to whether it is fair, if Ireland supervises most of these big technology companies-----</p></speech>

That is an open question that has been raised a number of times.</p> <p>  Regarding the costs, it is well possible that the Irish taxpayer will end up, by virtue of these companies being headquartered here, incurring costs.  The Irish taxpayer has incurred costs already in the case the Deputy referenced that is before the Court of Justice of the European Union on transfers of data because it arose from a complaint by Max Schrems against Facebook Ireland.  Facebook Ireland being located here means that we are responsible.  However, under this co-operation and consistency mechanism that now operates around the one-stop shop in the EU, I have to circulate a draft decision on any of these cases that concern multinationals to my fellow EU data protection authorities.  If, ultimately, they have a different view that I cannot reconcile into my findings, I institute a dispute resolution mechanism before the European Data Protection Board and it may take over the decision-making.  If a company affected by that decision disagrees with it, it takes an annulment action to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  There would be a certain number of cases that may end up being taken out of Ireland's hands because of disagreement between data protection authorities.  The European Data Protection Board will then have to bear the cost of defending those cases before the Court of Justice.  Undoubtedly, the effect of having the multinationals headquartered in Ireland will give rise to costs for Ireland in terms of the supervision and enforcement of data protection law.</p></speech>

I know that there was a freedom of information response, from the Department, that said if the report was published it would "have a serious, adverse effect on the ability of the Government to manage the national economy and the financial interests of the State".

If the commission is really independent why would it be, when there is non-compliance within a specific period, and the commission relies on the Department to give permission to publish the report?  Is there an inadequacy there in terms of process that needs to be addressed?  Clearly, there is a public interest in this matter.</p></speech>

Now, under section 149 of the 2018 Act, we have a very broad power of publication, which includes publication in relation to any matters that we think are in the public interest.  Had we conducted this investigation under the 2018 Act we would have been capable of publishing it when we concluded the findings regardless of whether the Department wished to publish it or not.  The issue here is that we commenced this investigation in October 2017, pre-dating the 2018 Act and the 2018 Act does not stretch to cover, retrospectively, the publication of a report that was commenced.</p></speech>

That is because it is clear, in section 8 of the 2018 Act, that if we had commenced the investigation prior to the 2018 Act coming into force we have to complete it under the old Acts.  We had written to the Department to indicate that regarding the other areas that remain for examination around MyGov.ie - certain issues relating to the public sector data set, and the single customer review database, which we have a particularly interest in looking at - because we had not commenced the investigation work on those areas that a new investigation under the 2018 Act and GDPR would cover those, and that is still the plan.</p></speech>

The starting point is that we take a risk-based approach in terms of deciding where to allocate resources.  We look at the number of complaints around a certain type of processing that we might receive.  We may see media reports in relation to certain types of processing, particularly issues with multinationals that we may want to look into.</p> <p>  We look at the number of affected individuals of a particular processing operation.  So, for example, with the PSC, it clearly could affect every individual in the State because children's data is also processed, in the context of the PSC, given that they have been issued to individuals under the age of 18.  </p> <p>  We look at the potential nature of impacts on the rights and freedoms of the individuals whose data is being processed.  So could the data processing operations give rise to adverse impacts for individuals where decisions are being made about them in circumstances that are unfair and where they are not on notice in terms of the purposes of use of their data?  We bring to bear a range of factors in terms of the risk-based analysis.  We now have, under one of the deputy commissioners who is not here today, a process where we convene a committee within the DPC that looks at areas of high-risk, considers the realities of our resourcing, and makes decisions then on the areas that we will pursue for large-scale investigation.  </p></speech>

Is there any engagement or reporting mechanism where there are shortcomings in terms of legislation?  There is a balance of rights.  For example, one Department is rolling out CCTV that communities can take up.  One has got some ongoing dialogue with local authorities, for example, and I think it is around who is the data controller.</p><p>Clearly, we cannot have garda&iacute; everywhere.  In some locations, there is a desire to have CCTV.  It is a question of how it is handled.  I am using this as an example.  Does the commission have the ability to draw attention to changes that should be made to facilitate something that may involve a public good, but lacks legislative safeguards?</p></speech>

We have also examined the deployment of CCTV by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  One aspect of those 32 investigations is looking at section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides the legislative basis for CCTV for security purposes in public places.  A range of issues will fall out of those investigations.  The Data Protection Commission has a dedicated consultation team that can look at other areas.  All sorts of organisations seek formal and informal consultations with the commission.  If they have something that is at concept stage, they might run it by us to see what data protection issues might arise.  Equally, they might consult us on the detail of something that is more advanced.  In many instances, organisations are required to have a data protection officer who should be the first line of defence when new things are being implemented.  In cases like that referenced by the Deputy, they are required to conduct data protection impact assessments on a mandatory basis.  The type of analysis that takes place as part of a data protection impact assessment that is conducted properly will lead to the correct answers and outcomes.  We engage with organisations on data protection impact assessments.  They are conducting the issues that are arising.  In many cases, our consultation team is pointing to an absence in legislative underpinning for various concepts that are brought to us by public sector bodies.  We pre-empt those - they often do not proceed and nobody hears anything further about them.</p></speech>

The GDPR awareness campaigns certainly made people more aware of their rights.  It caught their imagination and showed them how they can exercise their rights.  People are taking an interest in data protection issues.  We certainly saw a surge after the publication of the public services card report, which we did not publish.  We see an increase in contacts with the office in such circumstances.  The case of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook last year also gave rise to a surge in complaints.  Those complaints were not necessarily about Facebook processing.  In general, the case brought attention to data protection issues.</p></speech>

It is never going to be a static figure.  As we take a risk-based approach, it depends on where we identify that issues are arising.  As new issues become apparent, we direct our resources to them.  We are at the beginning of the long process of driving up the standards of the application of data protection law across the Irish public sector.  The GDPR has been in application for approximately 15 months.  There is no doubt that the GDPR and the law enforcement directive are not yet fully bedded in.  A great deal of work remains to be done.  As the investigations conclude over the coming months, the gaps in the standards will start to become clearer.</p></speech>

In recent months, each time we have opened a new investigation, particularly into the big tech sector, we have issued a statement to that effect.  Clearly, there is global interest in those investigations and in the extent to which people want to be on notice.  The Deputy mentioned the investigation into the local authorities, which is already in the public domain.  We put it into the public domain that our resources are currently focused on this area.  We issue statements.  In our annual report, we preview areas that are under investigation.</p></speech>

The legislation specifically looks at the remit not necessarily of a legal entity but of the role of the people who decide the purposes and means of the data processing operation.  It is unlikely to be directly relevant to a data protection analysis that we would conduct.  The obligations on the controllers remain the same regardless of whether their funding is obtained through a Government grant or allocated from within their own resources.</p></speech>

The first thing that jumped out at me was that the Department had really made a pig's ear of it.  All one can see is the law being broken.</p> <p>  Ms Dixon said she had instructed the Minister to publish the report within seven days and that this had not been done.  It was done after four weeks.  Ms Dixon had also requested the Department to delete illegally retained data by 5 September - to my knowledge that has not been done - and to instruct other State agencies to stop processing data.  They have failed to do this and seem to be hell bent on continuing to ignore the report's findings.  Ms Dixon said the Data Protection Commission would have to fulfil further criteria in order to issue an enforcement notice.  In response to a parliamentary question the Minister said: "It should be noted that the findings in the DPC report do not have the force of law until such time as they are formalised in an enforcement notice."  Is it the case that the Department is working inside the law, or is it working outside the law as found in the report?</p></speech>

If it reads the provisions, the committee will see that we have identified that section 10A provides for the commission to deal with infringements of data protection law.  It is a matter for the Minister how she characterises the findings as a result of the statutory investigation which have been issued to the Department.  Section 10A also states the commission may issue an enforcement notice in order to force compliance with its findings.  The letter of 15 August has been published.  When we issued the report to the Department, we followed the approach we take with most organisations.  We deferred enforcement, pending the Department's voluntary compliance with the clear directions we had set out.  That is why it is now necessary to proceed - we reserved our right to do so - to enforcement action.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has also asked his Department to carry out a review of the criteria, especially as they apply to the Passport Office.  If the card will not be mandatory or compulsory in obtaining a passport and given that the T&aacute;naiste is perfectly fine with this, as is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, does Ms Dixon see this as vindication of the Data Protection Commissioner's report and its findings?</p></speech>

We have no insight into how that decision-making process arose.  It is important to point out that in the context of our report and the findings we have made, they are findings specifically against the controller of the data - the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The report is about the processing of personal data being conducted by that Department in the context of SAFE, level-2 standard, and the issuing of the public services card.  When Deputy Munster asks me about vindication, there has been no vindication of the findings in the response of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

In a way, it is easier if there is a single document that sets out what the plan is, what the objectives are, what outcome is expected as a result of a project and the associated costs.  If all of that is set out at the beginning, it makes my job much easier.  It also makes much easier the job of those who are trying to deliver the project such that they will know when they are or are not making progress.  It is a fundamental requirement for any public sector project that there be clarity on what one is trying to achieve.  When we examined the development and roll-out of the public services card project, we found pieces of what was being attempted laid out in various documents.</p><p>There were probably contradictions in some of them so we are looking for what the latest position is and how it is evolving.

Ms Dixon is a breath of fresh air and the straightforward manner in which she has answered questions today is a model for everybody who comes before us.</p> <p>  I want to look at the accounts, at rented buildings and at the amount of money going on consultancy fees.  The approach to the commission's report also has cost implications.  I am confused about the issue of enforcement.  Is it open to the Government to appeal the commission's findings at this point?  Does the commission take enforcement proceedings and the Government fights them in court? </p></speech>

It is fair to say the commission did not rush into this investigation, which has cost a lot of money.  The commission is to get back to us on the question of the money and it is vital that it itemises the costs as best it can.  In the annual reports to the Department every year, certain aspects were flagged.</p></speech>

There are transparency requirements in data protection legislation, whereby individuals should understand why their data are being collected, processed and retained, but these were not being fulfilled.

We had legislation in 2005 and there was a Government decision in 2013, which had implications.  The annual reports repeatedly pointed out concerns, though Ms Dixon's predecessor accepted that there might be some justification for a requirement for a card, or something similar, for social welfare purposes.  The commission did not object to this but teased the issues out to see what the implications were.  Each year, the implications became much more serious and this was all conveyed to the Department, one way or another.</p></speech>

I do not mean to zone in on any particular person but we are here to discuss value for money and the business case.  I was raised to believe the devil quotes scripture for his own purpose and we all now do that.  I see that a chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is being quoted <i>ad nauseam</i>, by me as well as others.  It is being done incorrectly, as it happens.  The Minister quoted it last night but she quoted arguments given by the Department and not the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General sensibly, clearly and in a moderate way stated that there was no one business plan at inception.  He said he believed it was very good and that it had good points and elements of good practice but that there were a number of omissions and partly addressed matters.  This report dates from September 2016 and it puts the reader on notice that there is no business case.</p><p>In terms of value for money, where is the business case?  The contract for &euro;3 million, to be rolled out by 2016, did not happen and it was way under that.  A new contract was entered into with advance payments to the company.  Lots of bodies come before us and we haul them over the coals for a business case, for a rationale for why something is necessary or to tell us the benefits of something.  If I accept Ms Dixon's report, the benefits are illusory, particularly in the area of making services available.  It was supposed to be an enabler but it has become an inhibitor.  It was supposed to make it easy for Departments to roll out their services but that has not happened.  Fraud is a minute factor and identity fraud is a minute part of overall fraud, yet errors are higher.  We are rolling out a project the costs of which were projected to be &euro;60 million by 2016, although nobody can tell me what they are now.</p></speech>

I have often made the point that public money is being wasted on rent, which is keeping market rents artificially high.  I do not expect Ms Dixon to have an answer to that, but that is where I am coming from.  I then see a perfect situation in which the commission is accommodated rent-free in a Government-owned building.  That is great.  Problems then arose and the organisation needed extra space.  I will come back to how that space was acquired.  Did the Office of Public Works look at any other building owned by Government or the OPW for the commission, rather than private accommodation?</p></speech>

It is for the OPW to say why it has not been able to secure a building suitable for our needs and in which all our Dublin-based staff could be located.  It says that, in part, it is because there have been very few suitable properties on the market that it can make available.  The other response I believe it would give is that the building requirements we have specified pose particular challenges.  The Deputy may be aware that at a data protection conference in Dublin just this week one of the presenters put up a very large photo of the office in Portarlington, which is located over a supermarket.  This photograph has been circulated globally with commentary to the effect that this is how seriously Ireland takes data protection.  As such, we have specified to the Office of Public Works that we ideally need a standalone building which is not co-located with Government Departments to reflect our independence.  We also ideally need a building that is located centrally in Dublin, near to the large entities we supervise.  We also ideally need a building that is not located over a supermarket or commercial premises that could be used against us.</p></speech>

I want to ask about legal costs awarded against the Data Protection Commission.  This is mentioned on page 17.  The accounts cover two periods; I am looking at the period from 25 May 2018 to the end of December 2018.  Legal costs awarded against the Data Protection Commission totalled &euro;445,401.  Will the commissioner explain those figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019092600002#X02900"><p>I will.  It is worth mentioning that the legal costs awarded against the Data Protection Commission in respect of cases coming to a conclusion in 2018 were exceptional.  The first very significant amount is that paid in costs to Max Schrems as a result of the judicial review he took in 2014 that gave rise to a reference case to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which was ultimately remitted back to the Irish High Court.  He was awarded his costs from that action because the Court of Justice of the European Union found that he had a valid complaint.  A cost demand of &euro;900,000 was submitted to the Data Protection Commission in respect of his estimate of costs.  We considered that to be excessive and hired a legal costs accountant who engaged in a taxation process and we succeeded in having the claim reduced to &euro;300,000.  Therefore, of the nearly half a million euro mentioned, &euro;300,000 relates to Max Schrems's costs arising from that particular case.  The other significant amount included relates to costs awarded to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter.  He took an appeal against a decision of the then commissioner in 2014 with regard to a case that involved the former Deputy, Mick Wallace.  He lost in the Circuit Court but appealed to the High Court, which took a different view from that of the Circuit Court.  Ultimately costs followed from the judgment of the High Court.  His costs were &euro;97,848.</p></speech>

The commission did not rush into this.  Finally, it was broadened out and the commission carried out a risk analysis.  Then came the investigation and all that ensued.  I have heard the argument that people have embraced this card and that there are no complaints at all about it.  I have heard that the Department has carried out fact-finding searches when in fact it has carried out market research to tell us that people are not objecting to this card at all.  I read most of the commissioner's report.  I would like the commissioner to elaborate on her point that this is not just about privacy.</p><p>Ms Dixon spoke about control and the predictability of information that belongs to me or any other individual, and about how that is managed and the degree of control I have over that.  Perhaps she could elaborate on that in light of the market research which the Minister and the Government are relying on to claim this is all a big fuss about nothing.</p></speech>

Is it definitive proof of address?  How can it be if someone has changed address since they completed SAFE 2 registration?  In fact, how a person is supposed to change their address is not clear from anything published on SAFE 2 and the public services card, PSC.</p> <p>  The other issue around foreseeability for individuals is that if it is not clear to an individual that procurement of a public services card is to be mandatory to make a school transport appeal, for example, then he or she may at a minimum endure significant inconvenience when he or she discovers at the last minute that this is now a requirement and must submit to having his or her personal data processed in this way.  There is a range of issues around transparency concerning what the card is or is not and what it represents proof of.  There are even issues with where the card can be presented as an ID card.  Section 263 of the Social Welfare Act 2005 provides that any entity which is not a specified body under the legislation cannot have the card presented to it.  There seems to be some evidence that individuals are using the card as an ID when they go to the credit union and are required to provide ID.  This is prohibited under the Social Welfare Act 2005.</p> <p>  There is a range of issues around foreseeability.  I raised a particular issue at paragraph 359 of the report.  There has been a lot of talk about how the card allows a "once and done" process.  However, paragraph 359 of the report outlines that if I engage with a specified body using my public services card and point out to the specified body that I have since changed address and it records that, I have absolutely no guarantee that the change of address will be transmitted back and recorded on the SAFE 2 register by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That does not represent a "once and done" process in those circumstances and it is not foreseeable which address is held by which public sector body.  We have identified a range of issues.</p></speech>

This is detailed in our second annual report from last year.  We invited that company to voluntarily comply with a very clear set of directions.  In that case, while not particularly pleased with our findings, the company did voluntarily comply.  We have supervised its compliance with those requirements.  It depends.

I see an awful lot of taxpayers&rsquo; money about to be wasted in court.  We legislated for the Data Protection Commission, DPC, to do a job.  It has done it.  We do not like the sound of it, however.  The language used in the correspondence sent to the DPC suggested it was a State agency and should get with the programme.  It suggested the Department is not happy with this and it will agree a set of terms and conditions but the law does not apply to it.  Collectively, the Oireachtas has made an entire mess of this card and now we have to clean it up.  Money is in short supply but we are going to waste millions of euro litigating about who is right and how the law should be interpreted.  That is tragic.</p> <p>  How much has come in with fines?</p></speech>

Most of our legal fees go on external support for the 24 live litigation cases in which we are involved.  There is also the Data Protection Commissioner versus Facebook and Max Schrems case, the standard contractual clauses case.  There will always be a need for external support because of the volume of litigation in which we are involved.</p> <p>  We would have to replicate a small law firm with legal support services in our office.  That would not represent an efficiency or value for money.  In terms of that high number of in-house legal practitioners, some are deployed internally as legal advisers horizontally across the organisation.  Others are deployed in actual investigator roles, meaning they have full-time roles in terms of the volumes we are dealing with in-house.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that in budget and employee number terms we are eighth, based on statistics from the European Data Protection Board.  It would be almost impossible to make a direct comparison as to how we compare.  As a data protection authority in the EU, we are almost unique in terms of the volume of litigation in which we are involved.  That is because the Data Protection Acts in Ireland have always provided a clear right of statutory appeal to any party affected by our decisions.  In other EU member states, that has not been the case.</p></speech>

We have had several protected disclosures made to us from outside.  In general, most of them have been in fact complaints by individuals within organisations about how personal data has been processed.  In many of the cases, we have agreed with the individual to examine the complaint on its merits.  We have then discussed with them whether we can process the complaint in circumstances where they would have wanted to remain anonymous.  The statistics for 2019 are five received, three closed, one under investigation and one under assessment.  In 2018, five received, four closed and one still being investigated.  We have statistics going back to 2015 if the Deputy wants them.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for the delegates, whom I thank for their presentation.  First, however, I wish to clarify a matter for the public record.  We are often accused of being a little mischievous in who we call in, the idea being that we want to get headlines in the newspapers.  That is not the case.  The request to the delegates to appear before the committee was issued to them last July, well before the events of later in the summer.  Issues relating to the public services card were raised at previous meetings of the committee, which led to my request for a meeting with the delegates.  One of those issues concerned the large social media companies registered in Ireland within an EU context, and the role of the Irish Data Protection Commission, not just in an Irish and European context but also in a worldwide context.  It is a relatively small office which has been getting larger as the years go by.  As such, my concern is whether there is the scope, ability and resources within the organisation to deal with its new responsibilities.  That was my motivation as Chairman in inviting the delegates to appear before the committee.  Other issues have arisen in the meantime, and I understand why they have taken up most of our discussion time.  That discussion has been useful in giving us a good insight into the commission's growing role and importance.</p> <p>  Will Ms Dixon indicate who collects the fines that are issued by the commission and were issued by its predecessor, and where those moneys go?</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. Geoghegan, is working to ensure that the appropriate bank accounts and logistical arrangements for the collection of the fines are in place in advance of our imposing the first administrative fine.  From there, the fines are remitted back to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

In his reply on 2 April 2019, the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated that in 2014, the Data Protection Commission prosecuted fines through the courts totalling &euro;25,000, all of which was collected.  In 2015, just one company was fined &euro;2,000, which was collected in full.  In 2016, ten companies and one company director were prosecuted, with total fines of &euro;16,600 issued, of which &euro;7,500 was still outstanding in April this year.  In 2017, seven companies and one company director were prosecuted, with fines totalling &euro;24,000 and an amount outstanding at the end of April of &euro;20,000.  In 2018, the fines imposed totalled &euro;6,000 and the amount outstanding in April 2019 was &euro;3,040.  I was interested to see the figures for moneys not collected.  Ms Dixon has confirmed that the loss is not to her office but to the Central Fund and, therefore, the taxpayer.  The amounts involved are not large at this stage, but there was mention earlier of a figure of &euro;1 million.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the Courts Service to collect them.  The prospective process we are discussing in terms of fines under the GDPR is a different process, and those fines will be imposed by the Data Protection Commission and collected by us, albeit the courts will confirm the fines.  There are two different processes at issue.</p></speech>

As I clarified earlier, we issued the final report on 15 August, together with a clear letter stating that, as in other cases, we were deferring enforcement and inviting the Department to comply voluntarily with the clear set of directions.  There is no question mark about something not being ready; it simply was not the process that was followed.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether it is routine to outline findings without having an enforcement notice ready, to which the answer is that it absolutely is routine.  We do not anticipate litigation in respect of every decision we make.  The Deputy asked for previous examples of the same thing happening.  I referred earlier to the case of Yahoo! EMEA Limited in June 2018, where we issued details of our findings in respect of a detailed investigation similar to the one we undertook in the case we are discussing today.  In the Yahoo! EMEA Limited case, we invited and received the company's voluntary compliance, thereby negating the need to move to an enforcement action.  There is nothing unusual in terms of the process we followed in the case we are discussing.</p></speech>

One of the commission's main findings related to information being held for longer than was necessary.  People lose cards all the time.  Surely if the information is in the system for a year, two years or three years, it makes it easy for a card to be reprinted?  There is a value there for the body holding the information.  Does Ms Dixon understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

The information that is at issue in terms of our finding relates to supporting documentation that is collected as part of the SAFE 2 registration process.</p></speech>

Although many people have a public services card, others, including myself, have not had a requirement to obtain one.  Perhaps I will do so when I renew my driver's licence.  Will Ms Dixon explain the process for those who have not applied for a card?  It is not her job to do so, but it would be helpful.</p></speech>

We talk all the time about the public services card but what really is of significance is that behind the card is a registration system that is administered for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is a system which requires individuals to attend an Intreo office for a face-to-face interview, to which they must bring copies of identification documents such as a passport or driver's licence, documents demonstrating proof of address and other documentation.</p></speech>

Our findings relate to the indefinite and blanket storing of all the supporting documentation.  The legislation sets out that the Minister cannot issue a public services card until she is satisfied as to identity.  Once the requirements to satisfy identity have been met, there is a question mark over the necessity of retaining all the supporting documentation, particularly in circumstances where, as Deputy Connolly outlined, there is a requirement to renew the card every seven years.  However, it is proposed by the Department, despite the fact that further documentation is required to renew the card, that the existing documentation would be retained.  Evidence simply was not produced by the Department to demonstrate a necessity to retain the documentation.  Equally, the issue of whether the address at which one first registered is still the valid address arises in the ongoing accumulation of all the supporting documentation.</p></speech>

To paraphrase Ms Dixon, it is unnecessary for the card to have a chip if no one uses it, and she is against collecting unnecessary information or data.  Is the chip an unnecessary component, given that nobody seems to have a plan to use it?  We were told years ago the intention was to futureproof the card but there is no sign of that proof being required, or is there?  Is the commission dealing with that issue?</p></speech>

I will give Ms Dixon a little warning.  The record of the Office of Public Works, OPW, in moving public bodies is not as good as its people will claim.  Every time it moves a public body, there is grief involved.  The moves are not properly planned.  The Department of Health was moved to Baggot Street and the measurements in the building were wrong.  There were arguments about staff, open space and all sorts of matters.  The final cost for the life of the lease remains to be determined.  The OPW did not get it right.  It came to Leinster House to work on a project in the building.  While we acknowledge that it is an historic building, the cost rose.  Representatives from the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, appeared before the committee last year and I draw a parallel between it and the DPC.  They stated the TAC had nothing but grief from the OPW during their office's move.  We have yet to invite an organisation to appear before the committee that has stated the OPW efficiently managed a transition to a new office.  I hope the DPC will be the first but we have not yet heard.</p></speech>

Everyone says that the OPW is wonderful but it is not.  We have not found it to be.  Whoever manages the project on the DPC's side should not believe everything he or she is told.  He or she should double-check because we have found organisations indicating that they experienced a great deal of grief.  That is a general comment for our guests from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform more than anything else.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance published legislation concerning the TAC this week to increase the number of commissioners from one to two.  When the TAC was being set up as a new body, the Department did not adequately project its work programme.  It was under-resourced, therefore, from year one, and there have been backlogs and delays.  The backlogs continue and the Department is beginning to increase the commission's resources to a reasonable level.  I am worried the same will happen in the case of the DPC.  I make these remarks as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to the senior personnel throughout the public service.  When a new body is set up, the mere setting-up of the body will attract business.  That the DPC exists, that it has a new office, that it has received great prominence and that it has issued the report will, in itself, increase public awareness and bring more cases.  The public sector has never adequately projected an increase in such activity.  I hope the increase in resources the DPC seeks will meet the demand next year and in the following years.  We might find that an additional &euro;5 million is sufficient but events might take over and it could be well short of the mark.  My advice is that the DPC should be cautious because other public bodies have struggled with resources in the early stages of their lifespan.</p> <p>  As a Deputy, I represent Portarlington in County Laois.  How many members of DPC staff are based in the Portarlington office and what is the plan for it?  The commission was based there primarily.  Will Ms Dixon outline the accommodation plans for the commission?</p></speech>

The number certainly has not decreased and, in fact, it hit a spike two years ago.  We have a leased building in Portarlington.  The lease was taken out by the OPW and is for 20 years.  The rent is paid by the OPW and not recouped from us.  The lease will expire on 30 November 2026.  We have had a number of works carried out on the office over the years.  This year, in particular, a little later than one would have hoped, there was a repainting of the front of the building to reflect the name of the Data Protection Commission as opposed to that of the Data Protection Commissioner, and that has been completed.  The plans for the office are that it is business as usual.  The staff are a critical part of our infrastructure and team.  Experts in the office have been with the data protection authority in Ireland for close to 14 years.  We rely heavily, therefore, on their expertise and corporate memory.</p></speech>

It is ultimately in the form of an investigation but involved an audit element.  It is probably a technicality that we do not need to dwell on.  Those investigations in respect of the local authorities are in relation to what we call surveillance technologies.  We are looking at CCTV systems, automatic number plate recognition systems and any drones or body-worn cameras that are being deployed by the local authorities, and looking at whether they are in compliance with the data protection legislation and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act if required, in particular section 38 of that Act.</p></speech>

I got the impression from what Mr. Fallon said earlier that if there is a difference, the courts can adjudicate, although he did it not put in those words.

In that instance, that process has been commenced in regard to a particular Department and the public services card.  Within that legislation, there are certain safeguards and options for parties who are subjected to such proceedings.  They are now in play and part of the statutory process for dealing with these matters.  We have established a statutory process to deal with such matters and that statutory process is now taking place.</p></speech>

The European Commission also participates and the European Data Protection Supervisor is also a member.  The Irish Data Protection Commission is a member and a part of the European Data Protection Board.  It is a decision-making body.  It has a limited role in making decisions in certain circumstances that are set down under the GDPR.  Its primary purpose is to promote a harmonised implementation of the GDPR across the EU.  We do that, as a board, by issuing agreed guidance on concepts under data protection legislation, concepts regarding transparency, consent and so on.</p> <p>  In terms of specific cases and investigations, the European Data Protection Board has a particular role in the co-operation and consistency mechanism, and the dispute resolution mechanisms between data protection authorities.  As a board, we have rules of procedure that we have agreed between us.  The GDPR provides for the appointment of a chair to the board and the chair is the head of a national data protection authority, voted on by the members of the European Data Protection Board.  The commissioner for Austria is the current chair of the European Data Protection Board.  We meet in plenary form on a monthly basis in Brussels, typically a full two-day meeting each month.

As of April this year the Irish Data Protection Commission requested a standing slot on the agenda of the European Data Protection Board, EDPB, meetings where we could proactively provide an update in respect of the "big tech" cases that we are handling and the progress on them and any issues that are arising in terms of co-operation procedures between the data protection authorities around these investigations.  By that, I am referring in part to that IMI IT platform that we use to share details on cases between us.</p> <p>  A number of issues have arisen for us as a board in the first year in terms of complaints that have been lodged with a data protection authority in an EU member state that then have to be transmitted to the Irish DPC for investigation.  There have been issues in terms of translation of the complaints and timeframes involved in transmitting the case to the Irish Data Protection Commission.  In those cases, we are obliged to communicate with the complainant back through the originating data protection authority.  We have a journey to go as a board in terms of smoothing out all of those handoffs that have now become part of the process.</p> <p>  Issues have also arisen in the first year around different administrative law procedure in the different EU member states.  While we are conducting an investigation, we would never release full information on the investigation while it is under investigation, and the transparency rules in other member states and their administrative laws have different procedures that impact on those issues.</p> <p>  We are very active members of the European Data Protection Board.  We have led as rapporteur on some of the big guidance projects that the EDPB has undertaken in terms of publishing guidance.  Ultimately when we complete the decision-making process on these investigations we have under way - I mentioned earlier that under Article 60 of the GDPR I cannot finalise a decision on my own; I must transmit it as a draft and allow every other EU data protection authority that is concerned with the issue give input.  Any of those data protection authorities or a multiple of them can raise what is called a relevant and reasoned objection to any part of my draft decision.  I am then obliged to try to reconcile what they raise with me as an objection with my findings.  Ultimately if I cannot, under Article 65 of the GDPR I then institute the dispute resolution mechanism of the European Data Protection Board.  This is the area where it has a decision-making function.  It first of all decides if it is a relevant and reasoned objection that has been raised with me and, second, it may opt to take over the decision-making in respect of the-----</p></speech>

However, if the Irish DPC has to take a prosecution against one of the major social media companies, does it have to carry the cost of that?  There could be a benefit for all EU citizens.  I saw a case reported yesterday where Ms Dixon's colleague in France had a case against Facebook about the right to be forgotten.  There are two sides to it.  First, it succeeded but it only applied in the EU and the court had no jurisdiction on the right to be forgotten outside the EU.  That is a benefit to all EU citizens.  Did the French data protection commission carry the cost of that for the benefit of all EU citizens?  Would Ms Dixon have been aware of that?  Based on what she said, if it was going to take a case and make a decision, she had to be consulted on that, be made aware of it and either object or not object.  Given that Facebook is headquartered in Ireland, why was that case taken by France.</p></speech>

The Chairman has hit on what is a very complex issue - the issue of the French authority's action in respect of Google.  Under the GDPR the one-stop shop is a benefit to multinationals and it is designed as a benefit.  Ultimately, they are subject to one decision by one enforcer and there is one appeal that can be taken and one fine ultimately.  If they are not availing of the one-stop shop where they are supervised by one authority, they are, per the previous regime, subject to the jurisdiction of every individual data protection authority where they are supplying services.</p> <p>  The one-stop shop is a benefit and there are conditions that organisations have to meet in order to avail of that benefit.  One of the specific conditions is that the data controller must be EU territorially based to avail of the one-stop shop.  At the time that the French authority investigated Google, its controllership was not located territorially in Ireland or the EU.  Google could have been investigated and subject to sanctions by any of the data protection authorities in the EU.  As it was, the French data protection authority conducted an investigation.</p> <p>  Sorry, the case the Chairman is referring to, the right to be forgotten case, predates the GDPR completely so there was no one-stop shop applicable at that time.</p></speech>

I cannot ask Ms Dixon to comment on the Department's response, on which we will have a significant number of questions to put to its officials.</p> <p>  Ms Dixon may be surprised by two other issues.  She mentioned the travel pass a few times and perhaps she will tell me if I am right or wrong on this issue.  Deputies meet constituents with different problems.  I met a person who is a carer and had the travel pass as part of the social welfare card, which they could present to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to travel to and from Dublin or as the case may be.  A point came when this person was no longer a carer and was, by right, no longer entitled to use the card.  The card still worked for free travel, however.  Four or five months later, the person got a bill from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for &euro;1,048 along with a list of all of the dates on which the card had been used since the point at which, in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's opinion, the person was no longer deemed to be a carer.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann used the public services card to collect information on the number of rail trips the person made.  One day the person arrived in Heuston Station and could not pass through the gate because Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had obviously been in touch with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

I understand Ms Dixon said the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2015 was very hard to follow and unclear.  She was critical on the basis that it was not clear how the whole system worked.  She was accused of using pejorative and sensationalist language.  I will make one point in her defence on that issue.  We had a special debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday on the public services card.  The card was introduced in the 2005 Act.  Section 263 has been amended six times in three different pieces of primary legislation.  A further provision on which the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection relies in relation to the public services card project is section 241, which has been amended 28 times by 11 different enactments.  This demonstrates, from a legislative point of view, a lack of consolidation.  We have here a provision that has been amended 30 or 40 times, including every year in the Social Welfare Act.  The legislation that underpins the public services card has been amended at least 50 times.  How could any reasonable citizen be expected to know what legislation he or she is looking at?  The commissioner's criticism was, therefore, very valid.  It applies to social protection legislation because it is not consolidated often enough but probably also applies to many other public bodies for which legislation is repeatedly amended.  How could anyone find their way back through the 50 different amendments? </p> <p>  This discussion has been nice and rosy so far.  However, it would be remiss of me not to voice the numerous complaints people have made since the introduction of GDPR.  I know GDPR is needed for good reason but citizens are being strangled by it.  GDPR is designed to help citizens and I will give one example of how the legislation the Data Protection Commission is enforcing works on the ground.  I have umpteen examples but I will give this example because it arose last weekend.  There is an old couple who live in my constituency.  The husband, who is 96 years of age, is deaf, has dementia and is confined to bed.  His wife is 86 years of age and is not faring much better.  They live on their own and use a community alert device operated via their landline to buzz if something happens.  Lightning knocked out their telephone last Friday night.  When a carer phoned Eir on her mobile phone from the couple's home she was told the provider could not speak to her as she was not the account holder.  The woman of the house then spoke but was told that as she was not the account holder, she could not speak on her husband's behalf.  Her husband is deaf and cannot speak on the phone.  The 85-year old woman was then told that if the couple changed the account on the website from the husband's name into the wife's name, the company would speak to the woman.  The husband and wife are both bedridden.  I got on the case and I have been involved in identical cases.</p> <p>  I will give another example involving another good neighbour.  Every Deputy can recite a litany of these cases.  The Data Protection Commission gets flak on this one issue from many people.  People may or may not agree with some of what is going on.  The second case involves an old person living in an isolated area.  The landline went down and because there is no mobile signal where the person lives, they could not make a mobile call.  A good neighbour who visits every day volunteered to ring on the old person's behalf but the provider would not speak with the neighbour as this person is not the account holder.  Does Ms Dixon accept that in extreme cases the legislation can, when implemented as the commission intended, cause enormous personal hardship in a many cases?  Does she understand my point?</p></speech>

The GDPR, as I said earlier, requires organisations to be accountable, to conduct their own risk assessments, to implement identity verification procedures that are proportionate to the risks in terms of why identity is being verified, very similar to the public services card issues that we have to discuss, and to ensure that they have means by which people with disabilities can be accommodated in any of those processes.  Those telcos do not represent the views of the Data Protection Commission in terms of how they are implementing in those cases.</p> <p>  We are aware of those very specific cases.  I mentioned earlier, in response to Deputy Connolly, that the most complained of sectors per our 2018 report are telcos and banks.  In respect of telcos, my colleague, John O'Dwyer, recently had a meeting on site with ComReg about this very issue of how identity verification is being delivered and how people with disabilities can be accommodated.  We gave ComReg a range of solutions that should not put people in the kind of circumstances that the Chairman outlined today.</p></speech>

They say we have gone mad when we are down to such a situation.  It stems from GDPR and perhaps it is not being implemented properly.  When it is not implemented properly it can damage the good name of GDPR and what GDPR is trying to achieve.  The commissioner understand the point.  I ask the Data Protection Commission to send us a note on what its guidance to these telephone companies is because ourselves, the Data Protection Commission, ComReg or some other body should put this up there in order that people are aware there should be ways to do this.  Maybe these telephone companies should be told to make sure they have these procedures in place.  It is not that these companies are subcontracting agencies just to handle phone calls but it might not be employees who are dealing with it.  The witnesses understand what the difficulties are with the chain of who is responsible for answering the phone to their customers.  People should be fully aware of that.  A bit of education is probably required in some of these companies.</p></speech>

As one of the members said earlier, we have witnesses who come here and are helpful, up front and straight and the witnesses from the Data Protection Commission have been among those.  We have other witnesses who come in and try not to be as upfront and that is obvious to the public.  It is good for public bodies when people see public officials being so open, straight and upfront.  We appreciate that and we appreciate the work of the Data Protection Commission.

Today we are delighted to hear from the Integrated Education Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education on their work.  This work earned them a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2019 and I know members will be very keen to hear about the positive contributions that they are making.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their phones or turn them on airplane mode as it interferes with the sound and broadcasting system, even when on silent.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I welcome Ms Roisin Marshall, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, Ms Amanda McNamee, principal, Lagan College, Ms Hilary Copeland, chair of trustees, Integrated AlumNI, and Mr. Sam Fitzsimmons, head of communications, Integrated Education Fund.</p></speech>

Members will be aware that the Integrated Education Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019.  We appreciate the committee seeing us in this context and for the support that Deputies and Senators have given us over a long number of years, support which we hope will continue.</p> <p>  The Nobel Peace Prize nomination is, of course, not for our two organisations as much as for those courageous, resilient and visionary parents, pupils, staff and governors of integrated schools and, in particular, the first 28 pupils who attended Lagan College.  The current principal of that school is with us this afternoon.  In the statement the committee makes after this meeting, we would be very appreciative if it acknowledged the Nobel Peace Prize nomination and the recognition this bestows on all our pioneering families, staff and governors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roisin Marshall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019092600002#B00300"><p>I will give a brief overview of Integrated Education and how it has developed over the past 38 years.  Founded in 1981 by a group of parents in response to the challenge of community conflict and a religiously divided school system in Northern Ireland, Lagan College was the first integrated school in Northern Ireland.  Beginning with just 28 pupils, Lagan College is now the most oversubscribed school in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  By 1987 there were seven newly established integrated schools and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, NICIE, was formed as a charitable organisation to co-ordinate efforts to develop integrated education and to support parent groups through the process of opening new schools.  The 1989 Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order enabled NICIE to support existing schools to grow and to promote integrated education. </p> <p>  In 1992 the Integrated Education Fund, IEF, was established as a charity to provide a financial foundation for the development and growth of integrated education in Northern Ireland.  The IEF mandate is derived from the expressed demand of parents and individual schools who seek integrated education for their children and pupils.</p> <p>  In 2014, there was a landmark High Court judgment which compelled the Department of Education in Northern Ireland to fulfil its legal duty under article 64 of the 1989 Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order and the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;to facilitate and encourage integrated education&rdquo;.  Not only did the judgment rule that the Department needs to be alive to its article 64 duty at all levels, including the strategic level, but it also outlined what an integrated school is striving for, namely &ldquo;to achieve an equal balance in relation to worship, celebration and exposure to both faiths &hellip; reflected in its constitution &hellip; and the [school&rsquo;s] board must strive in its ethos to achieve this&rdquo;.  For these reasons, an integrated school seeks to achieve religious balance among its pupils and its board of governors.</p> <p>  Since then the Department of Education has recognised its legal duty and agreed more than 25 school development proposals, DPs, providing in excess of 1,500 additional places in integrated schools in recent years.</p><p>This growth has been further enhanced by the Stormont House Agreement and Fresh Start agreement capital commitment of &pound;300 million to 23 existing integrated schools, of which three capital projects have been completed and one is under way, with the rest due to be completed by 2025.<br/><br/>In terms of community and parental empowerment, no integrated school has ever been planned by the Government, yet despite this there are now more than 24,000 pupils attending 65 integrated schools, and demand for integrated school places continues to grow.  The funding crisis in the overall education system means that the focus for growing the number of integrated schools and school places is on supporting existing schools in transforming from non-integrated to integrated status rather than on building more new schools.<br/><br/>To support and fulfil the wishes of parents for integrated education, the IEF has raised money from a range of funders, including individual donors and trusts, to help empower parents seeking to transform their children's schools.  This parental engagement campaign was launched in 2017.  The IEF and NICIE acknowledge and thank the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its support for this initiative and its ongoing commitment over the past 15 years to NICIE and the IEF in supporting integrated education through its reconciliation fund.<br/><br/>The parental engagement campaign uses a range of tools, including a dedicated website - <i>www.integratemyschool.com</i>- to encourage parents to register their support for their school to transform to integrated status.  This bottom-up approach is also supported through outreach and direct engagement with parents, communities and schools.  The success of this campaign is highlighted in a survey by the polling company LucidTalk, which shows that awareness of the process of transformation rose from 8% in 2012 to over 40% in 2018.<br/><br/>NICIE continues to provide practical support to encourage schools to take this step and then works with them through the process, which can take up to two or three years.  In the past 40 years, we have had 20 schools transform.  Since the launch of the parental engagement campaign in 2017, we have had six more schools taking the first steps on the journey towards integrated status by holding successful parental ballots on transformation.</p></speech>

This is most notable in the largely separate nature of our education provision, which means that the majority of our children and young people of school age continue to be educated within a single-identity setting.  Approximately 90% of pupils in Northern Ireland are educated in schools that identify with a single tradition or denomination.  Only 7.2% of pupils in controlled schools are Catholic and 1.1% of pupils in Catholic-maintained schools are Protestant.</p> <p>  The collapse of the Assembly has presented challenges in growing integrated education, but it has also provided an opportunity for the integrated education movement to engage with politicians, educational stakeholders and academics to look at a way forward and seek agreement on an independent commission to review education.  The IEF's alternative manifesto sets out a roadmap for a more inclusive and integrated education system, and our collaboration with academics in the Ulster University school of education provides robust evidence-based research that is helping to cast a light on some of the areas of education that contribute to school separation and additional costs.  An example of this work can be seen in the briefing paper, Employment Mobility of Teachers and the FETO Exception, which we have supplied to the committee.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms McNamee to provide a little bit of background of integration in practice.</p></speech>

I have the proud role of being principal of Lagan College in south Belfast.  I am having a lovely day out in Dublin.</p> <p>  As Ms Marshall stated, Lagan College is Northern Ireland's first integrated post-primary school.  It was founded in 1981 against the setting of the Troubles.  We started off very small with 28 students - 14 children of Catholic faith and 14 of Protestant faith.  The school was originally housed in south Belfast beside the River Lagan, hence its name.  Over the years, it has flourished.  We now have 1,386 students from the ages of 11 to 18 years and 191 staff.  We are an integrated, inclusive and united community on a beautiful National Trust site.</p> <p>  The school was established by parents with the mission statement: "To educate to the highest standards the [children] of Catholics, Protestants [and other faith traditions and none] and of all abilities, together."  The four central values that underpin our school are respect, reconciliation, service and equality.  The children are educated together every day.  Self-respect and respect for others are strongly encouraged.  The integrated ethos is taught and shared to ensure the inclusion of children from different religions, cultures, genders, abilities, socio-economic backgrounds, sexualities, preschool needs and special needs as well as children of newcomer status and looked after children.  Anyone is welcome in our school.</p> <p>  Lagan College serves to celebrate all that we have in common and to encourage the children to understand that we must appreciate the things that make us different and unique as individuals.  Our school chaplains state that if something is important to one of us, it should be important to all of us.  Therefore, everything we do we do as one school community.  We hold prayer, if that is the child's choice, together or we take time to reflect on things that are happening locally and in the world.  We have assemblies, such as Remembrance Day assembly and Ash Wednesday assembly, together and we encourage our children to discuss controversial issues rather than shy away from them.</p> <p>  Over 38 years, Lagan College has built up a reputation for integrated practice, academic excellence and pastoral child-centred care.  Lagan College is an all-ability school as well as a family school, in that we can take all of the children from the same family.  We offer 32 GCSE and 25 A level courses at post-16 level.  Aspects of the curriculum, such as religious education, RE, politics and history, are viewed by children through a shared lens.  The learning that we offer is fun, innovative and challenging so that every child can reach his or her true potential.</p> <p>  I have been told by the children to mention our sport.  We play sport for enjoyment, to build team spirit and to win.  We have been the all-Ireland basketball champions.  Last year, we won the JJ Riley Cup in Gaelic football, which the boys were really proud of, and we have a strong reputation in other sports, for example, football, hockey, netball and rugby.</p> <p>  Lagan College has been in a strong position and we have been supported by our local community.  We have been the most oversubscribed school for the past decade, with 554 applications for 220 places this year alone.  As principal of Lagan College in south Belfast, I believe that there is a greater demand that we as a school can meet.  I call passionately upon all of those in government to support integrated schools as the norm for families to be able to choose if they wish.  We are educating children not only for their own futures and career pathways, but to be the peace leaders of all our futures.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for having me.</p></speech>

I will speak to it from the perspective as a past pupil of integrated education.  Like many other alumni, I got involved in setting up the Integrated AlumNI in 2013.  A number of former pupils of integrated schools who now live and work in various locations throughout the UK, Ireland and the US came together to offer us a social network group and a way to connect, to help support and encourage present pupils at integrated colleges through mentoring, career advice and helping to raise their aspirations, to spread the message about integrated education, and to lobby and campaign.</p> <p>  I will tell the committee a little about when I first went to an integrated school.  The school I attended is called New-Bridge Integrated College and is situated approximately 40 minutes south of Belfast and 40 minutes north of the Border.  When I started there at 11 years of age, the school was in the third year of its existence.  There had been a long delay in the development of the school site in 1995 in the rural, small village of Loughbrickland in County Down.  The delay owed to the fact that, after the site was finally secured, the farmer who owned the field would only permit building work to commence once his harvest had been taken in.</p><p>By the time I started school in 1997, there were 156 pupils in the student body, which could easily have fitted into one of the committee rooms.  During my time at New-Bridge, there were no illustrious past pupils to return and speak at assemblies and prize days because nobody had yet graduated.  In 1997, when I was 11 and starting secondary school, none of the issues happening around me, in the mouth of the Good Friday Agreement to be signed the following year, was a factor for me.  I was not aware of what was going on or what the adults around me were deciding about my future.  I knew that my parents had let me do what I wanted, namely, go to New-Bridge.  Although I was academically able and had secured a place at a grammar school, they were happy for me to attend a school that did not have any academic attainment record, past pupils or an established reputation.</p><p> When I look back now as an adult, I think about how brave we all were to take such a great leap of faith on an unfinished school that, weeks previously, had been a field, at a time when our country seemed to have little faith in the notions of peace and co-operation.  Twenty years later, I am proud we all had faith in the experiment.  In particular, I think of the staff who left permanent positions at other schools to come, take part, build and establish a new place for us all, and of how hard we all worked, because we wanted to make it work.  We were very much united in a confident belief that the model of education, despite its apparently humble beginnings and despite us knowing we were in the minority, would build a better future for us all.</p><p> When I started working as an adult, I lived in Scotland for a while and then moved back to work in arts management in Belfast.  It was clear to me then, when I worked with others who had attended school in Northern Ireland, that their experience of school had been different from mine and that was when I started to realise what that had meant to me.  I learned that learning, working and making friends with all kinds of people who could talk about our differences and joke about the same matters about which we saw the rest of our country fight was a normal part of our education.  It was just school to us.  I became aware that for most children in Northern Ireland, their experience of school is not at all the same, and we in the Integrated AlumNI believed we could change that.</p></speech>

We are confident a more integrated education system should be at the heart of the reconciliation process, as reflected in the Good Friday Agreement, which states "An essential aspect of the reconciliation process is the promotion of a culture of tolerance at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage integrated education and mixed housing."</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to appear before it and to give some background on integrated education.</p></speech>

I very much wanted to attend the meeting and wish I could stay for the whole afternoon because I am very interested in the subject matter.  When I attended a social event in the North approximately a month ago, I met a teacher from an integrated school.  I am ashamed to say I had not even been aware that integrated schools existed there.  When I heard our guests' contributions, I thought we needed to learn about the subject.  I congratulate our guests on their Nobel Peace Prize, which is a fantastic achievement.</p></speech>

I always like to think ahead.  Our guests will win the prize and there is no doubt they deserve it.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by how integrated education works.  It is powerful to think there are so many cross-community students in the school, although I have no doubt some issues must arise there.  Are there times when there could be problems between groups from two different communities?  How is such a problem managed?  Perhaps it is just my ignorance, but do our guests find that in sport, for example, if one group plays GAA whereas another group plays rugby or football, there is any separation between them, and if so, how is that managed?  </p></speech>

My background is as a primary school teacher for 35 years before I was elected to the House. I worked in a small primary school where we embraced the integration of boys and girls, first, and of disability, second.  The benefit from that, in the influence on all children and adults, not least in the disability sector, spoke for itself.  Like Senator Black, I wish our guests well in their nomination.  As somebody who does not live too far from Loughbrickland, I did not even know of the existence of the school.  I wish it and Lagan College every success.</p> <p>  Both presentations related to secondary school.  Is there integration at primary level in the North?  My philosophy is that everybody should have respect for everybody else's view of the world.  Senator Black mentioned various sporting activities.  There is currently a debate on whether the national anthem or otherwise should be played at rugby matches and so on.  I am especially interested in whether there is integration of language.  In some of my visits to the North related to this committee, we have visited all-Irish schools, which I support as a Gaeilgeoir.  Is there an issue with teaching various languages or with sport?  Do students get the opportunity to engage with and learn about other people's customs and - dare I say it - religion?  One does not have to be religious but there may be integration on the rugby, soccer or Gaelic pitch.</p> <p>  I presume that the opposite of integration is segregation, of which we had too much in the past.  It is not just an issue in the North but it also needs to be addressed throughout the nation in order that people will have a respectful view of the world.  I am delighted that our guests made their presentations and wish them all in their future.  </p></speech>

Not all those young people have attended an integrated primary school and, therefore, when the children start secondary school, we have to make very clear the ethos and values of the school.  Many of the children will have held many similar values through family life, having been raised by their families before coming to school, but we cannot take for granted that the children will know how to learn from and respect one another.  That has to be helped and supported.  We take from the Latin motto, <i>Ut Sint Unum</i>, that we are one school community.  We tend to use sport as a great analogy for people forming a team and working together.  Much of that is built and shaped by us as teachers and non-teachers to help the children understand who they are.  There is often a misconception that integrated schools are sterile communities and that children's culture and faith background, family politics, passport and so on are cleansed out.</p><p>It is quite the contrary.  We are proud of children saying what passport they hold and whether they support teams playing Gaelic games, rugby or soccer.  We want to generate healthy discussions in our children and they should not be shy about it.  We have not had a problem in Lagan College encouraging children of different backgrounds to engage in sport.  Some of our best enrichment rugby players play Gaelic games and <i>vice versa</i>.  The children enjoy learning about something that they may not have had a chance to learn about in earlier years.  We support the children in having access to things they may not have had a chance to experience in primary school.<br/><br/>As far as language is concerned, my school works through the medium of English but every young person who comes to the school gets the opportunity to have enrichment Irish in their first year.  We tend to look at the lovely aspects of poetry, prose, song and cultural placenames just to give the children understanding of where the school is situated in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the North of Ireland or whatever way the children want to see themselves.  It is about where their home is situated.  Beyond their first year at Lagan College, children may choose to do Spanish, French, Irish right through to A level or the likes of Mandarin, which is new for us.</p></speech>

If so, how were they overcome?  Have any major lessons been learned since the school opened?</p></speech>

Many adults in our world struggle with that and we, therefore, try to teach ways of listening to somebody else's perspective and giving a point of view back but not falling out because there is a difference.  People should certainly not take up arms or hurt somebody because there is a difference.  Much of that is about teaching the skills of how to be proud but not fearing somebody else having a different opinion.  As principal, I lead by example.  I often tell the children about my family, which is integrated, and staff in the school see this as a vocation.  We feel we have been drawn to working in an integrated school and we strongly believe there is a passionate peace element to working in integrated education in Belfast.</p></speech>

There is an obvious need for more progress as well.  It is welcome that the Good Friday Agreement refers to facilitating and encouraging integrated education, and all of us would like more progress to be made.  With the 65 schools, these institutions educate approximately 8% of the student population, which is still quite low by any yardstick.  I had the privilege of visiting Lagan College in the mid-1990s with the British-Irish parliamentary group of the time, comprising Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, as well as members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  We did some study on education and where progress could be made but it was a much smaller school at the time.  The population today comprises 1,386 students, which is a great achievement.  Naturally, I would like to see more integrated schools.  We speak about the 65 schools but are these all second level institutions?  Are some of them primary schools?</p></speech>

There are 45 primary schools and 20 post-primary schools.</p></speech>

None of these was a new school.  There was growth in many areas and we can take for an example the developing areas of Dublin, including its commuter belt, where there have been new schools for new areas of population.  Where different areas have developed throughout Northern Ireland, have integrated schools been established that were not transformed from a previous existence?  At secondary level here, plebiscites are held among parents about the type of second level schools they wish to have, including community, education and training board, ETB, or voluntary secondary.  If a new second level school is deemed necessary in an area, who has the opportunity to contribute to the decision-making on what type of school it should be?</p> <p>  I gather from meeting different groups in Northern Ireland that often in higher socioeconomic strata - to use a terrible phrase, the more affluent areas - there was a bigger presence of integrated education than in places where people were on lower incomes.  That was suggested to me but is there a good spread throughout the socioeconomic strata?  I know it is not a measurement we all like but it is there.</p> <p>  Where there is no Minister in Stormont driving a programme, are those few years lost when momentum could have been gained in driving integrated education?  We all know the budget is under a particular control.  The departments are administered by civil servants so are they in a position to make decisions if a school applies to change its status to being an integrated school?  Do they have the authority in current administrative arrangements to make such decisions?  There were worthy proposals for a major campus in Omagh and I presume that campus included plans for integrated schools at primary and secondary level.  My understanding is the project has not proceeded at anything like the pace we would like to see.</p></speech>

It is a crude measurement but it is the only one we have, and it is the number of free school meal entitlements.  In integrated primary schools, the level is approximately 27.7%, whereas in non-integrated schools, that figure is 29%.  At post-primary schools and not including non-selective schools, the level of free school meals for integrated schools is 38%, whereas in non-integrated schools, the level is 39%.  The perception that integrated schools are very much for the middle class is not reflected in the free school meals numbers.  Unlike many non-selective schools in the North, we have integrated schools where the free school meals level is as high as 75% in some areas.  The perception is not correct.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the Strule campus at Omagh.  It is a shared education campus, not an integrated campus.  Five schools of different management types, Catholic-maintained and controlled, are relocating to one site.  The Deputy is correct that it has not progressed and it has run into a number of issues with respect to procurement.  There is also the question of getting agreement from schools as to what it will look like.</p> <p>  When there is no minister in Stormont driving a programme, will those years be lost where momentum could have been gained in driving integrated education.  We all know the budget is under a particular control.  Are the civil servants that currently administer the departments in a position to make decision if a school applies to change its status to being an integrated school?  Do they have authority in the current administrative arrangement to make such decisions?  There were very worthy proposals for major campus in Omagh  </p></speech>

It is a very good point but there is an integrated campus in the same part of the world, in Omagh, which is the Drumragh Integrated College and Omagh Integrated primary school.  This gives parents a choice for their children from the age of three through to 19.</p></speech>

The Assembly being down has not hampered our growth until very recently when we had five of our nursery units not approved.  The reason was there was not enough money in the budget.  Looking to the future, we are very perturbed that unless something is done around the Assembly getting up and running again and our education system in general receives more money into the system - because we believe there is not enough money in the system for it to run effectively - this could hamper our growth in the future.  We feel that until those recent turndowns, we have managed to grow despite the Assembly not being up and running.</p></speech>

They have all been opened either by parental power or they have been transforming schools.  We look forward to the future where that will change.</p></speech>

The 65 schools over the 38 years roughly equates to two schools per year.  I do not know any other organisations that are able to say they developed two schools per year, apart from Educate Together of course.  The growth has been phenomenal.  When one considers groups of parents coming together to start those, with no money, it is quite amazing.  Of the schools, 40 started from scratch, meaning that most of the 65 schools were created as brand new schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.753" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sam Fitzsimmons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019092600002#F00600"><p>A question was asked if they are looking at a new school in a particular area.  There are two planning authorities.  That would be the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, CCMS, which looks after the Catholic-maintained schools, and there is the Education Authority, which looks after controlled schools.  They plan for those sectors.  As mentioned previously, there is no body planning for integrated schools.  On top of that, we have an estimated 50,000 empty school desks.  There is rationalisation going on within our education sector.  It is being rationalised sectorally.</p> <p>  There is, however, an opportunity for the planning authorities to look at retaining education provision in a particular area.  We may, for example, have a Catholic-maintained school and a controlled school that are both undersubscribed and where both planning authorities will make decisions on whether to close each of those schools.  There is not really a process in place where one could look at how the two schools could come together to make a sustainable school.  The Integrated Education Fund is working with Ulster University in developing a community consultation mechanism.  We have been working with the Education Authority and the CCMS to see if they could include that within area planning.  We believe we are making some progress on that.  This would allow communities to decide what type of education provision they would like in their area.  From polling attitudinal surveys we can see that the majority of parents would choose to have an integrated provision in their community rather than no school at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mickey Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019092600002#F00700"><p>I thank the witnesses very much for the presentation.  I congratulate the council on its Nobel nomination and I offer best wishes on that.  I represent the Newry-Armagh constituency and I am very aware of Newry and Banbridge and the New-Bridge Integrated College from its inception, and I am well aware of the work it does.  I believe that it does a great job.  Initially, there was a feeling locally that the parents who sent their children to integrated schools were middle class and that it was an elitist thing.  That is certainly not the case.  Some of my children's friends have gone to New-Bridge college and one gets a very good insight into what that school is doing.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Things have changed to some degree.  I went to a convent primary school.  There were girls there but we never saw them as there was a divider down the middle of the classroom.  I then went to a single-sex primary school and then single-sex grammar school.  The primary schools have changed and now it is mixed and so on.  Where do the witnesses find the most opposition coming from?  We would very much want to have all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement implemented.  Surely the best way to promote reconciliation is integrated education.  That is a no-brainer - excuse the pun.</p> <p>  It is good to see that Lagan College, which has a very good reputation, is an all-ability school.  With entrance tests, do children have to go through the five tests?  I ask this because I did the 11-plus test a long time ago.  We were told that we were the last year to do that.  As we were the last class and supposedly the last year, we had the same teacher - a Christian brother - for four years from the ages of seven to 11.  There were 43 pupils in the class and 43 of us passed the 11-plus.  Some passed through academic ability and quite a lot through fear and other things.  There are quite a lot of good all-ability schools in my constituency, including St. Patrick&rsquo;s High School, Keady and St. Paul's, and St. Joseph's in Crossmaglen.  I was at a prize-giving recently and it is great to see the kids who are doing so well at every level.  Integrated education is a step further, where that could be done.  Coming from Newry, which has never really suffered the sectarian issues that other places in the North have experienced, one can see that reconciliation and integrated education have such an important part to play.  I congratulate the council on the work it does.  Unlike some of my colleagues here, I am very much aware of what New-Bridge Integrated College does.</p></speech>

In many senses, if we looked at it very simply, it is the controlled and maintained schools.  It is well established how we came to be here and it was not a deliberate attempt to separate children or any such thing.  We are, however, where we are and the statistics tell us - as Sam said earlier -  that in general Protestant and Catholic children are not being educated together, never mind the other diversity that now exists all over Ireland but also in Northern Ireland.  We need to look at it as a change management programme.  Mr. Brady spoke of his school.  There is an emotional attachment to school.  We are trying to ask people to think differently about it.  I would ask the Catholic-maintained schools and the controlled schools how they are going to attract people from the minority tradition into their schools.  That is all we are asking them to think about.  This is very difficult if it is not the traditional choice parents make.  We are also asking parents to make different choices.</p><p>We want to empower parents to make a choice.  That choice is to call for the school to which they are emotionally attached, to which they went, that their children go to and that their parents went to, to transform to integrated status.  The parents have that power.  It is a legal process which takes a few years, but there is that intention.  That is what we are asking people to do.  We would be very grateful for anything anybody could do to help us to empower parents to make that choice and change their school.</p></speech>

I would like to talk about the factors that are limiting the progress of integrated education.  For several years it has been lovely to see parents wanting to send their children to Lagan College where I have been the principal for ten years.  It is a great blessing when parents are interested in our school and affirming in the work that we do.  Our frustration stems from having to turn children and families away because we cannot physically accommodate more children on the site in south Belfast.  As Ms Marshall said, if the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, CCMS, and the Education Authority are the decision-makers, they decide on the provision of funding to open or support new schools.  We started with a grassroots organisation among parents and are now at a point where the governors are wondering if we should do it again.  That is literally where we are as a school.  It is heartbreaking having to turn children away.  The newspapers state there is no demand, but we see it every year.</p> <p>  The other aspect I wish to mention is the all-abilities nature of the school.  As I mentioned, we welcome children of all backgrounds.  That is reflected in our all-abilities status.  Members may know that since the 1960s in the North of Ireland there have been grammar secondary schools and, in effect, the segregation of children along those lines.  Most integrated schools are all-abilities and use a non-selective model.  In the 1990s, before my time as principal, Lagan College decided to take the bilateral route because of its position in Belfast.  It is in a very particular area in terms of parental choice.  Many of our friends in the CCMS are now doing the same and opening new schools also.  Children of all abilities come to Lagan College, but 35% of our intake are children whose parents have put them through the Association for Quality Education, AQE, or the GL assessment.  It is something our board of governors considers every year.  When they come back to sit in Stormont, we ask political leaders to look at this issue for Northern Ireland as a whole, rather than school by school.</p></speech>

When I went there, it was very obvious to me that every other child in my class in the small rural village where I went to primary school was put on a bus to go to another secondary school.  It was a very deliberate decision on the part of their parents.  I do not think the implications really struck me until I looked back as an adult.  It was a rural village with a lot of farm families, ostensibly a mixed village, yet a lot of parents decided not to send their children to the school that was ten minutes' walk up the street.  That was very powerful.  When I attended New-Bridge Integrated College, I was amused to attend alongside so many other pupils who were in the opposite position.  They had come on buses from Ballynahinch, Lisburn, Newry and Mayobridge.  They would take two or sometimes three buses a day and I made friends with quite a range of people.  My parents must have hated it.  I had to be put in a car and driven to visit all of them.  They lived all over the place.  They must have wondered if I could have made friends with anybody who lived a little closer to home.  To be serious, they did not hate it all.  This was what the school allowed me to do - to make friends with lots of different people from many backgrounds.  The opposition faced by my parents was striking.  Neighbours and the families of children who went to the same primary school were critical of what they saw as a wrong decision.  There is a lot of fear in small communities and it takes a very long time for it to dissipate.  There are people who have not spoken to my parents since.  We should not take for granted the decisions parents and the families of children have made to attend integrated schools.  They are often the first in their families to do so.  There may be other family members who do not agree with that decision and oppose it.  Opposition to integrated education can be very close to home.</p> <p>  Until I had left and looked back I did not really realise what a brilliant experience the all-abilities aspect of my education had given me.  As a student, I was academically able, but I did not want to go to the grammar school where I had a secure place.  When I walked through the gates of New-Bridge Integrated College at the open day I adored the feeling I got from every pupil who was there and every teacher who welcomed me.  That is a great reason I continue to talk about my school education more than 20 years later.  There are not many adults who do that.</p></speech>

They have given us a very powerful insight into their own personal experiences.  I believe in the principle of integration, but, as Deputy Brendan Smith said, 8% is a very small figure.  Ms Copeland has outlined some of the obstacles to increasing that number.  Are there other practical steps that could be taken to increase it?  The delegates spoke about beginning with parents and having to go through this process, but 8% is still a small figure after 20 or 30 years.  Are the groups represented not getting the message out on the value of integrated education?</p> <p>  Given that schools are not being integrated, are there programmes between schools that aim to increase their awareness of each other and the issues other schools face?  Communities might not be located on the same campus, but at least there might be some engagement between them.  </p> <p>  I note that the Republic is becoming more multicultural.  Does this reflect another challenge for integrated schools?  We are no longer talking about the two traditional communities in the North but much wider communities.  </p> <p>  I was interested in the question abut the Irish language, but it has been answered.  </p> <p>  My third question concerns teacher training.  Is the principle of integrated education part of general teacher training, or are the delegates talking about a module that is additional, not compulsory?  It appears that it should be compulsory as a part of teacher training.</p></speech>

As Ms McNamee pointed out, many integrated schools are oversubscribed.  If parents cannot get their children into an integrated school, there is no other option for them; therefore, they have to opt for one under another type of management.  There are only 65 integrated schools, which reduces the opportunities for parents to send their kids to integrated schools.  That the figure is just under 8% is remarkable, given that the Government has never planned an integrated school.  As we said, all of the schools have been established by parents, whether they are grant maintained integrated, GMI, schools or transformed schools.  They are parent-led.  It is a challenge to ask parents to remodel the education system in the North.  That is a job for politicians and officials within the Department.  Our challenge as a movement is not just to grow integrated education in response to parental demand.</p><p>We need the education system to be redesigned.  I may be repeating myself, but there are over 50,000 empty school desks.  There is an extensive tale of underachievement in schools.  All schools have a budget crisis.  It is predicted that next year there will be a &pound;300 million shortfall for schools, many of which are in deficit.  We need political leadership and the will to make integrated education the norm, rather than a lifestyle choice for parents to create for themselves.  I hope that provides a little context for the figure of 8%.</p></speech>

There is a vital word missing in that provision which is "promote".  It is handed over to us.  If someone thinks just over &pound;500,000 and a few members of staff will suddenly change hundreds of years of culture and traditional choices, he or she needs to think again about resources.  That is why we have the integrated education fund to raise funds to kick-start integrated development in certain areas.  It is not good enough in a lot of ways.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about other projects.  In the past ten years shared education has developed.  We are talking about collaboration between schools and the promotion of peace and reconciliation between them and the children and adults within school communities.  That is good and it has developed at a very rapid pace.  It is the first cross-party supported peace and reconciliation project for a very long time, but it will never replace integrated education.  Integrated schools are a school type.  It is important to understand integrated education and its development within a shared education context will I hope be easier in the future.  Schools are building relationships.  When I was growing up in a small town in Country Down, we used to peer over the wall on a Sunday evening at the Protestant school.  That coming and going between schools did not happen at the time.  It is happening now in Northern Ireland, which is to be commended, but our model of all-day, every-day learning, playing and working together is surely the way for our society to learn to live together, as opposed to within the separate silos.  That is helping.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan also mentioned diversity more broadly in schools.  We are the council for integrated education, not diversity within education.  Every single school in Northern Ireland has a responsibility to be diverse and ensure the inclusion of all children, irrespective of ability, disability, family background, community, race or culture.  We are specifically in place to promote peace and reconciliation through integrated eduation.  Ours is the largest, most sustainable and cost-effective community relations project in Northern Ireland.  For very little money, we are changing hearts and minds at a rapid pace.  We have a very specific mission - to ensure the two main communities, plus everyone else, are educated together.  The possibility of children being educated together is what we stand for collectively.</p></speech>

The teaching vocation is about supporting those children to learn, be happy and have fun in their early years.  In Lagan we have a number of children who have come through newcomer status in the country.  We support their needs, as we would those of any other child, be they special needs or certain gifts or talents.  It is our job to encourage children to pursue what they enjoy and become bettter at doing it.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned growth.  As a leader in education, I hear politicians speak a great deal about equality and respect, but there may be a need for more talk about shared housing and education.  In the wider sense, we are passionate about shared education as it is an important vehicle for children to meet one another.  I had the opportunity to meet children coming into the education profession through a PGCE placement.  I asked them if they had ever met somebody of a different religion or if they had friends from one and it still shocked me to find young men and women, not too far from Ms Copeland in age, who had never met somebody from the other major tradition in Northern Ireland.  It was a shocking revelation.  It is, therefore, in all our interests to do our best to enable any child who wishes to come to an integrated school to have his or her learning needs met.</p> <p>  I was asked recently to speak in front of St. Mary's and Stranmillis students who will be the teachers of the future.  It is rewarding to have been invited to speak to them next Tuesday.  It will be the second time I will have spoken to them on what the grounds are for integrated education and inclusive practice.  It is happening.  There is a joint module for trainee teachers at St. Mary's and Stranmillis which is encouraging and a first step in the right direction.</p></speech>

However, there is no dedicated induction programme or training and development in being a teacher in an integrated school.  That is something about which we think a great deal.  We hope to go back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade very soon to say a larger strategy is needed.  All of our teachers and every school are struggling with the same issues.  The question is how do we prepare these teachers and share that learning across the education system generally.  While it might be possible to facilitate some of it through shared education, it is so important that it needs to be at the heart of any teacher institution developing the teachers of the future.</p></speech>

It has been very informative and useful.  I also commend the delegates on the nomination which is quite the achievement.  I have every confidence in them.  I had a brilliant visit to Lagan College when I was Lord Mayor of Belfast.  I went to Malone College and a few others also.  It was great.  One knows as soon as one walks into a school whether it is a happy and healthy one in which people are doing well.  Certainly, I picked up on it there.  While I would never presume to tell the delegates what to do, they might find it valuable before they leave to extend an invitation to committee members to come to see it in practice for themselves.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions about some of the issues raised and on which I would like the delegates to expand.  I am keen to know what is the difference between an integrated school and a non-denominational or multidenominational school.  How does it play out in practice?</p><p>We want all schools to be integrated, but is that going to be possible in reality?  Different aspects have to be taken into consideration, including the right to choice etc.  I was impressed and pleased to hear about the work undertaken by Lagan College to make Irish available for study up to A level because I have a particular interest in the language.  I also congratulate its Gaelic football team on winning the JJ Riley Cup last year.  Are such developments replicated across the sector or are they unique to Lagan, Belfast or particular geographic areas?  Will the witnesses also tell me about the Integration Works project and the importance of support from the Department for the project and, indeed, other projects?  </p></speech>

The last thing I want to do is pit sector against sector.  I am, however, talking in a frank way because it is important that a committee like this functions in that manner.  I went through non-denominational education.  The religious sacraments were available to people if they chose them.  People from Jewish and Protestant backgrounds also attended the school and they did not have to choose them.  The unifying element was the delivery of education through the medium of Irish.  Perhaps I was at an integrated school all along and did not know it.  My point is that if we are going to advocate for a universal model, then we must be careful that such a model is not at the expense or detriment of another model.  I want to give the witnesses the opportunity to provide reassurance.  Mr. Jim Gibney, who works in my office, always refers to "lighting a candle as opposed to cursing the dark".  I ask the witnesses to light a candle on this issue and reassure us.</p></speech>

That is the description but it is not how we would describe a school in the South.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roisin Marshall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019092600002#J00500"><p>I will kick off on this question.  There are Catholic-maintained schools and controlled schools.  Most Catholic parents choose Catholic education by default, even though the Protestant Churches transferred their schools over in 1947.  The majority of controlled schools, then, are those from a perceived Protestant background.  There is of course diversity within all of those schools as well.  In general, however, Catholic parents do not choose controlled school education.  There are anomalies.  That is where we are at the moment.</p> <p>  Integrated schools deliberately, proactively and intentionally strive for a balance between Catholics, Protestants and others within their schools.  Some people ask why that is necessary.  Our answer is to ask why we needed something similar in respect of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  We sometimes need to do these things to ensure people have a voice.  Research shows that once we go below 10%, sometimes people get very quiet and feel they do not have a voice.  We deliberately try, therefore, to create schools that have an equal, or balanced, pupil population and board of governors.  That is an important distinction to make.</p> <p>  Catholic-maintained schools have a number of Catholic trustees on every school board.  Controlled schools have had transfers from the three main churches: the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Church of Ireland.  In every controlled school of nine governors, for example, almost half, four of those nine, will be from the transferrers, that is from the Protestant churches.  The governors set the culture and strategic direction of the school.  They also, however, determine what happens within the school.  We suggest that what makes integrated schools different is that they strive to have a balance within their board of governors.  That means, therefore, that all of the children will see their culture and tradition reflected in the governing body and in the staff.  Does that answer Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question?</p></speech>

Amanda alluded earlier to what happens in an integrated school.  It is about addressing diversity and celebrating diversity within the school.  There is an opportunity to that because of the diversity within the school.  That does not happen within a single-tradition school.  As was pointed out, less than 8% of Catholics go to Protestant-controlled schools and less than 1% of Protestants go to a Catholic school.  In essence, only one narrative is being heard within those schools.  Within an integrated school, however, multiple narratives are being heard, not just in the playground but also in the staffroom and the classroom.</p></speech>

My sister-in-law is an Irish-medium primary school teacher in Strabane.  She set up that school some years ago.  What happens in that school is very close to my heart.  A lot of brilliant inclusive practice is going on, as has been mentioned.  The edge of where we take integrated education, as Ms Marshall stated earlier, lies across all different strands.  It sounds as if Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile had a very inclusive experience, which would not have been too far away from making that move into being an integrated school.  That would have been the case if there had been children of other faiths and backgrounds attending the school.  I am sure there were children from different ethnicities and cultures but perhaps not from the other main denominational traditions in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

That was not really the case.  I understand what she is saying and this is an interesting discussion.  I want to return to the point made by Ms Copeland.  Much of what she said in her opening presentation rang true in respect of my own experience.  I was educated upstairs in the Cult&uacute;rlann before it was refurbished into the beautiful facility that it is now.  We were really up against it regarding our experience.  That was also a great unifier.  It was a great way to instil a positive ethos and unifying spirit within any school.  I am keen to talk to Ms Copeland to get tips on establishing a similar body for those of us who have passed through Irish-medium education to enable us to become champions and advocates for that approach.  Aside from everything else, it would be useful because we are in a climate where many young people going through that sector feel abused and vilified, given many of the public statements made in recent times.  I appreciate the presentation today and what the witnesses are doing.  There would be merit in us taking a look at what is happening in Lagan College, whenever that might be possible.  Regarding Irish as an A level subject and Gaelic sports, which are available in Lagan College, is there similar availability across the sector or is it confined to certain areas?  I am not trying to put anybody on the spot and it might not be practical.</p></speech>

Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile comes from a background of enjoying politics.  As a principal of an integrated school, I love seeing our young people coming from all different angles of politics and having the ability to debate without fear or judgment while still holding different opinions.  Our young people want to talk about many things have happened in recent years.  They may have differences of opinion on Brexit and what is going to happen in Ireland, Northern Ireland and-or the north of Ireland.</p><p>We should be encouraging those young people not to be afraid to talk it through because if people do not talk it through and communicate, we will take a step back to what we had before, which is people being fearful of one another and not really understanding what happens in each of our respective homes and communities.</p></speech>

Senator Craughwell and I had an interesting discussion in the Seanad earlier - although he was not in the room for my contribution - about the climate we are in.  I come from a school of thought that believes that regardless of where something is or what it is about, the more young people are empowered to be engaged in politics, critical thought and activism, the better.  Any school ethos that promotes and enables that, without pushing it, is positive and commendable and is worth supporting.</p></speech>

Boys swam in different places to girls and girls did not go to the same schools as boys did.  It was a different sort of segregation and I am delighted to inform my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, that in 1967, young people found their voices and came forward and we had integrated swimming in Salthill for the first time ever, which was something to behold, and I was fully behind it.</p> <p>  I spent 25 years of my life teaching and I am all for young people having a voice.  I am totally against exploiting young people in order for adults to have their voices heard, but that is another story and Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and I can argue that out in the future.  The shared education system is good as a second-class alternative.  Integration is the only way forward, but having spent 25 years in education, I can tell the witnesses that education change comes slowly, even with simple matters such as changing a teacher midway through a course.  There can be a poor teacher teaching a subject who is replaced by an excellent teacher halfway through a course, and students will complain because people get used to certain systems.  I want to go back to 1967 and the introduction of girls into the technical school, for which I must compliment the vocational education system in Ireland because it abandoned religion and concentrated on its core ethos of education.  That changed the lives of many of us who went to school there.  We saw girls as fellow human beings, and I would hope I carried that attitude with me through my life, rather than as some strange object who were over a wall, as Ms Marshall mentioned.  We sneaked up and looked over that wall because we wanted to see what was going on over there.</p> <p>  The work the witnesses are doing is really important.  Two weeks ago, I was up in Northern Ireland and I had a long discussion with some people from the Unionist tradition.  One of the matters they were applauding was the increased level of mixed marriages in the North.  That will impact the provision of the Integrated Education Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education as time goes on.  Every time someone comes from Northern Ireland I regret to say that the "B word" has to be used to talk about budgets.  My concern is around funding.  If the Integrated Education Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education are to be successful, two things will matter as they go forward.  The first is results.  Parents will abandon all beliefs if there are results in the school, regardless of where the school is.  I am mindful of a particular school in Dublin that had the most appalling first year to sixth year students.  One had to go in there wearing a flak jacket and a gas mask to survive a class but it had one repeat leaving certificate class and parents from the richest parts of Dublin sent their children there because they were guaranteed results.  Results are the lifeblood of the school and there is no doubt at all about that.  Opening up opportunity is also important.  Given that the witnesses have the imagination to be involved in integrated education, I believe they will also be open to alternatives to third-level education.  We are pushing too many children to undertake third-level education so I would assume the witnesses are interested in apprenticeships and in parity of esteem across the different vocational and academic routes one can take.</p> <p>  With the onset of Brexit, and we have no idea what will happen with that over the next few days, weeks and months, my concern is that if we have a break between the UK and Europe, the funding that may have been available will be at risk.  I am not sure how much of the Integrated Education Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education's funding would come through the peace process system but if it is not much then maybe they do not have too much to fear.  Funding is really important.  I am always concerned about politicians in the South talking about what is going on in the North because in truth, so few people from the South travel up and experience the North.  It is a wonderful place and a beautiful country and I love the people up there.  I also love getting my car fixed up there because it was cheaper for me when I was up there two weeks ago than it would have been down here but that is another day's work.  Results and funding are the key issues.  Without funding, the Integrated Education Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education are not able to employ the staff who will provide the results so I am interested in the views of the witnesses on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roisin Marshall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019092600002#K00500"><p>Those are very good points.  We would concur that every school has to be a good school first and foremost and then parents will buy into the ethos.  Funding is something we are also concerned about.  We are very grateful for the &pound;300 million allocated to integrated schools for their capital buildings, without which some of those schools would not have survived much longer because the schools were built with a core and mobile classrooms.  They had a main block and mobile classrooms with a lifespan of 15 years to 20 years, most of which have surpassed that marker now.  With that comes revenue as well.  As our schools grow, the numbers of children attending integrated schools since the Good Friday Agreement have doubled.  That is not a story a lot of people know about because the growth of school buildings is what is talked about but the number of integrated schools has doubled.  With that comes the necessary revenue for teaching staff, for growth within the school buildings and so on as the school grows.  That revenue is not there to back up the capital funding and we are concerned about that, particularly now as we have five development proposals for nursery units.  Every child deserves the best start in life and if they do not have the opportunity for education in an integrated setting from age three that concerns us because the reason we were given was a lack of funding.  That is the first time in our history we have ever heard that.  We had to raise our own money through the Integrated Education Fund or through borrowing from the club bank but eventually, when we proved the viability of a school, the Department of Education would invest in it and a lot of the money would have come through Europe at that time.  That is our concern.  To me, integrated education would grow exponentially if it was financially incentivised.  There is no doubt in my mind that would happen.  Some &pound;43 million is going into shared education, which is fantastic, but none of that money went into integrated education.  It went to integrated schools that are involved in shared education but not to integrated education itself.  Anything we can do to change that situation will be vital for the growth of integrated education.</p></speech>

Some 43% of the Executive's budget was spent on health and the other 57% was spent on education, infrastructure and so on.  There was simply not enough money.</p><p>Part of the problem, if not the entire problem, is Tory austerity.  They took approximately &pound;1.2 billion off the Executive's budget during the eight years I was there and that has not been replaced.  Therein lies the problem because we do not have fiscal levers in the North even if the Assembly is up and running.  It should be because, obviously, local people would make local decisions and better decisions.  That needs to be addressed as well.  We get a cake that one slices it up as best as one can and this is the case across the educational sector.  The position integrated education is in is even worse because it does not get the funding it should be getting anyhow so therein lies the problem.  </p><p> Brexit will be a disaster for everybody.  I go to Westminster.  I was over there this week and the previous week.  Nobody has a clue what is happening, including the people who are supposed to make decisions, but funding for integrated education is an even bigger problem in many ways because schools are relying on parents and fundraising.  This is why they have the organisation they have, which is to be commended, because they are very much on their own in that sense.  The two governments have responsibility to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented and a major part of that is the promotion of integrated education.</p></speech>

Schools are essentially about helping children to learn about themselves, others and their future career paths and prospects.  As has been mentioned, every school wishes to be a good school.  The joy of working in an integrated school is we have children of all abilities.  They will go into the workplace be that through university, apprenticeships, gap years or charity organisations.  It is a joy to see one can make a difference to children aged between 11 and 18.  As a principal and a mother of a child who attends an integrated school, I believe that integrated education is doing much more than that.  It is our civic duty to encourage children to make sure we do not make the mistakes of the past by integrating them into understanding what peace looks and feels like.  None of us knows what Brexit will feel like but as a principal, I must be optimistic that the children will go forward and, hopefully, make a difference in the world.</p></speech>

I have just moved outside Croke Park and have become a great deal more acquainted with GAA jerseys.  It is about learning from people who can share their stories with each other, ask, "What's that?", and explain it to somebody who is on their level in a way that is without fear and judgement - possibly a bit of judgement because kids are very good at ribbing each other.  I learned more there about cultural differences than I could have been taught formally.  As chair of Integrated AlumNI, I have the privilege of working with adults who feel this is so important to them that they want to give up their time and energy to continue to talk about it.  It is difficult to manage a committee.  Everyone has different opinions and is coming from different positions.  What better training for dealing with difficult political issues than being taught and formed as an adult to share their experiences, discuss differences and learn how to do that in a grown-up fashion, which I would love to see reflected in our political leadership.</p></speech>

We can certainly send more information about that.  That relates to parental and community engagement, trying to educate people about integrated education and empowering parents to transform the school to an integrated one regardless of its current management type.  An integrated school can be either grant-maintained, which means the board of governors is its managing authority, or a controlled integrated school, which means the education authority is the managing authority.  The good news is that this transformation is open to every school apart from special schools and hospital schools so any school can switch to integrated status.  Why would a school not transform if it has a mix of Protestants and Catholics?</p></speech>

I am the assistant secretary for the housing policy, legislation and governance division of the Department.  I am joined by Rory O&rsquo;Leary and Stella McKervey from the approved housing body, AHB, policy and regulation unit within this division.</p> <p>  It might be helpful for the committee if I set out briefly the background to the classification process.  Traditionally, AHBs have been classified as non-profit institutions serving households.  Following a meeting on social housing initiatives in October 2016, EUROSTAT requested that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, review the sectoral classification of AHBs.  EUROSTAT expressed the view that under the European System of Accounting 2010, the role of government financing should be given greater weight in the sectoral classification.  Over the course of 2017, the CSO conducted this review, focusing on the larger Tier 3 AHBs.  A particular emphasis was placed by the CSO and EUROSTAT on the levels of State funding provided to AHBs.</p> <p>  During this process, the Department strongly put forward the view that AHBs are independent private bodies and emphasised that factors other than the level of State funding need to be considered in testing whether the Government exercises effective control over the operations of AHBs, namely: that AHBs decide their own strategic and management priorities; that the boards of the bodies make the decisions on entering contracts and taking out loans and bear the risk of developing new projects; that, by definition, to be approved as an AHB a body must be a limited company registered under the Companies Acts 1963&ndash;2001 or a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893&ndash; 978 or a trust incorporated under the Charities Acts; that AHBs register their tenancies with the Residential Tenancies Board in the same way as private for-profit landlords, which is unlike the situation applying to local authority tenancies; and that AHBs are responsible for all matters of management and maintenance, which do not fall to the State to address, and any action taken by the tenant for redress is taken against the AHB.  Ultimately, the CSO published its decision in December 2017, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to indicate control by Government and, accordingly, that 14 AHBs should be classified as part of the local government sector and within the general Government sector. </p> <p>  The effect of reclassification means that any funding privately sourced by these AHBs to acquire social housing units will be added to the general Government debt, unless it has separately already been classified as such.  It also means that the cost of purchasing or building units will have to be accounted for in general Government expenditure in the year of purchase or completion.  In addition, all expenditure by AHBs, including staff costs, will count as Government expenditure and all revenue accruing to the AHBs will count as Government revenue.  AHBs currently secure the majority of their financing through the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  The HFA reports strong growth in direct lending to AHBs in 2018 and indicates that activity remains high in 2019.  This suggests that activity in terms of approvals will remain close to 2018 levels, while actual advances should be higher this year than last. This demonstrates that the sector is performing strongly.</p><p>It is important to be clear that the reclassification does not preclude AHBs from pursuing private sources of finance.  The Department continues to work with AHBs in that regard.  Such a collaborative approach will ensure the classification will not become a barrier to delivery or diversification of funding sources.  The Department's assessment of the situation, as informed by discussions with the Department of Finance, is that there are no concerns at this time from a fiscal rules compliance perspective about the classification of AHBs as part of general government, but that is not to say there is any complacency in respect of this issue.</p><p> I would like to speak about AHB delivery and future output.  The Department continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to the delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the action plan is maintained.  AHBs provide and manage social rented housing.  They are independent and private not-for-profit organisations that are formed for the purpose of relieving housing need.  They provide housing in response to a range of needs for families on low incomes, households with special needs, older people, people with disabilities and homeless persons.  The delivery of social housing is made possible through collaboration between local authorities and AHBs.  The AHB sector is committed to delivering one third of homes under Rebuilding Ireland through a blended delivery of build, acquisition and leasing.  In 2018 the AHB sector was responsible for 38% of blended delivery of social homes.  Last week the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, updated the committee on Rebuilding Ireland and published the social housing construction status report, which demonstrates the positive progress being made in advancing national local authority and AHB new build construction projects.</p><p> I wish to make clear to the committee, the AHB sector and local authorities that this classification will not affect the ambitious plans under Rebuilding Ireland.  We are continuing to engage with the AHB sector.  Constructive discussions have taken place with representative bodies in the sector on the issue.  An important part of this exercise involves examining the measures that could be taken in the medium to long term to develop the AHB sector and lead to a reclassification.  It has to be accepted that it is most likely to be a longer term objective.  As the proposals may cut across a wide range of housing policy issues, they will require in-depth analysis.  As part of this process, we are continually engaging with the Department of Finance and the CSO to fully understand the implications of the classification.  The Government's policy is to support the AHB sector as it endeavours to provide and manage social rented housing and to continue to fulfil its full potential in the delivery of the targets set out in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  The Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to the delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the action plan.  The sector has engaged its own research and sought legal advice on classification.  The Department is evaluating that research as part of its ongoing wider consideration of the issue.  The options available to create the necessary conditions to allow this classification decision to be revisited in the future need to be developed and analysed to determine their implications and possible impacts.</p><p> I reiterate that AHBs are delivering.  The Department remains committed to working with colleagues in the Department of Finance, the CSO and the AHB sector to ensure the capacity for AHBs to deliver is sustained.  I hope I have provided a helpful summary of the issue.  We are happy to take questions and provide any additional clarification sought.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Stephen McDonagh and Mr. Robert McLoughlin.  All three of us are based in the economics division of the Department of Finance.  Mr. McDonagh and Mr. McLoughlin are based in our statistics unit which is responsible for the application of statistical standards in the Department's medium-term fiscal projections.  <br/><br/>I will begin by setting out the institutional framework for official statistics in Ireland.  As Ireland's national statistical institute, the CSO is part of the European statistical system, the primary objective of which is to guarantee that European statistics compiled in all EU member states are comparable, reliable, relevant and usable.  EUROSTAT, the EU statistical office, does not collect statistics from respondents but compiles and quality controls national statistics collected and reported by each national statistics producer, which in the case of Ireland is the CSO.  The CSO is responsible for implementing the European system of accounts framework, known as ESA 2010.  In that context, it determines which bodies are on or off the Government balance sheet.  ESA 2010 is legally binding across all member states.  Therefore, the CSO is the national arbiter in the classification of entities and subject to oversight by EUROSTAT.  It has complete independence in the exercise of its functions and makes decisions on classification matters.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance respects the statistical independence of the CSO, which is enshrined in national and European legislation.  While the Department does not have a direct role in reclassification matters, its statistics unit may provide preliminary <i>ex ante</i>statistical advice for Departments based on the information submitted.  Such advice is always deemed to be provisional and dependent on the proposal being implemented as described.  The process allows for engagement with the CSO, if necessary.  When a proposal has been implemented, the CSO will review all relevant information and make a final <i>ex post</i>classification decision.  The Department has no role in <i>ex post</i>classification which is entirely a matter for the CSO and EUROSTAT.  The Department's main involvement in statistical matters is to collect the necessary financial data to ensure the public finances are compiled and reported accurately.  It is responsible for current year estimates of general Government deficit and debt that are supplied to EUROSTAT and other European institutions.  It compiles and publishes technical forecasts of general Government receipts and expenditures in the Stability Programme Update, Ireland's medium-term fiscal statement and budget publications.  The medium-term fiscal projections are in accordance with ESA 2010.  In the light of this, there is ongoing close co-operation between the CSO and the Department in the area of Government finance statistics.  It is encapsulated by the secondment to the Department of CSO statisticians who are based in our statistics unit.  The Department and other relevant experts participate in a variety of groups dedicated to specific topics to provide for quality assurance in the reporting of deficit and debt figures.<br/><br/>As we set out in our submission to the committee on 1 July, the Department has no direct involvement with AHBs.  Each AHB is a delivery mechanism for housing, which means that its output is outside the scope of the Department's responsibilities.  In 2017 the CSO's review of the AHB sector focused on the largest of the bodies in tier 3.  It concluded that there was sufficient evidence within the funding schemes to indicate control by the Government.  Accordingly, it decided that 14 AHBs should be classified as being on the Government balance sheet.  The Department does not try to influence this or any other classification decision.  Before the decision was made, AHBs were classified as being off balance sheet.  If an entity is classified as being off balance sheet, its revenue, expenditure and borrowing are of no relevance in the calculation of general Government revenue, expenditure or borrowing.  <br/><br/>In February 2018 officials from the Department of Finance appeared before the committee to discuss the reclassification of AHBs.  On that occasion, there was a focus on the implications of the CSO's decision in the context of fiscal rules.  In January and June 2018 officials from the Department of Finance attended meetings with their colleagues in the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the impact of the classification of AHBs on the fiscal position.  Officials from the Department of Finance met the Housing Alliance to discuss this topic on 1 May 2018.  They advised on the impact of the reclassification of AHBs on the fiscal projections set out in the Stability Programme Update.  The reclassification of AHBs is not a Government accounting issue but a statistical issue, which means that it is entirely a matter for the CSO.<br/><br/>When the on-balance sheet conclusion of the CSO in 2017 was confirmed by EUROSTAT, the Department of Finance began its preparations to gather the necessary data.  The Department designed a data collection form aimed at collecting the necessary details and minimising the burden, insofar as possible, on individual AHBs.  The Department issued the form to the relevant AHBs for its spring 2018 forecasts.  Contact details of departmental officials were provided, as is standard on the issue of such a data request.  Direct contact details for the relevant CSO statisticians were also included.  A limited number of AHBs made contact with the Department to discuss the details being collected.  The queries centred on understanding the form and ensuring data were being submitted correctly.  Such contact took place by email or telephone call, with no requests for a meeting.  There was a 100% response rate in the initial collection round.  As the Department produces two official macro-economic and fiscal forecasts each year, we are in the process of gathering the information for the fourth time.  On foot of the CSO's decision, the reviewed bodies were placed within the general Government sector for statistical reporting purposes.  As such, expenditure by AHBs will count in the local government sector.  This will worsen the general Government balance.  Revenues to the AHBs from third parties will improve the general Government balance.  Any borrowing will count as part of general Government debt.  The 2018 Stability Programme Update included the first set of fiscal projections to incorporate the CSO's decision.  General Government statistics were restated to reflect the activities of the reclassified AHBs.  At present, there are no direct Exchequer implications.  In addition, the projections do not present a particular issue in the context of the fiscal rules.  However, this could change if the scale of AHB activity increases through increased borrowing.</p><p>The CSO was to review all AHBs.  Taking into account the structure in place in Ireland, the initial focus was on tier 3 bodies which comprise the largest of such bodies.  The CSO has committed to reviewing the remaining AHBs not covered in the original exercise.  If further AHBs are reclassified as being on-balance sheet, their data will be counted in Government finance and excessive deficit procedure statistics.<br/><br/>The AHB sector undertook its own analysis to explore how changes to their governance, funding and scheme conditions could facilitate a future re-examination of their status.  A submission was subsequently forwarded to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in late 2018.  Given that the proposals made in that submission centre on changes to the relationship with local authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Housing Alliance was advised by the Department of Finance that the proposals to reclassify tier 3 AHBs off-balance sheet were ones for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The submission also highlighted that clarification of aspects of the original reclassification decision made by the CSO was required.  As such, the Housing Alliance was advised the matter was more appropriate to the CSO.  The submission stated:</p><blockquote>[T]he power to decide the classification of an organisation under ESA 2010 lies with Eurostat.  However, in most cases Eurostat employs the services of the relevant national statistical agency to provide it with an assessment and recommendation.  In Ireland's case that agency is the CSO.</blockquote><p>The submission set out a number of measures required to place AHBs in a position where they could apply for reclassification as being off-balance sheet.  At a later stage, once the substantive policy aspects of their proposal such as contractual arrangements, organisational structures and funding mechanisms had been worked through with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance could review any of the workable solutions with regard to balance sheet implications.  The Housing Alliance responded and referred to the classification of AHBs as being &quot;at its core a financial accounting issue&quot;.  That is not the case.  It is a statistical, rather than an accounting, issue and, therefore, a matter for the CSO.<br/><br/>More recently, the Housing Alliance submitted a statistical query to the Department of Finance.  Broadly, there were two main aspects to the query.  First, the Housing Alliance was of the opinion that the CSO's 2017 review was incorrect.  The second part of the query was about a counsel's opinion of the classification decision.  This is under consideration in the normal manner and a response to the query will be issued in due course.  I assure the joint committee that the Department of Finance remains willing to engage in a supporting role with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government which has responsibility for housing policy.  <br/><br/>I hope this provides a useful summary of the issue.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to answer questions members wish to pose.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.820" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019092600002#F00300"><p>I will make some opening comments and then ask some questions.  </p> <p>  I have a real concern about how long it has been since EUROSTAT's decision in March 2018.  Notwithstanding the fact that both Departments have outlined the action taken to date, I am not hearing a coherent plan or strategy to get the approved housing bodies back off-balance sheet.  While it may not be a problem today, our difficulty is if there is any change in macroeconomic circumstances.  We have the ESRI speaking this morning in its bulletin about the possibility of a recession in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  That immeidately has implications for capital expenditure by the Government and, therefore, AHBs to meet their targets.  If everything goes well, we will be fine, albeit that will depend on the extent to which AHBs ramp up borrowing and spending.  However, if something negative happens, as happened before, and capital dries up, AHBs will be sucked back to very low levels of delivery.  We know that if there is a reduction in output, it takes a very long time, whether in the local government or AHB sector, to return to appropriate levels of output.  Last year the approved housing sector delivered perhaps 2,000 units between builds and buys.  It is a very important supply.  My questions come in the context of frustration that we are almost two years in.  Across the water in Britain it took about two years to get approved housing bodies off-balance sheet.  I am not saying I like the way they did it.  I have concerns about where its approved housing bodies have ended up, but still it has happened.</p> <p>  My questions are as follows.  First, it is important that the committee get a sense of how much we are actually talking about.  Therefore, I ask both Departments to consider whether they can answer these questions.  What was the level of expenditure in the approved housing bodies sector across 2018 and what is the expected level of expenditure in 2019?  What is the broad level of revenue in approved housing bodies, whether last year or expected this year?  What was the level of borrowing last year and what will it be this year?  Crucially - this may be a question that is more appropriate to the Department of Finance - how much fiscal space does all of it occupy in the context of the current budget?  I do not have the level of expertise of officials in the Department of Finance, but I ask the question in the following context.  Let us imagine the fiscal space in the context of where AHBs are on the balance sheet is currently &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million approximately.  That might be tiny in the context of Government debt, but we are about to have a budget which the Government tells us will include a figure of only approximately &euro;700 million in extra fiscal space.  An extra &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million would be very significant in that context.  As such, if the officials could provide clarity on that issue, it would be very helpful.</p> <p>  I am not hearing a great deal about meetings since December 2017 between the three crucial players, namely, the Department of Finance, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the approved housing bodies sector.  Clearly, there has been engagement.  I am not saying there has not been.  However, if the amount of fiscal space occupied by the AHB sector is of the order of several hundred million euro, it is a big prize for the Government and, subsequently, the Departments to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the fact that they are confident AHBs will continue to secure funding and meet targets in the next couple of years.  Am I wrong in saying that?  Have there been meetings held this year?  The Department of Finance stated there were meetings with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in January and June last year and May with the AHB sector.  Are there other levels of engagement?</p> <p>  What I am really interested in hearing about is the plan.  One of my major concerns is that EUROSTAT added a significant additional concern in its conclusions on the CSO's determination.  EUROSTAT added a much more profound commentary on what it believed was the non-market nature of the AHB sector in terms of both its principal aims and its rent setting approach, which is to say how rents react or, in EUROSTAT's view, do not react to market movements.  Crucial is the issue of how all of that influences or does not influence the investment decisions of AHBs on supply.  If one were to meet the requirements of EUROSTAT to get AHBs off-balance sheet, the core mission of AHBs - to be non-market operators and not-for-profit providers of subsidised housing - would have to change.  One would then be on that pathway to where British AHBs have gone.  In essense, they have become sub-market operators.  My concern is that I do not see a plan and do not know how any plan would ensure the AHB sector would continue to do what it now does very well, namely, provide non-market housing at subsidised rates for people who would not be able to afford even sub-market housing, as is emerging in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.821" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Lemass" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019092600002#F00400"><p>I will take what I can and there may be questions Ms Scott and her team can take.  I will take together the Deputy's first and last questions, for which I thank him.  </p> <p>  We are conscious that the AHB market in the United Kingdom is very different.  That explains in part why their reclassification process was somewhat smoother.  There are some fundamental differences in the role local authorities play in AHBs in England than in Ireland.  I believe Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate arrangements.  We are committed to exploring them further as part of a resolution of the reclassification issue.  We are happy to learn any lesson from what has happened in the United Kingdom and beyond.  It has happened elsewhere in Europe also.</p> <p>  The broader context is provided by social housing policy.  The major challenge EUROSTAT's decision presents for us relates to broader housing policy in areas such as the setting of differential rents, the allocation of housing, the configuration of housing and the types of housing we require.  These are matters which are the cornerstones of social housing policy.  While I appreciate the desire of the AHB sector to be reclassified as being off-balance sheet, we have to be mindful that in so doing we do not tear down the entire edifice of social housing policy, as it stands.  That is why these are hard decisions to make and why it has taken a long time to get to a position on them.  The Minister is on record as talking about an approach to social housing policy reform and looking at areas such as a national approach to differential rents, income assessment and so on.  That is at an advanced stage of development.  We are working on it and it must take precedence.  Ultimately, it will inform any consideration given to classification.</p> <p>  We recognise that the CSO and EUROSTAT have made a decision.</p><p>If we can bring new information to the table on foot of policy changes, we will do that but obviously a policy change that affects the entire allocations process for all social housing applicants would be one to which we would have to give a lot of consideration.  Also, to come to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about whether things go well, as it stands, the projection is that we would build, through build, acquisition and lease, 12,000 units per year between 2021 and 2027.  That is factored into the national development plan so, as matters stand, the figures provide for those 12,000 units.  That is the highest level of funding we have ever had for social housing.  It is important to remember that this is in the current national development plan figures.  If things turn badly, the first step will be prioritisation.  The Government has stated that housing is an absolute priority.  There are other calls on funding.  At the moment, the children's hospital is going through, but that will complete at some point, and then the draws on funding in that area will no longer exist.  Part of this, then, is a matter of Government priority at the time.  Clearly, however, the national development plan provides for 2,000 units per year between 2021 and 2027 and that is the basis on which we are operating.</p><p> I have already touched on the UK.  As regards expenditure, funding to AHBs between 2009 and 2018 amounted to &euro;1.745 billion.  In 2018, expenditure was &euro;337.69 million.  That includes capital and current expenditure.  For 2019, the capital allocation is circa &euro;260 million and the current allocation is circa &euro;210 million.  That is funding from the Department.</p><p> I think I have dealt with the matter of the fiscal space, the &euro;100 million issue in the context of what is hardwired into the baseline and the funding already available.</p><p> As regards the number of meetings, we have met the Housing Alliance and the ICSH a number of times and there has been substantial engagement with the Department of Finance as well.</p></speech>

The fact that it is the broader consideration of social housing reform presents a challenge in that it is not just a reclassification issue we are working on.  We are working on a suite of broader social housing reforms, many of which will have an impact on any future consideration by the CSO of the classification status.  There is, therefore, a much broader agenda there than just the AHB sector, and we have to take that into account.  That is the summary of my comments at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Scline Scott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019092600002#G00400"><p>I assure Deputy &Oacute; Broin that the Department stands ready to engage with our colleagues on housing.  We would need a lot more detail on the proposals we have seen to date before our statistics unit could give some technical advice.  Does Mr. McDonagh wish to come in on the issue of fiscal space?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019092600002#G00500"><p>Yes, briefly.  To add to what Mr. Lemass said, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows, it is income and expenditure that will impact fiscal space.  I think he understands that.  Again, the decision to reclassify was retrospective.  With the Rebuilding Ireland plan and the national development plan, there is a clear pathway for capital expenditure, funding and delivery of social housing.  I caution the Deputy that this is quite difficult to do.  The simplest way of doing it is to remove the AHB data from the latest set of projections, the stability programme update, SPU, on which basis there is approximately &euro;300 million of Government expenditure this year and again next year, declining to about &euro;200 million in 2021.  Using that concept, one actually frees up fiscal space, based on the current projections from the AHBs.  Again, that is reflective of their portion of the 50,000 houses over that timeframe.  The reason the numbers are relatively low is that there is a consolidation under way because there is funding from Departments and the local authorities.  That was already captured in the expenditure numbers.  That is offset, and what one then captures is what would have been statistically treated as current expenditure.  What one gets is the actual capital investment by the AHBs, and again, as the Deputy knows, that is subject to the four-year smoothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.827" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019092600002#G00600"><p>May I ask one supplementary question on that?  I know this is not a straightforward question, but if the AHBs were taken off the Government balance sheet today, what would that mean for the fiscal space available?  What would be taken out?  What would be the advantage to a Government of having it off-balance sheet in terms of how it could then use that fiscal space elsewhere?  Can Mr. McDonagh quantify that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019092600002#G00700"><p>In effect, there would probably be no advantage.  It depends how one reclassifies.  If the AHBs were not on balance sheet, there would be no impact on fiscal space because they would be taken out across the board such that they would not be in the base for last year.  Again, it is a question of how much one can grow one's base in year-on-year terms.  If, however, there were a policy change to remove the AHBs at some point in time, the question is basically one of their allocation within the overall pot of general expenditure.  Again, that is a matter of policy choice for Government to decide.  Does it want to continue to spend that on something?  Does it want to spend less?  It is a matter for Government at that stage.</p></speech>

We had a presentation from the approved housing bodies just before we rose for the summer recess.  There was a general frustration among everybody around the table that we have not been able to resolve this problem, and I think it is a disappointment to everybody that the approved housing bodies have now been put on balance sheet.  We need to find a resolution to that because, regardless of what anybody here says, unless we find an off-balance sheet model, we cannot invest in social or public housing to the degree that is needed to address the crisis we are in.  In that regard, I will expand on a few issues based on the previous meeting and today's meeting and get some clarification on some matters.</p> <p>  My understanding, from both today and the previous meeting, is that any debt generated by an approved housing body, whether privately funded capital or State funded capital, is now all on balance sheet regardless of where it comes from.  This is the nub of the problem that we must overcome.  We have discussed the credit unions and talked about a figure of &euro;3 billion, with &euro;7 billion being available from credit union funding to invest in public housing.  If approved housing bodies were to take that sum tomorrow morning and invest it in social housing, it would increase State debt by the same amount.  As such, it would have a significant impact on fiscal space and on future delivery.  While this change may not be impacting now, it is affecting the potential to use an off-balance sheet model to solve the housing crisis into the future.  The priority is to find an off-balance sheet model if we are to genuinely address the housing crisis.  The fiscal space is not big enough, no matter what way we do it.</p> <p>  Regarding the criteria, it is also frustrating that this can be achieved elsewhere in Europe but not here.  Why is that the case?  What is the fundamental difference between how we present our statistics and how the rest of Europe presents its statistics?  The contractual arrangements, the financing and the risks are the three fundamental issues on which the Department is gathering data and presenting them to the CSO.  I read in one of the reports that the borrowing of the approved housing bodies accounts for less than 1% of their expenditure.  This means the State is funding the other 99%.  That fundamental issue also needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Is the capital debt a bigger factor in the decision than the fact that the local authorities decide who goes into the houses or the differential rent that applies?  Is there any leverage in this regard?  Which of the various criteria the Department is using have most impact on the final decision?  Is capital the biggest criterion or is it the fact that local authorities have too much control over who goes into the houses and the types of houses that are built?</p><p>Do we fully understand how EUROSTAT and the CSO made their decision?  If so, can we not just get on and address the issue?  We can talk here all day, but unless we find an off-balance sheet model that can deliver social and affordable housing, we will not fix this crisis within our current fiscal space.  We need private investment from the likes of credit unions to do it.</p></speech>

EUROSTAT is responsible for applying the rules in a harmonised fashion across Europe.  That is evidenced by how EUROSTAT took in the specifics of each country in the context of each representative national statistical institute's decision.  Housing markets differ across Europe.  As such, not all providers of social or affordable housing in other EU countries are on-balance sheet.  This is the case for many reasons and would require a comparative review of how affordable housing was delivered in each EU member state.</p> <p>  In terms of debt, funding and what is on the balance sheet, anything that is borrowed from the private sector is general government debt.  At the moment, that is in the order of &euro;100 million.  This is reflected in the fact that the borrowing is predominantly from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, which is already on-balance sheet.  Therefore, that debt is already captured when the HFA borrows.</p></speech>

We have looked carefully at the off-balance sheet question and how it impacts behaviour.  We have tried to learn how behaviour has changed since the introduction of the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, in 2011.  It provides for a 30% unsecured fund, effectively from the Government via the local authority, with the remaining 70% to be raised by the AHB.  Under CALF, the AHB is free to source private financing if it wishes to do so.  Before CALF came into existence in 2011, we had the capital assistance scheme, CAS, and the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS, which were at 100% funding.  Since 2011, the avenue has been open to AHBs to raise private finance.</p> <p>  In 2011, we did not have the reclassification issue with which we are challenged currently.  There was a period from 2011 to the end of 2017 during which the door was open to AHBs to access private finance.  In reality, the actual amounts drawn down through private finance rather than via the HFA were very small.  We must learn from that.  Part of our engagement with the AHB sector will be to try to do so and to understand more about that significant period of time.  As someone mentioned, nearly 99% of funding in that period and beyond has come from public rather than private sources.  Something we need to understand more is what the barriers to drawing down private finance are.  Between 2011 and 2017, reclassification clearly was not a barrier, yet private finance was not drawn down.  The danger is that removing the barrier now will not have the desired effect.  We just need to understand the situation a bit better and to engage more with AHBs.  We are committed to doing so.</p> <p>  Regarding the source of funding, colleagues have identified that there is provision through the HFA to provide funding.  However, an AHB is not obliged to go through the HFA.  If an AHB were to identify another source of funding, it would be possible to reduce the drawdown from the HFA and divert that to the other source.  That is a feasible outcome if there is a desire to explore available sources of private funding.  That option is on the table.</p> <p>  We have done what we can to support credit unions and AHBs in developing a special purpose vehicle, SPV, to enable investment by the credit union sector in AHB developments.  That has included changes in the regulations from the Central Bank to allow credit unions to invest.  I believe that the figures are in the order of &euro;700 million.  The investment is based on the size of the credit union and its reserve, with larger credit unions able to invest more than smaller ones.  That facility is in place.  Ultimately, however, it is a matter for the two independent bodies - a credit union, the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, or the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, and the respective AHB - to decide to take the final step and set up an SPV.  The framework has been put in place and the Department has provided funding to the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, to develop that framework.  My understanding is that it has gone pretty much as far as it can go without actually reaching the point of making an SPV happen.</p> <p>  I will give some scale to this issue.  The goal under the national development plan is to build 12,000 housing units through building, acquisition and leasing - building and leasing are the main components and are growing faster and faster - between now and 2027.  At that point, we will have added to the housing stock to the tune of 112,000 units.  The current housing list as per the scheme for social housing assessments, the headline figures of which have been released but the details of which are yet to be released, is in the order of 68,000.  The projection in the national development plan of 12,000 units per year from 2021 will enable us to build, acquire or lease 112,000 units.  Given that there are 68,000 households currently on the list, and accepting that people join and leave lists, we will broadly be in the right area in terms of the scale of the response.</p> <p>  A question was asked about contracts, finance and risk.  I will not go into detail on all of those, but a key aspect of the CALF contract is a continuation agreement.  This has been cited in correspondence from the Housing Alliance as something that it would consider.  Our duty of care in a continuation agreement is to the tenant.  We need to know that, in the event of a difficulty with the contract, the tenant is protected.  That is why we must insist on there being a continuation agreement.  There have been proposals for alternative assurances to financiers and so on, but there must also be assurances to the tenant that if anything happens with the source of finance, there is security for him or her.  The current arrangements with the HFA are working well in that regard.</p> <p>  EUROSTAT has taken a wider view on financing.  That seems to be the direction of travel.  However, there is also a practical constraint.  In the event of a downturn, someone might suggest that it would be great to go to private financing to raise the capital.  If that capital were raised by an AHB, it would have to be paid down somehow.  That is the other side of the equation.  The capital is the input, but that finance would need to be paid from some source on an annual basis.  To consider access to private capital in isolation is only to deal with the input side of the equation.  The output side is that, once an AHB has its &euro;100 million or whatever, it must find funding or charge rents to enable it to repay the amount.  This, as well as the broader range of elements at play, show why the situation presents a more challenging picture for us.</p></speech>

He will find that there is a desire among most political parties in the Oireachtas to reclassify AHBs and to deal with the situation.  It is not just the approved housing bodies which want it to happen.  I take it from the statement of the Department of Finance that it is neutral on the question, that it is crunching the numbers but does not have any policy or decision-making role in the matter.  That is useful to know because we have been trying to find out whether it was housing, finance or CSO until now, and it has been like trying to pin a tail on a donkey.  The donkey in this instance is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and that Department is responsible for moving the situation forward.</p><p>I am trying to get a handle on the level of engagement on this.  My feeling, which could be incorrect, is that the senior level of the Department of Finance does not want this resolved.  The policy decision for a reclassification to an on-balance-sheet status suits Government policy on housing, and keeps control over the sector for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister.  It was said that, even if we were to borrow privately, it would have to be paid back but we know that.  Is it not the case that, at ministerial level in the Department of Finance, it suits Government policy with regard to the delivery of 12,000 housing units per annum?  They are saying we are going to get to that level anyway so we do not need the approved housing bodies to ramp up delivery.  Deputy Casey and others have raised the concern we have, which is around the fact that while it may be okay to think like this now, it may not be okay to do so in two or three years' time.</p><p>What is the level of engagement?  The Department of Finance said the proposals received to date from the Housing Alliance would need a lot more detail.  Does that refer to the August document submitted by the alliance?  If we need more data, have we sought them from the Irish Council for Social Housing or the Housing Alliance?  I get the sense that this will be allowed to drift.  We will be told the decision has been taken and that is the way it is.  We do not need to deal with this issue so we are not going to do anything about it.  There was talk of a working group being set up involving the Departments and the AHB sector.  Has that happened?  Is there a real desire to rectify this problem?  It could be a valid position to take that the <i>status quo</i>is the preferred option of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  If that is the case, the Department would be better to tell us, lest we go around in circles trying to resolve an issue the Department does not want to be resolved.</p></speech>

The Housing Alliance made a submission to the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform in October last year, setting out a number of measures that could possibly see the bodies brought off balance sheet some time in the future.  We told the Housing Alliance that we would need to see a lot more detail before we could provide technical advice around that.</p></speech>

I was trying to demonstrate that the reclassification exercise is likely to be a long-term development.  The UK context is quite different and we are comparing apples with oranges.  The UK body was not previously a not-for-profit organisation and was a private institution, although I forget the precise categorisation.  The most important thing is that the delivery pipeline is not affected by reclassification.  We have had some five or six meetings with the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Housing Alliance since I have been involved and I meet them regularly on the interim regulatory committee, on which Dr. Donal McManus also sits and where we discuss issues relating to reclassification, regulation, etc.  There is engagement but there needs to be more and we are committed to ramping it up.</p> <p>  The EUROSTAT decision called into question issues such as the setting of differential rent, the allocation of housing and the configuration and type of housing that is being built.  These are fundamental to overall social housing policy.  We are happy to consider how changes in that area might affect reclassification but we do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and we do not want unintended consequences.  The fundamental thing about Rebuilding Ireland is to deliver social housing for social housing applicants, which we do at the moment through an allocations process that is understood and a differential rent system that is understood.  The Minister is on record as saying he is looking actively at a national approach to differential rent and income eligibility, etc., and we have to carry that work forward, for the entire sector and not just as regards AHB participation.  It is a slower-moving development than it may have been in the UK, where there were one or two quick fixes they could put in place.</p></speech>

When was the last formal engagement between the Department and the AHB sector on the classification issue?  Are we actually trying to deal with this?  Does the Department want this to be resolved?  Does it see this as a problem?  The national development plan was mentioned on a couple of occasions.  Is it not the case that reclassification to on-balance-sheet status effectively suits the policy direction of the Department?  If that is the case, it is a valid position, though not one I agree with.</p></speech>

As we internalise the EUROSTAT decision, we would like to see that situation pertain, although we have to see how practical it is in the context of the changes required to the allocation system and to differential rent.

It would be &euro;100 million lower, in the context of &euro;200 billion.  As I outlined for Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the expenditure will be &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million lower per year.  The impact on the balance sheet, because there is some revenue included, is a little lower.  Theoretically, for 2019, the general Government balance would be &euro;250 million to &euro;300 million better if the approved housing bodies, AHBs, were off balance sheet and not hitting it, so to speak.  Simply put, the fiscal projections are compiled based on the system of classification.  It encompasses all on balance sheet bodies.  If they are on balance sheet they are counted and if they are not, they are not so to a certain extent the fiscal numbers are largely agnostic.  There is the sense that a significant amount of public expenditure is being devoted to capital investment for the delivery of social housing.  Effectively, that is public money under public control to deliver public policy so it should be on the balance sheet and not delivered via some off-balance sheet mechanism potentially creating a contingent liability for the State at some point in the future.</p></speech>

I get that because it is a significant recalibration.  When he talks about a long-term objective, what incremental steps does he envisage taking?  What timeframe is he talking about?  Do we have to arrive at a particular legal situation at a particular time?</p></speech>

The first aspect is that, independent of the reclassification exercise, social housing reform is on the agenda.  The Minister is developing proposals in that regard and hopes to bring them to Government reasonably soon regarding issues such as differential rent, income manageability and such like.  That is at an advanced stage and the Minister is hoping to move on that.</p> <p>  Separate from that, we need to engage in more detail with the Housing Alliance regarding its proposals.  It has put forward detailed proposals.  We probably need to get more of the detail behind them.  It has a proposal to do away with the payment and availability system and replace it with a differential housing assistance payment, HAP, system.  We would need to understand fundamentally how those two are different and how that would have the desired impact of demonstrating less control by Government.</p> <p>  We would also need to get into some more detail about its proposals on choice-based letting, which is an important part of the allocations process but is very much the tail end of the process.  There is a suite of steps in allocation before one decides whether to let a property through choice-based letting.  We would need to understand that in more detail.  One might say there is a twin-track process that we would have to work through.  Once we get a definitive position out of either of those that we can act on, that will enable us to bring new information to the CSO that would enable it to consider whether a reconsideration of the classification was appropriate.</p></speech>

We will work with it.  We will also work with the Irish Council for Social Housing because the Housing Alliance applies only to the six large approved housing bodies.  There are others that need to be incorporated as well.

In truth, it is the bigger ones that drive the growth agenda.  Of the ones that come looking for funding, 15 to 20 of those would probably take the lion's share of any funding available.  Many of the smaller AHBs do not have any particular growth or development plans and are just managing the stock that they have, so it is likely that the large ones will be the most active on this particular agenda item.</p></speech>

That is the current arrangement under the voluntary code of practice.  Once the regulatory system is introduced, hopefully, with the committee's support, early next year it would then be a matter for the regulator and they would register through the AHB regulator.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had to step out of the meeting as I had to deal with an item in the Seanad.  I do not have the advantage of knowing the questions that were asked but I take it from the comments of the two Senators present that securing meaningful engagement with the sector is an issue.  When I attend Oireachtas joint committees, I tend to notify agencies or relevant people that a particular subject is being raised.  Needless to say, I have spoken to a number of approved housing bodies and the common issue that came across consistently was their lack of meaningful engagement on what they read about this legislation, the reclassification process, the role of EUROSTAT and the impact of that on or off balance sheet.  I believe there are too many approved housing bodies.  Can Mr. Lemass confirm how many are in existence?  I have heard the crazy figure that there may be up to 500 but that may not be true.  He might be able enlighten us on the number of approved housing bodies.  Some of them are very small and some are very big.  Some of them are driving the process and some are clustered in groups.</p> <p>  The reform of approved housing bodies may be a debate for another day.  It is no secret that the Minister and the Government are keen to see rationalisation, organisation and structure around this area.  I am not in the business of supporting a large number of approved housing bodies with plush offices and top chief executives making loads of money.  I am not saying they are all like that but there is a perception that many people are reinventing the wheel and that we are all over the place in this area.  Questions are being asked of elected members who have mandates and are part of councils, which are housing and planning authorities that have many other functions.  They are close to the ground in terms of the administration of their respective housing lists.  The approved housing bodies take tenants from the social housing approved lists.  That is extremely important to ensure transparency.</p><p>There are a whole load of issues about reforming the sector which may not be part of today's deliberations so I want to point that out but I also want to acknowledge there are very good and successful approved housing bodies.  My understanding is the Government is keen to use AHBs as a major source of housing and in the provision of social housing.  There is always a conflict with what the local authorities are meant to be doing.  We know from looking at land inventories that there are substantial public lands in the ownership of these housing authorities and we know there is a demand for housing.  One has to ask why we cannot harness all that energy and do it?  Why are we reinventing the wheel and handing so much of this direct build of social housing to authorities and organisations outside local authorities?  I just want to say that because it is important.  The Department might tell us how many approved housing bodies there are.</p><p> I refer to the differentials system.  Mr. Lemass can correct me if I am wrong but he suggested there might be a two-tier differential rent within the HAP system.  Maybe that is being considered but Mr. Lemass might enlighten us on that.  I appeal to the Department to have more engagement with the approved housing bodies.  I accept there are clusters and maybe the Department is engaging with the groups - and they are not engaging down - but that is a big issue and it is a recurring theme here today.</p><p> Can the Department detail the interactions with EUROSTAT on getting AHBs off the balance sheet?  We do not have all the documentation.  I am not suggesting the Department should go back and take its filing cabinets apart and come back here with a busload of stuff but what is the Department's engagement with that?  What is its preferred option?  We need to know what the Department's preferred option is.  We do not want to hear that the Department will wait and see wherever the dice falls.  What is the Department's preferred option in an ideal world?</p><p> We need to reassure people that with overruns on the children's hospital and a whole load of other overruns, the financial difficulties the State will face post Brexit and all the other financial challenges the State faces, this will not impact the level of delivery expected in Rebuilding Ireland and beyond, depending on the reclassification.  I am a bit tired of hearing about delivering targets for Rebuilding Ireland.  I want us to be ambitious to get way over the objectives, commitments and targets we have set in Rebuilding Ireland.  I thank our guests from the Department for coming in.</p></speech>

There are two different sets of numbers on this.  The number of registered AHBs is 552.</p></speech>

Many of those would not be active.  A de-listing exercise has been undertaken and we need to do more.  The numbers participating in the voluntary code, which is set up through the interim regulatory committee, is more like 260.  However, those 260 AHBs represent the lion's share of the activity and the housing stock.  We are comfortable that we have captured most of the housing stock and most of the growth with those 260.  Growth is linked to working with the voluntary committee and getting a satisfactory assessment through it.  We recognise it is a busy sector and we have supported the ICSH and others to look at ways of rationalising the sector and facilitating the transfer of assets.  That work is ongoing and it will become more pressing as time goes on because 560 AHBs is too many for a country of 4 million or 5 million people.</p> <p>  A critical aspect of reform will be the introduction of statutory regulation, which we hope will be in this committee soon.  That will be a significant support to the development of the sector.</p> <p>  On the use of AHBs, the plan in Rebuilding Ireland is that they would deliver one third of the units.  In reality they are over-delivering and they are closer to 40%.  We are happy with that.  The policy in Rebuilding Ireland has always been that it will be flexible.  If it is apparent there is an AHB that is ready to take the lead and develop, and there is a need in that area that is signed off by the housing authority, we will be flexible.  The committee has seen that because AHBs have gone from 33% to close to 40% of the deliveries so far.</p> <p>  To be crystal clear on the differential rent, the Housing Alliance has proposed that as part of the reclassification exercise, we would move from the current SHEP proposed operation of the payment and availability scheme to a new scheme, which would involve a differential HAP being paid in addition to the differential rent a tenant would already pay.  That is a Housing Alliance proposal.  It is not our proposal.  We will refer to it in that context and that is something we need to work through with it to understand how it would practically be different from a payment and availability arrangement.</p> <p>  On the reclassification of AHBs, I reiterate that we supported their retention off-balance sheet.  We made a case to the CSO and EUROSTAT at the time that they should remain off balance sheet and we pointed to their independent appointment of officers and to the fact they have their own boards and set their own strategies as justification for them remaining off balance sheet.  The ultimate decision was they became on balance sheet but it was not our preferred outcome and we are happy to work with the sector to examine ways to reverse that.  Earlier on I emphasised that notwithstanding the reclassification, the delivery of social housing continues apace and there is nothing in the reclassification that will impact negatively on our plans to deliver.  Those plans include moving up to 12,000 build acquisition and leases per year, while will be mainly build and lease, by 2021, and continuing at that rate until 2027.  That is already factored into the national development plan so we have a high degree of confidence those numbers will be delivered.  To put that in context, that means that by the end of 2027, we will have put out 112,000 new units.  That compares with the social housing list which was completed a month or two ago, which indicates we have 68,000 people on waiting lists.  We feel that is an acceptable proposal in terms of the scale of ambition and a response to the challenges presented in the context of a housing list with 68,000 people on it.</p></speech>

I presume these are the AHBs outside of the 260 he is talking about.  What does Mr. Lemass mean by that?  Is there a substantial inventory of all of that?  I presume the Department is on top of all that.</p> <p>  I mention the over-delivery by AHBs.  Mr. Lemass should remember the targets were too low.  Many of us would have thought the targets right across the sector were too low.  Would the Department be in a position to furnish the committee with the outputs for the AHBs for 2018 and 2019 to date as soon as possible?  I do not like comparing the outputs of AHBs with those of the 31 local authorities.  If we could have this information on the basis of the 31 local authorities it would be helpful because we can look at that against other statistics.  We are talking about over-delivery and that is positive.  We want to see that, track it and examine why it is happening.  I welcome any additional delivery of houses.  Wherever houses are delivered they are houses.  It does not matter who is building them.  We are talking about homes for people so we should not get hung up on the ideology of the private sector or public sector providing them.  I made the point earlier that the local authorities have so much capacity, local knowledge and skill.  They do not have the capacity to raise funds as easily as the AHBs for a number of reasons Mr. Lemass would know all about, and maybe that is why local authorities are under-delivering, coupled with the four stage bureaucratic process that takes months to get through sections of.  That also frustrates local authorities.  If the Department could assist the committee by providing a delivery spreadsheet on the 31 local authorities with delivery targets, the over-delivery of those targets and the breakdown, that would be really helpful to the general work of the committee.  I thank the witnesses again for coming here today.</p></speech>

It is more of a broader provision if an AHB decides it might be better off winding up, and there are such situations with elderly people in AHBs.</p><p>They are not in a position to continue.  We would like to facilitate a process whereby their assets would be transferred to another AHB that would take over ownership and control of them.  We support that and we recognise that it will probably be the way out for a number of AHBs.  We do not quantify that precisely but that is the kind of thing we have in mind.  Our concern would be that the tenants are protected through any transfer.  That is the main thing.  </p><p> Regarding over-delivery by AHBs, I reiterate that Rebuilding Ireland is flexible.  If one sector can over-deliver, we accommodate that.  I must defer to my colleague, Mary Hurley, regarding what statistics are collected on individual delivery by county by AHB but I will raise it with her and we will revert to the committee between us to see what we can give the committee in terms of the actual delivery numbers by county by AHB.  I am not sure what is collected so I do not have the answer.  </p></speech>

It is just a question of us having them because they are there.  As Mr. Lemass is telling us that AHBs are over-delivering, we must have some way of backing up this statement.  If Mr. Lemass could relay that message to the relevant people, I would appreciate it because it is so important for the committee to track the progress on a housing association and local authority basis.</p></speech>

I could not but reply regarding the last point about the four-stage process.  The four-step process envisages a 59-week turnaround.  In some places, including a couple of developments in Wicklow, the period has been as short as 43 weeks, so we feel this process is quite lean and manages to balance the need for delivery and the need for value for money.  There have been a high-profile examples of how very expensive projects might have got through were it not for the four-stage process.</p></speech>

I am getting the impression that Mr. Lemass feels that this is the larger element that needs to be thrashed out as opposed to the capital or funding element.  The Department of Finance might have its opinion on that.  Mr. Lemass spent a lot of time on CALF funding, which involves a 30:70 mix.  If most AHBs used the 30:70 model and there was some tweaking of the other three items, would we be in the ballpark where we might get a reclassification regarding the on-balance sheet model?</p> <p>  How is the debt calculated with regard to AHBs?  There are issues like capital deficit, operational deficit and income expenditure.  How is that debt presented when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is presenting the statistics to the CSO?  Does Deputy &Oacute; Broin need to come back in?  </p></speech>

It concerned rent pressure zones and all the great difficulty renters are having.  I have three supplementary questions.  I am sure Mr. McDonagh winces every time politicians clumsily try to work our way through stuff around the fiscal space because getting our heads around it is genuinely very challenging for many of us.  I will relay back what I think Mr. McDonagh was saying and might put another question.  If the AHBs are taken off-balance sheet, because that is retrospectively applied in the baseline, the Government expenditure bit of it in terms of capital or current has no impact.  If the Government continues to spend the same amount, all things are equal.  A question arises on private borrowing and the spending of that private borrowing for capital construction because with the exception of the small special needs AHBs, 70% of the capital spend by AHBs is Housing Finance Agency, HFA, or private sector borrowing.  Because the HFA is Government-backed, that will be on-balance sheet no matter what so the key question is private sector borrowing.  Is there visibility in terms of the extent to which that private sector borrowing occupies a fiscal space?  If it was reclassified off-Government balance sheet, how much fiscal space would that save?  For example, if the borrowing last year was in the region of &euro;200 million, that is obviously quartered because it is smoothed out over the four years so it is a quarter of that.  Am I right in saying that whatever their borrowing requirements are or their actual borrowing is and the spending of that annually from private source, a quarter of that is the fiscal space that would become available to Government if it is off-balance sheet?  If that is wrong, could the witnesses put me right on that?</p> <p>  An interesting point by Ms Scott in respect of the propositions that have been put to the Department of Finance by the Housing Alliance was that the Department would need more detail from the alliance before it would go to the Department's statistical people.  For the benefit of the Housing Alliance, which is probably paying quite close attention to us today, could she tell us what kind of detail the Department is looking for?  If the alliance or those of us who are concerned about this are to be helpful, what more does the Department need from them because it would be interesting?  </p> <p>  In response to Mr. Lemass, I have always been a bit nervous about the debate on securing off-balance sheet because if it comes at a cost, I would much prefer if it stayed where it is in terms of housing policy.  It really does get down to the issues around rent setting and reviews, allocations and nominations but also investment decisions because this is one of the things EUROSTAT highlighted in a way the CSO did not because today, the investment decisions of the AHBs are really proxy decisions of Government because it sets the overall targets and the AHBs play their role in that.  Is it unfair for me to read between the lines of what Mr. Lemass said to say that part of our difficulty and part of why this is taking so long is because in respect of the challenges of maintaining the kind of policy focus the Government has chosen and the AHB sector has chosen to date in terms of that not-for-profit subsidised housing ethos, getting them off-balance sheet could require very significant policy changes that would have significant policy implications?  That is what I am hearing from Mr. Lemass.  I have not heard anybody from the Department say it as frankly before.  </p> <p>  With regard to the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill, which we discussed yesterday and which relates directly to this issue, I asked a question yesterday and while in fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy English, did his best, I do not think he got the point I was making.  My point concerned the inclusion in the standards of the Bill for issues around tenancy management, nominations and allocations because it was a surprise to many of us that this was there.  Is that an attempt to put some of those policies at one step removed from the Department and the local authorities and to create that sense of independence?  Is that related to this discussion?  If not, given that this Bill predates the reclassification issue, has there been any stress-testing of the provisions of the Bill in the context of the desire to get the AHBs back off-balance sheet?  For example, was there consultation with the CSO?  Is that even permissible under the rules?  Was there consultation with the Department of Finance on whether the provisions of the Bill would make it easier or more difficult to achieve reclassification?  I am thinking in particular of all of those areas where the new regulator will have to refer back to the Minister for consent, such as setting standards and the strategy.  </p></speech>

That is the kind of money involved.  Investment decisions are underpinned by a housing authority assessment of the need so if an AHB comes in with a proposal, it must be approved by the local authority in the first instance.  It then comes into the Department because we have a broader housing policy remit but there must be a need.  That is what drives it.</p> <p>  Regarding major policy changes, the bottom line is that they have called out allocations, differential rent and the configuration of properties.</p><p>We have to internalise that and determine the changes required and how those changes can be reconciled with the need to manage allocation and differential rent systems that are fair to everyone.</p><p> In parallel with reclassification, the Department is working on the social housing reform package.  We were looking at this anyway, independently of that exercise.  We will try to find a way that one can collaborate with the other or at least not derail the other.  We are very alive to the issue. </p><p> Regarding the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2019 and the question of tenancy management and allocations, I note that this is happening already.  The voluntary code is working very well.  It has taken us a while to go from 2013 to having a Bill published and in the D&aacute;il in 2019.  The benefit of that is that we have had six years to build awareness, raise standards and get compliance with them.  The sector has worked extremely well.  The oversight of performance provided for in the Bill largely exists already on a voluntary basis.  Obviously we need to move to a statutory basis; that is accepted.  However, much of this oversight already exists on a voluntary basis.  As regards whether it is a policy, the idea is that if a certain approved housing body, AHB, is asked to allocate houses to a number of people on the list, a regulator will be able to satisfy itself that those people have been allocated houses off that list.  That is the level of oversight at issue.  Alternatively, there may be a communications issue concerning whether an approved housing body is communicating effectively with its tenants.  That is the kind of oversight we are considering.  It is entirely separate from the role of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which manages its area.  There is a very clear division there.  It is not inappropriate for a regulator to examine those areas.</p><p> Reference was made to the Minister.  The Minister must have a reasonable level of oversight to understand what is happening in the sector and how it is responding to the challenges, and potentially to learn from the sector, which is racing ahead in terms of delivery.  There is no one-size-fits-all model for regulation but given the level of investment in the sector and our reliance on it to deliver, the Minister would have an appropriate level of oversight.  </p><p> Finally, before I yield to colleagues in the Department of Finance I wish to address stress-testing.  It is really important to be clear that the Bill was initially developed in 2015, before the issue of reclassification had materialised.  It is important that each of the two initiatives stands on its own merits.  I would be very uncomfortable if we were reconsidering regulation to facilitate reclassification happening or not happening.  We need to keep a clear separation between the two.  Regulation is there to ensure that the sector is well regulated and to give confidence to the public in that regard.  Reclassification is there to enable AHBs to participate and access private financing.  That is a separate exercise.  However, I sit on the interim regulatory committee which reviewed the legislation.  It was satisfied that nothing in the Bill would hinder a reclassification exercise.  In fact, its general finding was that the ability to demonstrate that the sector is well regulated would help in any reclassification initiative.  That is much as I can say.  Perhaps the Department of Finance can respond to some of the earlier questions.</p></speech>

As was probably mentioned earlier when discussing EUROSTAT, the fiscal framework is concerned with whether an AHB is a market or non-market entity.  This concerns various criteria regarding economically significant prices and whether a body operates based on commercial interest or non-commercial interest.  Without that level of detail, it is very hard to provide comprehensive analysis to give the best advice possible.  As such, it would be very hard to provide good advice or analysis using high-level thinking about structural changes that does not consider the degree of financing or the risk exposure and the small details of the proposal.  That is what we are looking for.</p></speech>

We present the debt in the medium-term forecasts.  It is presented in nominal terms and we also provide the ratio of debt to GDP, which is the requirement under the Stability and Growth Pact requirement.  We also provide information on the ratio of debt to GNI*, given the limitations of GDP in an Irish context.</p> <p>  Simply put, we collect the amounts directly from the bodies involved, in this case the AHBs.  We ask them to differentiate how much they are borrowing from local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, and third parties, that is, non-government bodies.  The latter is the part that adds to general Government debt.  The HFA, local authorities and any other Government borrowings are already captured elsewhere in the system.  Consolidating these figures provides the figure of &euro;100 million, which the approved housing bodies currently report is provided to them by the Department of Finance. </p> <p>  That leads me on to the question of how that links up with capital financing.  The two issues are somewhat separate when the fiscal space is calculated.  The debt is the debt.  That is what we borrow.  The relevant question is when it is spent.  When it is spent we do not link it to the source of the financing, although obviously the financing provides the space to spend.  When it is spent we determine whether it is current expenditure or capital expenditure in this fiscal context.  As has been said, if approved housing bodies borrow &euro;100 million from private capital, that would logically give them &euro;100 million to spend.  It is a question of the timing of that spending and whether it took place in one year, in other words, what is the relative change in the expenditure.  Assuming that the primary engagement of AHBs is in the area of delivering capital, it is most likely to lead to additional capital expenditure.  We determine the amount of additional spending in the area of capital and then apply quarterly smoothing to that.  I hope that addresses the questions.  I appreciate it is somewhat vague, but as members will be aware-----</p></speech>

The debt is one thing.  That is independent of fiscal space.  Fiscal space is based on expenditure, that is, when the money is spent and how much is spent.  To some extent it is distinct.

If, for example, the AHBs were to spend in a given budgetary year &euro;100 million on private borrowing, that would take up &euro;25 million of fiscal space.  Does the Department know how much of the &euro;100 million private borrowing facility was spent by the AHBs?  What would be the advantage to the Government in terms of that available extra fiscal space if they were off-balance sheet?  From everything Mr. McKenna says it seems that would be a small sum of money.  If it has not spent the &euro;100 million or has spent only &euro;50 million in a given year it is a quarter of that.  Do we know how much of that private borrowing has been spent?  Post-rebuilding Ireland this is fictional because we do not know who will be in government or what the plan is.  It is in the development plan but many of those things are questionable.  Even to the end of rebuilding Ireland do we know how much of the capital spending by the AHBs in 2020 and 2021 will come notionally from private borrowing?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Lemass that if it is a question of good quality or off-balance sheet regulation, we go for good quality.  Likewise, if it is a question of good-quality, subsidised, not-for-profit housing within the context of Government policy versus the British sub-market model to get off-balance sheet, I am for the first option.  Notwithstanding that, I would have thought the Department would like to know - not from the regulator but from the CSO and the Department of Finance, because they have a level of expertise the rest of us do not have - if the provisions of this Bill a help or a hindrance?  It is not a question of removing them from the Bill but it would be good to know if they were a help or hindrance in the context of reclassification because if it is the view of the Department not to opt for reclassification because the policy costs are too high and its recommendation to the Minister or the view of Government is that they are not policy changes it is willing to contemplate, we should just say that.  I am not stating that this is what Mr. Lemass is saying but it does sound as if that is the direction this conversation is potentially taking.  There is no point in our talking about reclassification if from a policy point of view the Department is saying the loss from the social housing provision is too great to bear.</p> <p>  We know how many new households come onto the housing list every year because that is published by the Housing Agency and there were approximately 14,000 households last year and the year before, which is twice the output of real social housing.  I absolutely respect the fact that Mr. Lemass must outline the Government's policy decision on HAP and people&rsquo;s housing needs being met.  If, however, we take all the people on the housing list and add the people on HAP and RAS, the number is 140,000.  The problem is that the NDP targets are based on an assumption that the long-term housing needs of households are met by HAP and RAS, but they are not.  I am not looking for a response from Mr. Lemass but he should feel free to respond if he wishes. Short-term housing needs, two years for HAP and four for RAS and all the 50,000 on HAP are entitled to social housing.  The NDP targets only work if we assume nobody comes onto the housing list even though 14,000 have come on each year for the past two years and the Department is assuming that the people in receipt of HAP will not want to take advantage of the transfer list.  When those are added in, it is producing approximately half of what it needs over the course of the NDP.  That is why those figures are kind of tricky but that is for another meeting.</p></speech>

We are not suggesting that quality regulation and reclassification off-balance sheet are mutually exclusive.  If it is possible to do both we will work to do both.  We need to conduct more investigation into possible solutions to the reclassification issue that we can then bring to bear on colleagues in CSO and the Department of Finance.  That is probably the direction of travel, that we agree and identify a possible way forward, then take it to Finance rather than have it comment on our proposed legislation and saying if we do this, that will happen.  It is better that we proactively study the legislation and see where we can take it.  </p> <p>  The Deputy would not expect me to say anything other than that a housing need has been met when a person has been awarded HAP.</p></speech>

To give some context, our members see the daily struggle to make ends meet in households where there is not enough income to meet outgoings.  It is when this struggle becomes overwhelming that families often request our help for the first time.  Last year, we published a report carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  The report examined the experience of families who could not afford a minimal essential standard of living.  Research participants had an income between 3% and 39% below what was required to meet their basic needs.  Half of the research participants were in employment and did not have an adequate income despite being employed.</p><p>The parents who took part in this study worked hard at budgeting and prioritising expenditure and tried to protect their children from the effects of poverty and low income.  However, the experience of going without characterised daily life and parents were constantly saying "No" to their children, leaving them feeling guilty and ashamed.</p><p> The research showed that living on an inadequate income is very stressful and emotionally draining and can have a major impact on physical and mental health.  The longer it goes on, the more difficult it is for families to see a way out.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul strongly believes that people who receive social welfare should have the means to remain integrated and participate in society.  The danger of inadequate social welfare is that it can trap people in poverty and lead to greater social, health and economic costs in the future.  Adequate social welfare helps people to reconnect to the world of work and allows them to live in dignity.  Therefore, first and foremost, we are asking that social welfare rates are set at a level which is grounded in evidence and that is sufficient to lift people out of poverty and to provide them with a minimum essential standard of living.  We are aware that reaching this goal will require action over a number of budgets and choices must be made in budget 2020 in the context of a potential no-deal Brexit.  It will be crucial to focus increases in payments for those experiencing the deepest level of inadequacy, namely, households headed by one-parent, single working-age adults including those under the age of 26, people with disabilities and households with older children.</p><p> The issue of in-work poverty is a growing concern for us.  In 2019, we published a report entitled Working, Parenting and Struggling.  The analysis of the employment and living conditions of one-parent families in Ireland found that the living standards of lone parents are among the worst in Europe and that the rate of in-work poverty among these families more than doubled between 2012 and 2017.  To reverse this upward trend in in-work poverty, budget 2020 should seek to increase the earning disregard for lone-parent payments to &euro;166 to restore the 2010 value for hours worked at the national minimum wage.  We are also asking that the hours requirement for the working family payment be reduced to 15 hours from 19 hours, in recognition of the greater difficulties lone parents face in meeting this threshold alone.</p><p> Although not directly within the remit of this committee, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is concerned that a significant proportion of the poorest lone parents will lose out under the new national childcare scheme.  The average weekly cost of school-age childcare is &euro;145.  However, the maximum subsidy a lone parent will get under the national childcare scheme is &euro;45 per week for 12 hours when his or her child turns seven.  This is at the same time when they are also subject to labour activation measures.  We believe that a lack of sufficient childcare hours will undo any potential budget 2020 measures introduced by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection aimed at reducing in-work poverty among lone parents.  Therefore, further investment in the targeted aspects of the national childcare scheme is required in budget 2020 to ensure that the poorest families do not lose out.</p><p> With regard to energy poverty, we are concerned that energy unaffordability persists without accounting for any potential increases in carbon taxes.  The combination of increased energy prices, poor quality housing and the persistence of low income impacts on the households we assist.  At current levels, fuel allowance is insufficient to meet the cost of energy for people on low incomes.  An additional week of fuel allowance was introduced in budget 2019.  This brought the payment to &euro;630 for the winter months.  To restore the payment to 2010 levels in real terms, it should be increased to &euro;830.  Increasing the living alone allowance by &euro;3 can also provide additional protection to older people who are more vulnerable to energy poverty.</p><p> Last month, we received more than 200 calls per day from worried parents struggling with education costs.  In our submission to the Minister for Education and Skills, we ask for investment to provide all children with free school books at primary level and an end to the practice of voluntary contributions.  To help alleviate some of the pressure on families, we also ask that child benefit is made payable to all children until the end of secondary school regardless of age.</p><p> The exceptional needs payment is a critical scheme for low-income households and is often a scheme of last resort for people in difficult circumstances.  However, delays and difficulties in accessing services create unnecessary stress and strain on people when they are vulnerable.  It is critical that front-line Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection services are adequately funded and that the total budget available for exceptional needs payments is increased by &euro;11 million to meet unexpected costs faced by low-income individuals and families.</p><p> Budget 2020 must reflect a real commitment to tackling poverty and deliver on the goal of a fairer and more inclusive society.  This will require a genuine whole-of-government approach to budgetary decisions and assessing all public expenditure against its impact on poverty.  When prioritising resources, decisions should be equitable, fair and just, should protect the vulnerable, should address structural inequalities and should promote the well-being of this and future generations.</p></speech>

I call Mr. White from the National Council for the Blind Ireland, NCBI.  If Mr. Reid wishes to comment, he is welcome to so do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.935" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris White" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019092600002#H00300"><p>I will be opening and Mr. Reid will be closing.</p> <p>  The NCBI is grateful to the Chair and the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the opportunity to speak to it today about the issues with employment affairs and social welfare needs for people who are blind or visually impaired.  The National Council for the Blind Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s national charity working for the rising number of people affected by sight loss.  At NCBI, we work every day with people of all ages, from young children to those reaching their 100th birthday.  The majority of people with whom we work have some remaining vision, while only a small percentage are completely blind.  The 2016 census figures show that there are currently 54,810 people with sight loss living in Ireland and this number is rising.  Anecdotally, we suggest that it underrepresents the actual number of people with sight loss in the country.</p> <p>  One of our major concerns relates to employment and the employment rate.  The 2016 census found that the level of labour force participation among people who are blind and visually impaired in Ireland is only 24.4%.  That means, of the 24,000 working age adults in Ireland, only 5,856 are in employment.  Unfortunately, this compares poorly internationally.  The employment rate in the UK is 27%, 38% in Canada and 42% in Australia.  This means that people who are blind or visually impaired in Ireland are one of the most marginalised communities in the country and Irish society, one which is not identified or spoken about in any meaningful way.</p> <p>  In an economy which claims to have nearly full employment, with employers actively undertaking expensive international recruitment drives to attract talent, and the conversation about that, it means that both private and public employers are consistently overlooking and not utilising or capturing the skills of people with disabilities in Ireland.  Not only is this a missed opportunity, it also demonstrates significant inaction in making the national workforce more inclusive.  We know from users of the NCBI employment service that once given the opportunity to work, people who are blind or visually impaired demonstrate real competency and loyalty to their employers.  Anecdotally, the retention rate is far higher among employees with sight loss once they are recruited than among those without a disability.</p> <p>  A key component in making the workplace more attractive and getting more people with sight loss into employment is the workplace adaptation grant.  That is a contribution of up to &euro;6,350 by the State.  It can also be used to upgrade adapted equipment that may have been previously funded.  Applications in excess of this sum will be considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,543 if specialist training for assistive technology is required.  The total amount of money allocated in 2018 was &euro;87,000 from just 39 applications.  If the State was to increase the allocation from &euro;87,000 to &euro;1 million in 2020, this would result in at least 314 people accessing the grant and taking up employment.  The cost to the Exchequer from various welfare payments to those people who are currently unemployed is &euro;3,314,000 a year.  Taking these people from a benefit trap and putting them into work has a minimum net gain to the Exchequer of &euro;1.3 million without considering any additional taxation that would accrue from their participation in the workforce.</p> <p>  Our requests with regard to employment are to value the community of people with disabilities and sight loss who are being excluded from the workplace and a contribution of &euro;2 million to the workplace adaptation grant, which would pay for itself.  The workplace adaptation grant should be administered consistently across the country.  Various Departments and local branch offices have different interpretations of what the administration means.  It needs to be extended to include the not-for-profit organisations, which cannot currently avail of grants and are expected to provide the required adaptations from their existing inadequate funding.  The Department needs to fund a national awareness campaign that proactively promotes the employee retention grant scheme and workplace adaptation grant, targeted at employers who are largely ignorant of the available supports to encourage them to recruit people with sight loss and other disabilities.</p><p>In keeping with that, the free travel scheme is valued by all those who can avail of it and needs to be retained.  However, not all people with sight loss are eligible for the scheme.  Many are unable to obtain a driver&rsquo;s licence, but also do not qualify for the scheme.  An alarming 700 people use our services who have no other option but to pay for each journey on public transport to school, college, work and leisure activities as they do not have sufficient vision to drive a car but are not eligible for the scheme.  Access to free travel is not a luxury for this specific cohort.</p><p> According to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the cost of the free travel scheme in February 2019 was &euro;101 per person.  Adding 700 people with sight loss to this group would cost the State an additional &euro;70,700.  Our ask is that the eligibility criteria for access to the free travel scheme be changed to include those with a long-term eye conditions, which render their level of vision insufficient to meet criteria for a driver&rsquo;s licence.</p><p> I will give an example in the form of the personal story of Des Keaney.  Des lives in County Leitrim.  He is one of the 700 people who cannot drive but is not "blind enough" to be entitled to a free travel pass from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Des has worked all of his life and is now retired.  He has to depend on his wife to drive him wherever he wants to go, otherwise he has to pay the full price for each journey he takes on public transport.  Access to free travel would give Des the independence to take more journeys on public transport to bring him where he needs to go rather than relying on others to drive him.</p><p> The rate of labour force participation among people who are blind and vision impaired in Ireland is only 24.4% and community employment, CE, schemes present an excellent opportunity to get back into the workforce for these people.  Our ask is that the Department extend the workplace adaptation grant to those on social activation schemes, such as CE, T&uacute;s and others, and people who are blind and vision-impaired should be allowed to apply for a second social activation scheme so that they can get experience with another employer.</p><p> In another personal story, in 2015, David Kortukohun got in touch with NCBI.  He had worked his entire life and wanted to get back to employment after he had experienced a reduction in his sight as a result of glaucoma.  He availed of NCBI's employment advisory services, orientation and mobility service and our technology service.  In 2019, David was given the chance to take up a position on a CE scheme.  David needed magnification software to enlarge everything on his computer screen to take up the role.  However, as the organisation offering him the job was a charity, a section 39 organisation, his employer could not apply for the workplace adaptation grant and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was unwilling to allow his application to go forward.  This meant that he could not get the technology that would enable him to get work experience and get back into the world of work.</p><p> Research has been carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and the NCBI, which found the minimum for an essential standard of living for a single adult with vision impairment was 18%, or &euro;44, more on a weekly basis than for a single adult in the main population.  We call on the Department to commit to an incremental increase in the basic social welfare rate for the blind pension and disability allowance ahead of inflation to address the additional costs of living with sight loss.  Mr. Darren Reid will give the committee some views on his employment experience.</p></speech>

I am a qualified social care worker but I have never been able to get a position in that field.  I have tried to get work in other fields but at every turn I have been told the employer did not have the capacity to offer me employment at that time.  I am either not qualified enough or the technology is not available.  Whenever I tell them about it, they say they cannot afford to get the technology.  On one occasion they said the technology does not exist.  I told them it did but they would not do the work to find it.  They were not aware of any avenue they could go down.  I have been offered a position in the Civil Service, for which I had to go through two years of competition.  It is not the avenue down which I wanted to go but it is a job I am now able and willing to do, because I want to work and to contribute to society.  It has been seven months since I was offered the position and I am still waiting to start, because of clearance and such issues.  When I am given a start date, I will have to wait for a further period before they put the technology in place.  It is not ideal and employers need to be aware of what is available for them to do.  The Government needs to get the word out that what has been done so far is not acceptable.  We want to work but 75% of us do not.  We are sitting around wasting taxpayers' money, not ours.  I am very fortunate to live at home with my parents, though I do not want to do that.  I want to be on my own but I cannot be.  Please sort this out - members have the opportunity to do so.</p></speech>

It is a starting point.  Senator Higgins noted the very low level of support for workplace adaptations, from which point &euro;2 million would be a reasonable uplift.  It probably needs to be multiples of that figure, but, with pressures on budgets, it is not an unreasonable point as it would pay for itself within 12 months.  Any such investment should pay for itself within that period.</p></speech>

As the delegates will be aware, my colleague in the Civil Engagement group, Senator John Dolan, works with the Disability Federation of Ireland; therefore, there is an overlap.  As we push forward and make a case, it would be useful for us to have a sense of the numbers from the monitoring of persons, even if it is informal.  We would then be able to say whether there were 50 or 100 cases of people whose potential employment was effectively refused because of this issue.  If the grant allocation is exhausted by February, we need to be marking this politically.  Persons with a disability who are seeking a workplace adaptation grant for the rest of the year have effectively been denied the opportunity to work.  It is similar to the gender pay gap in that there is a point in the year at which the disparity comes into play.  We will be looking at gender inequality proofing which is a requirement for all Departments during our hearing on the Estimates for the social protection budget.  We should raise the issue of inequality proofing with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection because of the differential in the offers being made.</p> <p>  We have not discussed the other issues, but I thank the delegates for raising them.  The point about the blind pension was well made and is taken, as is the one about expansion of the free travel schleme.  I would like to move towards blanket free travel, much wider access to and the promotion of free public transport owing to other imperatives, including energy, but this is yet another area where it is important.</p></speech>

If one looks at issues of sustainability and access, people with disabilities are generally unable to take up opportunities to avail of public transport.  They are not able to use it effectively because the transport system is not user-friendly for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

I was glad to see a focus on private rental accommodation and particularly those who are dependent on either rent allowance or the housing assistance payment, because there is huge vulnerability.  A few issues were mentioned in that regard, including energy poverty.  It is a key concern because persons living in private rental accommodation are dependent on State support for their private rental payments.  They are clearly in an economically vulnerable position, as they are not necessarily in a position to minimise their energy bills, as the power and control rest with landlords.  We need to ensure landlords bring buildings up to standard in order that the cost of heating them is not disproportionate.  As we know, it will increase in parallel with the price of carbon.  However, we must do it in a way that will ensure rental security.  I have teased out this issue before and proposed amendments on it in relation to part IV tenants, for example.  Homes being retrofitted for energy security purposes should not be regarded as being within the definition of refurbishment in the way we often see it being used as a rationale for the ending of secure or part IV tenancies.  It is a genuine concern.  I have spoken to many people who are afraid to raise concerns about the properties they are renting because they know that refurbishment would result in their losing their tenancies.  In that sense, it is a trap.  That is just one issue, in which I am interested because the submission identifies that danger and I wanted to tease it out a little more.  We need to figure out how to build in that security while ensuring energy poverty does not become an issue.  In yesterday's debates we heard that energy or fuel poverty was defined as fuel costs being 10% of one's income.  However, in its submission the Society of St. Vincent de Paul notes that for private renters, in many cases, 40% of their income is spent in putting a roof over their heads.</p> <p>  I was also interested in the focus on lone parents and income disregards.  Income disregards were substantially cut back in 2012 and have since been incrementally restored, although not increased.  According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's measurements, how close are we to full restoration?  Research into minimum essential standards of living highlights the huge costs associated with older teenagers.  However, the jobseeker's transitional payment terminates when a child is 14 years old, while the one-parent family payment terminates when a child is seven.  Between the ages of 14 and 18 years, lone parents effectively lose the benefits of the jobseeker's transitional payment, which means that they also lose the income disregard.  As well as increasing income disregards, do the delegates think it is important to increase the level of the jobseeker's transitional payment to ensure the income disregard would continue until a child either reaches 18 years, at a minimum, or leaves school?  That case is made elsewhere in the document.</p></speech>

The split incentive is a huge challenge in that landlords are unlikely to upgrade homes because they do not see an initial benefit, while low income tenants do not have the means to do it themselves.  Many of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's schemes are only available to low income homeowners.  There are no schemes available for those who are renting privately.  The uptake of the better energy homes scheme by landlords is less than 3%.</p><p>There are not enough incentives to encourage landlords to upgrade their properties without it having a negative impact on the supply of rental properties or rents in order that they will not be increased.  Landlords who have made this investment may want to increase the rent the charge.  While there are challenges, there is a huge opportunity if measures are designed properly.  If there are incentives for landlords that are conditional on security of tenure, that is, where a landlord is willing to rent his or her property to a HAP tenant for a long tenancy period of five or ten years, they can access grants to upgrade their properties.  That is something we have put forward and it would require a long lead-in time.  We have suggested that by 2030 all private rented accommodation have a C building energy rating, BER, or above.  It is a long-term ask and would require incremental changes over a number of years to reach it.</p><p> The State is the landlord of approximately 140,000 households.  It is a very straightforward way of upgrading the stock of housing.  Social housing tenants are as much at risk of being in energy inefficient homes as those in the private rented sector.  These are two issues that need to be looked at in the climate action plan and considering how we will tackle energy poverty.  This is very important, particularly if carbon taxes are to be increased.</p></speech>

The refurbishment of local authority housing seems to be extraordinarily slow.</p></speech>

We should look at the entire stock of housing.  Is Dr. Keilthy proposing or outlining the possibility of a carrot and stick approach being taken, whereby there would be an incentive for those who offer long-term tenancy security, that, in effect, there would be a stick in that at a certain point, if a private rental property was below a certain energy rating, it is something which might need to be marked, noted or penalised in some way?  If someone does not want to offer long-term tenancy security, he or she would have the choice to reach that standard privately.</p></speech>

Reaching the C grade would be quite a leap in the case of a lot of rental properties.  The shallower measures such as attic and cavity wall insulation can help in some ways and are not as costly as deeper retrofits which should be prioritised in the case of local authority housing.</p></speech>

A survey of income and living conditions has been conducted up to 2017 and there have been some incremental improvements in the last two budgets in supports for lone parents at work to undo the effects of some of the cuts implemented during the austerity years.  We hope to see an improvement in the figures once the new data are released towards the end of the year.  The earnings disregard was increased to &euro;150 in budget 2019.  In nominal terms, it was higher than it was before being cut, but in real terms because of the number of hours worked and the national minimum wage, it was below it.  It needs to be increased to &euro;166 per week to reflect the increases in the national minimum wage in order that the same number of hours can be disregarded as in 2010.</p> <p>  The Senator is 100% correct on the jobseeker's transition payment and jobseeker's allowance.  There is a very complex system in place that a lone parent needs to navigate if he or she is working part-time.  If someone is working part-time and on the national minimum wage, when his or her child reaches the age of seven years, he or she will have to choose between keeping the working family payment or using the earnings disregard attached to the jobseeker's transition payment.  Either of these options will leave the person concerned approximately &euro;80 less well off every week.  This issue has to be looked at.  We have recommended that the working family payment be made payable with the jobseeker's transition payment to ensure people would not lose out in the transition phase.  </p> <p>  When the youngest child reaches the age of 14 years, the earnings disregard changes, such that the person concerned can spread the hours over five days, but if someone is on jobseeker's allowance, he or she can only work his or her hours over three days in a week.  That is the difference.  He or she will lose out and the earnings disregard is a lot lower also.  We agree and have it included in our proposal that the jobseekers' transition payment period be extended until someone's youngest child is 18 years.  It is a critical point that there be investment in training and education supports for those furthest from the labour market to enable them to make the transition to sustainable employment and decent work once their youngest child is 18 years old.</p> <p>  Last year was the first time the State recognised the additional costs faced by parents with older children when the qualified child increase for children over the age of 12 years was introduced.  It was largely based on the work of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice which showed that the cost of supporting a teenager was significantly higher than that for younger children.  There is a mechanism in place, but the increase needs to be a lot greater to meet the total cost of raising a teenager.  It also needs to be increased in the budget.</p></speech>

I would have preferred to have seen the word "adequacy" included in the terms and conditions of the Low Pay Commission.  I regret that it was not.  It is the fundamental test of pay.  </p> <p>  On the working family payment, under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, the figure is 15 hours.  Does Dr. Keilthy agree with me that those who are entitled to 15 hours of free early years education are required to be working 19 hours a week in order to qualify for the working family payment?  Does she have any comment to make on the disjoint?  It affects those who may be working 15 or 16 hours a week and who may need to work for 19 to qualify for the working family payment. </p></speech>

As I outlined in the opening statement, the national childcare scheme is going to see the poorest lone parents lose out if it is implemented in the way intended.  If there is a gap in the childcare subsidy, the benefit of any increase in employment support could potentially undone if the subsidy is not responsive to the needs of lone parents.</p> <p>  On the adequacy piece, it is important to say there has been much discussion about indexing social welfare payments.  There are many options in that regard, one of which is indexing payments in keeping with the consumer price index.  Another is indexing wages.  We hold that the majority of social welfare payments are below what is adequate to achieve a minimum standard of living.  If people are below that standard and one indexes without reaching the benchmark of adequacy, essentially one will copperfasten poverty in that increases will be based on what is an inadequate income.  Payments need to reach that benchmark and one indexes from that point.</p></speech>

There is a similar issue with the thresholds for receipt of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  The threshold for a one-parent family is much lower than for a two-parent family.  Equalising the thresholds would allow more lone parents to access the allowance.</p><p>We do not really understand why there are two different thresholds for that because the costs are the same regardless of whether there is one or two parents in the household.</p></speech>

We are a strong advocate of the living wage and have made submissions to the Low Pay Commission on the issue.  We need to increase our national minimum wage in order that it bridges the gap with the living wage but it is also about ensuring that people's costs of living are low.  That is that whole-of-government approach regarding housing costs as well, in order that people who are working also have a decent standard of living.</p></speech>

I went off on a tangent, but she talked about restoring the lone-parent payment of &euro;166 to its 2011 level.  She referred to the minimum wage and the number of hours worked.  One of the challenges and one of the key things to keep an eye on in a social welfare budget is that when somebody is given an increase in whatever the allowance might be, there is not an unintended consequence in that he or she misses something else - for example, the threshold for a medical card.  It is important that that type of proofing goes into a budget as well.</p></speech>

I think it is my first time at a meeting of the committee since Deputy Curran took over as Chairman.  I believe from colleagues that he does a very good job.  I am delighted just to sit in on the discussion.  I apologise for being very late.  I was the lead speaker at a housing committee meeting and I could not leave.  I became aware that this committee had guests whose opening statements I would have liked to have heard but I am very familiar with a lot of the content, certainly of the presentation made by Mr. White, who is very welcome, as is Dr. Keilthy and Mr. Reid.</p> <p>  To pick up on a point the Chairman made, and I have discussed it with the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, a couple of times, part of the problem is that one must be permanently certified as not being capable of driving; for life, as such.  There are some discrepancies that I believe are being looked at.  It is frightfully unfair.  Even if people are not in a position to drive because of their eyesight, they should be issued with time-dated travel passes such that in, say, five years' time, if whatever treatment they may go for renders their sight possibly suitable for driving, the passes would become void or whatever.  There must be a way around the whole permanency issue.</p> <p>  Overall, the big issue I have with social protection - and we need to start looking at it - is where the welfare system prevents people from having the motivation to go out to work, not because of core payments but, as the Chairman said in his comments, because of the additional benefits that are critically important to people such as medical cards and similar services and important supports.  What I would therefore like to see is a move away from a budget process and model whereby we give a &euro;5 across-the-board payment to everybody - including old-age pensioners and contributory pensioners, even if they have alternative sources of income and other pensions - to one which front-loads supports to the areas of greatest need.  One such area is to ensure people with disabilities hold on to core benefits when they go into employment.  They can get a job for which they have worked hard and suddenly lose a whole raft of benefits.  That is not a progressive employment policy, and the thinking in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection must move away from across-the-board payments, full stop, whether in childcare, child benefit or pensions.  Supports need to be front-loaded in an effort to get people out of welfare who are well capable of doing so but are terrified of the prospect of losing key benefits, as they would see them, particularly medical cards.</p> <p>  Regarding the National Council for the Blind's budget submission, it had a very successful engagement across the road in Buswells about a month or six weeks ago, probably more at this stage, which many Members attended.  The level of unemployment in this country among people who are visually impaired or blind is totally unacceptable, and the advocacy work that Mr. White and his colleagues - Kevin Kelly and others - are doing to try to address that is particularly impressive.  I appeal to the Chairman and other Members of the Oireachtas to become more engaged with the work the National Council for the Blind does.  I am on its board and I see its work at close range.  It is starting to make a difference.  With some extra supports at Government and political level, a huge amount could be achieved.</p> <p>  Again, I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak and apologise for being late.  This initiative from the committee is very worthwhile.</p></speech>

That has been a fear I have had ever since the opportunity to go into employment has been there - that I would lose my medical card benefit, my free travel benefit and so on.  A constant fear in the back of my head is by how much I will be in deficit relative to what I have now.  While I will go up in how much I earn, by how much will I go down in the cost of travel and medical insurance?  I am a permanently disabled person.  How much will I be charged for medical insurance?  I need to pay for this kind of thing.  My medical card will go away eventually, will it not?  I do not know.</p></speech>

We considered why people were getting jobs and the whole area of loss of supports and benefits.  As Mr. Reid rightly said, just because one gets a job does not mean the disability, whatever it might be, does not remain.  We were quite clear that those supports need to be maintained in employment as in unemployment.  We made that point very specifically.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Conway for his contribution.</p><p>The sight loss community is very large but it has been very much overlooked and taken for granted, although not in any deliberate manner.  We are conscious of that and of the fact that sight loss is a growing area and people with sight loss can make a significant contribution.  We are looking at massive inward investment from the likes of Google and Facebook and from other European and US multinationals.  They are always on the hunt for talent.  They talk about talent attraction and talent retention.  They talk about the lack of talent in Ireland yet we have this outstanding pool of talent that, if enabled, supported and understood, can make a significant difference.  It can make a contribution to the quality of life of people with sight loss and other disabilities.  They can make a contribution to their families and to the workplace balance.  They can make a massive contribution to the work that is being done.  We have an opportunity in Ireland to stand out and to be front and centre of how disability and sight loss should be dealt with by employers.  We should be pushing IDA Ireland to make sure all the companies it is supporting with Government money have targets around employment for disability.  We should make sure those targets are upheld and that when $6 billion goes into Intel in Leixlip, some of it results in employment for people with sight loss, multiple sclerosis and other disabilities.  It is a fantastic opportunity to make a difference to how we do work in this country.</p></speech>

I just want to ask a really specific question on the issue around workplace adaptation grants.  As well as the increase in budget for workplace adaptation grants, is there a difference to be made in policy whereby somebody can hold provisional approval for a workplace adaptation grant or a company can be provisionally been approved for a grant?  The paperwork could be front-loaded so it becomes something that companies and maybe individuals hold while the recruitment process is under way.  The company can say it has already gone through the paperwork that would be required if it happened to employ a person who had a disability, sight loss or whatever it might be.  Similarly, a person would be able to go to two or three different employers and know that this is something they had.  That might be effective as a policy shift, as well as the increased budget, which is definitely needed.  My last question was about macular degeneration and the issue of medication.  Is there progress in this budget on the exclusion of that from the increased high VAT rate that was attached to macular degeneration supplements?</p></speech>

It would mean people or corporates having a tranche of funding allocated to them.  They would still have to prove that they actually have the people, but certainly being pre-approved for certain numbers of workplace adaptation grants is a good idea.  In the health services, personalised budgeting is coming down the line, where the money follows the person.  We could have an allocation of a workplace adaptation grant to, say, Mr. Reid, so that whether he works in the Civil Service, in the Garda or in Intel in Leixlip, the allocation would be to him as an individual.  That actually has a lot of merit in it.  I fully endorse the Senator's view and it is something we might take away.  We were supposed to be educating her but I would certainly take that as a really good idea.</p> <p>  On the issue of VAT on supplements for macular degeneration, there has been a moratorium on that and it has been pushed back so I think it has been addressed.  We are delighted that is not being placed as a barrier or additional cost to people trying to prevent it.</p></speech>

We have been advocating for it being grounded in evidence and that the evidence base is provided by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  As that minimum essential standard of living is used by the Insolvency Service of Ireland to determine living costs, it has stood the test of the courts.  It is accepted by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in that the qualified child increase, QCI, for older children was increased last year based on that research.  It not only provides where the needs are greatest but it also provides that whole-of-government framework because we can see where costs need to be reduced.  For example, if primary and secondary school were genuinely free, the rate of the QCI would not need to be increased by as much as the cost of living would be reduced as well.  It is a really important framework.</p> <p>  There is a challenge in terms of the cost of disability and how it is determined.  The NCBI mentioned the work that was undertaken by the Vincentian partnership to outline the additional costs faced by someone with a visual impairment but the cost will differ based on the disability.  There is quite a broad-ranging piece of work that needs to be done but it is very important.  In terms of the transition to employment, in research that we conducted last year fear of loss of the medical card came up increasingly.  There is a campaign to be done to help people understand what benefits they can retain if they do take up employment.  As Mr. Reid pointed out, there is that three-year cliff and the uncertainty around what happens there.  It is important to state that the thresholds for the medical card have not increased since 2005 so they are still well below all social welfare rates.  That needs to be looked at but obviously the overarching goal is universal health care in order that there is no means testing and it is just available to everybody based on need, not based on income.  </p> <p>  I would like to talk a little bit about Brexit because we are really concerned about the impact it will have on the people we are assisting.  We know that if there is a no-deal Brexit, we are going to see an increase in food and energy prices that will disproportionately hit people on low incomes.  In terms of budget choices, it is really important that those on the lowest incomes are safeguarded.  We do not want a repeat of the previous recession where those on the lowest incomes, particularly low-income women, took the hit for austerity.  In the forthcoming national action plan for social inclusion, we need to be ambitious around that and ensure there are safeguards in place if we are faced with another recession.</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee and am trying to bilocate and trilocate today.  I will look at the witnesses' submissions.  I wanted to take the opportunity to ask one particular question of the witnesses from the NCBI.  They may have seen some of the parliamentary questions I have been submitting about the situation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I hope Mr. White can shed some light on it.  Certain staff members were removed from the office in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and there was a possibility at one stage that the office would be closed altogether.  The service users were very distressed by that.  Despite assurances that the services would not be adversely impacted in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the service users are adamant that they have been and that the drop-in service in particular that used to be available there is effectively gone.  Telephone calls to the office are now being answered in Dundalk and many of the small but important services that were available before the staff member was removed are just not there any more.  They are extremely worried and are not terribly happy with the responses they have got from the HSE or the NCBI.  I would like to ask about that and whether the full range of services can be restored.</p> <p>  The other thing people asked was about membership for service users of the group company.  They feel that services should be service user-led or at least heavily influenced by service users.  That seems to me a very reasonable proposition.  They point out that in the Irish Wheelchair Association, service users can have membership of the group company and they see no reason that could or should not be the case in the NCBI.  Finally, on the expenditure on the new Tallaght headquarters, I do not know all the merits and demerits of it but there is a feeling among the service users in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that the expenditure on that is really what has impacted adversely on services in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I would like to hear some responses and comments on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-26a.1022" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris White" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019092600002#O00800"><p>I am happy to respond.  It is a difficult issue.  It is not easy to keep everybody happy about everything.  We have made commitments.  We were planning to merge our office in D&uacute;n Laoghaire with a new office in Tallaght.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire office gets &euro;104,000 per year from CHO 6.  The cost of running the CHO 6 service is &euro;420,00 per year.  As an organisation, we struggle for funding.  We only get approximately 70% State funding to provide our services and raise the rest of the money ourselves.  As would be expected on a value-for-money basis, we do the best we can with the money we have.  There was a proposal to move our D&uacute;n Laoghaire service.  Following discussions with, and demonstrations by, a small group of service users, we agreed to keep the office open.  It will remain open five days a week.  People still drop in to it.  The drop-in service to which the Deputy referred was never officially provided.  We do not operate such a service in any of our other 34 offices.  More people are now using our service in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, more services are being delivered and the quality of service is improving.  We are offering more services to more people at a higher quality and we have evidence to back that up.</p> <p>  On the Tallaght Cross move, we were originally located in Clondalkin.  As I pointed out to Senator Higgins, it was completely inaccessible to our service group as the transport links were very poor.  We moved office at our own expense with no Government support to Tallaght Cross.  The office is beside the Luas and Tallaght bus hub and affords easier access to a greater number of people throughout south Dublin.  We fully take on board that it is not the easiest place to get to from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but only a small number of the approximately 2,000 people who avail of our service in south Dublin live in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  That is not to say that those living in D&uacute;n Laoghaire do not wish to access our services.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire office remains open.  From our perspective, the service has improved.  We have added capacity and service quality in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and also offer services in Tallaght Cross.</p> <p>  On being a membership organisation, there are approximately 2,500 section 39 agencies and approximately 10,000 charities registered with the Charity Regulator.  A minuscule number of those have open membership, the Irish Wheelchair Association being one example.   Open membership sounds great but it is not representative of the need to listen to people and what they want.  It ends up with a big set-piece AGM held in Dublin and attended by people who want to be in Dublin, but it does not allow people in Tralee, Galway, Letterkenny or Athlone to engage with the organisation.  We have committed to launching an advocacy engagement strategy under which panels will be created.  I and members of the board will engage with the panels locally and that will feed up nationally to a service user representative panel.  We are more actively looking for people's views about what the service should and should not be.  We are going out of our way to invest in enabling people to express their views and we are seeking to implement those views in terms of what the NCBI should be doing.</p> <p>  I fully understand the views of the group in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have met its members on several occasions and corresponded with them.  I know where they are coming from.  If I had unlimited funds, I would happily have a service such as that in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in every part of the country, but I do not even have enough funds to run our current service.  We are one of the most underfunded big organisations.  We have experienced a 16% cut in funding since 2010, like many other organisations.  I acknowledge the frustration of the group, but we are doing a range of things to mitigate it.  Fundamentally, the office is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week to provide services.</p></speech>
