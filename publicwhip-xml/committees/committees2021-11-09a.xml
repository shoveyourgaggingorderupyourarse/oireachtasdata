Deputy Jennifer Whitmore is substituting for Deputy Holly Cairns.  Before we begin, I need to go through a few housekeeping matters.  I ask any member or witness participating remotely who experiences any sound or technical issue, to let us know through the chat function.  Otherwise, I will proceed.  I advise everybody that as this is a public meeting, the chat function on Microsoft Teams should be used only to advise participants of any technical issue or urgent matter and should not be used to make general comments or statements.  I remind members participating remotely to keep your devices on mute until you are invited to speak, and when you are speaking, I ask that, where possible, have your cameras switched on and be mindful we are in public session.</p> <p>  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside the precincts will be refused. </p> <p>  The first session today is with representatives of the Prevention &amp;amp; Early Intervention Network.  I would like to welcome Dr. Maria O'Dwyer, national co-ordinator, and Mr. Francis Chance, chairperson of the Prevention &amp;amp; Early Intervention Network.  The purpose of our meeting is to engage with you both in relation to strengthening prevention and early intervention supports to children and families post pandemic.  </p> <p>  Before I ask you to give your opening statement, I will go through parliamentary privilege.  As all of the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, you are directed by me to cease giving evidence about a particular matter, it is imperative you comply with any such direction.  You will be allocated three minutes for your opening statement.  We have a speaking rota, which has been circulated.  Each member will have five minutes for questions and answers.  We look forward to engaging with you both today on this very important topic.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. O'Dwyer to give her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maria O'Dwyer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#A00300"><p>Thank you very much Chair.  We very much welcome the opportunity to engage with members today about how we can invest now to ensure bright lives for children living in Ireland today, tomorrow and every day.  The Prevention &amp;amp; Early Intervention Network, PEIN, represents organisations and individuals working in children, family and community services throughout Ireland who are committed to developing a prevention and early intervention-led approach to service planning and delivery.  PEIN focuses on the most effective ways of building a protective layer of support to stop difficulties from arising in the first place and providing support at the earliest possible stage when these difficulties occur.<br/><br/>International and Irish research, Government policy and the experience of practitioners on the ground all clearly indicate the social and economic benefits of prioritising prevention and early intervention.  However, too often our supports to children and families are too little, too late.<br/><br/>We would like to use today&rsquo;s opportunity to talk about the impact of the pandemic on children and families, the impact of child poverty and adversity, the national policy environment for prevention and early intervention, the immediate priorities to shift front-line service delivery towards prevention, and the funding strategies needed to achieve this.<br/><br/>There is positive learning from the pandemic in terms of the widespread embracing of public health messages, our combined capacity to make quick changes to how we delivery our services, the adoption of virtual ways of working and the consensus that nobody should be left behind.  However, PEIN members tell us that those children who were most disadvantaged before the pandemic have suffered most because of it.<br/><br/>Our members' services are experiencing increased demand, based on pre-existing, new and emerging needs.  Anxiety, in particular, is having a debilitating impact on many children and many parents.  Adverse childhood experiences, ACEs, including the impact of poverty itself, result in serious physical and mental health issues across the life course. <br/><br/>Both prevention and early intervention are well referenced in a range of Government policy papers, including Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, First 5<i></i>and Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, these policies have yet to be fully implemented and there is a risk that preventive measures could become sidelined, as we continue to deal with onerous national crises such as the pandemic and homelessness.<br/><br/>Children should not wait to access services which are critical to their development.  There is a pressing need to ensure that the HSE services that screen children&rsquo;s development are immediately and fully resumed and that those babies born just before or during the pandemic are fully screened as soon as possible.<br/><br/>We also need to urgently reduce our waiting lists for the full range of early intervention services.  In failing to do this, many children may require intensive, long-term and costly interventions later on.  These are wholly avoidable. <br/><br/>Clearly, we cannot stop interventions to children with critical needs in order to invest in prevention and early intervention.  Instead, we need to reach a point of equilibrium, that delicate balance between crisis response and prevention.  We need to front-load and ring-fence funding to preventative services in order to achieve savings on crisis services in future years.  For example, PEIN proposes a strategic use of national lottery funding in order to front-load investment in preventative services.<br/><br/>We very much look forward to engaging with members this afternoon on the pivotal role that prevention and early intervention can play in shaping the child of three into the adult of 33.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. O'Dwyer for that opening statement, which I really appreciate.  I am very struck by the statement that there are good policies in place, but it is about the implementation of those policies.  We see reports like yesterday's drug task force report and the research done by the Tallaght drug task force, and it would be mirrored in the one I chair in Dublin 12.  Poverty and adversity in childhood set in motion a whole sequence of events that affect aspirations, opportunity, and marginalise children and keep them marginalised.  Knowing the current state of affairs, that we are coming out of a pandemic and  have much catching up to do as a result of the pandemic and that some services are still lagging behind and waiting lists have increased, what three things would the witnesses pick to prioritise and have us do if they were the Minister?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#A00800"><p>My apologies.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Chance" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#A00900"><p>I thank the Senator for her question.  When you are looking at the current environment in terms of policy, the problem is getting from paper policy into action on the ground.  As the chair of a drug task force, I am sure the Senator knows that.  I know well the situation in Tallaght and the work of the Tallaght drug task force, and that work is replicated around the country.</p> <p>  It is very hard to pick three things because the needs of children and families are multi-factorial.  They need integrated strategies across a range of Government environments.  I am going to pick three policy areas, which I think are urgent.  The first one is the national children's policy.  Our current national children's policy, although I should not say current because it is expired, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures finished at the end of last year.  We are currently without a national children's policy, and that is somewhat disturbing.  At the same time, I would like to acknowledge the work that has commenced in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the development of a new national children's policy, but it could well be towards the end of next year before we see that.</p><p>It is very important that we put the children with the greatest need and the prevention of need at the centre of that policy.  Before we ever had a pandemic, we had child poverty and child inequality, and it has gotten worse.  It has gotten worse for the children who were already in the worst position.  Therefore, we need to look at the policy and the implementation and at funding in those areas.</p><p> The second area would be in relation to Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is a really important policy in moving our health service from crisis to prevention.  The very first recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare is about child health; it is the first thing you come to when you read the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Yet, it seems Sl&aacute;intecare is in some crisis at the moment, and we are concerned that the focus is on institutional reform and structural reform, as opposed to direct service delivery reform.  We know that due to the pandemic a significant number of children have not been screened for health and development, and we really need to catch up on that, recommence those services immediately and make sure every child who missed his or her screening during the pandemic receives that screening now.</p><p> The final point I will talk about is in the area of the First 5 whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.  If we are serious about dealing with the long-term problems of children and their families, we need to start in pregnancy, or even before pregnancy, moving to early childhood.  We have a very good roadmap for that in First 5, but we need to invest in the implementation of that.  I would point, in particular, to the national model on parenting supports, which we have been privileged to work on with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and which is nearly ready for launching.  We need to look at a national strategy where every parent is provided with support in their parenting work, which is the most important work in society.  Those families that need extra support should get it, but we should also provide universal supports to each and every parent to every child born in Ireland.</p></speech>

Where has Mr. Chance seen that manifest itself in terms of what he would like to see prioritised?  Does he have any ideas on how to change that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Chance" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#B00300"><p>The area of recruitment and the recruitment of specific professionals is a real challenge within our health service as well as within Tusla in terms of social workers.  At third level, we need to be looking at what our workforce requirements are in the long term and at investing in additional training places so that we have a home-grown cohort of child health professionals and child well-being professionals coming on stream.  We also need to be looking at more creative ways of supporting and encouraging professionals to come from elsewhere to work within our children's services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#B00400"><p>I am good for now, Chair.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Dwyer, did you indicate you would like to speak?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maria O'Dwyer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#B00600"><p>I will add to what Mr. Chance said to the Senator in terms of recruitment.  In terms of the early years, we were making significant waves at the last budget.  The allocation for 4,700 new early years professionals is definitely something to be celebrated and championed.  However, we would be very cautious in terms of advising on the quality assurance, the training and the continuous professional development that accompanies that process.  To date, the early years have been lagging behind and while it is being addressed, there needs to be a simultaneous process with new recruits and support being put in to protect that cohort because quality, as we know, in terms of early years provision and providers is quality for children on the ground in the service they receive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#B00700"><p>From the early years perspective, the Fine Gael Party carried out a body of research recently that showed parents were very happy with the quality of their service providers, but they did not have a diversity of choice.  We do not have sport in early childhood, for example.  Deputy Dillon, who is here, would be very much into sport and supporting that.  We would like to have that diversity where every child's need and the holistic development of the child is supported in early childhood.  I hope that when we see the outcomes from professional planning, the joint labour committees, JLC, and so on that we will have a career path in childcare.</p></speech>

I was very interested to hear their call for new national child policy, but also interested to hear their point that we need to have an emphasis on practical steps to be taken.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  First, they referred to the need for and the importance of Sl&aacute;intecare, the importance of universal provision of healthcare and of screening for children's welfare and well-being.  Will they say a little bit more about how that would look on the ground?  For example, how would we screen children, how would public health nurses be assigned and how could we address waiting lists for children in healthcare, which I know has been a hugely topical issue lately?</p> <p>  The Labour Party is also pressing for a universal provision of childcare, for a public, universal free of access childcare scheme, because of all the difficulties parents and families are having accessing childcare at present.  The fees are high yet there are low wages for professionals working in the sector.  Our childcare system is currently failing all of those involved, and obviously and notably children.  Could Dr. O'Dwyer and Mr. Chance say a little more about how universalism might look in a childcare scheme?</p> <p>  Finally, I was very interested in the point that we need to balance crisis response and prevention in our strategies, and the call for the strategic use of national lottery funding, for example, to ensure a longer term approach.  Could Dr. O'Dwyer and Mr. Chance say a little more about how that would look in practice, and which prevention and early intervention services are working and what is good practice model?</p> <p>  Finally, I refer the catch up for children fund.  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and I have been promoting the need for a &euro;100 million catch up for children fund to try to alleviate and address some of the huge adverse impacts on children as a result of the Covid pandemic.  There may be a lot there, but they are few of the issues raised in the presentation.</p></speech>

Mr. Chance, will you be addressing those questions first?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Chance" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#B01100"><p>I will take the first and the third question, and I will let my colleague, Dr. O'Dwyer, to pick on the childcare services question.  On the first area of Sl&aacute;intecare, the great strength of Sl&aacute;intecare is that it is an inter-party agreement on what our health service should look like.  Over the last 50 years, since the introduction of the Health Act, we have been restructuring our health service repeatedly, and the health service has gone through a flavour of the current Government approach in terms of constant change.  If you are talking about major systems changes within our health service, you need a ten to 20 year strategy, and that can only happen if you have political consensus on that, and the great strength of Sl&aacute;intecare is that is what it achieved.  However, the most recent statements on Sl&aacute;intecare would indicate that breadth and that vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is being lost at the moment.  The slogan adopted by Sl&aacute;intecare was "Right Care, Right Place, Right Time" and that is really important in terms of prevention and early intervention.  Right care is about providing preventative services.  Preventative services will not always succeed, but on many occasions they will.  Where they do not succeed, then the earliest possible intervention is required.  We should not wait until the problem gets bad enough that intervention is required, which so often happens.  The right place is in the community, and ideally even in the family home with home visiting programmes.  The right time is as early as possible.</p> <p>  In terms of the current statements made about Sl&aacute;intecare, my concern is that it is all the right structure.  The belief seems to be that if we get the structure right, the other things will follow.  We have 50 years of history that show us that has not happened.  We need to go back to the original Sl&aacute;intecare vision, engage with that and move forward on all fronts and in an integrated way.</p><p>One of the key areas of Sl&aacute;intecare would be the investment in child health.  The particular suggestion within Sl&aacute;intecare is about public health nurses.  At the moment a public health nurse is responsible for everybody in his or her catchment area from birth until death.  It is a cradle-to-grave service which attempts to be all things to all people.  We strongly agree with both Sl&aacute;intecare and First 5 that the time for that approach is long gone.  We need a more specialised approach.  Older life and end-of-life care need a specialist approach.  Equally children and families need a specialist approach.  There is a very clear recommendation in both Sl&aacute;intecare and First 5 that we should have a cohort of public health nurses who are responsible only for the children and families of their catchment area.  That is going to provide a better service to those children and families and facilitate greater integration with the work of other agencies such as Tusla, with early years services and with education and other services.  </p><p> I will talk a little about the national lottery suggestion.  One of the key things about prevention and early intervention is that it has the potential to change costs significantly in the longer term, but for that to happen it needs to be front-loaded.  The savings that you will create in prevention and early intervention take a number of years to kick in so there needs to be an early investment within that.  We are pointing to three different strands within that.  One is that every State agency and Government Department that impacts on the life of children and families should be required to identify what its current spend is on prevention and early intervention, and then should work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to incentivise and gradually increase that spend over a ten-year period.  For example, a Department or State agency might set out to transfer 2% of its crisis funding into preventative funding on a gradual, slow basis, as obviously we must meet the needs of children in crisis as well as preventing children being in crisis in the future.  </p><p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had a prevention and early intervention unit in the life of the last Government which has been repurposed for the life of this Government.  There was much good background policy work done there and we call for that to be resumed and continued, and that Departments would have an incentive fund from which they could encourage and support Departments to make those kind of moves.  There would be a fund they could draw on to support those transitions from crisis towards early intervention.  </p><p> In regard to the national lottery, we recently had an opportunity to look at some work going on in Northern Ireland and how the national lottery has been used there and throughout the UK in a much more strategic and purposeful manner than we have used it here.  The review of the functioning of the national lottery, which is being carried out at the moment under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, gives us an opportunity to consider earmarking an amount of funding from the national lottery.  If we earmarked one month's income, or &euro;21 million, to invest in prevention and early intervention services each year - once there is a proof of need, the approach is proven and, most importantly, there is a commitment from State agencies that if the approach works, they will pick up on the funding in future years - there could be a real opportunity to use the national lottery in a much more strategic and creative fashion than has the been case to date.</p></speech>

Their presentation was very interesting and I appreciate the suggestions they are making.  They are coming up with relatively simple and feasible solutions to the obvious needs of so many children throughout the country.  The fact that we have nearly 200,000 children in poverty is a stain on our society.  We will certainly see a greater impact following Covid-19.  So many children who were already left behind will now get a double hit because of Covid-19.</p> <p>  Mr. Chance has said that the impacts of poverty include serious physical and mental health issues.  Can he give details?  What does that mean for children and families in real-life circumstances?  What does it look like?  I ask him to bring us back to the ground level of what all this really means.  What impact is it having on so many families?</p> <p>  The suggestions that have been made by Mr. Chance are very good.  Has he had any input to the Department?  Has he had consultations with regard to the national childcare policy, which is being developed at the moment?  Have there been any consultations with representatives of the Prevention &amp;amp; Early Intervention Network.?  Their input is very good.</p> <p>  Mr. Chance suggested that &euro;21 million could be made available from the national lottery.  Has he costed up what it would take to provide funding for the early intervention he spoke of?  To be honest, &euro;21 million seems a very small amount in the context of such a widespread problem that covers so many different portfolios and regions.  Has he costed it?  What would &euro;21 million achieve in the context of early intervention?</p></speech>

The pandemic has doubly disadvantaged families that were already disadvantaged before it began.  As a result, we are starting to see more tangible and evident forms of poverty in regard to fuel poverty and green poverty, etc.  I will bring it back to the basics of physical and mental health and start from there.  Children who grow up in families where there is responsive caregiving, where their cues are being met and where there is attunement, attachment and security with the parents from the time they are born enjoy a foundation of learning for later in life and positive mental health to be maintained throughout the course of their lives.  In families that experience disadvantage on an ongoing basis, on an occasional basis or on an emergency basis as in the case of Covid-19, responsive caregiving is not doable to the full extent.  In such cases, parents cannot engage with children in a way that is for the best, optimal development of the child mentally and physically.  Small daily caregiving activities like providing opportunities to play and reading to babies do not happen in such families.  We see that increasingly as a result of the pandemic.  A couple of years ago, there were atrocious pictures of a child in emergency homeless accommodation whose space to play was between the beds.  As a result of direct provision and the pandemic, we are seeing more and more of those confined spaces.  This has a significant impact on the development of gross and motor development skills.  Many children do not have access to play or access to nutrition.  We know that food poverty was heightened during the pandemic.  Families have always experienced food poverty, but the closure of early years services in schools heightened food poverty, which had an impact on nutrition.</p> <p>  Engagement with services is something we see with families who are experiencing difficulties.  It is not as linear.  If you have a problem, you know where to go and there is signposting.  If there is a whole other plethora of things going on for that family, the access to those services is not as direct as it should be.  Nationally we spend a great deal of time thinking about how to unblock referral pathways and uncomplicate the systems we have.  Sometimes we unblock those referral pathways more for the service providers than for the families at the end.  We really have to start with where the families are.  We can get a bit sniffy - I do not know if that is the right word - when we talk about technology.  There is a sense that if somebody does not have an iPad or does not have access to such-and-such, it is a very middle-class concern.  I would say that prior to the pandemic, in child development we would have thought that having a screen was not essential.  The pandemic taught us that we have a significant digital divide in Ireland between those who can access technology and those who cannot.  We saw it in such things as homeschooling.  It was not even always about the technology itself, but about having a space or an extra device in the house that a parent could use.  Parents and families were struggling, which impacted on learning.</p> <p>  In regard to the health and development of children who are experiencing poverty, their outcomes are always impeded by the circumstances they live in, for example if they are on waiting lists.  Currently there is a two-year waiting list for early intervention services.  If an issue is flagged, the two-year wait sometimes means that the prevention and early intervention window has been missed and the problem is likely to escalate.</p><p>We see that with speech and language attainment.  Initiatives such as the early based childhood programmes are doing stellar work in community clinical joint interventions where previously something like a speech language deficit or delay was picked up at the seven- to nine-months check-up, and maybe would not have been spotted again until school.  We now know in the early years that such deficits are being picked up earlier through the early years community clinical collaborations, such as ABCs, so now there is a chance of prevention and early intervention.</p><p> In regard to life opportunities over the life-course, we know children are exposed to things such as domestic violence at home, in which there was a 25% increase over the pandemic, and to levels of aggression.  It is very hard for parents who cannot regulate themselves to support regulating their children.  That is a cycle.  We saw in the pandemic the expectation that all parents can stay calm and guide children through this when in fact half the adult population was panicking.</p><p> In regard to prevention and early intervention, the message there is about getting in early enough and learning from the pandemic.  For example, mental health services ironically were one of the last to manage to go online effectively.  While the business and education sectors pivoted, mental health services which should have been front of stage were a little later to come online, so the impact of that meant that those with high anxiety who were supporting children who probably had high anxiety did not have access to support as and when needed.</p><p> The key message about child poverty and disadvantage is we cannot be offering too little, too late.  It has to be when they need it, and in most cases for us, before they need it.  I will hand over to Mr. Chance.</p></speech>

That is universal supports to all children and families, and targeted supports to children in families with high levels of need.  It is that whole continuum.  It is important to say that prevention and early intervention is not something that just happens in the State sector or something that happens in the community sector, but it is something that needs to happen in both the voluntary and community sector and the State sector in a joined-up way.</p> <p>  We have had many opportunities to input to policy.  We have had inputs to Sl&aacute;intecare, to First 5 and we are seeking to input into the new children's strategy and we are inputting to the review of the national lottery.  A key element of how we do our business is to represent the views of our members.  We are launching a paper later on this week on direct provision, looking at how the community and voluntary sector and the State sector can work alongside the Minister and the Department to end direct provision and support the integration of children and families currently in direct provision into local communities.  We have a unique offering to bring to that particular table.  We are very much engaged in every opportunity and particularly we have been working intensely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the development of a national model for parenting supports.  This was a very intense piece of work over the past 12 months.  We look forward to the Minister launching that hopefully in the very near future and seeing it turn into action.</p> <p>  In regard to costing our proposals I take the point that &euro;21 million is a small amount and our vision by no means stops at that.  That is a starting point.  The suggestion we were making was that over time we should grow the percentage of lottery funding that is spent on children and families in accordance with the percentage of our population who are under the age of 18.  That would over time move that &euro;21 million up to a rolling investment fund of &euro;60 million.  That is significant.  In terms of costing out the proposals, one of the things we feel is very important is that this needs to be done locally, in local communities and around local need.  There needs to be national guidance and national structures which identify what we need in terms of prevention and early intervention, what it looks like and what services should be available to every child and every family no matter where they live in Ireland.  Then each local community should work together under the auspices of their children's services committee, State providers and community and voluntary providers with children and families, talking about how that would look in their particular community.  The supports that might be needed on an Aran island would be very different from the supports provided in north inner-city Dublin.  The key thing is that each child and each family gets the equivalent range of supports no matter where they live.</p> <p>  There is a piece of work to do on costing but we see that as part of the process to identify what our goals are and then cost that, but to have some initial funding ready to invest in it at the earliest possible time.</p></speech>

It is a very engaging conversation.  I have two questions to follow up on.  From reading the literature, I know the witnesses were involved in building new tools to assist delivery of service planning such as outcomes for children data and the information hub.  Could they provide the committee with some information on these two initiatives?  Also, Mr. Chance spoke about the strategic use of national lottery funding to front-load investment in preventative services.  Could we have some additional information on this?  In regard to the suite of services that must be delivered through a combination of both statutory and NGO providers, what is their experience to date, both through practice and through international evidence, that provides reliable data to ensure that we have supports around early years care and educational services around health education and also spanning family supports?  I would be interested to hear about evidence on the ground in the provision of this suite of services.</p></speech>

The first question I will pick up on is about outcomes and outcomes measurement.  It is an area within the child and family sector where significant strides have been made in the past number of years.  What happened in Ireland traditionally in policy development around delivering services was we tended to pilot everything.  We would have pilot after pilot, then evaluations of them, and then we started something new.  The first national children's policy involved asking what are we looking for and what do we want to do differently.  That meant that for the first time we were going to undertake some collective mapping and gathering of collective data.  Rather than always looking at individual projects, they were banded together to look at the data that emerged both individually and as a collective.  The early based childhood initiative and project would have been the first big attempt at that nationally in terms of a national evaluation on the measurement of child outcomes.</p> <p>  With regard to outcomes frameworks, it can get quite complicated.  We look at things quantitatively and we want data and datasets.  What we need to do with outcomes frameworks is the balance of both, qualitative and quantitative.  At the end, the question is always whether it was value for money.  That is wearing the financial hat.  The ultimate question is whether it benefited children and families.  If it did, how do we do more and how do we learn to do it better?  If it did not, how do we change it?  There are many tools used and there is an attempt to standardise those as well.  In Ireland at the moment, the Centre for Effective Services, CES, currently develops a significant database on outcomes and outcomes gathering.  We work closely with the CES on promoting and informing that where we can.</p> <p>  Part of it is ensuring that going forward we are not duplicating the data we are gathering.  Another part of it is that we now have enough instrumentation on research to be able to drill down to specific projects so while we can take collective data we also need to know about local context.</p><p>When a policy has been implemented nationally, many of its outcomes traditionally have been measured through Dublin.  We know that what happens in Dublin and the measurements for it will not be the same as in Kerry and in Donegal.  That kind of contextual and geographical element in outcomes frameworks is really important as well.  </p><p> I refer to the qualitative piece when we are trying to map outcomes for children.  We, as well as for many of the members, agencies and partners with whom we work, have honed the focus on the voices of the children for whom the services are provided and of the parents of service users.  For long time, services were done onto children and families, instead of being done with them.  We are now starting to see children&rsquo;s voices being incorporated into those outcomes frameworks.  It is important to flag there can be much lip service in regard to that.  For an effective mapping or any kind of outcomes gathering, however, we want to make sure that those processes are genuine and that they are done in consultation with children and families.</p><p> We are lucky to have the kinds of data sets that we have in Ireland at the moment.  We can see that, for instance, with the recent ESRI publications.  The Growing up in Ireland study has given us a fascinating insight into the longitudinal development of children and into how families are supported and what that looks like.  We are starting to see how that started with babies.  For instance, in the "Seven Up!" documentary years ago in the UK after the Second World War, they mapped children at longitudinal junctures.  We are starting to do that here now.  It is creating significant data in understanding what goes on in the home environment.  For so long, the kind of data we had gathered on children was reported by parents.  What we need is data that has an insight into the home environment, which is obviously formative for child development.</p></speech>

Has the Prevention and Early Intervention Network seen any trends in this area, in child poverty or in early intervention?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maria O'Dwyer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#E00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for that good question.  We see discrepancies.  We see them in relation to rural-urban, as well as related to class.  Where we try to implement a project nationally we see that it will not mean the same thing in different places and in the interpretation of it.  If one looks aspects such as breastfeeding supports, for example, we take a population approach to how we promote breastfeeding.  However, if we gather data in, for example, the Traveller community, that data will be automatically skewed by the information and supports Traveller mothers and parents are given and the traditional inheritance of low uptake of breastfeeding in that community.  We are not, therefore, comparing like with like.  Often, we look at statistics and think that they are way down when actually we have not looked at the contextual data.</p> <p>  Similarly, some interesting work was done on play and the use or uptake of baby and toddler groups.  A survey in the late 1990s looked at play patterns through baby and toddler groups.  There was a significant discrepancy between rural and urban, but there should have been.  This is because in a rural environment, a baby and toddler group would be held in, for instance, a community hall.   That setting is far removed from what they would have in cities.  It is important to look at those types of things when looking at trends.  It is important that the data allows us to spot those kinds of differences.  </p> <p>  The pandemic shone a light on our misconception around play.  We have always thought that children in the country played far more outdoors than children in the city but actually they do not.  They are pretty much head-to-head at the moment.  We are finding that children in country and rural areas spend a significant amount of time in cars, being driven to different places, such as to sports, whereas for children in the city there is a local mobility.  We have had perceptions or misconceptions around play and child outcomes, or play as element and indicator of child outcomes.  We have to be conscious of nuances around rural-urban, class and culture, and those different nuances and potential divides that exist in how we do things differently.</p></speech>

I apologise if I am repeating things.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke in their opening statement about the national policy environment for prevention and early intervention.  One of the things I would like to get their insight into is that over the last few years, Tusla has put much effort into realigning its early intervention.  I appreciate that not every adverse childhood experience, or harm caused by poverty that we are looking to prevent, will be the sort of harm that will end up in front of a social worker or on a social worker&rsquo;s caseload.  We need to be careful not to say that every harm needs child protection response.  However, Tulsa acknowledges that.  It put much effort into the prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, and the Meitheal.  There was concern as these were being set up and rolled out that much of this was an unfunded mandate, so to speak.  The work Tusla should have been doing was pushed onto community groups without necessarily putting funding behind them.  The family resource centres were often involved in these.  Not all the family resource centres were being properly resourced or structured to do this. </p> <p>  I would love to hear the network&rsquo;s experience of the roll-out of the PPFS and Meitheal.  Did it help prevention and family support?  Is it a weakness?  Where are the weaknesses in it?  What do we need to look at?</p> <p>  Generally, what has worked well?  We have spoken about a couple of ideas here.  The network has spoken about endless piloting, which I must admit, brought a wry smile to my face.  However, in regard to the idea of endless piloting, what has worked well?  What did we pilot that worked well but which to which we never went back?  What are the obvious tricks that we are missing here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Chance" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#E00600"><p>I will take that question.  I remembered the Deputy&rsquo;s previous career as he asked the questions.  A key issue is that we are not starting from scratch here.  There have been 20 years of good work going on in Ireland on prevention and early intervention.  Some 20 years ago we started from scratch.  However, in particular thanks to Chuck Feeney and Atlantic Philanthropies, there has been a significant investment into children and families services over the last 20 years, with a particular bent to moving these towards prevention and early intervention.  That has been within the community and voluntary sector, as well as within the State sector.</p> <p>  In particular, the Deputy spoke about prevention, partnership and family support within Tusla.  That programme was funded by Atlantic Philanthropies in order to establish it.  A similar programme in which I was engaged with the Health Service Executive on the Nurture programme was about establishing and strengthening preventative services in the Health Service Executive.  It developed into what is now the national healthy childhood programme.  We are starting with good experience, knowledge, evidence and research within Ireland.</p> <p>  We have to note the departure of the Atlantic funding.  Chuck Feeney&rsquo;s model was giving while living.  He has now basically spent down all of his money.  Atlantic Philanthropies has now closed its doors.  We do not have another Chuck Feeney on the horizon.  Yet, we are a relatively wealthy country.  Borrowing money at the moment is cheap, as the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office has been telling us clearly in some of his recent contributions.  The opportunity to invest in early childhood is strongly there, if we can find ways to do that and find what is best to invest in. </p> <p>  A well done piece of research a few years ago asked parents what they found important and helpful in raising their children.  It asked them what the gaps were within that.  One of the things that came from that was that parents do not understand what services sit under what Departments, silos, and agencies.  They do not give a damn about that.  If they have a support need, they want the support.  The label attached to the person who gives the support is quite irrelevant.  We, in our agencies and services in Departments and structures, are all concerned about that but it is important that the supports are there.  Many of the families with whom we work - the more complex the family, the more likely this is to be true - require integrated solutions which require the input of more than one State agency, or more than one Department.  The role of the community and voluntary sector within that can be crucial as well, because it can been seen as an honest broker or less stigmatising for parents to link with.  There are those opportunities there to invest in local service provision.</p> <p>  I want to refer back to Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s last question about the national lottery.</p><p>It is an example of what I am talking about in regard to how we fund services.  We suggested eight criteria that should be used for national lottery funding in this area, including that the service must be focused on prevention and early intervention and that there would be a move to multi-annual funding of services or a three to five year period for funding of services.  Funding a service for 12 months and it not knowing at a particular time of year if it will be operational on 1 January is not good for children and families.  It is also not good for service development.  </p><p> Services must be new developments and funding should not be used to replace existing statutory funding.  We have seen evidence of funding being made available for something dressed up as a new service when it was just a recycling of an existing service.  Development money needs to be used on new services, not existing services.  There needs to be clear evidence of need for the service, including good local research on the service and why that particular model is appropriate.  There must be evidence of the effectiveness of that particular intervention.  Services are delivered in partnership with parents.  We do not do things to parents; we do things with them.  We consult parents and involve them in designing our services.  Parents are the key and lead partners in the delivery of services to them.  There needs to be strong evidence of integration with other services so that it is not about parachuting a service into a particular community, but about how that service will interact with continuous services in the area and will complement and work with those services in a joined-up way.  </p><p> Pilot funding is important.  There needs to be a commitment from the State agencies that if a pilot is shown to be successful, it will be prioritised for mainstream funding.  There is no point in having pilots that run for 25 or 30 years.  If a project is running for 25 or 30 years, either it is not working and it should be closed or it is working and it needs to be mainstreamed.</p></speech>

Many of the topics I wanted to address have been covered, but there is one specific issue troubling me, that is, the public health nurse system and the incredible backlogs in that system as a result of Covid.  In my CHO area there are up to 20,000 children who have not had their developmental checks.  That is incredibly worrying.  I cannot get an answer from the HSE on how it proposes to deal with that backlog.</p> <p>  Reference was made to our public health nurse system being a cradle to the grave system.  How can we remedy this system and also address the backlog therein?  What are the consequences of us not taking care of all of those children who are clearly missing out on developmental checks?  My son is among those who have not been checked.  That is what drew my attention to the issue.  As I said, my son is awaiting his development check.  He is not special; he is just one of the up to 20,000 children in CHO 8 awaiting a developmental check.  There is only one CHO in the area.</p></speech>

It is great to have personal experience coming into this discussion.  In recent days, I have heard of two different situations.  One case involved a baby born two weeks ago who was discharged from the maternity hospital with a particular health condition but the mother was not given good advice in regard to that condition or breastfeeding.  The mother and baby were supposed to get a home visit from a public health nurse within 72 hours of their arrival at home but that did not happen.  Instead, the mother received a telephone call asking her to attend the health centre.  She had never been there before and had not yet left the house with the baby.  She arrived late to the health centre because she could not access parking and she had a very rushed meeting with a public health nurse who suggested that because the baby had lost a little weight, the mother should cease breastfeeding and move to formula feeds immediately.  That was not appropriate advice.</p> <p>  In terms of the public health nurse piece, the most immediate priority is that every public health nurse be returned to full public health nursing duties away from any engagement in the Covid supports.  Otherwise in six months, 16 months or six years, babies who are being missed now in terms of developmental checks will be appearing in our services with deep-set difficult needs that will cost a lot to address.  It is important that we get that screening back in place.</p> <p>  The second piece is a look-back in terms of the pandemic with regard to the children who since March of last year have not been fully screened in relation to their needs.  They need to be screened properly now.  Last week, a parent told me that her child had just started school and she got a telephone call from the public health nurse asking her if everything was fine and if it was okay to discharge the child.  The public health nurse could not get off the phone quick enough.  Luckily, everything was fine.  If that had not been the case and the family had needed support, that telephone conversation was not one that would have encouraged them to voice their concerns or seek help.  Those things need to happen.  We need to do that look-back around the children born during the pandemic to identify if they have been fully screened.  Otherwise, we are setting ticking time bombs for our healthcare adult services into the future.  </p> <p>  The third piece is that we need to immediately start to progress in regard to child and family public health nursing.  Again, we are not working in a vacuum.  This has been happening extremely successfully for many years now in Longford and Westmeath.  A public director of public health nursing in that area many years ago had the foresight and vision to try a different structure within her own area.  Nobody stopped her and it has worked.  She has good evaluation in terms of care of older people and the care of children, as well as the satisfaction of the staff in that it is working.  We need to apply that nationally.  It is written in policy.  We need to do it.  The cost of doing it is clearly laid out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  The cost is &euro;14 million for a phased developed over a five-year timeframe.  That should have started in year one of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are now in year four of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a bit wobbly at the moment.  We need to bring it back on track and to catch up.</p></speech>

I thank Senator McGreehan for the question.  I would like to add to what Mr. Chance said.  The Senator will know from her own experience that while we worry about the delays in screening impacting the child and the long-term development, it also increases parental anxiety and stress.  The most confident parents in the world, in particular first-time parents, need to be told that the baby is putting on weight, doing great and hitting the milestones.  When that does not happen, it causes additional stress that parents do not need in an already fairly stressful time.</p> <p>  The second piece is the structural issue around the public health nursing system.  We tend to take a generalist approach to nursing.  We do not have dedicated child health nurses, similar to the UK model.  In Ireland, there is the possibility for collaboration with the community mothers programme.  It is about organisations stepping outside of themselves.  We are very tightly bound in terms of our clinical and community public health provision.  The community mothers programme has a 30-year history.  The community-clinical partnership can support and fill in some of the voids during that critical time.</p> <p>  In terms of screening, more than half of all the babies during the pandemic are currently on a waiting list for a developmental check.  That is a significant cohort of children.  Home visit programmes such as the community mothers programme, preparing for life programme, parent child home programme and Lifestart can offer critical support a time when there is a gap in other services.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late and missing the opening statements but I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber putting questions to the Taoiseach around early intervention in regard to assessments of need and the struggle parents face in getting assessments for their children.  Mr. Chance spoke about old services being dressed up as new services.</p><p>What is happening is that they are being watered down in the process, going from assessment of needs to a standard operation procedure.  The Ombudsman for Children who appeared before this committee stated that it was an old-fashioned three-card trick where kids were being moved from one list to another without receiving the service they need and they are not reaching their developmental milestones as a result of this.  There are huge HSE waiting lists for speech and language, assessment of needs, occupational therapy, child psychology.  During Covid-19, I know there was an emergency, but we had a bizarre situation where clinicians who were providing these services for which there are huge waiting lists were moved from providing these services to Covid-19 measures.  Yet thousands and thousands of people, and I was one of them, answered Ireland's call and offered our services free of charge to fill that gap but our offer was not taken up.  </p><p> I have a couple of questions.  The first is in regard to the post-code lottery whereby, depending on the location a person lives in, the service might be provided more quickly than in another location.  The second matter, on which I questioned the Taoiseach today, relates to the response I got to a parliamentary question, where the State now provides a public service to complete assessments of needs, which I was not aware of.  Have the witnesses heard of this happening?  What are the witnesses' experiences on the ground in regard to the post-code lottery and the waiting times?  How can we ensure children get the care they need, when and where they need it, in connection with assessment of needs, occupational therapy, speech and language, child psychology and all the auxiliary services? </p></speech>

We were all nodding along furiously because it is unfortunately a very common story at the minute.  Currently there are 2,559 children on the waiting list for CAMHS and that will go nowhere except upwards while we are trying to catch up on the backlog.  The idea of a post-code lottery is an awful way to have to think about it but it is the reality, depending on the CHO and availability, of how children are going to be assessed.  For us, prevention and early intervention means that when you get in early enough it is not compatible to have an aging-out system which is what we are seeing in many of the assessments of needs.  If we intervene before a child is six, for example, we have a window for prevention and early intervention with them whether it is for psychology or speech and language therapy.  After six it gets harder and harder and they are in a different place in the system.  What we are seeing, and this goes back to the post-codes and differences as well, is there are regional variations.  This speaks to the need to standardise the approaches and the protocols we take even around the waiting lists themselves.  For example, in different regions there might be a child on a waiting list for psychology who, while on that list, can access other interim therapies such as creative therapies in play, music or art therapy.  The child will hold his or her place on the list and progress.  In some places there can be up to a three-year waiting list for psychology.  In other regions a child may be at the same place on the list but to avail of the same interim therapies he or she must pause his or her position on the list which means others climb up ahead of him or her.  That lack of standardisation does not support effective prevention and early intervention because what it means is, depending on where a child lives, his or her access to a service will be quicker or unfortunately will come when the child has aged out of the needs or the appropriateness of that service.  I will now pass over to Mr. Chance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Chance" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#G00300"><p>To pick up on one issue around the whole area of assessment of need and disability, we had a real problem in recent years about demarcation between State agencies.  Going back to my earlier comments, many children and families need the support of more than one agency and it should not be a buck-passing exercise.  It should be a partnership exercise.  In some of the more extreme cases within Tusla and the HSE there is now a working protocol for how that is planned, but that needs to be applied in the area of prevention and early intervention as well.  Both agencies have something to bring to that table and something to offer in that space.  It is important they operate both at a national level and a local level co-operatively to develop services and ensure there are proper and effective pathways for families to get to services as quickly as possible.  That happens very well in some parts of the country but in other parts of the country, it does not happen at all.  One of the phrases we have used in our discussion is the moving family test, which refers to a family who may have their first child while living in one part of the country and for some reason move before having their second child and move again before having their third child; they live in three different parts of the country.  We are not suggesting they should receive exactly the same service wherever they are but they should receive an equivalent service.  We might structure the service differently in rural west Donegal compared to how it might be structured where my colleague Dr. O'Dwyer is, in Limerick.  It is around what services are there already and what is the most logical way to deliver that service in a particular community; nobody should be disadvantaged in accessing a service because of where he or she lives.  There has been an assumption in recent years that child disadvantage is something that happens in urban areas, particularly in inner city areas and areas of high deprivation but it happens in all parts of the country.  </p> <p>  When the area-based childhood programme was set up, 13 projects were established and 12 out of those 13 projects were based predominantly in cities and large town areas.  There is evidence on poverty and child deprivation that there are particular problems in the far west of Ireland and around the Border region.  Investing in services in those areas is also important.  The original area-based childhood development programme was meant to be phase 1 of a continued roll-out of that programme.  We are still waiting for phase 2 to happen, so the notion of investing in another tranche of services in communities in an integrated way looking at the next range of need will be important.</p></speech>

One of those heart-breaking things we all do as public representatives is sending back responses from the HSE to say that a person's child is going to be waiting for four years for early intervention, or speech and language, or occupational therapy.  Dr. O'Dwyer mentioned standardising the services across the areas but there are discrepancies even within CHO areas.  For example in my area, CHO 7, these new children's disability network teams are set up in CHO 7, there are eight of them as far as I know.  Two have not had a manager appointed yet.  Both of them are in my area, one in Rossecourt and one in Clondalkin.  So even within CHO areas, there are discrepancies.  For example, in other parts of my constituency a child may get a service quicker in the Palmerstown area but in north Clondalkin or Lucan or other parts of Clondalkin it is not the same service.  That is something we need to work on and I wanted to make that point.  Also, primary care centres are meant to underpin and have the structures in place to provide these services.  Dublin Mid-West is a huge constituency without even one primary care centre at the moment.  That is what we are up against.</p></speech>

I want to make a few points, not really questions.  It was extremely interesting, particularly the issues witnesses raised around play in urban versus rural areas.  Is that as a result of the passage of time and different generations?  It is that there is a nervousness in a rural area about letting children out to play?  In urban areas there might more green spaces or playgrounds in particular areas, although not everywhere.  On the matter of transport, as a parent of two living in a rural area when I am not here in work, I am in the car driving to some activity, but that discriminates against many children.  I often meet parents or children who say they would love to do an activity but have no way of getting there or no way of collecting the kids.  If there was much better public transport in rural areas they might be able to avail of this.  My last point is about the value of the public health nurse, which is something I have thought for a very long time.  In fairness to them they have to be across everything and it is very different to deal with an elderly community as opposed to new mothers and babies.  When it is managed right and done right it can be excellent particularly in situations where mothers potentially have post-natal depression which can be identified.  We have all heard very positive stories, but also very negative stories too, so it is about how it is managed.  It comes down to resources.</p><p>That is a really good recommendation.  I know that it is in Sl&aacute;intecare, but I am glad the witnesses raised that point.  Does Dr. O'Dwyer or Mr. Chance wish to make any concluding remarks?</p></speech>

In many ways we are speaking to the converted here.  Nobody is going to argue that prevention is not a good thing in terms of children and families but it is important, in the context of financial decision-making, to stress that prevention is a cost-effective way to work.  In our opening statement, we include a graph from Mr. James Heckman, the award-winning US economist, showing that the earlier one invests, the greater the return.  Late investment is poor investment in the context of children and families.  That is an important element of it.  A key requirement now is a new national children's strategy that puts prevention at its centre, one that picks up from where the last strategy left off before the pandemic and also deals with the new and additional challenges that the pandemic has thrown at us.  We know that childhood poverty and inequality have grown during the pandemic but if we work together we have an opportunity to address that.</p> <p>  We really appreciate the opportunity to address the committee and would be very happy to engage further with the committee or its individual members in the future.  Please feel free to contact us.  Finally, we owe it to our children to act now and to act decisively in relation to their development and well-being.</p></speech>

Pre pandemic, the more natural play we saw with children was in areas of disadvantage, which is ironic.  Children in those areas would have played in the way children played 40 years ago.  Children come home, the street lights are on and the neighbours watch them play.  They use green spaces and community facilities.  One of the benefits of the pandemic, which I hope we carry forward, is that renewed focus on free play and the use of green and outdoor spaces.  The idea of putting children in cars on commutes or having scheduled play dates on rubberised play mats in play parks is starting to be phased out, thankfully.  In terms of play being a key process and outcome for child development, we are delighted that there is a positive to take from the pandemic.</p></speech>

I am Pat Dennigan, CEO of Focus Ireland, and our delegation includes Mr. Mike Allen, director of advocacy, and Ms Kelly-Ann Byrne, one of our ambassadors with lived experience of homelessness who we have asked to join us as part of our commitment to ensuring that the voices of people who have experienced homelessness are heard where it matters.<br/><br/>Focus Ireland has been working to prevent homelessness and to support people to make sustained exits from homelessness for more than 30 years.  Our vision has always been that homelessness can be ended, not just managed.  We have long advocated for a commitment to eradicate homelessness and we welcome the goal of working towards ending homelessness by 2030 in the recently published Housing For All policy.<br/><br/>As we have set out in our current organisational strategy, we concentrate our work on single people with complex support needs, young adults, and families.  The issue of child poverty is deeply related to people in all three groups.  While child poverty is a key part of the cause of homelessness for many single people and young adults, it is also part of the daily experience<i></i>of life for children who are homeless with their families.  Many children become homeless due to the poverty experienced by their families but the experience of homelessness itself is a deeper and more traumatic form of poverty.  We need to understand that the process of their family becoming homeless is in itself traumatic for children and the experience of being homeless is a further trauma.<br/><br/>We welcome the renewed sense of partnership and collaboration between local authorities, Government, State agencies and NGOs that was cemented during the pandemic and the hard-won gains that were achieved but we need this to continue long after restrictions have ended.  In recent years, most people entering homelessness have come from the private rented sector and the primary causes of families becoming homeless remain the same, namely landlords leaving the market and rent arrears accruing because supports such as housing assistance payment, HAP, or rent supplement fall far short of real rents.<br/><br/>We would ask this committee to consider several key initiatives that we believe would make a considerable difference to supporting children who are experiencing and those at risk of homelessness.  First, funding a sufficient number of child support workers to support children experiencing homelessness should be a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s plan to deliver the EU child guarantee.  The importance of child support workers is demonstrated by our experience with the Focus Ireland family centre and the Dublin family homeless action team.  Second, we support former Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Private Member's legislation that requires local authorities to put the best interests of children at the centre of their decision making when responding to a homeless family.  Finally, we ask that the committee recognises the achievements that have been made possible by partnership between local authorities, NGOs, Departments and other State agencies over the past 18 months and the importance of this approach continuing going forward.<br/><br/>There are a number of other areas of our work which are very relevant to the committee&rsquo;s work on child poverty.  These are outlined in our written submission to the committee and we are happy to take any questions about them.  I again thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee. </p></speech>

We work with children and families to help address issues affecting children and young peoples&rsquo; development and well-being.  The majority of families receiving our support services are experiencing poverty.  They are living in cramped, overcrowded and unsuitable accommodation, with parents struggling to meet essential costs such as electricity, heating, transport, clothes and food, not to mention the costs associated with sending their children to school.  Research shows that living in poverty significantly affects a child&rsquo;s well-being and future development.  It worsens children&rsquo;s physical and mental health, educational attainment and causes social exclusion and isolation.  It is associated with reduced life chances and increases the likelihood of poverty as adults.  Our staff see first-hand the damaging impact that living in poverty can have on a child&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Reducing and ultimately ending child poverty should be a fundamental aim and commitment of Government.  Children living in poverty are often far more dependent on State supports for meeting essential needs.  Unfortunately, the State all too often fails to meet these needs and children are waiting unacceptable lengths of time for assessment and support around speech and language, and psychological and mental health services.  The children and parents we support deal with poverty on top of considerable adversity in their lives, including parental mental health issues, parental addiction, domestic violence, homelessness and parental separation.   </p><p> Our recent back to school survey of almost 1,500 parents highlighted the financial challenges they faced last year, with 54% stating they experienced financial concerns.  Over 50% of parents reported they had been concerned about the cost of returning their children to school and 20% had to take out some form of loan to meet those costs.  </p><p> Our support services intervene to improve the life chances of children and parents experiencing poverty by providing direct support to families.  We provide them with practical support to address immediate needs.  This might be through the direct provision of items, including furniture and food, or linking with energy providers to try to reduce payments.  One such service is our teen parenting service in Finglas, Tallaght, Waterford and Wexford that works with young mothers to ensure they continue in education through the provision of a range of practical supports, including funding childcare costs, contributing towards travel expenses, purchase of laptops and other support as needed.  We know from research that the likelihood of experiencing childhood poverty is closely linked to maternal educational attainment.</p><p> In order to address child poverty the Government should do the following as a priority: reduce the number of children experiencing homelessness, placing a six-month limit on the time they can spend in emergency accommodation and ensuring they have access to family support workers; further roll out the hot school meals programme; provide free education to all children, including free schoolbooks, ending voluntary contributions and reducing the high cost of school uniforms; enhance welfare supports for lone parents, whose children are at heightened risk of poverty; and increase access to free childcare for low-income families.</p></speech>

It was a really good engagement which I enjoyed.  I have engaged with Focus Ireland in my past work as an addiction and outreach worker and mental health support worker across Dublin.  I know both organisations well.</p> <p> As has been mentioned, much of the cost of living stuff affecting children is outside of their control.  Fuel prices going up, electricity, transport, clothes and food are all outside children's control but they are, for want of a better word, victims of this.  There is also a poverty of opportunity out there, especially in more disadvantaged communities.</p> <p>  The first question I will ask concerns an area I am doing work in at the moment.  We have seen criminals using children for their own selfish needs as drug mules, drug couriers and so on.  Have the witnesses experienced this?  Children see this as a way out of poverty.  I was speaking to a few of them and to a few organisations.  They see the flash cars and jackets and the extravagant lifestyles.  Have the witnesses noticed this?  Any feedback on that would be great.</p></speech>

In the communities we work in, we are well aware of the grooming of young people into inappropriate, short-term attractive propositions.  It can give them money and a sense of status and excitement.  We try to work with others, including the Garda, to give alternatives to children and young people, but it is difficult.  It is particularly important to keep those young people engaged in school as much as possible and ensure they have a routine to their lives.  That makes it less likely they will have spare time in which they can be associated with groups in the community which are not there for their best interests and are exploiting them.  Education and keeping them involved in activities are key.  If the traditional school does not meet their needs, we need to think of alternative schools that will interest and attract them.  We need to ensure they can begin to get away from immediate gratification and think of other future possibilities and options for themselves so they do not think they have to go down a particular path.</p></speech>

That is the poverty of opportunity.  It is difficult for children.  Ms Connolly mentioned school and in my area we have seen school completion programmes being closed.  On one hand, we are trying to get kids into school and support them and, on the other, the school completion programmes are closed.</p> <p>  My next question is on child homelessness.  I have seen in my office, as we all have as public representatives, where people come in with their children.  I have allowed families to use my phone because they have run out of credit from ringing place after place trying to find a place for the night.  I have seen the trauma in the kids' faces every time mother or father is told there is no room at the inn.  I have seen the mother and father being like any mother and father, trying to shield their child from this trauma and being unable to do so.  When they eventually find somewhere, they might have to get two buses and bring all their belongings across the city just to find a place for the night.  Then they go through the whole process again the next day.  It is heartbreaking to see.  What long-term implications will that have on children, especially on mental health?</p></speech>

We addressed in our statement that there has been a considerable improvement in the conditions in which families are living, particularly in Dublin but in the rest of the country as well, over the period of the pandemic.  As the numbers of families who are homeless have fallen, the local authorities and Dublin Regional Homeless Executive have taken the opportunity to improve the quality of accommodation and there are far fewer families living in commercial hotels than there were before.  That is not to say it is not an appalling circumstance that people are living in poverty and being affected by it, but the improvement is worth noting, partly because it is important to hang on to it.  As the measures which resulted in the decline in family homelessness, particularly those to prevent evictions, are lifted, we see the numbers creeping up again.  That will inevitably put pressure on services which are exactly the ones the Deputy referred to.</p> <p>  While there are a sufficient number of emergency places available, families coming into the system just need to go through an ordinary process.  They are coming into a system which is already overcrowded with not enough places and so on and there are all sorts of administrative measures, delays and people being moved across town.  All our services have talked about the traumatic effect of that.  Some of the families experiencing homelessness are coming out of poverty and of existing challenges for the children, but some of the families are becoming homeless because their landlord is selling.  They have never had any economic problems or problems like this before.  Our services from the beginning of the crisis have remarked that families who came in with no social problems and no impact on the children were, over a short period in homeless services, beginning to exhibit all sorts of problems more normally associated with families who had already had traumatic experiences.   It is not a criticism of the local authorities but of the legislation when we say in the submission that the legislation and regulation of homeless services is written on the assumption that people becoming homeless are single men and the response is related to that assumption.  None of the things we have done in terms of changing the Constitution, putting children at the centre of it and so on have carried into homeless legislation.</p><p>That legislation should be reformed in order that local authorities and public servants delivering public services are clearly informed that they must put the rights and the interests of the child first in any dealings.  Unfortunately, there are so many other things going on that in the context of the sorts of circumstances the Deputy described the rights and interests of the child have not been the top priority.</p></speech>

While there are not as many children being housed in hotel accommodation as there were previously, we have found that children are being housed in bed and breakfast accommodation as a short-term measure.  We try to secure a place for them in a family hub where they might get some supports to exit homelessness but we have found people are staying in family hubs for longer because there is nowhere for them to go because of the housing crisis.  Even though not as many children are being housed in hotels we are on a precipice for that to happen again if things do not start to move on.  I have one further question if that is in order.</p></speech>

I also thank all our guests for their contributions.  They have articulated very well the points and issues involved and the actions that need to taken.  To move away from the bad situations Deputy Ward has outlined, acknowledging that what he said is 100% correct, how is the siloing of supports from one Department to another one and from Tulsa to the council to the Department of Education negatively affecting those involved?  We all come across these blockages.  We try to help a child and his or her the parents and depending on the school the child is attending he or she may get free meals and the care he or she needs.  There are many different hoops to go through.  From our guests' expertise and experience, what is the effect of the siloing and the responsibilities different Department have on the cohesiveness of providing adequate services for families and for the betterment of children?</p></speech>

It is a challenge we constantly come across in Focus Ireland.  We deal with cross-agency and cross-Department issues all the time, be it any of the local authorities around the country, Tusla in dealing specifically with children or the HSE and some of its provisions.  There needs to be a whole-of-government or whole-of-State approach to address that.</p> <p>  I would like to address Deputy Ward's question but it would be useful to bring in our ambassador from our Leap programme, Ms Kelly Anne Byrne, who is with us today, to answer that.  First-hand experience of dealing with one's own family and all those agencies in seeking help would probably be of relevance to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kelly Anne Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#K00700"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today and for enabling my input and experience to be heard to be able to create change together.  I am a lone parent with four children and I am also a carer due to three of my four children having additional care needs.  I have experienced first hand that there are huge gaps in government around what is implemented and what practically works for us lone parents and carers.  I believe in trying to be the role model for my children that I can be.  While being a parent and a carer is already a full-time job in itself, I am still determined to achieve my dreams and goals in life and show my children that they too can break through the poverty barriers and become anything they want to be and live a life and have a career of their choice that they want or love.  With hard work and determination and the right structure and support around them, which actually work, they do not feel they have to settle on social welfare or live in poverty for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>  There is a very real disconnection with respect to the number of hours carers are allowed to work or take up some form of training or a course, which does not make any sense as most part-time courses or jobs are at least 20 hours a week in any event during which time our children are cared for in school.  Primary school children are in school more than 20 hours a week and secondary school children are in school more than 30 hours a week and they are cared for.  The previous Minister, Senator Regina Doherty, increased the hours from 15 to 18.5 in 2020 but, unfortunately, this still prevents carers like myself from being able to work or do training of some kind.  I applied for a vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, beauty therapy course through Fingal adult education, for which I had to go on a waiting list.  I was called for an exam to see if I would be able to keep up with the work required academically, which I passed.  I was then called for a formal interview, which I also passed, only to find out the only way I could complete the course was if I gave up my half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as it was 20 hours a week, which would have left me and my family even more financially stuck.  I was very disheartened after all the time and effort I put in and having to get childcare to even make the interviews and exam.  If we can fill the gaps, it will build a firm solid bridge for lone parents and carers like myself to feel safe and supported enough to be able to upskill and work towards our passions and goals in life.  It would help to empower us and to believe in ourselves, which, in turn, would also benefit, empower and support the lives of those around us.</p></speech>

It is invaluable for us as a committee to hear first-hand experience and we really appreciate it.  I note Ms Connolly is indicating.</p></speech>

What enables services to work effectively is where the relationships are such they are focused on meeting the service requirements of children and their parents, which is the priority.  They each say what they need to do to deliver what the children and their parents require.  Therefore, the silos do not come into question.  That must be the priority.  What the committee could consider at some point, working with other committees, is that sometimes we need to encourage that cross-organisational, cross-Department working through the funding arrangements required.  We know from our practice in Barnardos that sometimes local relationships are fantastic and work really effectively and that sometimes they involve much hard work.  We all come into this work because we want to deliver really good services for children and parents who need it.  I always like to finish on that optimistic term.  I would also suggest Departments need to lead by example and so do, dare it say it, public representatives, of which these committees are a good example.</p></speech>

My first question, which Deputy Ward may have covered, relates to the partnerships and collaborations with the local authorities, Government, State agencies and NGOs in tackling homelessness during the past 18 months.  Our guests have outlined the sense of achievement in delivering some key metrics or figures in this regard.  Could they provide an overview to the committee on what has happened in terms of the shift of focus during the pandemic on how this crisis has been tackled, what learnings they have taken from this, and how important collaboration and partnership has been in delivering the results we have achieved, in ensuring we do not take a step backwards and continue in a trajectory to drive the numbers down?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Dennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#L00100"><p>The efforts particularly through the pandemic have been huge.  We can see that in the numbers.  The numbers of children living in emergency accommodation reduced from a high of 3,873 in September 2019 to 2,129 last July.  It is no coincidence that last July was the last time that the Covid restrictions on the housing market were lifted.  The numbers have increased slowly but steadily since then to 2,344.  There is no doubt that through the pandemic the way local authorities, the HSE, various NGOs, agencies like Tusla and other Departments pulled together in an emergency had a huge effect on the numbers and on homelessness.  The overall numbers, including children and adults, came down from more than 10,500 to just over 8,000 in roughly the same period.  We need to learn from that effort, commitment and partnership and continue it right through what is just a different crisis.  The crisis that we are working in now is the crisis of homelessness.  The plan to eradicate homelessness by 2030 is something we all want to achieve.  If we all work together with that same commitment we can achieve it but we need to start now and ensure we are putting the building blocks in place as well as the small wins that will build and amplify as we get to 2030.  We need to put that in place right now.</p></speech>

As public representatives, we all know that every September parents, regardless of income, find the back to school period places huge financial strain on them.  The experience is magnified for those already struggling financially.  The myth of free education at both primary and second level is crushed when they look to purchase school uniforms, books, bags and footwear, and then there is the annual school trip.  Barnardos comes out very strongly on this.  What level of intervention does the Department of Education need to start taking coming up to the next school year?  Additional funding is being added to the Department's budget yearly but is there something specific we need to tackle in our education system to address these challenges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Moffatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#L00300"><p>On the previous question, it is vital that we keep an eye on the numbers.  Our services are seeing children of families being squeezed out of the accommodation that they were able to access during Covid.  Greater numbers are being pushed towards homelessness.  That is a very real concern for a lot of our services.</p> <p>  On what the Government could and should do around back to school costs, there are three obvious choices to be made.  One relates to voluntary contributions.  Time and again, schools look for children from all families to make voluntary contributions, regardless of backgrounds.  In some circumstances they are chased up for it regularly.  Parents are really struggling with finances and this is pushing them over the edge.  Schools should be actively discouraged from doing that and steps should be taken by the Department to ensure that the issue of voluntary contributions comes to an end.  There are steps that the Department and schools could take to reduce the stigma particularly associated with parents feeling stigmatised if they do not pay those voluntary contributions.  </p> <p>  Another step would be uniforms.   The Department has issued a circular on uniforms saying that schools should allow all children to attend school wearing a uniform with, say, an iron-on crest but we know that is not being implemented everywhere.  There are circumstances where parents who are struggling with finances are having to shell out considerable sums of money for expensive uniforms.  That is not acceptable at the moment.  There should never be a burden placed on parents to try to dress their children in a certain way that might mean that they are put under further strain for heating that month.  There is a real choice to be made on uniforms.</p> <p>  Finally, there is school books.  Time and again parents tell us about the cost of school books and now, additionally, with IT facilities, paying for codes in order to access online activities.  It is vital that the Government takes a step back and asks if we are going to supply those books free to children who need them or if we are going to continue to allow parents to feel the pressure of having to provide for them every year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#L00400"><p>To follow on from that, where schools do not comply, and very clearly they do not, what kind of sanction should we put in place to induce them to ensure that they do?  There are very clear violations of this, as we hear every September.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Moffatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#L00500"><p>It is quite a delicate balance.  The oversight of schools at national level is within the Department of Education but it falls down at a local level to local boards of management.  The Government probably has not done enough on voluntary contributions.  Additional steps could be taken within the Department and legislation could be brought in around it, so that, for instance, once voluntary contributions are requested from families, the schools and individual teachers would not know who has or has not paid the money.</p> <p>  With uniforms, either the Department has to introduce some sort of sanctioning programme or it needs to go a step further and say that it will govern uniforms, and that a minimum standard has to be adopted in schools.  Then the Department needs to apply that.  For example, if schools want to have a uniform that might cost &euro;100 and parents are willing to pay that, perhaps that is acceptable.  There needs to be an option for the parents who are not in a position to pay that money to pay for a uniform that does not cost that much without dividing the children between those wearing more expensive uniforms.  I am not sure what specific sanctions should be taken.  It is becoming clear that if the Department of Education is issuing circulars and they are not being implemented on the ground, it needs to be escalated and a deeper analysis of what is happening at a national level and a questioning of whether those circulars are sufficient is needed.</p></speech>

My child's school has a second-hand uniform sale every year and everyone is encouraged to go down that route rather than anything else.  You cannot tell as everyone that is in a uniform that maybe older and it does not matter.  It is probably a badge of honour at this stage.</p> <p>  I have seen Ms Byrne's video for Focus Ireland.</p><p>It is powerful and incredibly moving.  It is a great tribute to the witnesses and to the team that assisted in putting it together.  They are championing a positive outcome.  It is a difficult journey to get there.  I would be interested in hearing more about that.  One difficulty that would regularly come across my desk is where families are evicted because they have outgrown the home that they are in and find themselves homeless.  A two-bedroom apartment might come available but the city council will not give that to a family because the family needs a three-bedroom apartment, but in the interim, while waiting for a three-bedroom apartment, they are in one hotel bedroom in Sheldon Park or a similar place.  I find that extraordinarily frustrating.  There are no words for it, especially when special needs are concerned.  While I think we need to have policies at local authority level about the allocation of homes, at the same time, it seems that we could have something in place on a temporary basis.</p></speech>

Thankfully, we got the right support.  We had to go into bed and breakfast accommodation and to a hostel.  We were faced with absolutely nothing.  We had to put belongings into storage and we went with just the clothes on our backs to the council.  We practically had to beg for help and support.  It was extremely tough.  I had twin girls and had lost my daughter to cot death while in the midst of domestic violence.  We were in turmoil and had no support.  It is only when we lost our home that people started to see that we as a family really needed support.  A little light then started to shine on us and we started to gain the needed support.  I started to get the right support to be able to be the best mam I can be for my children and to have stability.  That was when Focus Ireland, the women's refuge and so on came in.  We worked our way up and did a lot of healing.</p> <p>  Five and a half years later, thanks to Focus Ireland, we are supported and stable.  I am able to look at careers and what I want to do with my life.  My kids are stable.  They are in school and college.  They are in a community.  There has been significant progress from the poverty that we were living in to what we are in now.  There are still gaps.  I feel that I would like to completely come out of the poverty trap and get back into work, to be able to show my children that they can become whatever they want to be.  We need the right support and the right hours.  We need the Government to work with lone parents and carers to find practical steps that actually work.</p></speech>

We then needed correct care.  We had to go into the women's refuge for a while.  When we started to gain stability and had the right support, we transitioned from the women's refuge and support to Focus Ireland support workers.  My good support worker is with me for life.  I always have somebody to turn to and to work with me on whatever I need, whether it is related to my children, life, house or anything else.  I have ongoing support, which is something that I never really had.  Due to being fostered as a baby, I never really had any family support.  It is great to have the right supports around us.  Focus Ireland kindly gave us our forever home.  We have been living there for more than five and a half years and we cherish it because we know what it is like to go without a home.  Having that stability is a foundational start to life that I feel everybody deserves to have.</p></speech>

We experience it often.  Deputy Ward and others asked about silos and how those operate.  These are silos within local authorities.  One side of the local authority says that accommodation is not good enough for people, so they have to move on, and then the local authority says that it does not have anything better for those people, so they have to stay in a place that is much worse than where they were.  The practical solution would be a more integrated response from local authorities, geared around the needs of the family rather than the sets of rules that they have.  These problems are going to arise.  Many of the families stuck in homelessness for a long time are larger families.  In the other area of homelessness, we are increasingly looking at the need to build one-bedroom units.  We really need to see local authorities build, not a huge number, but significantly more three and four-bedroom social housing units to house people who the local authorities can readily see will need them.  That is the medium to longer term solution that needs to be built into Housing for All.  The shorter term requires better integration, more listening in Departments, and not letting the perfect constantly be the enemy of the decent.  Unfortunately, some people live in poor circumstances rather than just difficult circumstances where they would be more secure.</p> <p>  Waterford County Council has a different way of doing this which we have written on in some cases.  It uses its own housing stock for emergency accommodation.  Clearly that is not possible in Dublin with the scale of the problem.  It is somewhere to get to, where even if people become homeless, they do not end up in homeless accommodation but in something which looks like an ordinary house.  They only stay there for a short time since they do not have a right to stay there.  The harm that comes from living in unsuitable accommodation is removed from the system.  All local authorities should look at it.</p></speech>

It makes much more sense and is much more focused on dignity.  I thank the witnesses.  I apologise that I need to leave the meeting now to go to the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#N00100"><p>I have two more questions.  My first is in regard to Barnardos and the hot meals programme that was mentioned in the opening statement.  We need to start looking at the DEIS criteria and how that is done.  There are schools in parts of my area that have high levels of poverty but they are not in areas that traditionally have high levels of poverty.  For example, they could be areas with many HAP tenancies and insecure tenancies, and the cost of rent and the cost of living is going up.  Even from talking to the local food bank in my area, I know there are people accessing the food bank who are from areas that did not traditionally access it.</p> <p>  When I was a kid, I would have been one of those who accessed the meals programme and my brothers and sisters and my neighbours would have done the same.  There was no stigma in it because everybody was in the same boat.  It helped me to get through coming from a disadvantaged area because there was food in my stomach when I was coming home from school.  Now, parts of my area have kids going to school hungry and coming home from school hungry, which is really not good enough in 2021.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses from Barnardos have any input into how we might modernise the DEIS criteria or the DEIS programme to make it 2021-proof, for want of a better term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#N00200"><p>As a quick answer, hot school meals should be universally available and then there would be no question of people even knowing which school they are in or not in.  That would be my overall argument.  Mr. Moffatt will come in with a far more nuanced approach in terms of what might be possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Moffatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#N00300"><p>In terms of the specifics around the hot school meals programme, we know from the evaluations that have been done of the benefits to the brains of children and, obviously, the Deputy outlined some of the benefits he has personally experienced.  We appreciate that this should be available to all children who would benefit from it.  It has been around for long enough that we do not need to slowly roll it out piecemeal.  We should acknowledge that it has been further rolled out over the last couple of years.  What we know is that not all the schools that applied for the hot school meals programme were accepted onto it.  At the very least, every single school that applies for it and meets certain criteria should be able to have its students benefit from it.  That is the very first step.</p> <p>  In the longer term, there are obviously issues in that some schools would not be practically placed to be able to be part of the scheme because of the facilities they have.  As schools are built, we need to ensure there are kitchen facilities and, where possible, to refurbish existing schools.  That is another step that needs to be taken.</p> <p>  In terms of the wider question around DEIS, it is certainly something we understand and appreciate.  Among the children using and benefiting from our services, not all of the children experiencing disadvantage are living in areas where they go to DEIS schools.  It is certainly something that we must examine to see what impact it has or what it means if children do not have the same sort of support they might have within a DEIS school.</p> <p>  The Government has provided additional money towards DEIS in the recent budget, which is welcome.  It is probably a longer-term issue about how the Government builds a strategy around supporting those children who are experiencing disadvantage but who do not live within a DEIS school area.  There needs to be a clear plan as to what is going to happen with those children.  Is it right that they do not have the same access to support?  Is that acceptable?  We would argue that the Government needs to think about that in the longer term and really look to address it.  Some of that might be addressed by putting more money into DEIS schools so they cover a wider area, and some of it might be having a specific strategy that looks to address the issue of children who are experiencing disadvantage in their education but who might be living in a slightly more affluent area.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Byrne for sharing her journey, which was powerful and very good to listen to.  I had a somewhat similar experience, although not quite the same as hers and I did not face the same barriers that she did, especially when looking to retrain and access education.  I will give an example from my experience about how things changed for me.  I have multiple sclerosis.  I was on a disability allowance payment and I needed to change my career because, at the time, I was not physically able to do the work that I was doing.  At that time, people were allowed to do a community employment, CE, scheme and keep their disability allowance.  As a father of young kids, there was no way I would have been able to afford to do that unless I was getting the dual payment.  That was changed within two years of my accessing that programme.  If I had accessed the programme two years later, I would not have gone to college, I would not have changed careers and I probably would not be sitting here speaking to these people now.</p> <p>  I take Ms Byrne&rsquo;s point in regard to carers and disability payments for lone parents.  What does she think should change to enable her to access the educational and career paths that she needs at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kelly Anne Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#N00500"><p>Fundamentally, it is down to the number of hours we are allowed to access courses.  At the moment, it is still 18.5 hours and if we do any more, if we take on any training above that or if we decide to work over those hours, we have to lose our carer&rsquo;s allowance.  That is just not possible as we would be in severe poverty if we did that.  For me, we would need at least 20 hours a week in order to be able to even look at starting to upskill.</p> <p>  As I said, being a mother, a lone parent and a carer is a full-time job in itself.  Even to start looking at anything further is a bonus.  I do not want my children growing up living in a box, thinking that this is their life now and that they have to follow the footsteps and go onto social welfare themselves.  I want them to open their mindsets and to be able to use the abilities they have.  Even though some of them have disabilities and things like that, there are ways around it, especially nowadays, when we have moved along a lot from the situation of years ago.  We are learning that everybody learns differently and everybody has different ways, and we are adapting to that.</p> <p>  I feel that, for our future, it is time for the Government to allow the correct hours and support us to be able to move on, to gain work and to find a solution, rather than just to stay where we are.</p></speech>

I always believe education is one of the best ways to enable people to exit poverty.  I mentioned earlier that there are young kids getting involved in criminality in my area.  Education is key to preventing that from happening.  They can never take it away from you.  Once you have an education, they can ever take it away.  They might take your home at some stage, they could take your freedom at some stage, but they will never take your education or your knowledge away from you.</p> <p>  I have seen in my own local authority over the years that very good motions were put down in regard to trying to provide extra assistance for people in homelessness.  For example, a couple of years ago, a motion was put down in regard to moving councillors&rsquo; overseas expenses, which were never used in my time on the local authority, to create a bursary for people in homeless accommodation or who had experienced homelessness in order for them to go back into education.  That was voted down by the members of the local authority at the time.  This is what I am saying.  We need to have joined-up thinking and we need to all be on the same page.</p> <p>  I greatly appreciate all of the feedback and the contributions today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#N00700"><p>I have a few points to make.  First, in regard to Barnardos, I acknowledge the excellent work that is done.  The witnesses might want to comment on the situation coming out of Covid and the need for recovery for children in particular.  I am conscious of how they have been affected from a whole range of viewpoints, not just from a school point of view but due to absolutely everything, in particular health and mental health.</p><p>The point has been made that child poverty existed before the pandemic, but it was highlighted further during Covid.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on these matters?</p><p> Regarding the recent increase in energy costs, I know from people coming to my constituency office that people are panicking.  In some cases, they are only starting to see increases now, but they are panicking and almost trying to stockpile, which they do not have the means to do.</p><p> Those questions are for Barnardos.  I will raise a few points with Focus Ireland afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#O00200"><p>If I address the issue of children post Covid, Mr. Moffatt might speak about energy costs.</p> <p>  Across all of our services, we are aware that children are highly anxious, as are their parents.  It is an uncertain time.  It is important that children have access to a range of supports depending on the degree of their anxiety.  At one level, classroom-based supports can be provided, whereby one talks in general to the class about how all feelings are okay, some of us get very anxious, some of us less so, and we can support one another.  That is a universal-type service.  Barnardos runs something called the recovery programme, which is part of our roots of empathy programme.  It is concerned with normalising feelings of sadness, loss, anxiety and having no control.</p> <p>  However, some children need more than this because their anxiety is more worrying.  They need access to individual support through a qualified project worker from an organisation like Barnardos.  If they have a more serious level of anxiety, they need access to qualified mental health specialists.  We know from our conversations that there is a significant gap because there is too lengthy a waiting list for psychology services.</p> <p>  There is an education link to this, as many children are anxious about their capacity to catch up because of how much schooling they have missed.  If children were provided with reassurances that they would be given extra support in a school context, it would make a significant difference.  I am delighted that schools are still open.  That is essential in terms of the structure that school provides to children from a social and emotional point of view, not just an educational one.  Evidence from a survey that we conducted during Covid showed that parents were well aware of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Moffatt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#O00300"><p>Regarding the recovery for children, there are two points, which Ms Connolly referenced.  There needs to be direct additional support for children to help with issues around their social and emotional progression and development and their education development.  Some steps have been taken by the Department of Education, but whether they go far enough is a wider debate.  There has been some regression in children's development.  We need to ensure that there is sufficient support to get children to where they want to be and where they should probably be in their development.</p> <p>  We need to remember that children have been impacted by what has happened to their parents during Covid.  For many children, particularly those experiencing disadvantage or from disadvantaged backgrounds, their parents may have faced additional adversity and hardship over the past 18 months or so.  We know from a survey that we conducted that there was a major increase in financial stress, overall stress and mental health issues.  There was also an increase in tensions within the home as well as social isolation for parents.  Many of those parents will need additional support.  If they do not get it, there is a concern about what the negative impact on the children will be.  We will advocate that more family supports need to be available to those parents so that they can get the support they need to address the issues that arose for them during Covid.</p> <p>  Regarding energy costs, we have been having discussions with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example.  Families are struggling to meet energy costs.  We have been fortunate that the weather has not been terrible, but it will get worse.  There have been multiple increases in energy costs across various providers and other providers have pulled out, which has reduced competition.  We need to ensure that no child is living in a home that is inappropriately heated.  Practical steps can be taken by support agencies like ourselves.  We try to work with energy providers to ensure that payment plans are in place and energy is not switched off at any point, but what of a wider plan?  Steps were taken by the Government to increase the fuel allowance, but it will not go anywhere near meeting the increased costs this year.  We need to think about whether we believe it is acceptable that children are at risk of living in inappropriately heated homes and what the Government believes should be done about this issue.  Living in a poorly heated and poorly lit home has repercussions for a child's development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#O00400"><p>I agree, particularly with the point on the fuel allowance.  A large number of people narrowly fall outside qualifying for it but are still struggling.  Sometimes, I do not think there is any joined-up thinking on how to tackle the root of the problem.</p> <p>  I agree that a large number of children are struggling in school.  They have lost a year and a half of school.  In certain ways, it feels like everything has gone back to normal for them even though it has not.  They just go into the next class.  There may be emotional impacts for children.  If children start struggling and falling behind, they might think they cannot do it, and we all know the vicious cycle to which that can lead.  I was glad to hear Ms Connolly mention those points.</p> <p>  What are Focus Ireland's opinions on the situation?  The point concerning Waterford City and County Council was interesting, although not every local authority has the resources to manage something like that.</p> <p>  I wish to mention two groups, the first of which is the hidden homeless, namely, people who are staying in overcrowded conditions with family members or friends.  I know of families that genuinely want to help out but are afraid to do so because they do not know how long someone might be with them.  What might once have been a few weeks or months is now a year or a year and a half.  I can understand where local authorities are coming from because they are under pressure.  If two or three families are presenting as homeless, who genuinely does not have a bed for the night?  People are effectively seen as being sorted even though they are not.</p> <p>  I raise this matter because of its impact on children.  Children worry, but it can take a while to pick up on that because they hide their worry.  They are trying to cope themselves and they can see that their parents are stressed, so they try to not raise the issue.  Previously, they might have been able to have friends over or attend birthday parties, but that type of thing is gone now.  This is a difficult situation for people and, sometimes, they can fall through the cracks.</p> <p>  I also wish to discuss the issue of domestic violence.  I am frustrated by the fact that it is women &ndash; I know that men also experience domestic violence, but we know from the research that it is mainly women &ndash; and children who have to leave the home to escape domestic violence.  They then present at a refuge or emergency accommodation.  A person is left sitting in the house.  There has to be a short period in which people leave to get out of the situation, and I understand that there has to be due process and so on, but should we be doing more to ensure that they can return to that home?  They are the people responsible for the children.  Ultimately, the children should be entitled to their homes.  Will the witnesses from Focus Ireland offer their opinions on such situations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#O00500"><p>I thank the Chair for those questions.  On the first point, we know from Focus Ireland's own research that the most common reason for families becoming homeless is losing what has often been secure accommodation in the private rented sector.  This often happens because the landlord is selling or moving family in, which are legitimate reasons under Irish law for evicting someone.</p><p>That is the most significant and largest group of people who are becoming homeless.  Very often, what happens after the eviction and before they enter homeless services is that they go and live with somebody else among their wider family or friends.  It is what the American homeless organisations call "doubling up".  That eventually breaks down because it just is not possible for two families to live in a one-family home.  Even in the best of family or friend relationships, what starts off as an act of kindness becomes something that could have negative long-term impacts on relationships because of the tensions, and then the family moves into homelessness.</p><p> One way of looking at what causes homelessness is that local authorities ask families becoming homeless why they are entering homeless services now.  The families say they fell out with their sister or with friends and it goes down as a social conflict, but in fact the real reason they lost their home is for economic reasons, the landlords, and our failure to deliver enough homes and to protect tenants in the private rented sector.  They try to prevent themselves going into homelessness by staying with wider family and friends, sometimes for long periods, and then we characterise their reason for going into homelessness as social causes and relationship breakdown.  That leads us to completely misunderstand what is happening in terms of driving so many families into homelessness.  We must find a better way of measuring that.</p><p> One of the most successful programmes of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is called Preventing Homelessness.  In the technical language it would be known as "diversion".  When a family comes in that is facing eviction, it may offer them homeless HAP, which is a genuine prevention of homelessness, or in some cases they convince the family to go back to their own parents or to wider family and stay there.  You could argue that that is better than much of the emergency accommodation that might be offered, but it is never counted or measured and there has been no evaluation or understanding of the consequences of that for the family in homelessness or the long-term impact on the children.  We are saying that what the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is doing is a good measure, but the good measures need to be evaluated as well as the poor measures.  We need to understand how they can be improved and what their consequences are.  We hear it right across the country in a much less organised way that local authorities ask people if they are sure they cannot stay with their mother or cousins.  That will be coming back.  It has not been around for the past two years, but it will be coming back in a very strong way now that the numbers are going up.  We need to understand it better in terms of numbers so that we can put it into our equations for ending homelessness and also knowing how to respond to it.</p><p> Domestic violence is very much part of Ms Byrne's story.  She told us movingly about the consequences of that.  Domestic violence is appalling in itself but the fact that it so often leads to homelessness for the victims of domestic violence is the bit that we can pay a bit more attention to.  There is much more that can be done to deal with domestic violence and also a lot more to prevent it turning into homelessness.  In recent years, we have been doing a major study with Dr. Paula Mayock in Trinity College Dublin, which will be published before the end of the year.  It looks at exactly that question of what happens to households when there is domestic violence.  It is not always but usually the mother who flees with the children and ends up in homeless services.  Probably the most egregious example of siloisation and lack of integration of our public services when somebody is in crisis is the way we respond to those families fleeing domestic violence; it is up there among the worst that we could do.  We will publish that before Christmas.  I am not particularly looking for another gig, but if the committee were to invite Dr. Mayock, the researcher, to come in at some stage when the report is out, we would be delighted to go into more detail on what we have discovered in that research and the recommendations emerging from it.  We are doing that in partnership with the Housing Agency and the Department of Justice.  The partnership while working on the report has been positive, in conjunction with domestic violence charities.  I hope the level of co-operation we have had in doing the research will follow through into implementing the recommendations.</p></speech>

I cannot wait to see the report.  In the course of my work, first as a councillor and then as a Deputy, I am aware that it can be very frustrating.  In certain situations women unfortunately end up going back to the home because it is so difficult with the kids and everything else that goes with it.  We are failing in that regard.  That concludes our questions.  If any of the witnesses wants to make a concluding remark, I invite them to do so now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Dennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#P00300"><p>One item that we would like to emphasise before we close is the need for child support workers and help.  At the moment, through the support of the HSE, the National Social inclusion Office, Tusla and public donations, we employ ten and a half people in a child support worker capacity across Dublin.  They typically work with a caseload of approximately 15 children at a time.  We cover between 150 and 160 children at any one time.  At the moment, there are 1,806 children homeless in Dublin in emergency accommodation.  We estimate that probably about 25% of those would fall directly into having a need for this type of child support work.  That is more than 400 children.  If we could bridge the gap between the 150 to 160 children and the 400, it would be a huge resource that could be of real benefit in dealing with trauma in homelessness for children.  That is the key ask that we would make in terms of prioritisation from the committee, if at all possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110900002#P00400"><p>I would like to say how delighted I am that attention is being given to the issue of women, generally speaking, and their children having to flee the home.  That would make a massive difference in terms of children's well-being if they could remain in the family home and the alleged perpetrator could leave.  That would be a phenomenally successful outcome for children and, generally speaking, mothers.</p> <p>  In the context of what Mr. Dennigan seeks in terms of child support workers, in Barnardos we are asking for family support workers.  It is important that whatever services are needed are available across the country.  Different organisations could provide the supports needed in different parts of the country and we can draw on each other's expertise.  In some areas across the country, we work very closely with Focus Ireland.  It provides a particular type of service and Barnardos provides another.  I would hate to see a situation where one organisation ends up not being able to provide a service, but that there could be a range of organisations providing this type of support that could be rolled out nationally.  Family problems do not happen in isolation.  Ms Byrne's fantastic contribution highlights that.  Families need overall support for parents and children.  They come with a range of issues on which they need support and different organisations can provide that support.  Let us think about that when we are being creative about the use of resources because that encourages organisations to work together, which is what children and families need.</p></speech>

That is how we became homeless in the first place.  In other cases, the woman and the child or the man and the children have to flee because it is not safe for them to stay there or to go back there because that is where the perpetrator knows they are.  That is why they have to go into some form of hiding or some other safe place until they gain stability and the right supports around them.  There would have to be some new form of supports built around them so that they can be in their own home.</p><p>That would probably require the Garda to get involved.  As of now, I do not see how that is possible.  For that reason, parents and their children have to go somewhere safe and hidden as otherwise the perpetrator will know where they are.  I wanted to highlight that to the committee.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to discuss matters that arose at the recent meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and the UN Security Council.  The Minister is particularly welcome here in person this afternoon for the first time in quite a while.  I also welcome his officials.  I thank them and the Minister for the comprehensive briefing material supplied to our members prior to the meeting.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear an opening statement from the Minister before going into a question and answer session with members of the committee.</p><p> I remind the Minister and members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  There are a number of members present and I assume we have members online from their offices as well, although I do not see them at present.  For anybody watching this meeting online, some members and witnesses are accessing the meeting in remote format.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the fact that members are attending remotely while some are in the committee room, I ask that everyone bear with us should technical issues arise.</p><p> I am not sure what the Proclamation is doing at our meeting, not that it is in any way unwelcome.  That is Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's office.  I am not sure if it indicates whether he is present-----</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to the meeting.  I will say a few words at the outset on a selection of significant issues which have featured on the agendas of the EU Foreign Affairs Council and the UN Security Council since I met the committee to discuss these topics last May.</p> <p>  In September, Ireland served as President of the UN Security Council for the first time since October 2001.  This will be the only time we hold the presidency during our current term and therefore the month offered a unique opportunity to advance our priorities.  First and foremost, we succeeded in adopting a groundbreaking resolution on UN peacekeeping transitions.  This ensures the UN is properly prepared for the shift from peacekeeping to peacebuilding.  The resolution was co-sponsored by 97 member states, including the council's five permanent members.  I believe I am correct in saying this was also the first time Ireland got a thematic resolution passed at the Security Council, so it was a significant achievement.  I believe it is only the second time we have got any form of resolution that Ireland authored agreed in the Security Council.</p> <p>  We also convened a landmark debate at the level of Heads of State and Government on the linkages between climate change and security, chaired by the Taoiseach.  We have initiated negotiations on a new resolution.  The council has never before adopted a resolution on the relationship between climate change and international peace and security.  If we can achieve this, it will pave the way for the council to take concrete actions to address climate-related security risks for the first time.  Truth be told, denying there is a risk now with what is happening in parts of the world that are deeply impacted by climate change and conflict, where climate change is an accelerator of that conflict and tension, is really not a credible position any longer, so I hope we will be able to get agreement on a wording for a resolution in this space.</p> <p>  In line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, we also convened and chaired a council meeting to mark the 25th anniversary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty towards the end of our month-long presidency.</p> <p>  The presidency was not just an opportunity to advance Ireland&rsquo;s specific priorities.  Our main responsibility was to manage the council&rsquo;s programme of work, and we chaired discussions on Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and the Middle East peace process.  I personally chaired a meeting of the Security Council on the situation in Afghanistan, and our team in New York successfully led negotiations to extend the mandate of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan at what was a critical period.  Managing the council&rsquo;s work in September also allowed us to present our vision of how the international community should address peace and security issues.  We set a record for the number of women civil society representatives to brief the council in a month.  There were 17 briefers during the meetings we organised that month and 16 of them were women.  I think those numbers are right and Ms Hyland will correct me if I am wrong.  Instead of just discussing in the abstract the effects of conflict on women and girls, the council got to listen to their voices directly.</p> <p>  Before moving on from the presidency of the Security Council, I should point out that we have an extraordinary team in New York.  The more I work with it, the more I realise its members are a mixture of experience and very smart young people.  We have a team of almost 50 people who are working week-in, week-out on ensuring Ireland has an impact on the big global debates.  They are led by an extraordinarily able person, but there is so much talent on that team, it is worth reflecting on it in this committee as well as thanking them for their work.  They have done an extraordinary service to the State.</p> <p>  I will proceed to some other topical matters in which members have an interest.  On the Middle East, I am attending this meeting having just returned from a week in the Middle East, after meeting political leaders from Palestine, Israel and Jordan.  The escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine in May served as a reminder of why continued engagement on the Middle East peace process is vital.  I addressed the UN Security Council and an emergency meeting of foreign ministers at that time and called again for the immediate cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and compliance with international humanitarian law on all sides.  The D&aacute;il at that time also passed a motion characterising Israel&rsquo;s actions of ongoing settlement expansion and the demolition of Palestinian homes and infrastructure in the West Bank as de facto annexation.  Over recent months, actions on the ground continue to undermine any effort to engage meaningfully with a political resolution.</p> <p>  In my meetings with President Herzog of Israel and Foreign Minister Lapid, I gave the clear message that Israel must immediately halt these actions and start to take concrete and sustained confidence measures to begin to rebuild some of the trust that has been lost in recent years.  Those meetings were good, direct and constructive.  It is important the Irish Government seeks to build a relationship with the new Israeli Government, which has very different views and perspectives within it.  There are many in the Israeli Government with whom I believe we can build a strong and positive relationship.  In reflecting on my meetings in Israel, which were at times somewhat confrontational but always respectful, there is a very strong sense in Israel that there is an issue with antisemitism in Ireland.  While some people might not want to hear that, it is important to say it.  I do not believe Irish people are antisemitic and we have to be clear in our language if and when we criticise Israeli policy, and we do it regularly, particularly towards Palestinians as regards settlements, demolitions, forced evictions and many other issues in terms of a peace process that is not moving forward.</p> <p>  We must distinguish in the language we use between being critical of Israeli Government policy and giving the impression we are in some way anti-Israel or, indeed, anti-Jewish.  That is something that, from my perspective, would be unacceptable.  Sometimes, through the language used in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, lines are crossed that should not be crossed.  I ask people to reflect on that.  We can and must be a strong, clear and consistent voice on the Middle East peace process, which advocates for international law, international humanitarian law and finding ways to move a peace process forward.</p><p>We also have to be careful in terms of the danger of sending signals.  I mean that being critical of Israeli Government policy sometimes is taken as a signal of being anti-Israeli and the lines are blurred lines.  If we are not careful with the language that we use that can stray into antisemitism.  I have had many conversations on this issue in Israel I think are a cause for concern and we need to reflect on that.</p><p> My conversations with the Palestinian Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister were very positive and constructive.  I made clear my view that democratic renewal and a clear path to elections in Palestine are essential to renewing the legitimacy and credibility of the Palestinian Authority, not least in the minds of its own people but also in the context of its relationship with the outside world.  I made it very clear Ireland is there to help and support those efforts.</p><p> In both Israel and Palestine I met a wide variety of civil society, academic and media partners.  In Jordan, I had detailed discussions with Foreign Minister Safadi about Jordan&rsquo;s crucial role in the Middle East peace process, Syria and other regional issues.  I also had an opportunity with him to formally open Ireland&rsquo;s new embassy in Amman.</p><p> The prospect of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East is of enormous concern.  The Iranian nuclear agreement, or the JCPoA as it is called, is a vital safeguard in protecting the Middle East.  I have engaged extensively with the partners to the JCPoA in the context of Ireland's role as facilitator of the relevant resolution in the UN Security Council, which is the basis for the JCPoA.</p><p> I am encouraged by the approach of the US, which has set out its clear intention to return and engage intensively in parallel talks in Vienna between March and June.  I am, however, deeply concerned by Iran's continuing breaches of its commitments.  I met the new Iranian foreign minister in September and urged Iran to return swiftly to talks and to full compliance with its obligations.  It is positive the talks are due to begin at the end of this month in Vienna.  I encourage all sides to make progress while there is still time.</p><p> I would like to say a few words about the situation in Ethiopia, which is of grave concern to me.  The events of the past year in Ethiopia have resulted in a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe.  While responsibility for ending the conflict rests with all of the parties, there is a moral imperative for the international community to take action.  As de facto penholder on this file at the Security Council, we have worked tirelessly both in New York, with partners in the region and with parties to the conflict, to push for unhindered humanitarian access, an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated solution through dialogue.  Ireland led the negotiation of last Friday's UN Security Council statement that warned of incitement to violence by the use of inflammatory hate speech, and called for respect for international humanitarian law and support for the efforts of the African Union special envoy, former President Obasanjo.</p><p> The publication of the joint report last week, by the UN Human Rights Office and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, confirmed that abuses, some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, have taken place in Tigray over a sustained period.  EU foreign ministers will again discuss the situation next week, including the possible use of the global human rights sanctions regime in the light of the findings of the joint report.</p><p> There are a number of other important issues that have been in focus in recent months, with which members will be familiar, not least Syria, where Ireland plays a key role on the humanitarian access file; Lebanon, where our engagement on the UNIFIL mandate has been critical; and Afghanistan, where the humanitarian situation is of increasing concern.  I am happy to discuss any of these issues in as much detail as members so wish when we have questions and answers.</p><p> I thank the committee members for their continued engagement on these and other foreign policy issues, and I look forward to their questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021110900002#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and it is good to have him before the committee this evening.  I concur with what he said about our staff, particularly those in New York who work for the Security Council.  I, too, would like to be associated with his comments.  The staff do exceptional work and are great representatives of Ireland.</p> <p>  First, I wish to refer to Tigray and Ethiopia.  I share the Minister's concerns about the ongoing onslaught perpetrated on civilians in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.  I know EU foreign ministers are due to meet again next week.  I welcome the statement made by the Security Council.  I know how difficult it has been in the past to get a consensus on even issuing a statement.  There are serious concerns, as the Minister well knows, about the potential for famine within the region, so the eyes of the world must remain on Tigray and Ethiopia.  Everything that can be done must be done, including full humanitarian access.  I plead with the Minister to ensure the eyes of the world remain on Tigray and other regions such as Yemen where, unfortunately, conditions are quickly evolving into a humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will not be surprised when I say that I want to focus on discussing Palestine and Israel.  I welcome his recent visit to the region and engagement.  Over recent weeks there has been a serious escalation in what can only be described in a continuous onslaught, not just against Palestinians but also human rights in general.  How does the Minister view the comments made by the Irish ambassador to Israel last June who stated Israel is a country "based on the rule of law, on democracy, and on respect for human rights and human dignity"?  Are the ambassador's comments in line with the position of the Government?  I ask because it certainly is not in line with the view of experts.</p> <p>  A statement made by UN experts, dated 3 November, states, "Israel settlement expansion 'tramples' on human rights law".  We know that is the case because Ireland was the first EU country to state formally that the ongoing illegal, colonial settlement policy by Israel breaches international law.  I want to home in on that issue first.  There are real concerns given that up to 15,000 additional illegal settlement units have been given the go-ahead and as many as 3,400 of those settler homes are in the E1 area.  The expansion of settlements is really concerning and the expansion of the E1 settlement is especially sensitive.  In the past the EU, the US and we have said that any expansion would cross a red line.  Unfortunately, there has been no follow-up at EU level nor at the Irish level following Ireland's historic decision to declare that Israel had breached international law in annexing Palestinian lands.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on same.</p> <p>  I welcome the statement of condemnation the Minister made last week.  The situation has surpassed the point of condemnation and now we need definitive action.  Palestinian civil society groups has said the end game is being played out by Israel.  We can see that with the settlement expansions and with what can only be described as an absurd move a fortnight ago by Israel to designate six Palestinian civil society organisations as terrorist organisations.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the situation because we, as a country, donate to two of the organisations that have been designated to be part of the list.</p><p>It is concerning that these are the eyes and ears which ensure that a spotlight is shone on violations of Palestinian human rights by Israel.  These organisations have been central to gathering information and facts to bring to the International Criminal Court, ICC.  Therefore, this is a move by Israel to silence criticism and to stop the work these organisations are doing on the ground.</p><p> I note that the Minister has said that no evidence has been produced.  There has been a lot of talk about this dossier that Israel has produced.  Has the Minister seen the contents of that dossier?  Has any further evidence been put forward by Israel regarding this issue?  I ask that because there is no evidence, and that is the bottom line.  These groups are concerned by this designation of them as terrorist organisations, and not only in the context of their safety but that of their ongoing work for the Palestinian people.</p><p> Will we continue to provide funding to those organisations?  Will the Minister assure us categorically that that money will continue to be provided, irrespective of what the Israeli authorities say?  Will finance continue to be provided to support those organisations?  Concerns have also been expressed that the chilling effect in this regard may cause some of the financial institutions and banks to stop the flow of money to these organisations.  What actions is the Minister going to take in this regard?  What communications has he initiated with the financial sector and the banks to ensure that the flow of funds will continue to these organisations to allow them to continue to do their work?  It is particularly concerning that this move by Israel has been little mentioned at EU level.  What actions is the Minister taking at EU level and why is this silence continuing at EU level?  </p><p> We must go beyond talk.  This committee carried out comprehensive work and produced a report on demolitions, settlement expansions, etc.  It was published, and I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to read it.  It was a damning report and made several specific recommendations.  Therefore, I hope the Minister has read it and that he is prepared to look at the recommendations made by this committee, some of which are actions that should be taken immediately.  I ask the Minister to comment on that aspect.  Words are no longer sufficient in this context.  We need action, and we must work as a unit.  I am prepared to work with the Minister to move beyond words, rhetoric and condemnation to look at serious actions and measures that we can take if we are serious about standing up for human rights in this regard.</p><p> The last issue I want to touch on is Brexit.  It is not part of the work we are looking at here, but it is a serious issue and I cannot let this opportunity go without raising it.  Major concerns exist regarding what the British may or may not do in respect of triggering Article 16.  Dog whistling is coming from 10 Downing Street and the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.  Unfortunately, that is being picked up on by elements within the loyalist community.  We have seen the same thing in the dog whistling that came from certain political parties in the North yesterday.  The result on the ground has been the hijacking and burning of buses.  Cars on the Shankill Road with southern registration plates have also been hijacked and burnt out.  Therefore, there are real concerns in this regard.  </p><p> If the Minister can take a few seconds to address this issue, I ask him to comment in respect of outlining our continued defence of the Good Friday Agreement and our concerns around triggering Article 16.  What can we say to people in this regard?  Are we going to ensure that the protocol stays as it is?  Are we going to ensure that there is no hard border on this island?  I ask the Minister to give his views and those of his Department on these issues, and to reassure those people who are concerned about this dog whistling and the effect it is having in certain quarters in unionism and loyalism.  I refer to the concerns regarding the violence which may stem from such dog whistling.</p></speech>

The Minister just made a sweeping statement regarding comments made in the D&aacute;il and Seanad that he said would veer into anti-Semitism.  It was an incredibly sweeping statement.  Is he saying that has happened during this D&aacute;il term?  Does he have examples?  I ask those questions because I reject the Minister's assertion.  I do not think that anything said in the D&aacute;il and Seanad has veered into the territory of anti-Semitism or of being anti-Israeli.  Therefore, does the Minister have examples or anything specific he would like to point to?</p></speech>

I have two questions.  The first concerns the situation at the Belarusian-Polish border.  Large waves of refugees are being used as political pawns, and basically being used in hybrid attacks against the European Union.  There have been reports of refugees being flown in from the Middle East to Minsk and then being bussed up to the border.  The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for increased sanctions against the Lukashenko regime.  Does the Minister see these additional sanctions coming in and, if so, what will they contain?  How long would it take for any such additional sanctions to come into force?</p> <p>  My second question concerns China.  Every member of the committee is well aware that an Irish citizen is being held in China against his will and without charge.  It is a matter of deep concern for every member of this committee.  The Chinese ambassador has declined to come before the committee and I am sure we can all draw our own conclusions as to why that would be the case.  In fairness, all the committee members have maintained a dignified silence regarding the case of Richard O&rsquo;Halloran to allow the diplomatic community the space and time to progress the situation.  To be fair as well, however, we can see nothing that points towards progress being made.  I would be grateful, therefore, if the Minister will update this committee regarding where we stand with the case of Richard O&rsquo;Halloran and how he sees this issue progressing between now and Christmas.  If national diplomacy is not working, do we need to escalate this matter to a higher level, for example, to the European Union Foreign Affairs Council or to the United Nations Security Council itself?</p></speech>

In that regard, I met with the Jewish community in Ireland on this issue.  For me, if Ireland is to be credible and effective internationally in respect of being critical of the policy of the Israeli Government towards Palestinians, then we must be clear concerning how that is seen and interpreted by other countries and by Jewish people.  Jewish people living in Ireland should not be made uncomfortable or be targeted because of their association with Israel due to the strong political views held in Ireland concerning the relationship between Israel and Palestinians.  Many examples, unfortunately, have been given to me of Jewish people who have been targeted online because of who they are.  We must be careful, therefore, regarding how we speak and the language that we use to voice our frustrations.</p><p>In particular, when I used strong and emotive language in May, I believe I was on the right side of that line but I know many other people who were speaking passionately used highly emotive language as well.  When we start referring to racist, colonial settlement enterprises and so on, that can be interpreted by some as a reflection on a people rather than a Government policy-----</p></speech>

I visited Israel and Palestine for the fifth time in four years last week.  Had it not been for Covid, I probably would have been there for the eighth time.  I am investing on behalf of the members, because I know many people in this room and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad care deeply about this issue.  I am investing in building relationships with political leaders in the Palestinian Authority, PA, and the new Israeli Government, because, I want Ireland to be a positive influence on trying to create the conditions for a peace negotiation, which is the only way a Palestinian state can emerge on the basis of agreement.  The language we use is listened to and covered closely in Israel.  Many Israelis see that blurred boundary between being a critic of Israeli foreign policy and anti-Semitism as an area I am concerned about in terms of my effectiveness to be internationally influential in this space.  We should think about that.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, while there is a famine and extraordinary human suffering in parts of the Tigray region in Ethiopia, this is not confined to Tigray any longer.  There is a real risk that a country of more than 115 million people could fracture, in a part of Africa that would be thrust into extraordinary uncertainty and instability should that happen.  Ethiopia is on the verge of civil war.  We, along with a number of other countries, are trying to do everything we can to ensure that does not happen.  The immediate challenge is to try to get an agreed ceasefire and a negotiation process under way and of course, a massive humanitarian effort to bring supplies of food, medicines and many other things into parts of Ethiopia that need them, especially northern Ethiopia and not just Tigray.  However, this is on a knife edge and the international community needs to be active in this space and we are trying to be part of that.</p> <p>  I met the new UN special representative to Yemen while I was in Jordan and got a good briefing on the challenges there.  This is very complex.  We will not see a huge step forward overnight but he is an impressive person and is working closely with both parties and other countries in the region that are involved in this conflict, in terms of funding, arms and so on, to try to bring about the basis of a ceasefire and safe humanitarian access.</p> <p>  I know Deputy Brady has strong views on the Middle East peace process.  I have publicly challenged the designation of the six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations or as supporting such organisations both in Israel and on international media.  I have said we need to see the proof of these organisations being terrorist organisations, because, we fund, albeit modestly, two of the six organisations.  One of them is Al-Haq and the other is Addameer.  One works with prisoners and the other works in advocacy and taking legal cases for people who probably would not otherwise be able to afford to do so.</p> <p>  Our view is the role of NGOs, especially in somewhere such as the occupied Palestinian territories are hugely important in representing vulnerable people.  I have certainly seen no evidence to suggest any of the six organisations have links to terrorism.  Of course, if that evidence emerges and exists, we will look at it.  We will ensure no organisation gets Irish money if it is supporting terrorism or inciting violence.  I must add, however, that my senior officials met and had a good meeting with representatives of both Al-Haq and Addameer while we were in Ramallah to discuss how we can continue to support them through the difficulties they clearly now face because of this designation.  We will continue to support them until we see evidence we should not.  I do not know whether that evidence exists but we have certainly not seen it and we have asked for it.  If that changes, I will update the committee.</p> <p>  The role of NGOs and civil society is extremely important in any functioning democracy but even more important somewhere like the West Bank, where that voice is badly needed, even if that creates tension and difficulties for governments such as that of Israel.  We do not fund NGOs because they tell us what we want to hear.  They always push governments; that is the role of NGOs in society.  This decision needs to be questioned and that is why I have done so.  By the way, so has the EU.  The Deputy stated the EU has been quiet on this issue but it has not.  The EU has been quite public in questioning this decision, asking for the evidence and not being convinced by what was provided to it.  This is an issue which will continue to be under discussion.  In terms of-----</p></speech>

We have spoken and will continue to speak directly to the two organisations involved to understand how we can be helpful in practice, in terms of protecting the work they do.  That includes how they are financed.  Being designated as illegal because of links to terrorism is very worrying for an organisation in terms of its ability to be able to work at all.  It is important to be upfront about that.  This is not simply a label.  It is a designation in law or at least has a legal effect, which is hugely problematic.  That is why I was so direct in raising it.</p> <p>  We spent more than half a day in the West Bank, between Jerusalem and Ramallah, looking at settlement expansion and the impact that is having on many Palestinian communities.  It is a real worry.  My commentary on settlement and settlement expansion has been pretty consistent, both on and off the record.  We regard it as illegal.  Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, an occupying power on somebody else's land is prohibited from transferring its populations into occupied territory, which is exactly what settlement expansion is all about.</p><p>There are close to 700,000 Israelis now living in different parts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  That is making the ambition of a two-state solution as a basis for a negotiated peaceful outcome to a conflict increasingly difficult.  In this regard, I am referring to the future viability of a Palestinian state.  I continue to be very direct and blunt about the illegality of what is occurring, and also about its counterproductive nature if one is serious about negotiating a peace settlement in the future.</p><p> I strongly defend our ambassador's commentary.  Israel, as a country, sees itself as a democracy based on the rule of law.  That does not mean I am not very critical of actions of the Israeli Government in occupied territory.  I am not afraid to call out the illegality of that, but the two are-----</p></speech>

Irish people have solidarity with the plight of Belarusian people and what they are trying to bring about in their country, namely democratic legitimacy whereby they choose political leaders rather than having what is effectively a dictatorship that will not accept the will of the people as expressed in an election, which is what is currently in place.  In the context of the relationship between Belarus and the EU, there has been a deliberate attempt by the Lukashenko regime to create tension with the EU effectively by bringing in vulnerable migrants from other parts of the world and bussing them to the borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.  The regime is deliberately causing significant unrest at the borders, which is putting migrants in danger.  It is creating genuine tension among the countries involved, both politically and socially.  It is causing a lot of tension within the European Union.  There has been a very deliberate effort by Belarus to destabilise political relationships within the countries that border it.  This is reckless and puts some very vulnerable people in harm's way.  Some of the refugees have lost their lives on the border.  Belarus is also looking to try to paint the EU in a bad light as efforts are made to try to seal off borders in the region and try to manage the number of refugees crossing.  What is occurring is effectively the state-sponsored use of vulnerable migrants to create political tension as a negotiating influencer.  It is incredibly irresponsible.  We are working to try to target new sanctions to respond to that.  Members will see a fifth round of sanctions coming forward.  Ireland has been very much involved in trying to shape them to send a very clear signal to Belarus that this is not acceptable.</p> <p>  With regard to Richard O'Halloran, I do not want to say too much because this is a consular case.  It is probably the consular case that has been accorded more priority and taken up more time than any other over recent years.  I am personally very involved in it by way of conversations and correspondence with my counterpart in China.  Our embassy and representation in Shanghai are very much involved and speak to Richard regularly.  We are keeping his family, including Tara, his wife, up to speed on the work we are doing.  I am not sure it is helpful for me to get into all the legal detail on how we are trying to facilitate Richard's coming home, but we will continue to work with the Chinese authorities to get him home as soon as possible.  The lack of public commentary from me on this issue should not be confused with a lack of political priority to get Richard O'Halloran back to his family in Dublin.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  We are deliberately not saying a lot publicly in an effort to ensure that we have an effective strategy to get Richard home as quickly as possible.  For Richard's family, this matter has been a weight, and it has gone on and on.</p> <p>  The court case is complicated but I believe we are moving towards the end of the process.  I do not want to give any direct timelines, however, because I cannot stand over them definitively just yet.  I reassure people that there is an enormous effort under way to ensure that Richard will be allowed to come owing to the removal of the exit ban applying to him.  He has been in China for a very long time and his children are growing up without him, which is something we are trying to correct as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  On Brexit, I am conscious that I do not want to turn this meeting into a Brexit meeting because, if I do, we could end up spending all the time on it.  I do not want to give a monologue on Brexit either.  We are at a really serious point now in the context of the Northern Ireland protocol.  There is a serious risk that the British Government may choose to trigger Article 16.  I hope it will not.  We are working as hard as we can, as is the EU, to ensure that it will not.  The EU, through Vice-President &Scaron;efovi, has for many months been in deal-making mode.  It has been compromising and looking for ways to introduce flexibility in respect of how the protocol is implemented.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi came to Belfast, met political leaders, business leaders and civil society leaders and promised them that he would go back to Brussels to try to design a package of measures that would respond to their key concerns.  I believe he followed through on that promise when he responded to the four key issues people raised with him.</p> <p>  There has been concern for some time that medicines may be prevented from getting from Great Britain into Northern Ireland somehow because of the protocol.  Given that we are still living through a global pandemic, this was completely unacceptable to people in Northern Ireland.  I understand that.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi has essentially agreed to change EU law to ensure there are no barriers to the entry to Northern Ireland of medicines approved in Great Britain, despite the fact that Northern Ireland effectively functions as an extension of the EU Single Market for goods under the protocol.  That clear commitment to ensuring there would be no disruption of the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland from Great Britain was the first part of the package.</p> <p>  Second, business leaders and politicians want a significant reduction in checks and goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi has essentially proposed a way of reducing sanitary and phytosanitary checks on food products that are staying in Northern Ireland by up to 80%.  This represents a massive change from where the European Commission was at the start of the year, or even in the middle of the year.</p><p>I think Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has looked to push all the legal and regulatory boundaries within the confines of the protocol to allow for SPS checks largely not to apply to products coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland that we can show are staying in Northern Ireland by improved labelling, better data sharing and so on.  The approach is the same for customs checks.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi claims that the EU can propose solutions that can reduce customs checks by 50% - in other words, halve them.</p><p> In the fourth area, governance, many unionist politicians in particular, but not only unionist politicians, have said to me that if the UK is to operate under the rules of the Single Market for goods, the UK must have improved structures of communication and governance as to how that will work and how it will plan for responding to that in Northern Ireland.  Again, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has tried to respond to that concern by proposing new governance arrangements for direct dialogue and input from business and political leaders in Northern Ireland.</p><p> Taking all four of those things together, on top of some of the other concessions and flexibilities that have been shown over the past six months or so from the EU side, it has to be seen as a very genuine effort on the part of the Commission to try to solve these problems and settle people's concerns about the implementation of the protocol in the context of trying to deal with the Irish issues and the complexity of those that are forced by Brexit, or certainly forced by the kind of Brexit this British Government insisted on in Westminster.  Unfortunately, the British Government has responded to those efforts by effectively banking concessions and flexibilities and looking for more, giving very little recognition of the extent to which the European Commission has moved in an effort to try to respond to the issues and concerns in Northern Ireland.  The issue of the ECJ is in many ways one that is being prioritised in Westminster.  It has not at all been an issue of priority in any of the discussions I have had or the Commission has had in Northern Ireland in the context of the implementation of the protocol.</p><p> Discussions are still under way this week.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and Lord Frost will meet again on Friday in London.  I certainly hope they will find a way to move forward on the basis of discussion and partnership, as opposed to the British Government side deciding to trigger Article 16 at some point post COP, in the next few weeks, which I think will trigger a very robust response from the EU side.  If the British Government decides to set aside formally elements of the protocol using Article 16 as a facilitator for that, I believe the EU will see that as an act of bad faith and it will impact negatively the relationship between the EU and the UK and put a lot of pressure on the relationship between the UK and Ireland.  That is not what we need.  It is not what Northern Ireland needs or deserves and, from the Irish Government's perspective, we will look to try to find a way forward.  However, as long as the British Government keeps asking for the EU to deliver the impossible - every time a concession or a flexibility is shown, the British Government looks for more and more - and if that continues to be the approach, I think this negotiation will run out of road.  While there is a window for compromise, certainly from the EU side, I hope the British Government will see the sense in negotiating in a way that is robust but which will not trigger Article 16, instead looking to settle on a sensible agreement and a way forward.  The parties in Northern Ireland could do with that as opposed to the alternative, which is tension between Dublin and London, tension between London and Brussels and the unfortunately polarising impact of that on politics in Northern Ireland, where there is already significant tension within the Executive and the Assembly as we lead into elections next year.</p><p> There is a lot at stake.  I listened with interest to former Prime Minister John Major expressing his concern in a very forthright way over the weekend.  I do not disagree with anything he said.  When the British and Irish Governments do not act in partnership, it generally results in bad outcomes impacting Northern Ireland.  Whether on legacy or on the protocol, I hope the British Government will seek a partnership approach rather than an alternative to that, which is not good for anybody.  The British Government should not underestimate the EU's resolve or the EU solidarity in the context of the impact on Ireland of the decisions the British Government makes.  That is much as I will say about the matter.</p></speech>

Since this is one of our first hybrid meetings, on a personal level I wish to welcome to our team Ms Emma McCarron.  She worked with me on the Council of Europe, highly satisfactorily so, and worked on the Irish team there with great effect and great impact.  It is wonderful that we have somebody with that experience and ability on our team now.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting.  The handling of the UN role is extraordinarily satisfactory.  I will not repeat all the detail the Minister has given.  He is doing an extremely good job, as is Ireland generally.  He graciously recognised the role of our 50 young civil servants over there.  That is all good, and I wish to recognise that.  I am delighted with the Minister's passionate commitment to the Middle East, his continual visits there and his pursuing of matters in the region.  That is of great importance to me, as it is important, as the Minister said, to every Irish person.</p> <p>  I will run through a few specific questions.  I understand that Afghanistan, to which the Minister referred in his presentation, is going through extraordinary economic turmoil at the moment and is an almost dysfunctional economy at a certain level.  That is my understanding.  I will stand corrected if I am wrong.  What opportunity might that present for the international community to insist on and enhance women's rights there?  Since Afghanistan is no longer a big issue in the news as the news keeps changing, as we in this room all understand, I would like to hear what the Minister would say are the current issues in Afghanistan and how he sees the state of the country generally.  I would like a comment on that.</p> <p>  I will not repeat the points the Minister made about the Middle East.  It is great that it is a priority for him.  I agree with him: I do not think the Irish people are antisemitic, nor does the Minister, I know.  However, I certainly agree with him about the targeting of people online.  Our Jewish community should not feel any sense of insecurity - on the contrary - yet we can be very honest with them.  I suspect that many among the Jewish diaspora or Jewish people living here or elsewhere, outside of Israel, are quite embarrassed about a lot of the issues we discuss here.  I agree with the Minister about the non-governmental organisations.  That is terrible, and it is important we stay with them until, as he himself says, there is evidence to the contrary, and there clearly is not, so it is important we go on funding and working with the non-governmental bodies in the region.  He referred in his presentation to the elections in Palestine and the hope to get elections there.  He might comment a little more on what is happening there.  The last thing I will ask him about the Middle East is this: does he detect within the current Israeli Government, because of its complex and disparate nature, a lack of willingness or a lack of priority when it comes to the peace process?</p><p>If so, can we change that?  If not, when would he see hope there?</p><p> We are all interested in the Iranian nuclear deal.  The Minister alluded to it.  He is following it very closely.  There is not a lot we can say, other than that we hope it works.  The Minister might speak about his instincts around it at the moment.</p><p> I ask the Minister to comment on access for humanitarian aid in Ethiopia.  It is depressing to hear him say that Ethiopia is at the point of civil war.</p><p> Again, we are involved in access in Syria.  The Minister might comment on that.</p><p> I will finish with a couple of quick points.  The Minister referenced China.  I will not go into the individual case that Deputy Berry dealt with and that the Minister responded to.  The media reports about the Uighur Muslim people in China are concerning to all of us here.  I do not know what information the Department has on this topic.  If the media reports are true, we are back in a dreadful situation.  Future generations will talk about what we did not do about this.</p><p> Of course, I agree with the Minister and with everyone who referenced Belarus.  As he said, there is a fifth round of sanctions.  That is all to the good.  I was watching the television coverage last night - all of us probably were - on the Polish border.  It is distressing.</p><p> Lastly, as a Border person, I would like to say that I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clear statement on Brexit.  The British Government, and indeed many politicians in the North of Ireland, are out of kilter with the business community there and with the ordinary people on the topic of Brexit.  There is a divergence there.  The ordinary people feel differently about this question, as does the business community and civil society.  In fact, politicians are way behind the curve on this topic.  Anybody who is rational in Northern Ireland wants a normal trading relationship and wants to have the advantage of the greatly increased North-South trade that we are delighted about.  They want to be fit to trade east-west in a smooth fashion.  I welcome what the Minister has said there.  Certainly, it would be a nightmare scenario for the part of Ireland I come from if we were to go back to open hostilities, to a breakdown of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and to a breakdown of the protocol on Article 16.  </p><p> I find the report encouraging in that Ireland is so proactive, and the Minister is too.  However, the report is disturbing insofar as it sets out where we are at on a number of questions.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s responses.</p></speech>

At the outset, I want to say that our officials throughout the world, anywhere I have ever been, have been amazing people doing an amazing job.  The Minister, and indeed his forerunners as Minister for Foreign Affairs, have had high profiles internationally and have served the country well.</p> <p>  However, let us start with Iran.  I cannot understand why, when we decided to go back to Iran, we did not open an embassy there.  It strikes me that sometimes when we look at foreign policy in this country, we do so while being afraid of two nations.  These are, to our west, the US, and to our east, China.  We should open an embassy in Iran.  We should be treating both the United States and China as partners, not as dominant powers we are careful not to upset in any way.  I know there are problems with Iran.  I know that issues need to be sorted out there.  The only way to sort these things out is by being on the ground and engaging with the people.  I would like some idea of the timeline for the opening of a full embassy in Iran.</p> <p>  With respect to China, I will not go back over the subject of Richard O&rsquo;Halloran other than to put it into the same mix that I have just outlined.  It seems as though we are afraid to upset China in any way.  China is either a partner of this country or it is not.  If it is not a partner of this country, we should get tough with them at the end of the day.  </p> <p>  Similarly, with regard to Taiwan, most European countries now have a representative in Taipei.  Why are we so afraid to go there, especially given how responsive Taiwan was to our needs with respect to personal protective equipment, PPE, and the like when the pandemic hit.  Taiwan was a tremendous partner to Ireland.  It sent PPE over to nursing homes.  It was just wonderful in its response.   I cannot understand why we do not have somebody on the ground there.  The European Union has people on the ground.  Most of the European countries have people on the ground.  We do not have to open an embassy.  All we have to do is have a representative there that would be able to talk directly to the Taiwanese Government.</p> <p>  I was never enthusiastic about the presidency of the United Nations Security Council.  I am mindful of the words of Greta Thunberg last night on the news, &ldquo;blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah&rdquo;.  Very shortly-----</p></speech>

However, I am talking about the public perception.  People think the Security Council is just a talking shop.  I looked at resolutions going before the Security Council between 1946 and 2011.  I think those were the dates.  There were something like 11 pages of resolutions that had been vetoed by the big five.  It makes people wonder what exactly the Security Council does.  As Afghanistan fell apart, we made a statement that Ireland stands with the women of Afghanistan.  What does that mean?  What practical steps have we taken to ensure the women of Afghanistan have been able to access education, for example?  I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like for a teenage girl who has had a number of years of education suddenly to be told that she cannot attend education, or for a young woman who was attending university to be told that her education is over and she is not going any further.</p> <p>  We talk about the shift from peacekeeping to peacebuilding.  I would love the Minister to tell me precisely what that means.  With respect to his forthcoming negotiations for a new resolution with the Security Council, will he publish that resolution before it goes to the Security Council?  It is my understanding that the way----</p></speech>

I understand the way we get around the problem of having resolutions vetoed is that we do not publish the resolution until we are sure we have everybody on side.  If that is the way the Security Council works, it is really only a talking shop.  We have to be brave and we have to publish whatever resolutions we want.  We should let them veto it if they want.  However, let them face the world and explain why they vetoed something that was going to benefit all of humanity.  I admire the Minister for bringing this forward.  I think it is a great idea, but I would like us to bring it forward without fear or favour and actually publish it and be damned.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I wonder if future engagements of this nature should be divided into sections dealing with the Middle East or with external relations, etc., rather than having repetition and a kind of a pick-and-mix which makes it difficult for the Minister.</p></speech>

Have we effectively given up, or washed our hands of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, as a consequence of that?  Will our officers be back in?  What will be our role in the MINURSO mission in Western Sahara?  For me, Western Sahara represents another example of why we should be passing the occupied territories Bill.  This is first because it is right and just to do so, but second, because it would remove some of those accusations that were made against us previously.</p> <p>  I also want to touch on an issue about our application of Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, OPCAT, which is in the programme for Government.</p><p>We often talk about the human rights record of other countries here.  The ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, OPCAT, is long overdue.  It is not specifically a role of the Minister's Department but it is in the programme for Government.  We often talk about torture and human rights in the context of other nations.  We should not fear to hold the gaze against ourselves.</p></speech>

It is one of grave proportions and I hope the Minister and his European colleagues will engage in ensuring, insofar as they can, that monitored elections are held at the earliest opportunity next year and that the issue of humanitarian aid to Lebanon is on the agenda.  The situation there from the political, economic, financial and social points of view is one of crisis.  The task the Government has is overwhelming.  I ask that consideration be given at an early date for the European Union to follow through on sanctions that have been promised in respect of a political elite, some of which has clear links with terrorist organisations.</p> <p>  As far as Ireland's engagement with Lebanon is concerned and having regard to what the Minister said, we welcome the opening of the embassy in Amman, Jordan.  Is there a plan for us to increase our engagement with Lebanon and Beirut?  Is it envisaged that capacity might be built upon?  The ambassador in Cairo, Egypt, used to have and perhaps still has a remit in respect of Lebanon.  There is a distance issue there but I hope, having regard to the crisis in Lebanon, that we continue to take an active interest and build capacity in our consulate or look at a resident embassy in Beirut.</p> <p>  I note with alarm in recent times the arbitrary deportation of a number of Syrian refugees back to a situation of danger in Damascus and other parts of Syria.  I ask that that issue be taken on board.  The situation in Syria has faded from our front pages but it is still in crisis.  I refer specifically to thousands of prisoners detained in Damascus and other prison camps in horrific conditions.  Many of them have been detained without charges having been preferred.  I ask that the European Union continue to look at that.  Are we moving towards a situation, which I would warn against, where there is a recognition on the part of some European Union states of the Assad regime?  How is this being dealt with at Foreign Affairs Council?  I would regard such recognition with alarm and trepidation.  </p> <p>  The Minister can drop me a note on the following issue if it is not to hand.  Our relationship with Australia is good and has been for many decades.  That will continue but, having regard to our diaspora in Western Australia and the economic relationship between Ireland and Western Australia, will consideration be given towards the establishment of a consulate in Perth?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the UN Security Council.  I disagree with Senator Craughwell's remarks.  I express my appreciation and that of the committee for the role the UN council team played and the role our team in New York continues to play in political developments across the world.  I acknowledge the role the Minister's team played in the recent repatriation of Irish citizens from Afghanistan.  That was hugely important and very successful.  It was expertly done and we appreciate that, as do the Irish people.</p></speech>

He spoke on Afghanistan.  I will follow up on what the Chair has just said and give an update on the number of Irish citizens, as well as Irish residents who may be Afghan citizens still in Afghanistan but who want to come home.  So far, 106 Irish citizens, that is, Irish passport-holders, have managed to get out.  We have helped them do that.  There are 14 remaining and 12 would like to get out.  The other two want to stay.  Some people are extremely committed to the work they do with humanitarian organisations and want to stay and make a contribution.  I have extraordinary admiration for people in those situations.</p> <p>  We have had some success in recent weeks in getting places on planes organised by Qatar out of Kabul airport.  The Qataris have been helpful partners in terms of making, normally, 14 to 30 seats available, depending on the numbers, the size of the plane and so on.  We have 12 who want to leave and 106 out so we have made good progress.  Hopefully, we will get the remaining dozen people out soon.  I have made it clear to our team that I want Irish residents who may be Afghan citizens but who effectively live in Ireland and want to come home to their families, to be treated as Irish citizens in terms of helping them to get out.  Twenty Irish residents are out and about 12 remain.  We will do what we can to get them out.  </p> <p>  Then there are the refugee visa waiver cases.  Just under 500 people have been given refugee status to come to Ireland.  Some 300 of those are either on their way or already here.  Another 190 still need to get out.  It is often much more complicated to get Afghan refugees out of Afghanistan because it is difficult to get them on planes out of Kabul and many will cross the border into Pakistan.  We have a good relationship and agreement with Pakistan to get them on planes to Ireland under the visa waiver programme.</p> <p>  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has been remarkably helpful through this period.  His team and Department have turned around applications for visas quickly on the advice and recommendation of NGOs we trust.  If we had chosen to go through a long interview process structure, which some countries do and which we normally do, many of the 300 people now out of Afghanistan would still be there and many of them would be in real danger.</p><p>Ireland has received a significant amount of international recognition for the pace at which we have turned around refugee applications, specifically those of vulnerable groups such as journalists or teachers.  They are mostly women who were working, some of whom may have been translators in the past for western forces or NATO forces in Afghanistan, but all of whom have good reason to get out and cannot do so unless there is a country willing to accept them.  That is why we have done as much as we can there and will do more.  The biggest challenge for us is accommodation once they come to Ireland.  I would like to see us working more with communities and organisations, and potentially with employers, because many of these people have real skills and speak fluent English.  Some of them are nurses, surgeons, teachers or journalists who could make a very positive contribution here and we should be doing everything we can to help them.</p><p> To give members a sense of the scale of the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, I am gravely concerned in respect of the potentially catastrophic humanitarian situation.  The food crisis in Afghanistan has reached unprecedented levels, with more than half the population, or 22.8 million people, expected to face acute food insecurity by the end of the year.  We can expect that figure to increase due to prolonged drought, continuing conflict and the possibility of near-total economic collapse.  In September, Ireland confirmed an additional &euro;2 million to UNICEF and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, humanitarian funds for Afghanistan, bringing our funding this year to more than &euro;4 million.  I suspect we will end up doing a lot again next year.  Irish Aid is supporting the work in Afghanistan of some long-standing NGO partners such as Concern and the HALO Trust.  Irish Aid will discuss with our NGO partners their plans for continuing engagement in the country.  It has a large population, 50% of whom are suffering significant food insecurity and, unfortunately, more and more of them are facing the potential for famine-type conditions.  It is in that context that the international community is engaging with the Taliban.  It is not recognising the Taliban as a government but it is certainly engaging with it in order to get aid in there and take a pragmatic approach towards-----</p></speech>

Of course, we want to advocate for a more inclusive government, and we are doing so.  We want to advocate for women's rights and particularly the rights of girls in terms of education and employment and so on, and we are doing so.  However, are we being successful in protecting women's rights in Afghanistan?  Only to a very limited extent.  There are many anecdotal stories that, unfortunately, are very depressing and worrying.  We will have to wait and see how that relationship develops, but the international community does need to use all the leverage it has to try to ensure the Taliban is held to account in terms of adherence to international law and human rights standards.  We have also got to get enormous volumes of aid into the country, otherwise there will be mass movement of people, starvation and the collapse of an economy that is already collapsing, in truth, because there is no functioning financial or banking system.</p><p>As regards Palestinian elections, there are local elections planned across Palestinian territories next year.  There are elections within the Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, as well.  Of course, we would like to see the setting out of a roadmap to elections to the Palestinian Authority and presidential elections at some point.  Whether it makes sense to have an interim government in the meantime or a continuation of the current Palestinian Authority structures is something that is under debate within Palestinian politics right now.</p><p>On the issue of the Israeli Government, the truth is that it is a Government with eight coalition partners that have very different perspectives on the Middle East peace process.  Some are Israeli Arab parties, while others are parties that, in effect, represent the interests of settler communities.  It is not an easy thing for that Government to agree on a pathway forward on a peace settlement, or even the conditions to start peace negotiations with the Palestinian leadership.  That said, there are people in that Government who would like to do a lot more in that direction, while there are others who have a very different perspective to that shared by those in this room.  We will have to wait and see.  It is early days.  The Israeli Government has only just passed its budget.  Many people predicted it would not get the budget passed but it has passed a budget not only for one year, but for two years.  I think this Israeli Government will be in place for some time.  At an EU level and on a bilateral level, it makes sense to develop a relationship based on straight talking in an effort to try to encourage a peace dialogue with Palestinian leaders.</p><p>As regards Ethiopia and humanitarian access, the humanitarian situation in northern Ethiopia is dire.  At the moment, it is not safe to get humanitarian aid in and there are blockages to that aid.  The situation is changing literally by the day.  Members may well see Tigrayan forces and other troops with whom they are working actually opening up new supply routes into Tigray and other parts of northern Ethiopia, but that obviously has to be discussed and negotiated with the international community in terms of how that would be done.  Those are the kinds of conversations that are taking place right now.  It is a country with approximately 115 million people and there really needs to be an international focus to ensure it does not collapse and splinter into different tribal perspectives, which would be a disaster for the Horn of Africa.</p><p>As regards China and the Uighurs, Ireland has been quite vocal on this issue not only in our Parliament, particularly the Seanad, but we have also spoken at the UN Human Rights Council on this issue.  We have raised these issues on several occasions along with our partners in the EU and the wider international community, including, most recently, at the 48th UN Human Rights Council in September and at the UN Third Committee on human rights in October.  </p><p>I take Senator Joe O'Reilly's point regarding the pragmatism of business leaders in Northern Ireland, who now just want to accept a protocol that works with the maximum flexibility possible.  That is something towards which I hope we can work.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of Iran.  First of all, we have agreed to open an embassy in Iran but I needed to get a person on the ground quickly because Ireland has a responsibility in that regard as facilitator for the resolution which is the basis for the joint comprehensive plan of action, JCPOA.  As such, I needed to have a senior diplomat on the ground.  We have a <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>, Mr. Justin Ryan, in place there.  He is experienced and good at what he does.We agreed to partner with the German Embassy to get a team on the ground quickly.  That was the pragmatic thing to do.  If we had sought to open an embassy, we would still be messing around trying to find the right location.  As the Chairman will know having previously been in my role, it takes many months to get an embassy secured legally and from a communication point of view and all the rest of it.  We got a team on the ground quickly by working in partnership with a really good EU partner that has a big presence there.  Actually, we share information with it, which gives us a really good insight because the German foreign office has deep roots around the world.</p><p>  On the issue of China and it being time to get tough with China on Richard O'Halloran, all I can say is that my only motivation in this regard is to get Richard O'Halloran home.  We are pursuing a strategy to do that and it is about maximising his chances of getting home.  I do not believe China responds to strong-arming or pressure.  My objective is getting a result, not getting profile out of this case or getting column inches on it or anything else.</p><p>I have spoken to Richard O'Halloran's wife many times.  I feel a personal responsibility to get him home.  That is what we are focusing on and I believe we will succeed, but I cannot give an exact timeline as to when.</p><p> On the UN Security Council, from my experience, I am aware of the perceptions about the UN Security Council because the veto is used often in an irresponsible way that prevents the Security Council intervening at times when it should.  Just because that happens - and it should not - it does not mean the Security Council still does not do extraordinarily valuable work, which I have seen since we became a member of the council, in terms of interventions and applying pressure at the right time.  Sometimes the Security Council fails in a shocking way to intervene to prevent conflict, but it has successes too.  It is effectively one of the few legitimate multilateral fora that can intervene on war and peace issues in a way that is consistent with international law.  While it is not perfect, and I would like to see it reformed, what we are trying to do on the Security Council is to work in a streetwise manner to get as much done as we possibly can on new resolutions.  I can share the resolution on peace transitions with the Deputy.  I assure members that it is a practical resolution.  It requires the Secretary General of the UN to produce a report on how we move from peacekeeping missions, of which there are many around the world, and how we transition into peace support over time.  Peacekeeping missions should not have a permanent presence.  Unfortunately, they have become that in many parts of the world that rely on peacekeeping missions to keep the peace.  We should be able to invest in diplomacy and in capacity building within states to safely make the transition from peacekeeping to peace support to peace building over time.  Our resolution requires the Secretary General to put a roadmap in place in terms of how that can be done, and to tailor that to individual peacekeeping missions and the mandates around them.  It is very pragmatic and comes from a country that has much experience in peacekeeping - that is to say Ireland - and has worked with many other countries that do as well.  I am happy to share the resolution with the Deputy, who has an interest in and much knowledge of peacekeeping.</p><p> I will give an example of the UN Security Council functioning despite tension and politics.  We spent six months working with countries in the council, particularly the five permanent members, P5, trying to protect a mandate to get humanitarian assistance into Idlib, in north-western Syria, to support a population of close to 3 million people who are almost entirely reliant on the cross-border aid programme that is transparent and delivered through UN organisations.  That came to a head in midsummer, but we managed to get it across the line by helping to broker an agreement between the United States, Russia and Turkey.  As a result, that aid continues to flow.  If it had not been for the Security Council, there would be no such resolution and no such border crossing supporting vulnerable populations.  It can therefore work.  It is not always easy.  Believe me: the Security Council has its flaws.  It is predominately a force for good most of the time.</p><p> I refer to Deputy Gannon's questions on the mission to Western Sahara and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.  I did not recognise the acronym used; I bow to the Deputy's expertise on that one.  On the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, I know a bit about Western Sahara from my time in the European Parliament.  In July, the Defence Forces withdrew two personnel from MINURSO.  The decision arose from the need to consolidate operational deployments in the context of recent significant additional commitments to arrange a peace keeping operations, including the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, MINUSMA, the European Union Training Mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, in addition to maintaining the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  The withdrawal does not represent a reduction in our commitment to the mission's mandates and we have spoken on that mandate quite strongly in the Security Council.  Our long standing position is one of full support for MINURSO, the UN lead process and the Secretary General's efforts to bring about a definitive and mutually acceptable political settle on this issue.  What is happening in Western Sahara continues to be tragic.  Just because we do not have peacekeepers in a mission, it does not mean we are not completely committed to the mandate.  Sometimes we have to make practical decisions on where we deploy personnel in order to make a maximum and positive impact.  We made a practical decision on the advice of the Defence Forces in regard to that, and it does not undermine our political commitment at all.</p><p> On the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, legislation to allow for ratification of the optional protocol is currently being drafted and will be brought to Government shortly, subject to approval of the D&aacute;il and Government.  This legislation will create a new office of inspector of places of detention.  We are committed to it.  I am not sure if I will be responsible for debating it in the D&aacute;il.  I suspect the Department of Justice will be.  This legislation is on the way.</p><p> I refer to the Chairman's comments on Lebanon.  I was in Lebanon a number of months ago and I hope to return before Christmas.  This is a country that should be a wealthy country but is virtually bankrupt because of very bad politics.  The EU had been pushing for the formation of a new Government, which has now happened.  We are unlikely to see EU sanctions being used now.  The sanctions were there as a tool to force the formation of a government that could actually make decisions on the reform agenda that needs to be progressed.  The EU does not want to sanction Lebanon; it wants to be help it.  This country has survived in this extraordinary environment - domestically and in terms of the countries that surround it.  There has been a political class in Lebanon that has not brought about the reform needed and, as a result, we have effectively seen this country move into national bankruptcy, or close to it.  That is one of the reasons that over the summer we insisted on amending and changing the UNIFIL mandate to allow UNIFIL to play a more pragmatic assistance role to the Lebanese Armed Forces, LAF, which is one of the strong stabilising forces within Lebanon and has the respect of the population there.  UNIFIL can now, in a practical way, assist the LAF in a way it would not have been able to before, with things like basic supplies and fuel, etc.  There were real financial problems in funding the Lebanese Armed Forces to work with UNIFIL to keep the peace in southern Lebanon, particularly in the context of tension with Hezbollah.  It was an important change and was led by Ireland.</p><p> We need to watch Lebanon closely.  When we decided to set up an embassy in Jordan, in Amman, it was a toss-up between opening in Beirut or Amman.  In some ways, due to our presence in UNIFIL for so long, it would have made sense to set up an embassy in Beirut because at present it is served from Egypt which is a long distance away.  We felt we were developing a strong and positive relationship with Jordan at the time.  Jordan is a central player in the context of the Middle East peace process, particularly on the holy sites in Jerusalem.  We also believed there were real trade opportunities there as well.  We will be looking at Lebanon in the future, in terms of increasing our representation there, and hopefully we will have much more political and economic stability by the time we do that.</p><p> I have expressed my concern about the forced deportation of Syrian refugees.  Refugees should not be forced back into areas of conflict where they are not safe, despite the extraordinary pressures Lebanon is under in regard to the enormous population of refugees.  It is a bit like Jordan.  Some 30% of its population are refugees, between Palestinians and Syrians.  That puts extraordinary pressure on the system, particularly at a time when public money is not there.</p><p>That is obviously not a justification for returning refugees in a way that is not safe.</p><p> I do not think we are moving towards recognition of the Assad regime in Syria.  I will give the official position on that in the context of normalisation and reconstruction.  The conflict in Syria is far from over even though it has now been ongoing for over 11 years.  The EU remains resolute and continues to demand an end to repression, the release of detainees and that the Syrian regime and its allies engage meaningfully in the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  Given the failure of the Syrian authorities to engage in a meaningful way on the provisions set out in Resolution 2254, it is premature, in our view, to have any normalisation of political relations with the regime.  We have to continue to support humanitarian assistance and the vital infrastructure within Syria.  It is difficult to get the balance right.  I think the international contribution to humanitarian support in Syria is between $5 billion and $6 billion a year.  We do that with no recognition from and no relationship with the Assad regime.  We have to ask ourselves if that is sustainable indefinitely but we also have to ensure that we hold people to account for war crimes and for the treatment of their own people.</p><p> Regarding Australia, I am familiar with the Irish diaspora in Perth.  One of them is my brother.  He is a doctor there, like many other young Irish people and their families.  The Department is assessing where the next phase of expansion will go.  We have opened many new representations in the last years, from Chile to Colombia, from Toronto to Auckland, with a range in the United States, Manchester, Cardiff, Frankfurt, Lyon, Kyiv, Rabat and Liberia.  It is a long list.  We are trying to finalise the next phase of areas where we think enhancing Ireland's footprint makes sense politically, economically and with regard to the diaspora.  We need to think about Western Australia.  I do not want to pre-announce anything.  A recommendation will come to me and we will take it from there.  It might be interesting to come back to the committee and get members' views on those choices.  I would certainly welcome a broadening of perspective.</p><p> Have I answered the Chair's question on Afghanistan?</p></speech>

How realistic is that?  We all hope to get to that point but with the continued expansion of settlement units and the onslaught against human rights, with the designation of the six groupings, how long can we wait until that peace process kicks in, if ever?  Hopefully it does.  All the time, a two-state solution is being completely undermined.  As I see it, there is no serious attempt by Israel to get back around the negotiating table.  Unless definitive actions are taken to force Israel to the table, it will continue to act with impunity.  We talk about Syria and Belarus, and about the swift actions being taken by the EU, not normalising relationships with different regimes, standing up for human rights and so on, but there are no parallel actions by the EU or Irish Government, even though we have said that Israel has breached international law by annexing occupied Palestinian land.  When are we going to say that enough is enough and that we need to take a stand, to work in unison with the EU or to take unilateral action and take measures ourselves?</p> <p>  I want the views of the Minister and Department on another matter.  The Minister is aware of the ongoing hunger strike of seven prisoners who are being illegally detained in administrative detention.  There is classified evidence and there has been no trial or evidence whatsoever.  One of those prisoners, Kayed Al-Fasous, has been on hunger strike for 117 days.  The silence from the international community is deafening.  What are the views of the Minister and the Department?  Will he call for the immediate release of Kayed Al-Fasous from detention, along with his six fellow prisoners who are currently on hunger strike?</p></speech>

He recently had the opportunity to visit again.  He indicated that he met with the new, reshaped Israeli Government and he indicated a certain level of change, which we would all agree about.  I accept the questions that the Deputy asked but they need to be framed in the context of a most challenging situation, in which Ireland has invested considerably and will continue to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021110900002#O00500"><p>I am aware of the Palestinian prisoners currently engaged in a hunger strike, including the concerns raised by the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the health of two detainees.  I also note the statement from the UN special rapporteur on 21 October, calling on Israel to either release or charge the prisoners and to completely end the practice of administrative detention.  Irish officials are monitoring this matter closely in co-operation with partners on the ground.  Ireland has repeatedly called on Israel both directly and through the Human Rights Council to ensure that its treatment of detainees adheres to international humanitarian rights standards and international humanitarian law.  Ireland also provides financial support to NGOs in the region which are active in bringing issues regarding treatment of detainees to light.  We mentioned Addameer earlier.  It works in that space.</p> <p>  The Deputy constantly paints me as someone who is not fully committed on these issues.  Where we differ is about the mechanisms that should be used to bring about change.  I believe in engagement and in relationships.  I believe in blunt diplomacy and building relationships with people who I believe can be instrumental in bringing about change in the future.  I do not believe that, in this instance, boycotts and isolation are the way to bring about change in the Middle East peace process.  The Deputy believes that we should do that.  Many people believe that we should expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.  I do not believe that we should do that.  Severing our ties with Israel will not advance a peace process between Israelis and Palestinians in my view.  I believe that Ireland needs to be as influential as it possibly can be in EU and UN debates and in the bilateral relations that we have with both Israel and Palestine.  That is what I am focusing on because I believe that we can be a player to a certain extent.</p><p>Maybe that is something that will not happen, but the conversations I had last week in Israel, throughout the Palestinian territories and in Jordan suggest to me that people take our views seriously.  We are often described as the most vocal country on the planet, not just in the European Union, on this issue.  We will continue to try to influence outcomes as best we can.  Many people are trying to get their heads around this new Israeli Government.  Clearly, there has been a strategic decision not to engage seriously with a new peace initiative, for now, because of the diversity of opinion within the eight different parties of its coalition Government.  I know that does not solve the problem tomorrow.  I accept that, but I have been pretty vocal in trying to stop the situation getting any worse in terms of settlement expansions, their strategic nature, demolitions, forced evictions, humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and many other issues linked to east Jerusalem, such as holy sites and so on.  </p><p> I will continue to be vocal, but I have got to remain relevant and listened to by people who can bring about change and influence in the region.  If we took the approach that is sometimes suggested I should take, I do not believe we would be in a position to do that.  When the Deputy said that words are only words and we need actions, I am not sure what actions he is suggesting would add to Ireland's influence on the Middle East peace process in the multilateral fora we operate in and need to stay credible in.  It is an honest answer to his question.  I hope to have an opportunity to continue to engage in this space.  We have an opportunity over the next year or so, while we remain on the Security Council, to be part of some new thinking and initiatives in the Middle East peace process.  One of the things we are certainly thinking a lot about is how we can use our position on the Security Council to advance some new thinking in this space.  That is the way to do it, rather than taking unilateral action as a country on our own that isolates Ireland from mainstream thinking in this area.</p></speech>

One is the Minister's responsiveness when I have called on him for assistance outside this forum.  I recall contacting him during the Kabul evacuation and within moments he came back to me.  I know he did everything he could for the individual involved.</p> <p>  The other matter relates to the Security Council.  My concern is more about the frustration the Minister must feel about the big five on it that can veto anything that comes along.  I was encouraged to hear him say the council needs modernisation and to look at itself again.  We are living in a world where democracy is under attack all the time and we should try to democratise the United Nations Security Council far more.  I do not want the Minister to go away feeling that I thought everything about it was negative.  I feel the frustration he must feel, if he is trying to bring something forward.</p></speech>

We would like to see the veto either not used or limited to use in specific areas.  France, in particular, has made efforts to try to limit the use of the veto in certain areas, especially in respect of war crimes, accusations of war crimes and when humanitarian law is being breached, by the use of chemical weapons, for example.  The idea that a veto could be used to prevent an investigation into the use of chemical weapons is abhorrent in many ways.  We support France's efforts and we will work to try to bring about more reform.</p> <p> We also think there should be more permanent members on the Security Council.  Some very large countries that are very influential in global affairs are not part of permanent representation on the Security Council.  We also do not believe Africa has sufficient representation.  We have made our views known in those areas but if, during our time on the Security Council, we were to focus solely on reform of it, we would try but we might not achieve a whole lot.  These are powerful countries.  The Security Council is not a democracy.  There are five permanent members that have powers the other ten do not.</p> <p>  The Security Council is a place of negotiation, relationships and lots of tension.  We are trying to be a broker for agreement in areas where we can see opportunities to make a positive impact.  So far, we have managed to do that in some strategic areas, especially around humanitarian assistance for Syria and shining a spotlight on Ethiopia, going right back to February when Ireland started talking about that issue.  We have managed to do it through a resolution on peacekeeping transitions and we have also managed to do it around disarmament.  We have been a very strong voice in trying to pull people together on Afghanistan.  We are relevant and that is what a small country on the Security Council needs to aspire to be.</p></speech>

Could the Minister of State give some information on the timeline for the appointment of the chief executive through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, with respect to the possibility of an interim CEO?  Is that the Minister of State's intention?</p> <p>  Section 58 limits the consideration of matters that are in the legal process or in court proceedings.  That is completely sensible, but it does seem to have a retrospective application and I wanted to query if that is the case and why.</p> <p>  I might as well ask it now just to expedite things, in section 63(7), again in terms of the employment of consultants, could the Minister of State advise whether the public spending code fully applies to this or if there is a more restrictive level of transparency and accountability with the appointment of consultants?</p></speech>

Obviously the Oireachtas and its committees do not discuss matters that are currently before the courts.  That is not the question.  Does this section exclude the discussion at committee of matters that have previously been before the courts and have been resolved by the courts?  That would seem to me to be a little bit restrictive but perhaps I have misunderstood the section.</p></speech>

I wish to hear a little bit more about the plans for the staffing of the new marine area regulatory authority, MARA, and what the Minister envisages for the staffing of it.  How big of an entity will it be?  There is reference to consultants and approval for them.  I would like to know what is envisaged, as to the type of body it is.  What sort of staff will be full time?  What sort of specialists will there be in particular areas of environmental expertise, marine biology and heritage?  It would be useful to paint a little bit of a picture of what the authority will look like in terms of who is going to work for it.</p></speech>

We know the importance of this new groundbreaking reform in terms of enforcement and adjudicating on the consent process.  It is a new transparent regime.  Across government we have to negotiate the staffing and budget, which will all be part of the budgetary process.  We are very clear about the magnitude and scale of the work MARA will have to do.  I listened to the Taoiseach launch the marine planning framework at the Commissioners of Irish Lights headquarters, where he very clearly committed to ensuring that MARA will have the resources to deal with the complexities of the issues before it, and that the huge scale of expertise that is required would be provided for.  We want the best regime possible that will determine the future processes and consents for the entire maritime area.</p></speech>

This amendment ensures that such agreements can provide for the authority rendering assistance to the other body.</p><p>The intention is that the authority becomes a centre of excellence for maritime usages and in the interests of allowing other bodies to avail of that expertise, rather than having separate units in house, it would be better for the State as a whole if this expertise could be shared in a manner that is underpinned by statute.  In particular, smaller coastal planning authorities, among others, would benefit enormously from these amendments.

That seems sensible given that there are many competing imperatives in the maritime area, whether it is the protection of biodiversity, amenity uses, tourist concerns, offshore energy development, fishing or the many other matters that might be important.</p> <p>  It is positive that we would have agreements.  How would the decision that it is necessary to have such an agreement between different bodies be triggered?  Could the Minister of State respond to the concern, consistent with the concerns that we have raised throughout, that insofar as agreements might be struck between MARA and other Departments or public bodies, whether it is heritage, fishing, tourist and amenity concerns or wildlife concerns, that such agreements be screened in some way?  Will the public be aware of such agreements and do we need to concern ourselves about the degree to which such agreements might run foul of the directives that we have talked a lot about such as the marine spatial planning directive, the habitats directive, the birds directive or the Aarhus Convention?  In most other cases we have argued, whether it is guidelines, statements, plans or consents, one needs public knowledge, public oversight, political oversight and a concern to ensure that all directives are being complied with?  Do we need to spell it out in terms of such agreements because these agreements presumably would be a little like management plans of the maritime area where there are different groups involved with an interest in the same maritime area?</p></speech>

The Opposition has a number of concerns, which have also been part of the wider public debate.  This could be a good opportunity for the Minister of State to respond to some of those concerns on the record.  Our understanding, and as the officials and the Minister of State have explained to us before, is that the maritime area consent is not a grant of permission.  It is a grant to allow somebody to move towards the application for a planning permission at a later stage.  However, there seems to be an inference from that that the granting of a maritime area consent, MAC, is not in of itself an environmental decision, but more a procedural one.</p><p>We have all had conversations with organisations very concerned with protecting the biodiversity of our coastlines.  In short, those representing fishermen.  Some of their activities have already been disrupted by offshore wind companies that are now actively engaging in what would ordinarily be the process at the MAC stage, such as starting exploratory studies, etc.  It is very important for us to fully understand the nature of this process, but also, once someone gets a MAC, what the obligations are.  Can a MAC holder just squat and sit on it for a period?  Are there development milestones - and this is what the amendment specifically speaks to - that would have to be reached in order to demonstrate that a MAC holder is progressing his or her intention to move towards a formal planning application at a later stage?</p><p> There is a related matter, which is that while the assumption of the Department seems to be that the granting of a MAC is not, in and of itself, an environmental decision.  There are environmental impacts from what a MAC holder may do, on the sea bed, for example, if that holder is conducting certain types of studies or engaged in certain types of activities.  Again, how that is measured is very important.</p><p> Likewise, elsewhere in these sections, there is mention of the possibility of restorative provisions whereby certain types of damage may be done by the holder of a MAC in advance of submitting an application for planning permission.  If I read those sections correctly, if conditions are applied to MACs, including the need to restore aspects of the marine environment depending on what has been done to them in the intervening period, does that not suggest that there are environmental impacts?  If so, how do we make sure that they are properly monitored and that where problems may arise - hopefully, none will - appropriate enforcement action will be taken during the MAC stage and before the formal application seeking permission to develop?</p></speech>

If I read this section correctly, these will include things where their "size, nature or limited impact on the maritime area" falls within a class does "not offend against the principles of proper management of the maritime area and sustainable usage of the maritime area".  Where are the principles of proper management and sustainable usage of the maritime area against which this decision about what is or is not subject to a MAC benchmarked?  Where are those principles set out?</p></speech>

Second, if I read this correctly, a MAC will not be required for activities included in Schedule 3.  These activities include, for example, &quot;maritime usage[s] for the purposes, ... [of] consisting, of prospecting for minerals, or the working of minerals, within the meaning of the Minerals Development Acts&quot;.  That could possibly be called mining.  Mining in the sea in the maritime area would not require a MAC, if I read this correctly.  Schedule 3.7 further states:</p> <blockquote> 	Any maritime usage for the purposes, or consisting, of the exploration or working of petroleum (within the meaning of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960), or the restoration of ... [such] area in which ... exploration ... for petroleum has taken place. </blockquote> <p>These are not small usages of the maritime area and Schedule 3 would appear to exclude them from the requirement for a MAC.  The Minister of State might detail the other relevant usages because some of the others in Schedule 3 refer to other Acts that I have had time to cross-reference at this stage.  I ask for a clear spelling-out of what things will not be subject to a MAC and why.  On the face of it, I am deeply unhappy that mining in the maritime area or exploration for petroleum or anything to do with fossil fuels would be somehow not subject to all the processes and consents required in order to ensure those were not damaging to our precious marine environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110900002#D00500"><p>I will come at this issue from a slightly different angle.  The thinking on MAC is that it is not an environmental decision, so it does not need to go through the processes an environmental decision would.  Presumably, a MAC would allow somebody who is looking to develop in the maritime area to carry out surveying work in order to get an application together looking for a licence.  If surveying work is very intensive, it can have environmental impacts, especially in sensitive areas.  As we know now, it is impacting on the livelihoods of people engaged in fishing who have already experienced major disruption due to surveying work being carried out.  It can also impact on whales, dolphins and cetaceans by disrupting them; intensive surveying work can push them out of an area and can have all these environmental impacts.</p> <p>  I am trying to understand how a MAC is deemed not to be an environmental decision when, in effect, it gives the green light to things that can have environmental impacts, albeit more so in areas that are more environmentally sensitive or where there are particular issues or concerns in respect of marine biodiversity or habitats.  Why is a MAC not an environmental decision, and not subject to those safeguards and processes, when it can have environmental impacts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110900002#D00600"><p>I will give a little background information before I speak to the amendment.  The MAC concept is new and it would be helpful from the outset to detail what a MAC is and what it is not.  The MAC fulfils specific functions within the overall consenting sequence.  A MAC is a property right to occupy a part of the maritime area conditional on securing other necessary approvals, it ensures due diligence that the MAC holder can undertake the proposal, manages the relationship between MARA and the holder through the MAC conditions and is the gateway into planning permission.  A MAC is not a lease, it is not permission to undertake works, development or activities provided for under the Planning Act or licensing and it is not an environmental decision-making process.  We have applied a single environmental assessment principle that is provided for under the Planning Act or licensing.  In developing the new regime set out in the Bill we examined in detail the operation of the Foreshore Act and its interactions with the Planning Act.  We have designed a new sequenced consent regime that separates the financial and property issues from the environmental and planning issues.  Prospective developers will have to secure a MAC and then apply for planning permission.  They will need both.</p> <p>  Throughout these sessions, I have worked with Members to incorporate improvements that are feasible.  However, we cannot accept proposals that seek to fundamentally change the nature of the MAC process or recreate the duplication that exists under the current regime.  We are creating a new, streamlined and efficient regime to better manage maritime usages.  The property and planning processes must remain distinct and separate in order for the new regime to operate effectively.  Much of the discussion in the earlier sessions focused on a particular sector of offshore development.  I remind Members that the regime this Bill will establish is designed to be operable for maritime usages of all scales, from small slipways to major port development.</p> <p>  Amendment no. 147 provides for MACs granted under section 73 to be subject to a series of milestones set out by the Minister.  Section 73(2) provides for regulations to exempt certain maritime usages from requiring a MAC.</p><p>From a technical perspective the proposal is located in the wrong place.  Moving onto the substance, it provides for the Minister to determine by regulations case by case issues best handled by the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, in the context of specific applications and grants.</p><p> Standing further back, and looking at the intention of the proposed amendment, I believe it is to ensure that any proposal for which a maritime area consent, MAC, and ultimately planning permission is granted proceeds without undue delay.</p><p> In that regard the initiated text of the Bill already provides robustly for this.  I draw members' attention to Schedule 6.  No. 5 allows for the imposition of a timeframe in which to secure planning permission.  No. 6 allows for the imposition of conditions relating to other statutory milestones such as planning permission.</p><p> The Deputies may wish to withdraw the amendment on foot of this explanation.</p><p> For Deputy Boyd Barrett, amendments Nos. 219 and 294 cover mining within the scope.</p></speech>

How do we ensure that the environmental impact of that work is properly understood, assessed and addressed?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  With respect to Schedule 6, and this speaks specifically to the amendment, obviously conditions can be applied to a MAC.  If conditions are not applied to the MAC in the first instance, for example if there is not a condition to say that an application for permission has to be with the planning authority within a certain period of time, can that subsequently be added by MARA if somebody unduly delays applying for planning permission, or do they have to do this within the conditions of the MAC in the first instance? </p></speech>

I do not understand, and frankly I do not accept, that maritime area consents should not be required for explorations, surveys or whatever it might be.  No justification has been given.  This includes works related to looking for and extracting petroleum for example, which seems to be excluded, or exploration related to mineral extraction.  What are these principles referred to in good management or sustainable management?</p> <p>  This is not an exact analogy but in some ways I see the MAC as a little bit like some of the licensing arrangements that some of the big industrial offshore wind companies already have under the Foreshore Act for particular areas.  It is not for doing development, it is for doing surveys.  The Minister of State is shaking his head but an explanation would be helpful.  There are works involved in advance of an outright consent to development.  Those companies doing this work do not have a consent to development, so they are doing something in advance.  The Minister of State should not really patronise me while I am asking these questions, to be honest. </p></speech>

The fishermen have told me that it is impacting on them.  It is in advance of a full-scale development consent.  According to the fishermen, there is not sufficient assessment of what is the potential impact in the areas that are being surveyed of what they are doing now.  I echo those concerns.  If they are doing these things under a maritime area consent, which is not an exact analogy to a foreshore licence, they are doing things in advance of a full-scale development consent that are impacting on fishermen and others.  Should those works not be fully and properly environmentally assessed?  Should maritime users not know exactly what is going on with regard to these things and how it may potentially impact on them?</p></speech>

They will have their own environmental assessments attached to them.  Obviously, that is separate. As I already explained, a maritime area consent does not permit such activities.</p> <p>  Depending on the scale of the project the timeframe can be set between three and five years.  It will be specified.  I am not sure about operating beyond that.</p></speech>

I have two further questions.  With respect to the licences, would that also apply to the legacy projects where the MAC is essentially provided by the Minister rather than MARA, prior to the establishment of MARA?  Obviously, those are the licences we would be concerned about at the moment.</p> <p>  Will all a MACs stipulate in their conditions the period of time that the planning application has to be applied for?  Could it be a case where a MAC is applied for and there is no specific requirement within the period of the MAC to apply for planning, that MARA may take the view there is an undue delay?  We keep making comparisons with terrestrial planning and our own experience.  It is to work out whether at any stage there is the threat to the marine of the kind of things we see with land hoarding.  That is the motivation of the question.</p></speech>

This is a necessary administrative measure to enable potential users of the maritime area to confirm whether a MAC is required and relates to the usages exempt under Schedules 3 and 4.  This will help remove any uncertainties and ensure appropriate regulation of certain usages.  The MARA will issue such a declaration within 30 days of receipt of full information from the applicant.  Amendment No. 149 provides for MARA to apply an administrative fee to such declarations.  I am sure members will agree that this is a positive addition to the Bill.</p></speech>

This is a follow-up to one of Deputy O'Callaghan's earlier question and it relates to this.  If I understood the Minister of State correctly, the idea is not to have multiple parties all interested in a similar type of marine usage with MACs in the same territorial area.  At the same time, when Deputy O'Callaghan asked whether a MAC gave exclusive rights to seek usage in that area, it was said it was not exclusive.  Does that mean there could be cases where there might be more than one operator within a MAC but there would not be multiple, depending on the purpose?</p></speech>

They ensure further clarity in the legislation about the purpose and function of the MAC, which consents to the occupation and not the usage itself.</p><p>Amendment No. 151 allows for additional information in regard to a MAC application to be provided by means other than just by affidavit by substituting &quot;by affidavit&quot; with &quot;by affidavit or otherwise&quot;.  This is a necessary practical change.</p><p>Amendment No. 152 proposes to make it clear that the range of potential MAC applicants will include such groups as rowing clubs, charities, community organisations etc.  Section 76(4), as initiated, was inadvertently too limiting and would have excluded these groups.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 157, 158 and 160 add &quot;in the opinion of the Minister&quot; to avoid any doubt as to where the interpretation of such matters resides.  This is standard wording from the Statute Book and does not change the substance of the regulation-making powers under this section.</p><p>Amendment No. 161 is a technical amendment to define clearly the intention of the sentence and does not change the substance of the subsection.</p><p>I will now address members' amendments.  Amendment No. 156 proposes to provide a public and prescribed bodies consultation process in the MAC application procedure.  I appreciate and understand the intentions behind the proposal, but I will be opposing this amendment.  After my explanation, I hope members will understand the reasons.</p><p>In planning permission, the first time people normally hear of a proposal is in the set-piece public consultation on a planning permission or foreshore application.  Under this regime, that set-piece consultation will be undertaken on any planning permission application.  However, that will not be the start of the participation process.  A key MAC assessment criterion set out in Schedule 5 is, &ldquo;The extent and nature of stakeholder engagement undertaken by the applicant in respect of the proposed maritime usage.&rdquo;  This provision places an obligation on the developer to engage substantively and seriously with the public, to the satisfaction of MARA, before it has applied for a MAC.  Failure to do so will result in a refusal.</p><p>Likewise, the prospective developer will need to engage substantively with stakeholders such as NGOs and State agencies.  The intention of this provision is to help ensure issues raised at the earliest possible stage inform the very design of a project proposal.  To augment this approach further, amendment No. 281 proposes to include a condition requiring the MAC holder to prepare, maintain and adhere to a public engagement plan for the period from the grant of the MAC to the submission of the planning application.  This will enable continued public participation during the period where the detailed plans of a particular proposal are developed and evolved before a planning application is finalised and submitted.  Put simply, the days of a prospective maritime developer avoiding those whom the development might impact are ending with this legislation.</p><p>The intention of these provisions is to help ensure participation begins early, that issues are raised and can be addressed or incorporated into project design, leading ultimately to better planning applications.  This is an innovative approach that is hoped will shape good developer practices and change radically the nature and effectiveness of public participation.  I believe this is a far better approach than a single set-piece consultation on the MAC that would, by its nature, be limited to MAC assessment criteria.  I trust members understand why I oppose this amendment for these reasons.</p><p>Amendment No. 162 proposes to insert additional text limiting the operation of subsection (7)(b) relating to procedural fairness provisions to one particular ground of refusal: inadequate level of public participation and consultation.  On a purely logical level, it would not be appropriate to include an unfair limitation on a procedural fairness provision.  This amendment also relies upon amendment No. 156 that intends to include a public consultation procedure, which is also opposed.  For those reasons, I also oppose this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110900002#F02700"><p>A cynic might say, not that I am in any way cynical about this legislation, that by placing the responsibility, through the Schedules, on the applicant to design and manage the public participation process, there is an offloading of responsibility onto the applicant.  There are certain merits in that in that they have to resource, manage and oversee it.  It begs the question, however, when either the Minister in legacy cases or MARA in subsequent cases is taking a decision on the granting of the MAC or where the planning authority is taking a decision on the granting of a planning application, against what criteria do they assess if, let us call them the developer in this instance, has adhered to those requirements as set out in the Schedules as outlined by the Minister of State.  How do they judge if that was adequate or not if it is not set out in the same way as other public participation processes?</p><p>That is the first thing.  The second thing is that I welcome the Minister of State's specific namechecking of environmental NGOs and other stakeholders, but is there an expectation that the wider public will be involved?  Here is the reason I say that.  Before a planning application is put in on land, there is an earlier stage in the development process, what we call zoning, although I know it is not strictly comparable with this.  Where a local authority is changing the zoning and matters come up for consideration through the development process, and there is some earlier consideration, it seems to me that while they are not analogous, there is some merit in having a wider public participation or consultation where a MAC is to be granted.  If the Minister of State is saying that is what is outlined here, and there is a clear set of criteria against which a MAC applicant-planning applicant would be adjudged, that might go some way to assuage our concerns, although I am not sure how much it would do.  It is about trying to ensure that a decision as important as the granting of a MAC has some public involvement.</p><p> We all have experience of this.  Oftentimes, when an application has gone in, it is very late for people to impact or change that in terrestrial planning, in particular when one does not have the same level of expertise as an applicant or some professional bodies or environmental NGOs.  The public in particular are often greatly disadvantaged and their ability to impact the planning process is weaker.  Therefore, the earlier that participation is possible, the better.  I am not looking to duplicate anything, but a MAC is a very considerable decision in and of itself, albeit not a grant of development.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response to those questions, and depending on the answers I may well withdraw amendment No. 162.</p></speech>

When there is an initial application to a council, they become aware of it and they may become aware of the zoning before that.  They may well be involved in the public consultation processes at the level of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Having public consultation at different stages is very important in terms of building up awareness of issues.  It allows people in communities to gain a bit of knowledge and expertise and to talk to people and network.  That is why having a strong public consultation process is important, as well as it being very important at the MAC stage, in and of itself.  In terms of conditions around MACs, will there be rehabilitation conditions and when will they be specified?</p></speech>

If one is seeking a MAC in an area where damage has already been done to the marine environment, would there be a condition on the MAC that in order to look for licences or permissions in the area, rehabilitation work must be done?  Is the Minister of State saying that it could not be done as part of the MAC process but at the licensing or permission stage?</p></speech>

The whole intention of this regime is to get public awareness quicker as part of a planned stakeholder engagement process with the developer or the pending application.  That is the premise of the Bill that we will be trying to achieve.</p> <p>  MARA will consider the criteria set out in Schedule 5 and any consultation on MACs will be limited to those criteria.  As referenced by other Deputies and as I mentioned, it is not MARA's role or the function of a MAC to examine or determine some of those issues, which are considered as part of the planning application.  That is vital in terms of getting a robust, stitched-in methodology that would accompany the process and have at its core public participation and also ensuring there is public awareness well before an application is submitted to make sure communities are not blindsided.</p></speech>

This provision serves an important function in protecting the State&rsquo;s long-term interests in the property subject of the MAC.  A new application would enable a new assessment in the context of the performance of the holder under the existing MAC and allow MARA the opportunity to update the terms and conditions of the occupation which may be for durations of many decades.</p><p> Some flexibility is built into the system as the duration of the MAC could be extended by way of an application to materially amend the MAC under section 83.  However, that would have to be considered in the particular circumstances of the case and it would not be appropriate, in this instance, to double the lifespan of a MAC by way of amendment.  I must, therefore, oppose the amendment and I hope that the member may wish to withdraw his amendment following the explanation. </p><p> Amendment No. 165 proposes to include a new provision for MARA to grant a leasehold interest where a MAC is granted for exclusive use.  I must oppose this amendment for two reasons.</p><p> First, leases are property interests that arise from ownership.  The State only owns to the outer limit of the territorial seas, which is the current foreshore area.  Leaseholds cannot be granted beyond that limit.  To do so would result in two different terms of occupation depending on location.  The MAC is intended to be operable over the entire maritime area.</p><p> Second, leases as granted under the Foreshore Act create a specific relationship between the granter and holder with obligations on both sides.  This makes enforcement of terms more challenging as it is viewed by the courts through the prism of a contract dispute.  The obligations of MACs rest exclusively with the holder and are enforceable through the provisions of Part 6 of this Bill.  MARA should not be constrained in the exercise of those powers.  I trust that Deputy McAuliffe understands why I cannot accept this amendment considering the aforementioned.</p><p> Amendment No. 168 seeks to restructure section 82 procedure in respect of assignments so that the terms and conditions are set out by way of regulation.  The assignment provisions under section 82 provide for a joint application by the prospective assignor and assignee to be considered by MARA in the context of normal MAC assessment criteria under Schedule 5.  I acknowledge that this procedure may be somewhat cumbersome for MAC holders.  However, it is an important protection for the State&rsquo;s interests to ensure that any new holder is able to fulfil the obligations of a MAC and is held to the same standard.  MARA must have the full opportunity to undertake proper due diligence and revise the terms and conditions of occupation, if appropriate.  Control of assignments is in the hands of MARA.  Therefore, considering the aforementioned, I must also oppose this amendment.</p></speech>

Therefore, there should be a greater degree of public notification around the granting of such MACs.</p></speech>

It is difficult to see an amendment that might be classified as "trivial, insignificant, minor or inconsequential".

There is a big grey area in the middle.  Again, I give the example of the fishermen in my area.  They said as par of the survey for the proposed Dublin Array wind farm on their fishing grounds on the Kish and Codling Banks, the goalposts moved during their engagements with the companies as to the area from that they might be excluded from for the period of surveying.  That was not trivial to them.  No doubt, the company might have seen it as trivial, but the fishermen did not.  This is a matter of concern when there is such a grey area.  We are told that the Minister will specify these categories of amendments.  Our concern is on the precautionary side.  There is potential for a lot of slippage there and for big arguments about what is trivial and what is substantial.</p></speech>

The licensing regime is regulated separately.  The environmental assessment and thresholds that it has to go through are separate.  That is to do work through a licence.

On review, it was determined that the procedures in initiated text might be open to attempted abuse by the more unscrupulous MAC holders to sneak through material changes.  This new procedure provides MARA with a more direct control and oversight over the process and ensures that an amended MAC is issued and notification of the change is published.  This amendment strengthens the authority's control over the process.</p></speech>

A planning authority or the board may be minded to adjust the proposed development as part of its determination for a variety of reasons.  Rather than holding up the planning process, the consent would be amended, if required, post-planning permission grant.  This ensures that any MAC does not constrain the planning authority or the board in its decision-making, while allowing for any such changes to be reflected in the property consent.  Provisions in Part 8 allow for engagement between MARA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la prior to finalisation of the planning decision.</p></speech>

The section relates to whether a person is deemed fit and proper.  Often when development consent is sought on land it is from a corporate entity.  There may be directors.  Some of those directors may behave in an inappropriate way.  They then come off the board of directors.  They are replaced by family members or other associates.  The corporate entity no longer continues to have the person who may be deemed unfit and improper.  How do we protect against this?  The reason I am raising this is because as far back as 1977 the Law Reform Commission highlighted this as an area of particular concern with terrestrial planning.  It spoke about how certain persons deemed unfit and improper are able to hide behind a veil of corporate legal structures.  Is this something that has been given adequate thought with respect to this?  Does it solely centre around individuals as actual persons rather than corporate entities that may have relationships with people who have come off boards?  Does the Minister of State see the point I am raising?  This has been particularly problematic, for example, with defective buildings and poor building practices.  It is quite relevant to this section of the scheme.</p></speech>

These will be published, and the published framework at the time of the MAC decision will be applied to any application in question.  This will replace the administratively unwieldy expensive and time-consuming individual property valuations required for foreshore leasing processes, as the Deputy is aware.  It will also provide certainty to applicants and key process improvement in the current regime.  It will not be a one-size-fits-all approach.  The levy framework will be determined in accordance with section 88(3).  Our approach moves away from property value as the sole determinant as under the Foreshore Act to a far broader range of considerations, including the area involved, public benefits that might arise from the usage, the level of profit that might accrue from the usage, and the legal nature of potential holders, for example, those of more limited financial means that can be accommodated.  It is the explicit responsibility of MARA's board to develop the framework.  It can be assisted in this task by the CEO and committees of the board.  Given the wide range of interests and factors, it is envisaged that the development process will be inclusive and participatory in the same manner as will have been approached in other aspects of the new regime.</p></speech>

It is relevant to section 2(3) of the Bill, with regard to the interpretation of the Act, which states on page 20:</p> <blockquote> 	A reference in this Act to a MAC includes&mdash;  	(a) the maritime usage the subject of the MAC,<br /><br />(b) the conditions attached, or deemed to be attached, to the MAC by virtue of section 79, and<br /><br />(c) the rehabilitation schedule within the meaning of Chapter 8 of Part 4.   </blockquote> <p>This relates to the question I asked earlier about when conditions on rehabilitation relating to a MAC would be specified.  In response, the Minister of State said that conditions with regard to rehabilitation specified as part of a MAC will not be specified.  Perhaps I did not quite phrase it right.  As per page 20, there could be a rehabilitation schedule as part of a MAC.</p></speech>

This concerns the restoration of any aspect of the area within the MAC that one assumes has been damaged, disturbed or affected in some negative way.  One of the problems here is how will we know if this is the case.  If we think about this, if a MAC is granted, then conditions are applied to it regarding the restoration which may be required at a later stage, especially in respect of whatever works might have been carried out in the context of the licences secured.  If we have no baseline assessment, however, how will we know what will need to be restored and what level to restore it to?  How is that going to be determined and which agency will make that determination?  Will it be MARA or other agencies?</p><p><b>Deputy Peter Burke:</b>I understand that the MAC holder will have to put the area back to the way it was.  The obligations are set out in section 92.  </p></speech>

Again, let us make a comparison with terrestrial planning processes.  If someone undertakes an unauthorised development on land, then, generally, a planning officer can go to see it and will know what has to be restored.  Again, this is a clumsy comparison.  In this case, are we saying that the sole responsibility for knowing the baseline condition falls on the holder of the MAC?  How will we ensure that the holder will restore or rehabilitate an area to its original state?  Is there an enforcement mechanism which allows for that?</p></speech>

I hope to clear things up rather than to confuse them more.  My understanding is that part of the conditions of a MAC will be that whatever conditions applied under the development consent granted must be carried out by the developer.  </p></speech>

These provisions are specific to the relevant projects as set out in the legislation.  They relate only to either existing foreshore lease applications for offshore renewable energy, ORE, or had secured agreement for a grid connection.  These provisions are transitioning those projects from the old foreshore system into the new regime where each proposal will be subject to a MAC application process and, if approved, may then proceed to prepare and submit a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for consideration.</p> <p>  These provisions are intended to manage that transition alone and are not intended to apply to any other category of applicant.  To accept this amendment would be to fundamentally change the intention of the provisions and, potentially, to open up all potential development to these transitional provisions.  </p> <p>I must therefore, unfortunately, oppose these amendments.  The Deputy might consider withdrawing them on foot of this explanation.  </p> <p>  Turning Government amendment No. 180, this amendment removes unnecessary and redundant language from section 97(1) relating to relevant maritime usages and MACs before establishment day.  Amendment No. 181 is a technical amendment to section 97 so that it also references section 70, which deals with powers to specify forms of document.  </p> <p>  I must flag to the committee that it may be necessary to further amend sections 96 and-or 97 on Report Stage.</p><p>Work is continuing on possible minor technical changes necessary to ensure efficient operation of these sections, and I will endeavour to provide as much detail as possible to the committee in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

Again, I invite him to put on the public record additional information that may be of value to the public on how that process will be decided.  I know we have discussed it previously out of committee, but it is so people understand how the awarding of MACs, particularly in respect of transitional projects, will be decided.  Clearly, no public participation or consultation is part of that decision.  The Minister of State might speak to the committee on why that is the case.  Is there still some measure for some public participation in the granting of those MACs?</p></speech>

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications will be enabled to invite applications from the relevant projects in a structured manner.  The Minister will consider the applications in the context of the standard MAC provisions and assessment criteria.  If a MAC is granted, then relevant projects can proceed to preparing and submitting a planning permission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Once established, MARA will assume responsibility for any MACs granted by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Work is under way in that Department to develop the MAC consenting regime and guidance for those relevant projects.  It is intended that a public consultation will be held on a full suite of MAC assessment processes post the enactment of this legislation.  Work is also under way on the establishment of a levy framework for offshore renewable energy, ORE.</p></speech>

I will state that for the record.  If we had had designated marine protected areas, and I know the Minister of State said it is a different process that will come later, some of the areas applicants will be allowed occupy under MACs are ones they for which would not have been able to apply for a MAC because they would not have been able to occupy them because they would have been marine protected.

It is not properly stipulated in the Bill.  As it currently stand, the courts could be beset with uncertainty on MARA, the MAC holder and the applicant.  The amendment removes the entitlement to stay proceedings with the intention of ensuring the authorities specify the points in time in the decision-making process, when applications should be made and to ensure there is clarity so that applicants to the court do not risk being premature or too late if they wish to start a judicial review.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 185 is to extend the window for judicial reviews from eight weeks to 12 weeks.  That is because of the amount of complexity, potentially, in this process and to give a sufficient amount of time.  As everyone will be aware, when communities and other stakeholders are grappling with these matters, it can be very difficult for them to get the advice they need when going into the complexities of things.  That is the reasoning for this amendment.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 186 is, in effect, to give <i>locus standi </i>for environmental NGOs if they wish to challenge decisions around the MAC process.</p></speech>

This provision is required in circumstances where MARA may not have concluded a process and a judicial challenge is taken.  In essence, the provision is to allow MARA to finish its process.<br/><br/><b></b>Amendment No.185 seeks to extend from eight weeks to 12 weeks the period where persons can apply for leave to judicially challenge a decision.  Eight weeks is the standard period for non-environmental decisions.  These provisions are for the MAC which is not an environmental decision.  Section 103(6) provides for judicial discretion to extend that period<br/><br/><b></b>Amendment No. 186 seeks to apply the environmental decision-making standards for leave to apply for judicial review to a non-environmental decision-making process.  ENGOs are not debarred from judicial challenges but will have to make a case to the courts for standing in a particular case, as would be the case for a non-environmental decision.<br/><br/>For the aforementioned reasons, I oppose amendments Nos. 184 to 186, inclusive. </p></speech>

Regardless of whether this provision is in the legislation that is a matter for the courts to decide.  If these amendments are not accepted, this legislation gives weight to the idea that a judicial review should not be taken until MARA is satisfied that all of its processes are concluded.  In that sense, I remain concerned.  It is still for the courts to decide, but it could be interpreted as somewhat infringing on the process or the independence of the courts to have to decide on that.  This legislation is the Oireachtas giving a signal in that direction.  I am concerned about that.</p> <p>  Let us take an area that is particularly sensitive in terms of the marine environment and biodiversity.  It could be legitimate for somebody to want to take a case while there is a process ongoing around that.  If that process has been initiated by a developer it could raise a whole range of issues about a marine sensitive area.  Why would that not be appropriate?  Obviously, the courts could decide it would be appropriate.  Why are we seeking to somewhat curtail that through this part of the legislation or, at least, signal against that happening?  </p></speech>

A prohibitory order prohibits the removal or disturbance of beach material from or in an area of seashore, other than in accordance with a licence granted under the Foreshore Act 1933.  A prohibitory notice is similar to a prohibitory order except that it only applies to a named individual and is only served on a person where a prohibitory order is not in force.  The provision to grant a licence where a prohibitory order or a prohibitory notice is in place already exists in foreshore legislation and this amendment will ensure that similar provision can be made under the new MAP regime.</p><p>I wish to be clear that this change does not result in a reduction in the protections for areas covered by existing prohibitory orders.  Licences may already be granted under the Foreshore Act for the removal of beach material on the foreshore in these locations and the prohibitory orders simply provide protection for non-licensed activities.  They create an offence where none existed prior to their introduction.</p><p>It simply maintains the existing provisions for the granting of licences in these areas and allows these licences to be granted under this section of the Bill rather than just the Foreshore Act, which will ultimately be repealed.  Overall, prohibitory orders will no longer be required in the maritime area because, as a default, a licence is required for all the things set out in Schedule 7 and this includes the removal of beach material.  Currently, this is only restricted in areas subject to a prohibitory order or notice.  In essence, where it is currently only an offence to remove or disturb beach material in an area covered by a prohibitory order, it will now be an offence to do this in the entire maritime area.</p><p>The licensing regime has built in the relevant environmental screening and protection measures.  It also includes policy protection in the form of the national marine planning framework which, as we have discussed, will ultimately comprise all MSPs and DMAPs.  This amendment is purely technical to address a direct reference to the licences granted under the Foreshore Act in the sections relating to these orders.</p></speech>

We have suggested that we should not be granting licences for certain types of industrial development, particularly industrial offshore wind but also other major industrial-style development, within what used to be called the foreshore area.</p> <p>  Across much of Europe, these things are only allowed considerably farther out.  A paper by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy pointed out that the general distance in Germany is 53 km from shore.  In Belgium, I believe the distance is approximately 37 km.  There have been moves in France recently to ensure that the distance for a major offshore wind development is farther out.  As far as I understand, Wales has regulations relating to distance and height, with the height of something determining how close it can be to the shore.  The average distances are generally considerably farther out than some of the relevant projects which in some cases are as close as 6 km from shore.  That is the thought behind amendment No. 190.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 191 seeks to ensure that heritage is not negatively impacted by licences of that sort.</p></speech>

The Deputies may not fully understand the purposes of the licensing provisions in the Bill.  The purpose of the licensing provisions is to provide a regulatory regime for maritime usages that are of relatively low-scale or of a temporary duration.  The creation of this regime would mean that the planning system is not overburdened by the authorisation of the activities set out in Schedule 7.  The Deputies are apparently proposing that no dredging can take place to keep ports clear, and that scientific research be prohibited.  The amendment would see local seaweed harvesting banned on the coastline, the placement of navigation markers prohibited or boat moorings being inaccessible to most recreational boaters, something, I am sure, Deputy Boyd Barrett would not be happy with.</p> <p>  The amendment would make Part 5 mostly redundant, as most maritime usages to be licensed under this Part will be within 22 km of the coastline.  Perhaps the Deputies are attempting to ensure that no marine surveys can take place within 22 km to support specific planning applications, but there is a very significant consequence to the amendment proposed on all other maritime users, including local coastal communities, harbour and transport infrastructure and, indeed, the scientific research community.</p> <p>  When granting a maritime usage licence, the MARA is bound to consider all the things set out in the relevant provisions of the Bill, including the national planning framework and any appropriate assessment findings.  Licensing will take place in a well-managed and holistic system which, as previously discussed, balances the needs of all maritime users and the environment.  I am sure that the Deputies will appreciate why I must oppose the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 191 provides that a licence cannot be granted without a heritage survey.  While I find this proposition somewhat vague, as I think I understand the intention, let me clarify a number of points in respect of the granting of licences.</p><p>Under section 116(3), MARA cannot grant a licence unless the licence is consistent with the national marine planning framework, NMPF.  Part 7.3 of the framework, on heritage assets, requires that proposals consider the potential impact of their application on heritage sites from the earliest stages of project development, and states that expert advice will be required at all stages.  Moreover, MARA can specify what information must accompany a licence application before a decision to license a maritime usage can be made.  Section 113(3) pertains in this regard.  This could include a particular assessment or report relating to heritage if and when such a survey is warranted, having regard to both the characteristics of the local receiving environment and the nature and scale of the usage proposed.  MARA can simply determine that all licence applications in any area will require some form of support in respect of the assessment of heritage impacts.  Therefore, this amendment is not required and has a greater impact than is warranted regarding what it is trying to achieve.  It requires a "heritage survey" to be carried out for all licence applications, with no measure of professional judgment allowed to be applied or no proportionality regarding what is being proposed.  For example, do all applications for temporary moorings in all areas require such a survey?  Alternatively, is it only in areas where there is likely to be an impact on natural or cultural heritage?</p><p> It should be noted that the spatial data tool, as previously referred to, will be used to record the location of heritage sites and will be informed by existing and ongoing surveys.  This is the tool that MARA and the public can use to establish whether there is potential for any heritage impacts of any proposal. </p><p> On a technical point, "heritage survey" has not been adequately defined here, and, as such, this provision would be extremely difficult to enforce.  What would this survey entail?  What are the qualifications of those who are to carry it out?  What heritage assets should it examine, and in what areas?  Are the areas to be cultural, historical, social or ecological?  What is the extent of the survey area required for any particular licence application?  Moreover, the amendment simply requires that the survey be carried out.  It is silent on what should occur in the event of any significant impacts being identified.  In any event, it would simply not be appropriate for all types of licensable maritime usages to require any such report in support of an application in all areas &ndash; that is why we normally prescribe these things in regulation or in policy.  On the basis of my response, I hope the members understand why I have to oppose both amendments.</p></speech>

With regard to the central argument and thought behind it, I do not in any way concede, but the amendment, as currently drafted, is casting its net a bit too wide, to use a maritime metaphor.  As long we do not keep using the same metaphors over and over again, it is all right.  The amendment would prohibit practices that are entirely legitimate and uncontroversial within the foreshore area.  With regard to minor activities being licensed, there is not a problem.  I would be genuinely interested in hearing the Minister of State's thinking on this matter but we reserve the right to, and very likely will, table amendments seeking to have a requirement on the minimum distance from the shore of large-scale, industrial-style developments.  I am simply pointing out, in defence of this position, that the average distance from the shore of these kinds of developments in Europe is forever increasing.  We are contemplating a process to grant consents for developments that are much closer to the shore than is generally allowed elsewhere in Europe.  The Minister of State should say why we should do that.  There are reasons for what I describe.  People are trying to get a win&ndash;win because we need to develop offshore wind capacity but we can do that while at the same time protecting coastal amenities and the sensitive marine ecosystems and biology that often exist in what used to be called the foreshore area.</p></speech>

In the initiated text, paragraph 12 of Schedule 7 relied on the definition of "beach material" as set out in the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended.  This definition includes a reference to seaweed.  There is, therefore, an overlap between paragraphs 10 and 12, as drafted, and the potential double licensing requirement.  In order to more appropriately regulate and manage this activity in and around the coastline, I am proposing to separate seaweed from beach material in order that existing rights to harvest can be specifically addressed by regulation, and in order that a specific policy framework can be developed over time that will specifically apply to licences under this category of maritime usage.  As can be seen, it provides a more comprehensive description of the activity than previously set out.  This amendment, combined with the revision in paragraph 12, will provide for an appropriate delineation between these categories of maritime usage.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 283 is a technical amendment to address a number of deficiencies in paragraph 12, as set out in the initiated text.  The initiated text relies on the definition that is set out in the Foreshore Act 1933, which, in itself, is less than satisfactory because, over time, the relevant section may be repealed.  This definition repeats most of the text of the existing definition but also includes additional substances, such as maerl, which can be inert when calcified, not adequately covered by the term "coral".  This is an important substance that can be taken without resource at present and should now be properly regulated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-09a.661" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>The new wording removes reference to "seaweed" from the Foreshore Act definition as it is already provided for in Schedule 7 and there was a potential conflict or double licensing requirement arising.  This amendment and amendment No. 282 are simple clarifications of existing categories of maritime usages.</p><p>Amendment No. 284 is required to create a new licensable activity category that addresses Ireland's international obligations in respect of certain cables.  It inserts a new paragraph into Schedule 7 and makes it a licensable activity to lay or install telecommunications cables or ducting by or between coastal states where such cables or ducting pass through the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf but do not land in the State.  Such cables and ducting will have already been screened or assessed for environmental impacts in the current country of origin.  Where this has occurred, there will be further secondary legislation providing for the appropriate exemptions from the requirement to obtain a licence in those specific circumstances.  Where this has not occurred, no exemption will be available.  These exemptions will only be applicable where specific notification procedures have taken place.  My officials will be working with the relevant Department and the Office of the Attorney General to formulate suitable wording to accommodate same in regulations.  This is a technical provision that arises from existing international agreements and is necessary to ensure compliance with same, as advised by the Office of the Attorney General.  As this is explicit advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I must encourage Deputies to support the amendment.</p></speech>

That is essentially what we are talking about.  To use the language of the section, this relates to usages that "would not offend against the objectives listed in Article 5 of the MSP Directive" or are trivial.  I am concerned about that.  It is back to the issue of what is trivial and how the issue of whether these activities significantly impact on the environment is assessed.

The effect of this amendment is that the applicant can provide MARA with additional information by affidavit or otherwise, thus widening the type of information MARA can seek to support an application and potentially reducing the burden on some applicants.  For example, in some cases applicants may not have to go through the process of securing an affidavit where it would be disproportionate to the nature of the information MARA is seeking. </p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 196 is to only require MARA to carry out a screening for environmental impact assessment where it considers it necessary to so do after having regard to Schedules 5 and 7 to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  The current drafting requires a screening in every instance and provides no objective criteria upon which such a determination will be made.  This amendment brings a level of consistency with the planning Acts and clarity in respect of the decision-making in respect of those matters and provides more certainty.  Given that it is under the planning Acts that proposals that require an EIA will ultimately be assessed, it makes sense to use the same criteria to assess whether a proposed usage is eligible to apply for a licence or not.  This does not dilute the existing provision as set out in the initiated text but, rather, points to specific criteria by which the screening decision will be made and, indeed, if one is necessary.  EIA screening will not be required for activities not listed in the relevant annexes of the EIA directive and MARA needs the flexibility to reduce its administrative burden in this respect, but all while having very objective criteria within which it can be done.  I note that planning authorities and the board already use these criteria to determine if EIA screenings are required.</p><p>To be clear, if MARA does not screen a relevant activity and it should have done so, the decision will be deficient and challengeable.  If MARA screens out an activity for EIA that should have been screened in, having regard to the provisions of the planning regulations, then the decision to accept the application in the first place can be said to be <i>ultra vires</i>and could be challenged.  This amendment sets the parameters for these things, bringing more certainty to the process for MARA, applicants and the general public.  I am sure the Deputies will agree the rationale for this approach is sound.</p><p>Amendment No. 198 is a technical drafting amendment to insert "to do so" after "practicable" and improve the syntax.  The intention and effect is the same.</p><p> Amendment No. 204 requires MARA, when given notification of the refusal of a licence, to publish on its website a copy of the notice provided for under section 114(3), giving reasons for its decision.  It explicitly addresses a perceived lacuna in the initiated Bill relating to the publishing of licences that were refused and ensures consistency across all types of decisions MARA can make.</p><p> Amendment No. 205 is a technical drafting amendment to insert the number of the subsection referred to, missing from the Bill as initiated, and refers to the preceding subsection (5).  </p><p> Amendment No. 207 is a technical drafting amendment, to replace &ldquo;or by affidavit&rdquo; with &ldquo;by affidavit or otherwise&rdquo;.  The effect of this amendment is that the applicant can provide MARA with additional information by affidavit or something else in respect of an application to surrender a licence.  It widens the scope of what can be submitted in order to surrender a licence and aligns it with other drafting in this Part. </p></speech>

This will enable provision to be made for the avoidance of conflict between licensable usages in the maritime area.  It is important to note that this power is discretionary and does not confer exclusive rights automatically.  It is entirely up to MARA to apply this provision in specific circumstances, for example, where an applicant requires the sole use of a part of the maritime area temporarily for reasons of public safety.  As stated previously, this has the same effect as Deputy Matthews&rsquo;s amendment and it would be my preference to use the wording that has been through the relevant experts.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 201 requires MARA to have regard to the national marine planning framework before it decides to grant a licence.  This amendment is related to the proposed deletion of lines 4 to 5 on page 100 in amendment No. 202.  The current provision is difficult to administer and the proposed wording provides MARA with the required professional latitude in its decision-making.  The wording is directly comparable to that used in the Planning and Development Act in respect of local authorities&rsquo; obligations to have regard to their development plans when making decisions on planning applications.  For instance, this provision allows MARA to apply the heritage requirements set out in section 7 of the national marine planning framework to specific applications in specific areas, as discussed earlier, but would give it the latitude not to apply these requirements where they were not required, for example, for minor licence applications where there were no heritage assets that could be impacted.</p> <p>  This is a standard form of wording to allow MARA to be proportional when applying the provisions of the national marine planning framework.  It is not designed to reduce the requirement for large-scale operators not to comply with that framework and, where there is an explicit obligation in the framework relating to a particular licensable usage, MARA could not simply ignore it. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 202 is related and it removes the requirement for MARA to not grant a licence unless the licence is consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This wording is inconsistent with other similar provisions in the Planning and Development Act and does not provide MARA with the requisite professional latitude to interpret the policy provisions of the framework as they relate to licensable activities.  Not all of the provisions of the framework will apply to all of the usages set out in Schedule 7 in a consistent manner.  Amendment No. 201 inserts a more appropriate wording that requires MARA to have regard to the framework before it decides to grant a licence.</p></speech>

If it decides that it does not or - if I have the jargon right - it screens something out which should have been in, that is challengeable.  How?  It is through the courts only through judicial review.  There is no method for stakeholders, NGOs or members of the public to challenge a decision as to whether an EIA should have been required for the licensing of a particular activity other than recourse to a judicial review, which is an expensive, difficult and onerous process.  With the exception of the rather discredited strategic housing developments, that is different from how we do things on land, where there is an initial process and a right to appeal.  The only avenue once the MARA makes the decision that, for example, an environmental impact assessment is not necessary for somebody wishing to challenge that is to apply for a judicial review.  That seems-----</p></speech>
