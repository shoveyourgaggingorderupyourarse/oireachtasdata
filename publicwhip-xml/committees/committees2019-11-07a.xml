He is joined by Ms Geraldine Mooney, deputy director of audit.  </p> <p>  We have received no apologies for this meeting.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 24 October - we had no meeting last week - together with the follow-up questions sent to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  The first items, Nos. 2513 and 2525, are correspondence received from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, including briefing documentation and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and/or Ministers in follow-up on matters raised at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publication.  At our last meeting we agreed to hold over some items for consideration this week.  Items Nos. 2432 and 2465 are correspondence, dated 4 October 2019, received from from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, enclosing a copy of the post-project review mentioned and referred to in our previous periodic report on the Palace Cinema project in Galway.  I will make a number of brief observations.  </p> <p>  Recommendation No. 7 on page 3, with which I am sure members will agree - I will highlight some of the recommendations made in what I stress is a 35 page document - is that performance indicators should be established for all grants funded by the cultural division and that data should be collected and collated in a systemic manner.  This is a great recommendation, but in my view it does not grasp the point from the Committee of Public Accounts' point of view.  This is a project within a Department that went seriously over budget.  The Department's view is that within it there should be performance indicators within the cultural division.  That is unacceptable from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Where mistakes like this have been made within a section in a Department, the lessons must be learned, not only within that section but also within the Department and across the public service.  We will be writing to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as a result of this report to say it must put a system in place to ensure that in a case where lessons are learned, the results will not be pigeonholed in one cubbyhole in one section in one Department.  That is a method that ensures there will be no learning across the public service from mistakes that happen in particular areas.  The confining of the recommendation is not acceptable from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  </p> <p>  The Department also states there is to be a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform spending code update.  We will ask for a copy of it if it has been completed.  The reference is included at the bottom of page 3.  </p> <p>  Page 4 of the report essentially refers to the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with this issue in its periodic report and recommendations and that a post-project review was carried out as a result.  We are pleased that that has happened.  However, the Department has confined its learning from the mistakes to a very narrow section within it.  </p> <p>  On page 6 of the report - this is a theme that arises here every week - the Department states two independent reports were commissioned to examine the demand for cultural cinema in Ireland: the Neil Connolly and Maretta Dillon report in 2001 and the report produced by the English consultants Todd in 2004.  We are great at spending money in employing consultants.  There is no problem with employing a consultant, but when one has to come along a short time later and employ another to examine a closely related issue, that is where we consider no proper value for money is being achieved.  We had representatives of a State organisation here only a few weeks ago that essentially had four consultants looking at the same thing over a two-year period.  Our concern is the overuse of consultants.  Some may think we do not need them, but everybody can agree that our concern is their overuse.  </p> <p>  Table 5 on page 9 of the report deals with the original allocation of &euro;4.3 million for the project which ended up costing &euro;8.3 million.  The table shows where funding was received from various bodies.  When site costs are included, the project was originally projected to cost  &euro;6.26 million, but it ended up costing &euro;10.3 million.   Thast is a serious overrun.  </p> <p>  We have picked up on this project because the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted it for us initially.  Paragraph 6.5 on page 15 of the report refers to the fifth departmental review carried out in 2018 of the various cost increases over a period of time.  It took five reviews to get to the end.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined some of the issues at which the Department had looked.  My conclusion is that after so many reviews and consultants, the response of the Department has been to confine any learning to one narrow section within it.  That is a point I have already made.  There is to be no learning across the public sector on the issue.</p> <p>  Perhaps Deputy Connolly might like to add something.  We will publish this information today, if we have not already done so.</p></speech>

I was a councillor at the time and perhaps I am zoning in on the minutiae.  It would be worth everyone's while to read the report.  Who carries out the post-project review?  Is it done within the Department?</p></speech>

The committee did make a recommendation, however.  The Comptroller and Auditor General compiled a chapter on it.</p></speech>

Perhaps the focus of the chapter, along with the attention of the committee and its report, would have precipitated it.</p></speech>

[That is of concern to me, regardless of whether the Department complied with it ]  The final assessment of this review considers that the main problem with the project was the fact that the original project promoters, while very well-intentioned and passionate about cinema, were not sufficiently skilled to manage a project as complex as P&aacute;l&aacute;s.  Solas had no demonstrable experience of operating a cinema or managing a large construction project ... [and there was a] lack of relevant experience.</blockquote> <p>Passion is great.  I am always giving out about a lack of passion and a lack of vision, so that is marvellous.  I want to take the focus off the people who came forward with passion and vision but who did not have the experience.  I will go to the Department, which saw that passion and vision, but did not match it with oversight.  In the sentence I have just quoted, I am being told the Department complied with what was in place at the time.  I have made notes on it.  I am almost about to give up.  On the one hand, the Department is saying it has learned something from it while , on the other, it is stating that it complied with what was in place at the time.</p><p>Another concern relates to the funding.  It has been suggested that the operator of the cinema was the second biggest contributor after the Department.  In fact, Galway City Council was the second biggest contributor because it donated the site, which was worth almost &euro;2 million, and it gave &euro;500,000 on top of that.  This is not even recognised in this review, which is a matter of great concern.</p><p>We knew generally at the time that there were problems with this project.  This is what is important.  How can projects go ahead if people, including lots of councillors, had concerns?  They were demonised and ostracised and told they were not wearing the Galway jersey.  This was the type of conversation that happened in respect of this project.  We were the ones who endorsed the project in the beginning.  We did so with vision.  As the problems emerged, we called for accountability.  Those who dared to ask questions were told they were not donning the jersey.  This is a problem that must be learnt by all public representatives.</p><p>Consider, also, the bespoke nature of the project.  Perhaps somebody could explain what that means. On page 22 of the review, it is stated:</p><blockquote>The bespoke design of the building, while architecturally significant and award-winning, does present Element Pictures with a number of challenges as operators.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema was designed by De Paor architects and has been described as a contemporary moulded-concrete &quot;tower house&quot;. [And the description of it is included] ... the facade may be somewhat intimidating to people and, as such, presents a barrier to entry.  Element Pictures [who have been left with this baby on their hands now] are working to make the interior as warm and inviting as possible and encourage the public to explore and experience the building.  The highly bespoke nature of the building added to the overall cost of the project and over the long-run means that upkeep and refurbishment of the building will be a costly undertaking, as there are a number of functionality issues that make the building less than optimal for its intended purpose.</blockquote> <p>The Department, which might as well be working for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, goes on to give all the advantages to the cinema - which we knew and that is why we have been promoting it - and tells us how important it is for the area of Galway and the cultural quarter.  It tells us that there are four houses at the site and that these will be artisan dwellings.  The Department does not mention, however, that these houses have been empty since the council purchased them in 2005 or 2006.  In a housing crisis, these four houses are empty, but that is not mentioned at all.</p><p>Five reviews were carried out.  Fair play to the Department - it was good and carried out the five reviews.  The reviews, however, were limited and each time they concluded that they had no choice but to go ahead and not have a hole in the ground.  They also tell a story that is not quite accurate with regard to the first contractor.  The review provided a list of reasons as to why there was a problem, one of which was the recession.  Earlier in the report, it cited the design problems, delays and other issues that led the builder to walk from the building.  It was not the recession.  I welcome the report, and it is a starting point, but we or the Comptroller and Auditor General need to go through it.</p><p>The promotion of Galway is unnecessary in this context.  It is not part of a project review.  Did we succeed?  Yes, we did.  The idea was to build, and we did build, but it was built over a period of 11 years at a cost of &euro;11 million, with a housing crisis in Galway and a failure to purchase a building across the road that was better value at &euro;450,000.  All along the way there were implications for the decision to continue.  Element Pictures are the operators now.  I wish the company the best and have always done so.  I have been in the building.  None of this is about personal views, it is about how we got to the stage where a project that was to cost much less ended up costing &euro;11 million.  It is about how there was no project manager.  Solas was offered a project manager by the Irish Film Board and refused to accept.  I am just mentioning some of the issues.  There is a list of notes, but I will not delay the meeting any longer.</p><p>This project raises so many questions and generally it raises very serious questions about the use of public funds in this manner.  There have been five reviews into the project that allowed more money to be paid out.  Within this there is also the city council that gave a site worth &euro;2 million and gave another &euro;500,000 even while there was a serious problem in Galway around lack of funds for serious issues.  I have gone out on a limb for the arts and I have read the arts reports for the committee.  This is not about arts versus something else, it is about making very sensible and practical decisions, with proper oversight from a Department.  That did not happen in this instance.</p></speech>

It is a case of circle the wagons, nobody is to blame, nobody pays the price and Galway has a piece of infrastructure.  We are all proud of Galway's culture, heritage and the part it plays.  With every respect to Deputy Connolly, however, Galway does pretty well out of public funds when it comes to the arts.  As I said at the meeting when we first raised this, it is an abomination.  If it was the private sector, there would be disciplinary action and lay-offs, and whoever was responsible would have difficulty in getting into any kind of job in the future.  Yet here we have a report that says not only did it cost &euro;11 million, but we built this &euro;11 million building for a private sector project.</p><p>The building is so beautiful that people are frightened to go into it.  We will not be able to heat it.  It will cost a substantial amount of money to maintain it.  The building is to be operated for the profit of a different outfit at a preferential rent.  That is a disgrace.  It is endemic of what goes on in this room.  Whenever the State is involved, we put the car into the hedge but nobody pays the price.  We put it down to experience and state that we will know better next time.  Without tangible sanction for the endemic mediocrity of the apparatus of the State, this is going to happen again.  It is probably happening as we speak.  Without doubt, the same unit will use its training in the dark arts of circling the wagons and making a bunch of muck look like a bowl of ice cream.</p><p> This committee has to make a recommendation.  There must be tangible sanction when total incompetence is endemic to the extent that we have spent &euro;11 million for a private sector company to make profit and we have offered a preferential rent.  I have nothing against Galway and its great cultural prowess.  If we want to spend this &euro;11 million in Galway it would be better spent on light rail or public transport.  Galway has a traffic problem that is proportionately 100 times worse than that of Dublin, not to mention housing, health and other challenges.  It is a disgrace.  We cannot say it strongly enough.  This is a good example on a relatively small scale of what we happens on a massive scale with projects like the national children's hospital - we throw good money after bad.  The Taoiseach recently stated that the cost of the latter is heading towards &euro;2 billion.  The Deputy beside me has said it will cost more than that.  God knows who will be in this room to pick up the pieces when it is finished, or how many billions it will eventually cost.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema must be seen as a classic example of the incompetence of the apparatus of the State and its inability to admit when it is wrong.  There must be tangible sanctions to deter such poor management practices in the future.  That tangible sanction is what is missing from the work of the State.</p></speech>

To find the origin of the problem we have to go back to the original decision rather than the reviews.  It was the same building before this started as it was when the reviews were carried out.  Over and over again we see a failure to anticipate or understand resource requirements.  It is all very well to carry out a review afterwards.  That is fine.  The origin of many of these problems lies in the decision to take the project on and in the initial scoping.  It would be useful to know if that unit of the Department has a function in identifying how those failures can be prevented in the first instance.  I keep on saying that we have made a national pastime of creating problems and then trying to resolve them in reverse.  In a lot of other countries projects are scoped out, the resource implications are considered, things are planned and governments do not end up with a very costly problem at the tail end.</p></speech>

We will obviously write to the Secretary General of the Department about the implementation of the recommendations listed on page 3.  Recommendations have been made and we want to see what is happening.  That is a minor point.  We should write to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this issue and send this report to him.  There are two issues that have been highlighted here.  Deputy Connolly has noted that the value of the local authority's contribution is not dealt with in this report.  We should insist that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-----</p></speech>

We want to ensure that projects take a whole-of-Government approach if funding comes from various sources and not just the line Department.  We also want the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have a policy on reports.  A public spending update is to be published, or perhaps it has already been published.  One recommendation is that training should be mandatory.  While training is currently provided, it is not mandatory.  Some of the people working on projects do not bother to undergo training on the public spending code.  That is insufficient.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should insist that every project review, evaluation or value-for-money report carried out in a Department must include a section on the whole-of Government lessons from what went wrong in the unit in question.  Such reports must be considered inadequate without this section.  The public service is designed to confine a mistake it to the one unit in which it takes place.  We have seen this in the HSE.  When something goes wrong in a hospital, there is not even a mechanism in place to share the lessons learned with other hospitals.  We are seeing here that when something goes wrong in the cultural division, the issue is confined to that unit of that Department.  That is guaranteed to ensure that there is no whole-of-Government learning.  We will ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that spending codes include a requirement for every report to have a section outlining the overall lessons for the public service.  Unless there is a practice of sharing of lessons learned, the current system is bound to make the same mistakes in some other Department.</p></speech>

The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht did carry out reviews, which were very welcome.  Those reviews highlighted problems.  Those involved did try to do this.  There is a bigger issue here.  This took place in a political atmosphere in which the project had to go ahead.  We need to look at that element, as in the case of the national children's hospital.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could comment on project reviews.  I do not know what should go into a project review, but this seems to consist of F&aacute;ilte Ireland telling us how good Galway is.  The report notes that the city council "owns four properties immediately adjacent to P&aacute;l&aacute;s and intends to develop these".  This is a post-project review and nobody seems to have had the wit to ask why the four properties are empty.  When that type of review is carried out and not one question is asked about this, one begins to question our whole way of doing things.  That might be a bit unfair, but we decided to have a review.  The project review says how wonderful the project is for Galway and that particular quarter, as opposed to asking how this happened.</p></speech>

The letter responds to our request for information on fees paid to barristers.  We agreed to note and publish this two weeks ago.  This concerns fees paid in respect of the Apple case.

I came in literally two minutes after the Chairman finished with this item.  I was caught in traffic.</p> <p>  This has been going on for a long time.  I have been asking questions about this since before last summer.  To provide a little bit of context, this information was previously given out in response to parliamentary questions.  When I looked for a subsequent update on the continuing costs, it was denied to me under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.</p><p>I also asked questions regarding the two-payments system when it comes to public servants, that is, one can only get one payment if, for instance, one works for a university, is a member of a board or anything like that.  I understand that a number of people who are being paid under this actually do work in other public sector roles as well.  I was absolutely shocked that this information was denied to me.  I was further shocked that the Attorney General's advice was that this information cannot be given.  I had help from the Ceann Comhairle in this regard, as he felt that questions should be answered.  However, when it came to the advice from the Attorney General, that is where it stopped because, as we all know, such advice can never be published.  </p><p> I brought this matter to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts because I felt that it was necessary to use this forum to get some leverage as regards how we are going to get this information.  Frankly, the volume of money that is being paid is a scandal but nobody knows where the money is being spent, who it has been given to, for what and in what detail.  Furthermore, this matter creates a worrying precedent in cases where people are being paid, if they are constituted as individuals.  This precedent that has been set by the Government means that if one constitutes oneself as an individual for payment purposes-----</p></speech>

Consequently, were Sean Fleming a sole trader who was giving advice or doing anything for the State, we will never know how much he is being paid because the GDPR will prevent us from knowing, which is insane.  This is not the reason GDPR exists.</p><p>I must thank three journalists, namely, Danny McConnell, political editor, Fiachra &Oacute; Cionnaith and Elaine Loughlin, who work for the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, for pursuing this matter.  Subsequently, they got the Data Protection Commissioner effectively to state she does not understand why the advice has been issued or in what context and that it is not justifiable.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>ran a story on this issue earlier this week.</p><p>We must pursue this matter in the strongest way possible.  These are serious public sums and this will go on for years.  A dangerous precedent is being set whereby others will be able to use this loophole, potentially, to not have the amount of the payments made or costs awarded to them for various different items of work being made known.  In addition, from a Data Protection Commission point of view, it looks like this situation is not appropriate.  I am in the hands of the committee but we really need to pursue this matter because frankly, such a situation cannot go on.  It is against the public interest, it is against what GDPR is being used for and we will not know what people are being paid in this case.  Furthermore, I suspect the Department uses the non-two-payments rule for public servants to the letter of the law in many cases but yet, when it comes to situations in which people working in public bodies constitute themselves as individuals for other payments, the two-payments system does not apply to them and we will not be able to tease that out.  It is a four legs good, two legs bad scenario and that cannot be allow to happen.  I thank the Chair and shall take his advice. </p></speech>

At best, we are seeing the politically opportunistic use of legislation that was not intended for that purpose.  At worst, and as with actions we saw in the D&aacute;il during the week, through the use of articles of the Constitution on money messages, it defines life in a dictatorship disguised as a democracy.  I do not know what actions are open to us as a committee, but the system is all-powerful.  The Office of the Attorney General is effectively the commander-in-chief in respect of all matters of definition.  The intended integrity of elected representatives and the institutions within the Oireachtas itself - committees, the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and everything else - are being undermined hand over fist as a result of legal advices, be they from the Attorney General's office or, sometimes, the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, which sees the system as its client rather than the messengers of the people, those being, the elected representatives who try to raise these issues and ensure that information is made available to the public regarding the amounts of money paid to individuals, companies or whatever on their behalf or who exercise the will of the people through the tools available to us.</p><p>The money message issue, which is not the business of this committee this week <i>per se</i>, and the issue before us, which can only be described at best as the politically opportunistic use of GDPR, are deplorable and need to stop immediately.</p></speech>

It is as simple as that.  In the letter from Mr. Derek Moran, he referred to it being necessary and proportionate.  Regarding the test of what is proportionate, if someone is saying that a person getting &euro;1 million from the State &ndash; some barristers at tribunals got &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million over time &ndash; is not proportionate in the public interest and that it would be disproportionate to the individual who received a cheque of &euro;3 million to have his or her name published, that is an abuse.  I know what is happening.  The legal profession is happy to spend the next five years in the Supreme Court and wherever else it goes to ensure that this does not come out.  It just wants to run down the clock, during which time it will continue seeking not to publish the figures.</p> <p>  In the first instance, we will get a response from the DPC.  Arising from that, the Committee of Public Accounts, of all the committees in the Oireachtas, has an absolute duty to verify to whom taxpayers&rsquo; money is being paid and for what purpose.  Our committee will have a role.  If we are ultimately satisfied that the legislation is not sufficiently drafted to ensure public accountability for public funds, that issue will have to be revisited.  We will have a little bit of a road to travel first, but the intention of GDPR is not to protect barristers.  It is an abuse of the system by the legal profession, full stop.  It is the most powerful lobby and would not have been as quick were this about doctors&rsquo; fees or payments to other individuals.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  We will write to the DPC and travel a road in respect of this matter.</p> <p>  When I first started asking these questions, my motivation related to the two-payment situation.  I know of many good people who have served on boards and worked in other public service jobs who adhered to the non-second payment principle.  That is fine &ndash; they contribute, which is good, as we know that it can be difficult to get people to join certain boards.  However, we now see a situation where information that was being made public is no longer being made public.  I believe that is because the fees are so vast.  As a result, GDPR is being used.  In response to information being sought on the two payments, they have used GDPR as an excuse and have created a dangerous situation, one that will have to be unlocked.</p></speech>

There has been an escalation in costs at a significant scale in the space of a few months.  Within five months, there has been movement from &euro;314 million to &euro;397 million.  In any other case, there would be a national outcry over such a scale of increase but the public is conditioned to this now.<br/><br/>We now have a contract for construction <i>et al</i>and we also have, in a very convenient way for the Government, a separate process that cannot be costed on an ongoing basis and will only be revealed in years to come when the project is finished.

We must remember when we spoke about this previously we were told the costs that were outlined, which had been signed off by the Government - and the Taoiseach put the figure in the public domain - were outside of issues such as fit-out and IT.</p> <p>  A significant number of months ago I stated the project cost would exceed &euro;2 billion.  In the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach did not reference me by name but said that people who were saying this were exaggerating.  I now ask him to guarantee it will not exceed &euro;2 billion.  Given what is written here, the scale of the increase within a few months and the fact we now have a totally separate stream that will be uncosted, when the NPDHB is before us in a couple of weeks, we absolutely have to go through this in a level of detail that has not been seen before on behalf of the taxpayer because it is out of control.  We do not know where it will end.</p></speech>

Effectively, it amounts to a blank cheque.  The Taoiseach had signalled this earlier.  It seems, if we are to believe it, that we are about to write another blank cheque for broadband provision.  This is a significant concern.  We are continuing down an endless road in respect of the costs of this project.  They got it wrong from the beginning.  They handed out the contract to the man before the house was designed at all and God knows where it will end because there is not a person in the Oireachtas who will be able to say how much it will cost until it is finished, and I would say it will be significantly more, as Deputy Kelly said.</p></speech>

Wage inflation may well be a reason for an even further overrun.  This is not Monopoly money and we must have serious concerns about cost control.  There is an opportunity cost in what is not going to be able to be done.  There is a degree of spin about this that no other project will be impacted.  We have to keep a close eye on this because there is a pattern where some contractors come in low and there is an add-on. This contractor has that type of profile.  The NPDHB will come before us in the coming weeks but we need to have somebody come in and speak to us about the cost control side of the project at this stage because unless we maintain a grip on it and interrogate the additional bills coming in, we will run into even bigger cost overruns.</p></speech>

To go back to the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema, we had the exact same issue.  The project started at a certain price and there were cost overruns.  All of this was set out in the report.  Costs arose in parallel with it, which the architect for the Department subsequently said were justified.</p> <p>  I forget which witnesses who came before us were asked whether the cost would stay below &euro;2 billion.  They were not in a position to say it would not.  They were very upfront and told us they could not state that.</p> <p>  Our role is just to keep an eye on it, to check and to ask questions.  The bigger picture, and excuse the bad pun with regard to the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema, is that once it is decided that a project will going ahead, it will go ahead regardless.  In Galway, we were told we could not have a hole in the ground and it had to go ahead.  In Dublin, we have been told we need the children's hospital without any analysis of the consequences of continuing with the decision or looking at an alternative or the implications for the health of children in other hospitals.  Sometimes it is very difficult to see the wood for the trees.</p></speech>

It is from Ms Eilish Hardiman, chief executive of Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and is dated 17 October 2019.  It is in response to our request for information relating to each consultancy project undertaken by CHI since 2016.  This is also in connection with making sure that while the building is built that it will work on behalf of patients.  CHI will come before the committee.  It is interesting that Ms Hardiman has said there is a lot of work involved in gathering the information on the consultancy projects.  We will have the information at the end of next week.  We will note and publish this.  CHI will come before the committee shortly.  There is another stream of major costs with regard to the hospital that will pile up into a major amount.  These are non-construction costs.  This is why we need an overall picture of where things stand when it comes before the committee in a couple of weeks.</p> <p>  No. 2485 B is from Ms Carol Hanney, chief executive of City of Dublin Education and Training Board, providing an information note on the processes and procedures in SUSI for grant application cases involving difficult family situations.  We are all aware of cases where families have fallen out, a son or daughter might not be in good communication with the parents and an application for a SUSI grant is held up.  We have asked what SUSI does about these hardship cases and this letter makes for difficult reading.  It states the applicant can provide information to confirm parental divorce or separation by providing the separation or divorce agreement, a court order or a barring order.  We are talking about GDPR and SUSI is requesting college students to provide details of a barring order issued in the family court, which is a private matter, to a Government body to achieve a grant.  Talk about abuse not just of GDPR but the family court procedures.  For SUSI as a State body to ask for detailed information about third parties, as the student is the applicant, with regard to a barring order between two other individuals is outrageous in the extreme.  We are asking it to reconsider this.</p> <p>  SUSI states the student can provide details of the dissolution of a civil partnership, whether a parent is in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance or a one-parent family payment.  Sometimes people go their way without a legal agreement for separation or divorce.  In this case, a student can get a letter from a solicitor confirming that legal proceedings are pending or from the family mediation service, and separate utility bills to show they are living apart.  No wonder people experience difficulty when they are being asked for proof of barring orders.  It does not address the reality of students in houses where there is no communication between all of the original family members.  It makes it worse to speak about getting copies of family law court barring orders as evidence.</p></speech>

It is the public body that processes the applications on behalf of SUSI.  This rule probably comes from the Department of Education and Skills.  We need to write to the Accounting Officer of the Department for his comments in light of what has been said here and try to find a better way of assisting people who should be entitled to a grant.  We have often dealt with students who were just not able to go to an institution because they could not provide information of the kind in question.  On exceptional basis, maybe an interview or something could be done, behind closed doors or whatever.  There has to be a way to give students the grants.  There is a part designed to ensure they cannot meet the conditions.</p></speech>

We sought a breakdown of details on complaints, the role at EU level and the amount of time spent investigating public bodies.  We also sought the legal costs awarded against the Data Protection Commission.  The names of the cases are given.  I do not believe that the letter we were given gave the names of the people who were paid the fees, however.  We also sought information on outstanding reports being completed under the 2018 legislation.  I suppose that when the legislation changed, the infrastructure for producing these reports was different.  We will note and publish the information.</p></speech>

If they are not able to do the job, there will be failings, and we will see those failings here.  This is typical.  We will be interrogating and asking why certain things were not done.

All these replies will feed into our next report.  We may be here in the new year to deal with that.</p> <p>  No. 2487 B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the Health Service Executive, providing information requested by the committee.  There is quite a bit here.  The HSE witnesses will be here in a couple of weeks so we will be able to interrogate them further on these matters, but we will note and publish the correspondence for today.  An information note has been provided on risk analysis in respect of decision-making for public private partnerships, PPPs, for health centres.  Regarding the chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for this year, the witnesses will be coming in to deal with this in a couple of weeks.  I will confirm what else is in the letter, sighing in the process.  There is a reference to cash advances to section 38 organisations.  Deputy Kelly mentioned this matter.  On the top of page 3, there is a reference to the total payments to the section 38 and 39 organisations in 2018, amounting to &euro;3.258 million for section 38 organisations and &euro;1.025 million for section 39 organisations.  We asked for details on cash advances.  The letter is internally self-contradictory because it states all cash balances are to be neutral at the end of the year and then it states there was &euro;73.6 million outstanding at the end of 2018.  The essence of what is being said is that one gets an advance during the year that is to be paid back by the end of the year.  They give us the year-end outstanding balance saying it will come off next year.  Therefore, it is not neutral in the year, although that is the impression the HSE has been giving us up to now.  We will tease this out further.</p> <p>  There is further information on the cross-border initiative and its cost.  There is a note on the arrangements for holiday cover in respect of home help.  I will raise this myself again.  It is a new departure to cancel cover for people.  Cover is provided when home helps go on holidays on a priority basis.  That was not the case in the past.  We will be coming back to this with the HSE in a couple of weeks.</p></speech>

The responses are unreal.  With regard to Nos. 1 and 2, pertaining to planning and design, the first line states the planning risk transfer was reduced as the HSE had received planning permission.  There was limited risk as opposed to significant risk.  With regard to No. 2, design, the State had already done the design so, again, there was limited risk, not significant risk.  No. 4 concerns operational risks or events that could lead to the facility being unavailable, including failure to have the rooms in the facility heated to the correct temperature, leaks, vandalism, or failure to have the facility adequately cleaned.  None of these is deemed a significant risk.  Is the HSE saying a project is classified as a PPP project because of the risk that a radiator might not be working or that a tap might be dripping?  Even in regard to the building being cleaned, do all public buildings not have cleaners to clean them?  It is pure nonsense.  On legislation, the correspondents more or less state in response to No. 7 that they should obey the law.  It is totally unsatisfactory and pretty much a nonsense that this is their justification for PPP classification.  Could we get a very detailed breakdown, in advance of the witnesses coming in, on who the contractors were, the operation costs, the companies, the duration of the contracts, the building costs, etc.?</p></speech>

We will ask now to have it supplied to us in the briefing material in advance so we can examine it before the witnesses come in and discuss it in detail with them on a PPP project by PPP project basis.  Some projects are in bundles.  One contractor might be doing three or four in some cases.  They are in the middle of a tendering process for more, I understand.</p></speech>

Second, with regard to the section 38 and section 39 organisations, which I have been raising for over a year, this is complete and utter garbage.  It is actually riddling the books.  A number of these organisations are on the edge and cannot sustain themselves.  Basically, what happens is the HSE gives them so-called loans or cash advances to function.  This used to happen after the summer but it is now happening in the first or second quarter of the year.  Are they insulting our intelligence?  They are trying to insult our intelligence by saying that this will be cash neutral.  It is not going to be cash neutral.  These organisations have huge deficits.  They are basically doing the work of the State but they have been starved of resources.  In many cases, their services are weakening and in some cases, they are going to close down.  There is an avalanche of these issues coming.  In advance of our meeting and in order to help this committee in its deliberations and questioning, I want those figures broken down further.  I would also like a breakdown of how much has been given in cash advances over the past two years, in tabular form, to each organisation and when the advances were given.  In another column, I would like to see the total spend per year for each organisation in 2017, 2018 and the following year.  This is just rolling on and getting worse every year.  We need that information in advance.  We do not want to be asking for it at the meeting and having the witnesses tell us that they will come back to us with the information.  Let us ask for it in advance and then we will be able to go through it cumulatively and individually for these organisations.</p></speech>

We have talked about this particular issue previously and I agree with what has been said.  These organisations are losing clinical staff because they cannot pay the same rates as the HSE.  In many cases, the services being provided should be public services but often the charities are more flexible and are being paid less by the State for comparable work.  There is a real issue there.  I ask that before the representatives come in, they provide us with some context for the table on page 7 on home support services in the various CHOs.  Expenditure in the year to date is one thing but we need to know what the waiting lists are like.  Just giving us those figures is not enough.  It looks like one area is doing better than another but the size of the catchment area for the CHOs provides a context, as does the length of the waiting lists.  There may be a much longer waiting time in an area that seems to be under-provided for than in an area that appears to have a lot of money.  I do not think the table on its own is sufficient.  I would like to see that additional information before we meet them.</p></speech>

Patients are approved but the HSE does not have the money.  We need to know how many have been approved and put on waiting lists in each of the regions.  There are many such people out there.</p></speech>

We need that figure, broken down by CHO region too.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 2502, is from Mr. Ronan Murphy, the chief executive of Horse Sport Ireland, HSI, dated 23 October, providing a detailed response to a request for a timeline for the implementation of the recommendations of the Indecon report, Review of Certain Matters relating to Horse Sport Ireland.  HSI states that the recommendations were implemented between August 2017 and 2018.  We will note and publish this.  There is a lot of data there so I suggest that we note it for now and if any member wants to take it up in further detail, he or she is free to do so.  </p> <p>  The next items of correspondence, Nos. 2503 and 2526, are letters from Mr. Jim Meade, the chief executive of Irish Rail, dated 23 October and 6 November, respectively.  The correspondence relates to the public services card and in particular, to a case that was referred to at our meeting on 26 September.  Included in the correspondence is some detail on how suspected fraud is dealt with by the organisation.  The letter is claiming that what was said at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting was untrue and inaccurate.  Based on the information given at this meeting, everybody here acted in a totally reasonable manner and assumed certain things.  There is criticism of me in the letter but I was giving Irish Rail the benefit of the doubt that when it issued a bill, notice or charge to somebody it did so on the basis of knowing how many trips were taken.  I was giving the organisation the benefit of the doubt rather than suggesting that it was issuing bills willy nilly, without knowing how many trips were taken.  In the letter received, Irish Rail says it is untrue to say that it had details of the trips taken by an individual, which is surprising.  The follow up correspondence, No. 2526, states that Irish Rail issues a fixed penalty notice in circumstances where a free travel pass is cancelled but a person continues to use it.  This has highlighted the fact that there is no proper exchange of information between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the CIE Group in order to make sure that free travel cards do not continue to be used when they are no longer valid.  It takes months for this information to be provided to Irish Rail and Mr. Meade refers to the fact that people can be using withdrawn cards for years.  There is something very seriously wrong in the co-ordination between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the CIE Group on this matter.  Understandably, this has been a learning process for everybody.  The letter explains that a fixed penalty notice is based on the period in which the card was being used.  If it is, for example, four months since the card was cancelled, Irish Rail sends out a notice for four months although the individual may not have ever used the card.  Irish Rail says that there is a separate situation whereby a passenger who fails to deliver up a valid ticket on a specific day when requested to do so by an authorised officer will be issued with a fixed penalty notice.  This is separate from a debt, which is a civil matter.  The correspondence to which I originally referred related to an actual debt.  On the debt issued, we do not have the exact details of how that was calculated and Irish Rail has not offered those details.  We asked for details on the fixed penalty notices that were issued in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the amounts paid and the payments outstanding.  In summary, the situation for last year was that 12,000 notices were issued and 6,000 were paid.  The value of the fixed penalty notices issued was &euro;1.7 million and the amount paid was &euro;0.7 million.  Less than half of the fixed penalty notices are paid but more to the point, we want details on the bills that Irish Rail issues, that is, what it calls debts.  It issues bills for what it terms "a debt due" and we want the same type of information on those bills, namely the number issued for each of the three aforementioned years, as well as the amounts paid and the amounts outstanding.  It will be helpful to us when we get that information.  We will also ask the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection later today about the exchange of information.  We were told at a previous meeting that the travel companies know the details of all the trips taken using the card but do not know the name of the person.  The number on the card is anonymised but the Department can relate the number back to the public services card and it knows how often it was used.  The CIE Group of companies and Irish Rail are saying that they do not have details of the person's individual travel.</p><p>The outcome of all of this is troubling.  Whether it is a fixed payment notice or a debt, Irish Rail is issuing bills to people that are not connected with the number of trips those people should not have taken and for which they did not pay.  Those bills were issued on a time basis or some other method.  We will come back to this issue.  We will get some information from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and then we will conclude our work on this matter as soon as we have that further clarification.  I will continue to pursue this because I raised this issue and I was referred to in that letter.  We will get further clarification.  We will note and publish the information.</p><p> No. 2504 B is from Mr. John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation, Valuation Office, dated 23 October 2019, providing the further information we requested regarding appeals, adjustments to valuations in 2017 and 2019 and the rateability of car parks in supermarkets and shopping centres.  These issues have been mentioned and there is interesting reading in this document.  Mr. O'Sullivan makes a distinction between his role as the Commissioner of Valuation and his entirely separate role as Accounting Officer.  I can understand how people interested in filling stations along the motorways have an interest in this area.  A letter was written to Mr. O'Sullivan on this matter and he is stating that there is misunderstanding of his separate roles of Accounting Officer and Commissioner of Valuation.  Is that a valid separation of duties?</p></speech>

People deal with Mr. O'Sullivan and I can understand how people in that situation, dealing with Mr. O'Sullivan as the head of the Valuation Office, can think they are dealing with Mr. O'Sullivan in his separate legal role of Accounting Officer for the Valuation Office.  Mr. O'Sullivan is stating that people should not confuse writing a letter to him as the Commissioner of Valuation as opposed to writing to him in his separate legal role of being the Accounting Officer for the Valuation Office.  That is lovely stuff.</p></speech>

There is an interesting note on the valuation of car parks in the context of shopping centres where the main supermarket or property company may own the whole thing and there may be an anchor tenant and other tenants. Individual rates may not be paid but there would be a reflection in the rents.  The bottom line for the people who operate the car park is that it is rateable.  That is interesting for people involved in that trade and we will follow up on that outstanding item of information.</p> <p>  No. 2505 B is from Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, dated 25 October 2019.  It provides information requested by the committee at our meeting on 3 October 2019, including a breakdown of the 2,800 decisions made by the board, encompassing the number of decisions made by the full board and those made by a partial board.  Mr. Walsh states that 88% of all meetings comprised the full board.  That is my understanding of the answer given to our first question.  The second question concerned categories of decisions where the chairman felt that it was an appropriate matter to bring to the full board.  Mr. Walsh refers to that as category one.</p> <p>  It is also noted that we asked two questions that are more appropriate to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, namely, the number of times in which the Minister has invoked section 181 powers to grant permission and the issue of gender balance on the board.  Those are matters on which the Department will have to reply to us.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh gives further information on the current status of the 101 recommendations of the 2016 report.  That information is here.  Our fifth query concerned a breakdown of the categories of respondents to the consultation regarding An Bord Plean&aacute;la's website.  That response can be read and includes details on the type of people who access the website.</p> <p>  A note on gender balance is also included and the Minister will be asked to answer that query.  Copies of the resum&eacute;s of all of the board members are attached, as is a breakdown of the number of decisions of the board accepting an inspector's recommendation.  People will be interested in this topic.  Mr. Walsh has stated that in 89% of cases the report of the inspector is accepted but not in the other 11%.  An acceptance rate of about 90% is fairly high and it would be inevitable that the board would be entitled to make its own decision on some cases.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh's letter next addresses the issue of strategic infrastructure decisions.  Some 84% of all such applications are granted, with 16% refused.  That is interesting because there is a presumption abroad that under the strategic infrastructure process, if there is a meeting with the board, the details of an application are gone through and that application is then submitted on the basis that confirmation would almost be certain.  That is not quite the case, as some 16% of applications are refused at the end of the process.</p> <p>  Our next query dealt with the number of cases that have been with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for more than a year.  There are 74 of those and details are given in the correspondence.  Some of those instances are referral cases and some involve complex legalities.  All of the information is given in the correspondence.</p> <p>  We also inquired about the number of oral hearings upheld by the board.  Mr. Walsh informs us that oral hearings were held in nine planning cases in 2018 and the planning authority upheld decisions in eight cases.</p> <p>  Our 12th question regarded cases where the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la contravened a county development plan.  The correspondence states that An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not gather such information.  It makes its decision and is aware of the county development plan, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not gather statistics on cases where such decisions are made.  We know An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes such information into account, but it is not legally bound to follow the county development plan.  That is because things are often put into a development plan for good local reasons that would not stand up to the scrutiny of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  That is good information, it is good to get it and I thank An Bord Plean&aacute;la for supplying all of the information requested.  We will note and publish that information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110700002#K01400"><p>That final question is important.  The county development plan interrogates a wider scenario than an individual development.  It is a wider framework and not just about the development of an individual site.  It takes into account whether there are water and public transport services and similar aspects.  I refer to a breach of the county development plan.  New wording has gone into county development plans on foot of court cases where it has been directed that there should be compliance with it, as opposed to having regard to it, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a different standard.  That is really significant in respect of problems that will arise in the future.  It is not for this committee to deal with, but I will not be in silent consensus with the idea that information is not gathered.  That is a really worrying issue.  There will be a cost if the services available are not measured and then they have to be retrofitted.  There may well also be services provided in another location.</p></speech>

The information referred to is not being gathered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, so we might write back and ask it to put a procedure in place from now on to see that is done.  It is important for the local and regional authorities and the Department to know this information.  It would appear that somebody should be collecting this information, so we will pass this information on to the other sectoral committee when we get it.  The reason I am commenting is that I have seen county development plans that have stated there should be no mobile phone masts within 200 m of a house.  That stipulation was put in in the full knowledge that it was only for local consumption.  Sometimes things get into local development plans that everybody knows will not stack up, but sometimes the right decisions are made in these types of situations.</p></speech>

What is startling is the fact that the chairman of the board said there is more than one case of that.  We know of one case, which has not been answered.  I ask specifically about that.  We might write to the board to ask it what it will do to ensure the integrity of the process and that such corruption of it, which can have a massive impact on certain locations, can never happen.</p></speech>

We will thank the board for the letter and follow up those particular points.</p> <p>  No. 2506, is from Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, dated 25 October, providing information regarding the policing by the authority of the foreign registered vehicles working in this State.  Two and a half pages of a letter have been provided giving details of inspections.  For those who have an interest in this matter, the best thing we can do is note it today and publish it.  They may come back to us but we are not experts on the inspections of vehicles, whether they are registered in Ireland or outside the State.  A legitimate point was raised with us regarding the regime of inspections.  There is a reply there, which we will note and send to the organisation that contacted us on the matter and perhaps we will have further communication from it at a later stage.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2507 is from John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, relating to our request for the business case for the public services card.  He makes it very clear in his letter there is no single business case document relating to the development of the SAFE identity authentication process for the card.  He sets out that the Comptroller and Auditor General covered this in his report three years ago, and it is analysed time by time.  The Secretary General will be before us later when we will discuss the public services card.  We will note and publish that correspondence and discuss it later.  </p> <p>  No. 2508 is from Steven Sheridan of the Housing Agency responding to a request for a list of approved housing bodies, AHBs, registered with the interim regulator.  He clarifies the regulator's office operates on a voluntary code and AHBs are signed up to it rather than registered.  There are 275 bodies signed up to the code.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for maintaining the register of all AHBs, of which there are now 551, but we know that 95% of the assets are in the bodies signed up to the code.  The information is set out in a link to the website.</p> <p>  No. 2512 is from John McKeon, Secretary General, of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, who will be here shortly, regarding grants paid to travel operators in respect of free travel.  That arose from discussion on the matter.  We will discuss the public services card and free travel with him.  We will note and publish that correspondence and it can be discussed later.</p> <p>  Some category C correspondence has been held over for a little while.  No. 2464 is from an individual, dated 14 October, on behalf of a group based in Donegal called the Great Arch action committee, which is requesting the committee to investigate a planning decision by Donegal County Council regarding a proposed pathway to a viewing point for the Pollet Great Arch, Fanad.  Local authorities are not within the remit of the committee.  We must write back stating that it is not within our remit to examine that matter and directing the group accordingly.  It has obviously talked to the local authority, the ombudsman or whoever it believes is the appropriate body but it is not this committee.</p> <p>  No. 2479 is from persons calling themselves B and C, dated 17 October.  Members will recall the individuals had previously corresponded with the committee regarding the University of Limerick, UL.  The committee was copied with correspondence that was sent to the Minister for Education and Skills.  We have had other correspondence relating to UL in recent weeks.  While there has been an effort to conduct a mediation in the college it seems it has not reached a successful conclusion.  I propose we add these matters relating to third level colleges, including UL, to our work programme.  The UL issue seems to be ongoing.  We will not get to complete that issue between now and Christmas but we can have it on our work programme for the new year.</p> <p>  No. 2488 is from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, relating to an inquiry into Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross.  At our meeting on 19 September, we noted an update from the HSE that the case is currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who is addressing some further queries with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there was no further information at that time.  The HSE is scheduled for a meeting with us on 5 December and we will request an update on this for that meeting.  Members will note the matter is with the Garda and the DPP.  This committee will not have a role in it but we will get an update on it from the HSE as our meeting with it in a few weeks time.</p> <p>  No. 2490 is from an individual, dated 20 October, who raises some points about the Government's spending policies.  The individual raises issues that have been before this committee on several occasions previously.  He refers to the cost of providing broadband and the cost of the children's hospital.  We will note it and circulate it to members of the committee.  It is not for publication but members can take it into consideration.  We will not be specifically following it up but it relates to spending of Government money on matters already covered by the committee.</p> <p>  No. 2491 is from Deputy Cullinane, dated 21 October, regarding media allegations that RT&Eacute; is facilitating tax avoidance.  Perhaps the Deputy would like to speak on this topic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110700002#L01400"><p>This relates to an arrangement, which I have raised previously, regarding top presenters who can set up companies for the purpose of paying a portion of salary as corporation tax and not as income tax.  The issue was examined in other areas of the public sector in the past where there was a mix of public and private.  It is timely it has come up today given the announcement by the director general of RT&Eacute; that there will a 15% pay cut for these top presenters, which most people will welcome.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the first port of call for the director general.  We have examined this issue in the past and established that more than 50% of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s funding comes from the taxpayer.</p><p>Given that significant pay cuts, voluntary redundancies and the closure of services in Limerick and elsewhere are to take place at RT&Eacute;, it might be an issue that we would want to examine because when the Accounting Officer appears, they cannot answer questions on those issues.  They can only answer for the money that is transferred from the Department to RT&Eacute;.  I appreciate we have a heavy workload and that the sectoral committee will examine this but it might be something we could also consider.  This correspondence relates to an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>that put a focus on these types of schemes, which are not available to the vast majority of workers.  I was seeking that we write to RT&Eacute; to ask what is the practice.  Let us establish the facts because we do not want to be unfair to anybody but let us find out how it works and how many staff members are involved in this practice.  I imagine it is people at the very top.  I doubt very much it is anybody earning less than &euro;40,000 a year.  I want to get a sense of how widespread the practice is.  I imagine it involves a small number of staff, most likely the highest paid.  We should establish how it works and why RT&Eacute; engages in it.  If we could get a note on it from the organisation, we could take it from there, if that is acceptable.</p></speech>

They were not happy with the process or with the contracts they were subsequently offered.  Some of them were found to have been on the wrong contracts.  They were self-employed but should have been on proper contracts.  They are being offered proper contracts but at less than what they were on.  There is dissatisfaction with that.  It is a vindication of the issue raised in that it was a practice used by RT&Eacute; to save money and to avoid its responsibilities as an employer in terms of holiday pay and sick pay.  This practice should not be used by any organisation funded by the taxpayer.</p></speech>

She is not an Accounting Officer.  I made the point that there is a debate about funding public broadcasting.  RT&Eacute; is very clear that it needs more money and a reform of the licence fee.  I accept that is primarily a matter for the sectoral committee but there is an issue regarding accountability.  I do not believe we can stand over more money going to an organisation where the director general is not accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I see that as one of the principles that needs to change.  There is a mix of public and private investment to come but it was established-----</p></speech>

In the good times it had much more advertising revenue and when the advertising revenue dropped, the proportion of licence fee was more than 50%.  The point is well made.  We will come back to that.</p> <p>  No. 2494 is correspondence from Deputy Catherine Murphy, dated 29 October, in respect of matters raised with the Department of Justice and Equality by a whistleblower in the Prison Service.</p></speech>

We will keep it under review.</p> <p>  No. 2497 is a matter that should be dealt with in private session.</p> <p>  Nos. 2500 and 2511, dated 23 October, are from an individual with an inquiry regarding the school transport system.  We have already written to the Department requesting a note on whether Bus &Eacute;ireann's auditors and the Department are satisfied that the scheme profits are not or have not been used to cross-subsidise Bus &Eacute;ireann since the scheme began.  I propose we note the correspondence and wait for the Department to respond.</p> <p>  There was an article in a Sunday newspaper on 3 November in which it was stated that three Oireachtas committees are seeking answers to school bus scheme profits claim.  The Committee of Public Accounts is on the case.  We have mentioned it.  The Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport is looking at the matter from a Bus &Eacute;ireann point of view and the Joint Committee on Education and Skills is also examining it.  We are not going to do any more.  I do not believe in three committees of this House dealing with one item of correspondence so this committee will take no further action.  If we get a response to the last letter, well and good, but it is not fair on the Oireachtas to have three different committees working on the same topic.  I understand what is involved.  The matter affects the Committee of Public Accounts, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the school bus service but there needs to be a system here to ensure that members of three different committees are not reading the same correspondence at three different meetings in the one week.  We will wait for a response.</p> <p>  We are nearly there.  We said that we would have the witnesses come in about now.  The next item is the financial statements and accounts since the previous meeting.  A few have been received.  The first relate to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority .  Its turnover for the year was &euro;140 million.  It received a qualified audited opinion on the basis of its deferred pension asset.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's accounts do not recognise pension asset funding in respect of its pension scheme.  We have seen that previously.  It is a standard one.</p> <p>  Next is the Mental Health Commission.  Again, this is a qualified audit opinion.  The cost of the superannuation entitlements are not properly recognised versus international accounting standards as the standard of qualification in the health service.</p> <p>  The next one is Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB.  It is a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to non-compliant procurement of &euro;698,000 and the board's concern is regarding the adequacy of the internal audit resources.  They have all mentioned that latter point.  We are writing to them for a detailed report on the non-compliance with public procurement and to request them to give us the details of the contracts and the measures that are in place and as to why that happened.  In the new year, we hope to compile all the sets of accounts that have come to us in order to deal with that topic.  For now, it is a compilation of information.  We will not ask people to rework it at this stage.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.</p> <p>  The next set of accounts is Traveller' Protection Fund and Travel Agents' and Tour Operators' Bond Accounts.  There is a clear audit opinion in this regard.</p> <p>  Next is the National Concert Hall, for which there is also a clear audited opinion.</p> <p>  Next is Bord na gCon.  It is a clear audited opinion but attention is drawn to impairment losses totalling &euro;20.6 million recognised in the financial statements of five subsidiary companies following the board's review of impairment for 2018.  We had representatives from Bord na gCon before the committee recently.  We went through these impairments and the company's revaluations of its assets, but we are formally noting that.  The accounts have since been laid before the Oireachtas.  That is why we are noting it but we did discuss it at length.  That is the end of that particular topic.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme, in respect of which we will have a very brief discussion.  Before us today are officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Next week, on 12 November, we will have a private meeting from 4 p.m.  Tomorrow morning, the secretariat will issue a working paper to members of the committee in respect of the work it has carried out in assisting us with our consideration and drafting of a periodic report.  No report has been drafted and one will not be issued.  This is a working paper from the secretariat.  It has had no input from any member of the committee.  It is not a Committee of Public Accounts document.  We will consider that working paper at our meeting on Tuesday next, 12 November.  I plead with members to try to read the document, which contains many pages, because it would be great if we could get through our first reading in the one meeting.  Otherwise, we will have to keep coming back to it and we want to get this report out as soon as is practicable.  If members have anything in particular to say, they should make a note rather than starting to read this document when we arrive for the meeting.</p> <p>  I will come back to the work programme but Deputy Cullinane has indicated.  We had suggested a meeting on the following Tuesday, 19 November, to deal with the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment in respect of greenhouse gases and carbon taxation.  I propose that we do not proceed with the meeting on that date and that we will re-schedule it for a Thursday afternoon.  Three Tuesdays in a row is a bit too heavy for us.  We do much work on a Thursday so we will try not to have that third Tuesday meeting.</p></speech>

How is it then allocated?  I do not mean to make this as a political point but it is becoming a habit that Government representatives are being allocated lead and deputy lead positions and then do not turn up.  I have seen that a couple of them are noted as being not available, which is not acceptable from my perspective.  There has to be fairness in how those positions are allocated.  The secretariat or the Chairman might be able to inform us as to how it is done.</p></speech>

It is, I hope, very cost-effective, but I do not know if we have ever looked at the process by which it is operated or the application process or conducted an analysis of the outcomes.  The programme has been ongoing for a significant period of time.  I do not expect to go back forever in time, but perhaps we might look at how it has operated in the last few years or the last two allocations.  By the time we do so, the next allocations will have been made.  Perhaps we might look at that allocation and the one before it.  I want to examine the process by which the progamme is operated and the changes that have been made which have been significant in the past few years, as well as the outcomes.  I have seen an awful lot achieved with small amounts of money, but we need to see how projects that receive larger sums are performing.  It is an issue to which we might come in the future.</p></speech>

The sports capital programme was looked at by the last Committee of Public Accounts.  The most interesting point made was that there was no sunset clause.  I do not know if there is one now.  The issue was that grants were approved, the officers of organisations changed and projects never proceeded.  The Department had no mechanism in place for taking back money and it was very slow in going back, say, after three years to ask if organisations were going to complete projects.  It is important that if they are not proceeding, that we get back the money allocated.</p></speech>

We have representatives of the Courts Service scheduled to appear on 14 November.  On 21 November we have representatives of the Charities Regulator before us.  We have agreed to have representatives of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment before us that afternoon, rather than hold a special meeting on the Tuesday evening.  Those sessions might not take too long and we might put a time limit on both.  On 28 October we will have representatives of the Revenue Commissioners before us in what will be a very important meeting.  On 5 December - a big day - we will have representatives of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, the Department of Health and Children's Health Ireland before us.  We will have a separate session with representatives of the Health Service Executive to deal with the development of primary care services.  We have asked for updates because the representatives of the HSE has already been here to discuss its financial statements.  Therefore, it will be a second round and the HSE is asking what specifically we want to discuss on that occasion.  It would be helpful if we did not just go back over what we did before the summer.  We have mentioned a few items, for example, measures to reduce the incidence of cases involving clinical negligence that may lead to State claims, matters related to CervicalCheck, the oversight of section 38 and section 39 bodies and home help services, including the changes made during the year.  I also want to receive an update on private ambulance contracts which have been in place for years and not renewed.  I have asked parliamentary questions about this issue.  They went out to tender and there was a two-year process, but I believe that process has collapsed.  I do not know what has happened.  Any member will be able to raise an issue in order that representatives of the HSE will be prepared on the day.</p></speech>

I know that can be problematic because when we receive information, it is then leaked beforehand.  Perhaps that is why they will not send it to us until the last minute.  However, there have been additional claims submitted.  Before the witnesses come, we will need the most up-to-date information on the additional claims made, what they were for and the areas in which they were made in order that we will not be trying to drag it out of them and not spend half the session dragging out information that should have been presented to us in advance.  I do not mind if we receive it one day beforehand because at least we will have it, but we need this information.  What happens at times is that we end up wasting an awful lot of the time of the lead questioner, whoever it might be, in trying to obtain information that we should receive in advance.  I ask that we make that request.</p></speech>

If there are particular issues members want to raise at that meeting, they should contact the secretariat.  The HSE witnesses will say they were here to discuss the annual financial statements and that if there are further specific issues the committee would like to raise, they want us to tell them what they are.  It would be helpful if they were to be given advance notice in order that we could receive the briefing material in advance.  As they will be here in the afternoon, it will be a long day.  Representatives of the the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will be before us that the morning, while representatives of the HSE will be before us in the afternoon.  I ask members to mark the date in their diaries.</p></speech>

Expenditure on the schemes is accounted for in two accounts: the appropriation account for Vote 37, and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2018 totalled &euro;19.6 billion.  An appendix to the appropriation account provides a useful summary of the combined scheme expenditure, set out on a scheme-by-scheme basis within broad programme groups.  The Department&rsquo;s expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;636 million.<br/><br/>The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues.  In contrast, the Social Insurance Fund is financed mainly from pay related social insurance contributions, which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners, acting as the Department&rsquo;s collection agent.  Total receipts into the fund in 2018 were &euro;11.2 billion, an increase of 9.4% on the previous year and an increase of almost 47% on the 2013 level.  The fund receipts included &euro;575 million in levies payable to the national training fund operated by the Department of Education and Skills.  The surplus on the Social Insurance Fund for 2018 was in excess of &euro;1.1 billion.  This left the fund with accumulated reserves of &euro;2.3 billion at the year end.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2018.<br/><br/>Before I turn to the three chapters of my 2018 report, I wish to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a typographical error we identified in the Vote account as published.  In note 6.1, which deals with the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on compensation cases, the column titled &quot;compensation awarded&quot; should have been titled &quot;legal costs awarded&quot; and<i>vice versa</i>.  The figures in the note are not affected.  I wish to correct the record on that matter.<br/><br/>On chapter 12, regularity of social welfare payments, for a variety of reasons, some welfare recipients may be paid amounts to which they are not entitled or that exceed their entitlements.  Such irregular payments can arise as a result of inadvertent claimant errors, deliberate fraud by claimants or departmental administration errors.  Control surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department are intended to identify the types of cases where such excess payments arise.  The surveys also provide a basis for estimating the level of irregular payments and underpayments affecting the schemes examined.  The results of successive control surveys suggest that there is a material level of irregular payments on both Vote and social insurance schemes in 2018.  As has been the case for several years, I have drawn attention to this in both audit certificates.<br/><br/>Chapter 12 also outlines the findings of a 2018 control survey of a random sample of 1,000 recipients of the non-contributory State pension.  The Department found that one in five of the recipients whose claims were reviewed in the survey were receiving payments in excess of their entitlements.  The overpayments averaged approximately &euro;50 per week for those who were overpaid.  The excess payments represented 6.5% of the overall value of the payments reviewed.  Significantly, the control survey also found that more than 8% of recipients were receiving less than they were entitled, by an average of approximately &euro;30 per week.  The underpayments represented 1.1% of the overall payments reviewed.  From a regularity perspective, these errors do not offset one another.  Paying one claimant less than their entitlement does not compensate for paying someone else more than their entitlement.  The Department has initiated changes to the control framework for the scheme to address the causes of the errors.<br/><br/>Chapter 13 reviews the timeliness of claim processing by the Department, which is a key performance measure.  Claim processing indicators have been included in the annual Vote Estimates for several years.  The Department has set targets for each scheme in terms of the volume of claims to be awarded within a defined time period.  In most cases, the Department achieves in or around the target levels.  It has reported significant progress in recent years in reducing the average time to award claims. The diagram in the written submission I have provided shows the average number of weeks taken to award a claim in 2018 for the main scheme types.  Typically, schemes with the longest waiting time for a decision are those where eligibility conditions require a medical assessment, a means assessment, or both.</p><p>The examination noted that, for some welfare schemes, the rate of claim rejection exceeds 20%, which may indicate a need to provide better information to claimants about scheme qualification criteria.</p><p> Chapter 14 examines the development of application forms from the perspective of customer service.  Minimising the difficulty of the application process is key to the delivery of good customer service to applicants for income support and to ensure the correct outcome for each application in a timely way.</p><p> The Department relies on an extensive suite of paper forms for information gathering.  Based on our examination of a sample of the Department&rsquo;s forms, these are typically lengthy, which may be intimidating or difficult for some applicants.  However, the forms examined generally conform well with good design guidance issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p> In terms of processing, the Department makes extensive use of scanning technology to read certain paper forms but this continues to require extensive manual intervention and checking.</p><p> There are a limited number of schemes with an online application facility.  Where this option is available, online usage rates are generally very low.  There appears to be significant scope for further development and roll-out of online claim application options.</p></speech>

I hope that members found this material to be of use.</p> <p>  In previous opening statements at this committee, I spoke about the role of social welfare in compensating for and mitigating the impact of failures in the market economy and about how our staff are acutely aware, through their everyday work, of the impact of welfare and employment services on the lives of  individuals and families.  In saying this, it is important to emphasise that the term "social welfare" or "social protection", insofar as it is colloquially and properly used to describe the work of the Department covers a far broader remit than is traditionally associated with the term.  For some people the term "social welfare" creates images of dole office queues and connotations of handouts.  This was never a fair reflection of the role of the Department, the nature of its work or the disposition of the people it serves and it is certainly not the case now.</p> <p>  The Department is, as members will be aware, responsible for the provision of policy advice and the delivery of services across a broad and expanding remit.  As well as the traditional range of cradle-to-grave welfare services, which are themselves expanding, the remit now covers employment affairs and employment services, as well as general registry services, citizens information and advice and pensions supervision and regulation.</p> <p>  The Department is heavily involved in both the evaluation and development of policy and the design, development and delivery of services, giving it a breadth and depth of responsibility that is unique in an Irish Civil Service context.  The expenditure of the Department equates to approximately 37% of Government current expenditure and the Department employs approximately 20% of all staff in the Civil Service.  More notably, the impact of the Department&rsquo;s work is felt by every person, family and business in the State.  If a single statistic can encapsulate its impact, it is that the schemes and services delivered by the Department reduce the risk of poverty by some 50% compared to that which would otherwise pertain.</p> <p>  In delivering on this brief, the staff of the Department strive to always deliver an effective and efficient service and, in doing this, they are very mindful of the vulnerability of the people who rely on our services.  However, it is inevitable, given our breadth and scale, that failures will occur and it is equally inevitable that when these failures do occur, the committee and I, as Secretary General, will hear about them much more frequently and much more vociferously than we hear about the normal, routine, high level of service in, for example, processing over 2 million claims and making over 80 million payments across 86 different schemes and services every year.</p> <p>  I hope I will be forgiven, therefore, if I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of our staff by drawing attention to the evidence that they consistently deliver a high level of service.  Evidence in the customer satisfaction research shows an 85% satisfaction level, in the low level of appeals of less than 1%, in the accreditation for service quality excellence by the International Social Security Association, and in the award of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, certification up to level 8 of the national framework of qualifications or staff development and training programmes to name just some of the external recognition received during the year.  This is not to diminish the cases where we have failed or could do better and we also have to recognise and learn from these cases.  That is why the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General not only in reviewing our accounts but in examining, every year, specific aspects of our operations is welcomed, as is the scrutiny of this committee in holding us to account in respect of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p> <p>  Turning now to the Comptroller and Auditor General report for 2018, I do not, in the interests of time, intend to comment on all of the accounts and chapters but I do wish to make some remarks in respect of issues that I believe may be of interest to the committee or which have already been signalled as being of interest.  These relate to the status of the Social Insurance Fund, Brexit, service performance statistics and the public services card.</p> <p>  The Committee will note from the 2018 accounts that the Social Insurance Fund appears to be in robust financial health.  Expenditure during the year of &euro;10 billion was some &euro;1.1 billion less than receipts, yielding an accumulated surplus at the year-end of &euro;2.3 billion.  I can confirm that this trend has continued and we anticipate that this surplus will be in the order of &euro;4 billion, or thereabouts, by year-end 2019.  It is important to note that this positive trend will not continue and should not be allowed to engender complacency with regard to the challenges that lie ahead.  Past experience indicates that cyclical forces can wipe out this surplus very quickly.  In 2008, a surplus of &euro;3.4 billion was wiped out in 15 months and, over the next six years, the SIF was dependent on Exchequer transfers totalling &euro;7.4 billion in order to meet its obligations to contributors.  That was in the context of favourable demographic conditions.</p> <p>  Looking to the future, demographic trends will significantly increase expenditure of the SIF as the number of older people in our society increases.  This is clear from our 2020 Estimates, which show an existing level of service increase in expenditure of about &euro;520 million, of which over &euro;330 million is due to pension pressures.  This trend will continue with the result that it is inevitable that even with positive economic conditions, the fund will enter into and remain in deficit.  The most recent actuarial review forecasts an annual spend of about &euro;15 billion and an annual deficit of about &euro;3 billion per annum by 2030.  This sets a challenging context for the development of medium to long-tem policy, a context in which the social contract may come under pressure and in which the continuing, if not stronger, support and solidarity of contributors will be essential to the maintenance of the existing level and range of services. </p> <p>  I will now turn to Brexit and its impact on the Department and the people it serves.  The Department has two main concerns in relation to Brexit: first to protect access to benefits and entitlements for people and, second, to ensure that we can respond quickly and appropriately to any job losses attendant on an economic shock.</p> <p>  Existing EU-sponsored arrangements provide for access to and portability of benefits in order to protect the interests of its citizens moving between member states.  Against this background, many people were concerned that once the UK exited the EU, these arrangements would cease to exist.  The Department has for a long time had a very strong co-operative relationship both with the Department of Work and Pensions in the UK and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland.  I can confirm therefore that, building on these relationships and within the framework of the common travel area, the Department agreed and signed an international convention with the UK, which fully protects the interests of citizens from both jurisdictions regardless of the nature of any Brexit.  People will have access to the same benefits on the same terms under this agreement as they do at present, including free travel on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  The Department conducted its own assessment of the likely employment impacts of any downturn in the labour market by region and sector.  Based on this assessment, we worked and continue to work very closely with our colleagues in the enterprise and education sectors to ensure that our shared processes to respond to job losses and provide employment and training supports are robust and flexible enough to support affected workers.  We are confident, based on this work, that the organisation and processes innovations made following the 2008&ndash;12 crisis will stand us in good stead in delivering an effective and seamless service to people who may be affected by job losses post Brexit.  We are also confident in our ability to quickly process any large influx of claims and avoid any repeat of long queues outside our offices.  The development of our online service capability and the introduction of a front-office, back-office model of working will be particularly beneficial in that regard.</p> <p>  Chapter 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to performance monitoring within the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General notes that, with some exceptions, service performance on most schemes is within target levels and is improving.  Last year, committee members expressed particular concern regarding the time to decide carer's allowance claims.  The Department acknowledged these issues and advised that it was taking measures to remedy the situation.  Although the data in the Comptroller and Auditor General report offer no comfort in this regard, I can advise that the Department has, during 2019, undertaken a review and redesign of the carer&rsquo;s claims process and has allocated additional staff to this function.</p><p>We have also increased the complement of medical assessors.  Although there is much work still to be done, these steps are now yielding results.  For example, the average processing time for carers' claims in October was just under ten weeks.  This compares with an average of 17 weeks in 2018 and is the lowest level in ten years.  I understand that ten weeks may still seem a long period to decide a claim, but the complexity of the scheme, which is dependent on multiple conditionalities across two beneficiaries - the carer and the person in receipt of care - is such that these types of claim will always take longer to decide.  Nevertheless, we will continue our efforts to improve the service further.<br/><br/>I am aware that the committee members are concerned to understand both the legal status of the standard authentication framework environment-public services card, SAFE-PSC, process and the value for money, or otherwise, of the process.  With regard to the legal status, this is, as members are aware, a matter on which there is a difference of opinion between the Department and the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  In saying this, it is important to note that there is no difference of opinion between us on the core issue of whether the Department has the function and right to require people to authenticate their identity and to produce a public services card, PSC, when accessing its services.  This is a key finding that contradicts and puts to bed the main criticism made of the PSC by some observers.  Other aspects are the subject of disagreement between the Department and the DPC and we are anxious, as is, we understand, the DPC, that these matters be clarified and resolved as soon as possible in accordance with the process set down by the Oireachtas.  We therefore await receipt of an enforcement notice and, subject to what it might say, we may seek the necessary clarity in the Circuit Court.  We hope that this process can be completed expeditiously.<br/><br/>With regard to the issue of value for money, the committee is already aware from its review of this matter in 2016 that there is no single business case document.  While, as I indicated in my letter of last week, this is regrettable, it should not be taken as evidence that the project was not planned or executed properly.  In fact, as acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report from 2016, 17 of the 19 key elements of a best practice business case were, in fact, in place.<br/><br/>Having reviewed the costs and benefits associated with the project, I am satisfied that it has created the basis for improved service delivery, reduced administrative costs and enhanced control savings.  In a letter sent to the committee last week I indicated that the total fully allocated costs of the project to date are &euro;67.7 million.  However, a large proportion of these costs would have been incurred even if the SAFE process had never been introduced.  This is because the Department always sought to authenticate the identity of people claiming its services and issued identity tokens in the form of pension books, social services cards and free travel passes.  The SAFE process formalised this approach, established a consistent approach across all of our offices, and introduced a higher, more secure, standard of identity token in the form of a PSC, incorporating a photograph of the person.  If a conservative allowance is made, as it properly should be, for the counterfactual or already existing costs, then the actual additional costs of the SAFE-PSC process over the past nine years are, at most, approximately &euro;37 million.<br/><br/>Set against these costs are the benefits of the improved process.  These include administrative efficiencies within the Department, reduced payment leakage due to error or fraud, the deterrence and prevention of fraud, but most of all, improved customer service as people accessing our services do not now have to verify their identity on each separate occasion on which they make a new claim or service request.  In addition, secure authentication of identity provides the platform on which the Department is now rolling out online service access.  This has already delivered some administrative efficiencies and will deliver even greater levels of savings as well as significantly simplifying service access for people into the future.  As the PSC and <i>myGov.ie</i>platforms are available for use by public service providers, the savings and service benefits just instanced for the Department can also be realised by these other providers.<br/><br/>Ignoring the deterrence of fraud benefits, which are difficult to estimate, and ignoring the customer service benefits and the benefits that are being realised in other public service organisations, I conservatively estimate that the direct savings attributable to reduced payment leakage and administrative efficiencies within the Department already amount to more than &euro;20 million.  As the take-up of online service access increases, as inevitably it will, and as more people who are now SAFE-registered return to make second and subsequent claims, the level of administrative savings and customer service benefits will increase still further.  I am confident that these direct savings to the Department will, over the next few years, exceed project costs and that the overall project, taking account of the other benefits mentioned but not included in the figures above, will deliver strong value for money.  These figures are estimates only and I acknowledge that we will need a fuller cost-benefit analysis.  Therefore, I intend, early in 2020, when full-year costs for 2019 are finalised, to commission a full cost-benefit analysis of the project.<br/><br/>Just under &euro;10 million of the savings realised to date relates to detected fraud.  Individual prosecutions on some cases have amounted to more than &euro;400,000 and I have provided the committee, under separate cover today, with some examples of cases for its information.  In doing this I wish to return to the principle of solidarity mentioned in respect to the maintenance of the social contract.  As one eminent High Court judge has noted, prosecutions such as those circulated help to underpin the solidarity necessary to sustain continued public support for and confidence in the integrity of our social welfare system.  In other words, it is important not just that we stand over the integrity of our control processes but that we are manifestly seen to apply high standards in the detection and prevention of fraud and to deploy, within the parameters available under law, the best technology available to that purpose.<br/><br/>The benefit in authenticating identity is, therefore, not confined to administrative efficiencies or from the savings from the detection and, more importantly, the deterrence of welfare fraud but is just as much concerned with the fact that we can defend the system of social expenditure against the claims by some that the system itself is open to widespread and uncontrolled abuse.  These claims, although untrue, would, if not rebutted, threaten the continued support of the public necessary to sustain the funding of the services we provide, funding which, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, will have to increase significantly in future years if the existing range and levels of service is to be maintained.  Similar considerations apply to demonstrably using the best technology available to minimise administrative cost and error to reassure the public that scarce funds are not being consumed by bureaucracy rather than being delivered to the intended beneficiaries.  These are intangible but very important considerations that should not, I believe, be lost in the discussion on the merits or otherwise of initiatives such as SAFE-PSC.<br/><br/>I will repeat something I said last year.  We, by which I mean the managers and staff of the Department, work hard to deliver services to the communities from which we come and in which we live, conscious that it is our families, our friends and our neighbours who not only depend on these services but who, through their social insurance contributions and taxes, pay for these services.  We are proud of the work we do but we know we are not perfect and we do not always get things right.  That is why we welcome the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee.  This process plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose, helping us to identify areas for improvement and helping us to learn from our mistakes.  It is through such a process that we would hope to improve.  I and my colleagues will be pleased to take any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

Huge areas are covered by the Department and Mr. McKeon confirms that its customers are a huge part of our life and are made up of people of all ages, all demographics, rather than just people on the dole.  There are three special chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that we are discussing, along with the appropriation accounts, this morning.  I will start by focusing on the level of irregular payments made by the Department.</p><p>With an overall budget of &euro;11 billion, the moneys involved in this Vote are substantial.  This issue is topical.  In January, the Department published the result of a control survey of the non-contributory State pension scheme.  The scheme is a substantial piece of expenditure that accounted for some &euro;1 billion in 2018.  The Department examined 1,000 payments made during one week in 2017, at which time there were 99,000 beneficiaries.  The survey touched on how 8.2% of claims were underpayments.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, there was a mix of underpayments and overpayments.  People might believe that getting an overpayment is grand, but it causes difficulties for older people further down the road when they are hit with the repayment bill.  I know of a woman who this year received a bill where &euro;100,000 was the magnitude of the cumulative overpayment.  She took a hit through no fault of her own.  When her situation was reviewed, she was well into her 80s.  The survey showed that 38% of claimants aged over 80 years were in receipt of an incorrect rate.  Will Mr. McKeon briefly summarise the measures that the Department has taken to address the levels of irregular payments revealed in the control survey in January?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110700002#T00200"><p>The study on the non-contributory State pension also addressed the reasons.  The purpose of the control survey was to inform our control activity in specific schemes and provide us with an estimate of the overall levels.  The information from that survey showed that the risk areas were people over 80 years of age.  In general, their circumstances had changed since they were awarded their pensions when they were 65 and they had not advised the Department of that change.  It might seem strange that someone who qualified for a means-tested payment when he or she was 65 somehow has more money at 80, but it happens.  It can happen because, for example, people inherit property or live in a household where someone else has passed away and they now get money but they have not told the Department about it.  When we then undertake a control review, we find out that they may have more means than were disclosed when they initially put in their claims, giving rise to overpayments.  Our approach is to behave reasonably in recovering overpayments.  We agree repayment schedules with people, which can be low in weekly terms but which we hope will recover the full amount over time.</p> <p>  In terms of changes going forward, the survey will inform the cases that we pick for review each year.  Every year, we undertake approximately 10,000 routine reviews outside the control reviews of the non-contributory State pension.  Obviously, we cannot review all 100,000 people on that payment every year.  Instead, we try to pick out specific cases.  We look at and contact the people over 80 years of age who were close to their means level when they originally got the pension.  We also send out reminder letters to people advising them that, if their circumstances have changed, they should tell us.</p> <p>  What often happens in these cases is that the estate ends up paying the amount.  The Social Insurance Fund and the Department are preferred creditors when estates are being wound up.  If someone ends up with much more money in a bank account at the time of his or her death, we will be made aware of it and will recover the money from the estate.  That could be a shock to the family.</p></speech>

Many people are frugal up to turning 65 years of age, but perhaps their circumstances then change.  They are not being deceitful on purpose, but they might come into some money.  They are not checked until they are hit with a bill a number of years later.  I mentioned the &euro;100,000 in respect of the 80 year old.  Has the effectiveness of the measures and correspondence been improved in recent years?</p></speech>

Until this year, we concentrated on sending reminder letters to people who had already disclosed means.  For example, they were on reduced pensions.  Every year, we wrote to them asking whether their circumstances had changed.  We did not send reminder letters to people who had nil means, though, as we did not anticipate that their circumstances would change.  From this year on, we will pick out 10,000 of those cases and write to them.</p></speech>

Where there is a doubt, we will give the customer the benefit of the doubt instead of categorising it as a fraud case.</p></speech>

When the Department appeared before us last year, it had examined this area.  Following on from that, there was a finding and recommendation in our March periodic report, which read:</p><blockquote>The processing of applications by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection requiring medical assessments is unduly slow.  The Committee recommends that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection completes its examination of the possibility of contracting nurses to carry out medical assessments promptly.  Should it not be viable, other alternatives should be actioned to improve processing times. </blockquote> <p>Mr. McKeon alluded to this issue in his opening statement when speaking about carer's allowance and so forth.  Are there further updates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110700002#T01200"><p>I gave the update in our letter.  We have been working hard on this issue over the past year.  Last year, we acknowledged that medical claims, in particular for carer's claims, were a source of difficulty for us.  In the previous year, we had worked closely with the various disability and advocacy groups to redesign our claim forms and try to ensure that we captured as much information as possible up front and in a timely manner.  That yielded some benefits, but they clearly did not go the full way.</p> <p>  During the year, we have increased the number of medical assessors by four - it went from 30 to 34 - and added staff to our carer's and disability claims processing areas.  We have also undertaken a scheme review.  As of October, all of the schemes in question were at or below our performance target level.  We expect that, by this year's end, the average processing time for carer's claims will be approximately 12 weeks over the full year.  It started off at 17 and is currently just under ten.  We expect to maintain or slightly improve that.  We would like it to be better, but they are complex schemes.  For example, an issue we have encountered may need to be considered from a policy perspective.  As we deal with process and staffing issues that clear out many of the difficulties, we are left dealing with the complexities of getting times down from ten to eight weeks.  As I may have mentioned last year, we are encountering issues.  I fully understand why if someone has a carer's or disability claim, the advice from the disability advocacy groups - they are absolutely right - is to get that claim in as early as possible because that establishes the person's entitlement date.  Often, however, people submit claims when they do not have their full medical reports.  We must then make decisions on incomplete claims, which delays the process.  From a policy perspective, we may need to think about whether we should change the entitlement date.</p></speech>

From a policy perspective, we may need to establish the entitlement date in those situations.  There are risks to being more generous and there would be significant IT consequences for the Department, given that we would have to redesign many of our IT systems if we allowed for some flexibility around the entitlement date, but that is something that we will examine over the next year.</p></speech>

We often contact the Department's various sub-offices.  Will Mr. McKeon speak about the efforts to simplify the forms, given that their sheer size can be frightening for many people?  Figure 14.4 in the chapter lists the sizes.  The disability allowance form is 36 pages long and the carer's allowance form is 36 pages long.</p><p>The form for the non-contributory pension is 20 pages long while the form for child benefit is 16 pages long.  The forms for these payments are extremely lengthy.  I appreciate that it can involve medical reports but are any efforts being made to try to reduce the length of those forms?  It is extremely frightening for somebody to receive a 36-page application form for disability allowance or carer's allowance.</p></speech>

Every time I see the forms, I am shocked by their length.  I have gone through them.  On numerous occasions, we have looked to see whether we can simplify or streamline them.  In the case of the carer's allowance and benefit application forms, we spent a lot of time with Family Carers Ireland and used a collaborative approach in respect of the design of the form.  We work with the National Adult Literacy Agency on the design of our forms.  We set up a customer communications unit, which has taken responsibility centrally for all form design because, previously, it was done in each scheme area.  We hope that in the coming years, we will be able to refine them.  It is about a balance - giving somebody the opportunity to provide all of the information that might be required to decide a claim knowing that in each individual case, perhaps only half the information is required but that if we do not ask the question of everybody, we might not get it.  It is about achieving that balance.  This might sound counter-intuitive but when we work with advocacy groups, NALA and so on, trying to make the language simpler means that we break questions up, which means that we then lengthen the forms.  That is an inevitable consequence.  I acknowledge that we may have gone too far on that.  As we roll out our online applications, we are going through each claim form and trying to make the online version very simple so that people move from one screen to the next screen and it is not intimidating.  One of the issues about forms is that they are not as intimidating as they look but their sheer scale makes them look intimidating.  When somebody goes online, we will be able to take that intimidation factor away.</p></speech>

People sees the form and do not go through it.  They then come into our offices.  Mr. McKeon mentioned online forms.  The size of the forms is one issue.  How somebody applies is, obviously, totally different.  In an era when one can do almost everything online, figure 14.2 in the report shows how out of the 19 main schemes offered by the Department, only five can be offered online.  These are jobseeker's allowance and benefit, child benefit, the back to school allowance and maternity benefit.  Payments like disability benefit, carer's payments, rent supplement and State pensions are not offered online.  What is the Department doing to try to roll out more online applications?  What is prohibiting the Department from doing so?  Which of the main payments that are not offered online will come online?  Will any of them come online in 2020?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Department arrived late into the online world.  There is nothing delaying us.  The schemes are complex.  We are trying to carefully design the online forms.  Eight payments are offered online.  The number has increased since the Comptroller and Auditor General wrote the report.  The earliest ones we introduced are now doing very well online, for example, paternity benefit, where over half the claims are now made online.  A total of 97% of all claims for treatment benefit, which is our largest individual scheme in terms of applications, are processed online with very little need for human intervention.  We process about 1.4 million claims per year online for treatment benefit.</p></speech>

In the case of jobseeker's allowance, which we rolled out, we have taken a fairly slow approach to letting people know it is there.  We rolled it out in one iteration and had a lot of what techies call customer labs where we would get customers in, tell them this is available and then observe them as they went through the process.  We then changed the online system again and repeated the process.  We have been going through an iterative process to try to make it very easy to use.  When we are comfortable that it is as good as it can be, we will promote it as the best means.  Even though we have not promoted it, 11,000 claims for jobseeker's were made online this year even though we have not told people it is available.  The appetite is there and we want to move in this regard.  Currently, 70% of claims are taken by post and 30% in person.  My ambition and that of the Department is for half of claims to be taken online.  Going back to the public services card, that is a critical enabler of that because when somebody is applying for a service online, he or she can see the eligibility of his or her existing claim status and his or her contributions.  One must be certain that the individuals who are coming online are the persons they say are.  The safe process for registering the identity of a person and his or her mobile phone number, which is how we use the two-factor authentication, is critical when it comes to giving people access to online services.</p></speech>

The back page of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on Tuesday covered Mr. McKeon's letter to the committee on that issue, and the article also featured a very fetching picture of Mr. McCarthy.  It mentioned the business case.  The line that caught my eye was Mr. McKeon's statement that the total fully allocated costs of the project to date come to &euro;67.7 million but a large portion of these costs would have been incurred even if the public services card had not been introduced.  Mr. McKeon stated that this was because the Department always sought to authenticate the identity of people claiming its services in any event.  When I read that line, the words of another Secretary General, who appeared before the committee, came flooding back because they were nearly exactly the same as those uttered by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Martin Fraser, when he spoke about the infamous strategic communications unit.  Following the scrapping of the spin unit, Mr. Fraser pivoted and said the Department of the Taoiseach would have spent the money in any case because all the guys were working in various press offices across various Departments and nobody lost their job afterwards.  The two things do not tally because there was, of course, a cost in establishing the strategic communications unit.  I put the same point to Mr. McKeon. On the one hand, he is saying the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would have incurred the costs in any event but then talks about the savings.  I think he alluded to savings of &euro;20 million.  What is the real cost?  Obviously, the real cost is &euro;67.7 million but Mr. McKeon is trying to say there are counterfactual matters.  What is the actual net cost of establishing the services and what have been the real savings identified to date?</p></speech>

I will give an example.  PPS numbers always required an identity check regardless of the SAFE process.  Since the SAFE process was introduced, we have issued approximately 1 million of them, predominantly to new people coming into the State who do not have any identity with the Department.  We have always looked for documentary evidence such as birth certificates, passports or bank statements.  Irish people receive a PPS number at birth and the first time we come across them is when they make a claim.  Any time anybody made a new claim we always checked the identity.  Until the mid to late 1990s in many cases, we sent a social welfare inspector to the home.  We always incurred costs on identity.</p> <p>  I did not include the cost of sending social welfare inspectors to anyone's home.  I looked purely at using the process we were using for identity checks prior to the introduction of SAFE and how much it would have cost to keep doing it when issuing social services cards, pensions books and free travel passes.  At a conservative estimate, that cost would have come to between &euro;30 million and &euro;31 million.  The actual net additional cost is approximately &euro;37 million and that is genuine and sincere.  I acknowledge that the committee would expect, like Mandy Rice-Davies, that I would say that anyway but I was not involved.  I was not even in the Department at that stage and I was not in the Civil Service.  I was made Secretary General of the Department in 2017, the same year as this whole thing broke.  The easiest thing for me would have been to say there was a new broom, that everything until then had been wrong and that I was going to fix it.  I genuinely looked at the situation and the net cost is approximately &euro;37 million at most, in a conservative estimate.  As I said in my opening statement, I am quite happy and I do intend to commission an external cost-benefit analysis next year.  I understand the Mandy Rice-Davies-type argument that I would say that anyway.  We will do that and publish it.</p> <p>  The benefits break into two themes.  One is administrative efficiencies in the Department, including the online cases I mentioned.</p></speech>

The online savings to date are in the order of &euro;2 million.  There is a very low level.  The claims being done online go straight through with little human interaction and there are &euro;2 million savings in this.  The other big saving is the avoidance of multiple identity checks.  In recent years, a number of people have come back to us for a second or third claim.  In the past they would have had to have their identity checked every time and this was a huge source of frustration.  I remember it being raised not at this committee but at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection with regard to why somebody who made a claim for jobseeker's allowance in 2012, who then got a job but came back to make a claim in 2015 had to provide the same identity information again.  We do not need to do this any more.  This saving amounts to approximately &euro;9 million.  These two savings amount to approximately &euro;10 million.  We also have the savings in leakage in payments, which I have referenced, of &euro;10 million.  This amounts to approximately &euro;20 million.  It is a fair and reasonable estimate that the net cost is approximately &euro;37 million.  So far, we have saved approximately &euro;20 million.  These savings will accelerate.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commission said the cost of its initial investigation into the public services card was almost &euro;200,000, comprising &euro;130,000 internal and &euro;66,000 external.  Almost &euro;200,000 has been spent investigating it, again fuelling people's frustration with the expenditure of public money.  How much money will the Department have to spend on legal costs to defend this particular implementation?</p></speech>

It will depend on the nature of the enforcement notice when it is received and whether we in fact need to appeal it or not.  If we appeal it, there will be an appeal at the Circuit Court, which I understand is more cost effective than a High Court appeal.  As the committee will be aware, the Department does not carry legal costs in matters such as this.  They are carried by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chief State Solicitor's office in any event.  The issue at heart here is the interpretation of social welfare legislation and the Office of the Attorney General will lead on that defence.</p></speech>

The OECD has done a study on Ireland and a number of other countries.  It does seem, in some ways counterintuitive, but someone who becomes unemployed has to wait nine months for some schemes and 12 months for others.  The evidence reveals two issues.  One is the potential deadweight cost that arises where someone who would have got a job within the nine-month period was on a scheme or training course, and does not then compete for the job.  We are carrying the cost of them on the scheme when they could have been in employment.</p></speech>

The employment outcomes of people who went on the back to education allowance scheme who did either a short course for a year or a longer degree course,  compared to a control group of identical people - this research was done by the ESRI for the Department, not by the Department itself -  were 14% lower.   There are two competing things at work, the regression effect and the lock-in effect.  For somebody who is unemployed, the lock-in effect is that they then go on to a scheme that lasts two years, then try to go for employment and the employer asks how long has the person been without a job.  When the person says three years that immediately damages their chance of employment, which is what the evidence shows.  For some people it is right thing to do.  The issue is how does one target it at the right people.</p></speech>

One wonders about these academics, who tend to review other literature, written by other academics.  The practical reality on the ground, I am suggesting - our witness can take it from somebody who knows through hard graft experience -  is that this is an issue.  If we want to hide behind literature and peer reviews, there are nonetheless 108 front-line workers coming to this conclusion, including myself, and I have also spoken to some of the Department's own inspectors, current and retired.  I did not just dream this up to give our witness grief.  It is something of a dismissal to say that we have considered everything, this is the way that it is, one can like it or lump it.  I would most respectfully ask that Mr. McKeon seek out some research to see if early intervention is better across all of those schemes, but in particular the back to education one.  I see no justification to make somebody, who is geared-up and focused, hang around for a year, when they are best-placed on furthering their education, so that they can add value and more taxation to the other schemes that the most vulnerable are in need of.  We will leave that issue there.  Could Mr. McKeon send us a summary of the research that supports everything he has been saying, but in particular, could he seek out research on early intervention, because I am sure some exists?</p><p> Some 38% of claimants who were over 80 years of age were in receipt of an incorrect rate of payment.

The situation is that these are all non-contributory pensioners.  They are means-tested pensioners.  They are people who, at the time they made the claim, satisfied the means test, but 20 years later because their circumstances changed, they no longer satisfy the means test.  People's circumstances change even in retirement because they bequeath wills and so on.  Their income changes.  That does affect their entitlement.</p></speech>

They may have a number of different sources of income.  They have found a source of income that was not in place at the time they made the claim.  It is predominantly through inheritances.  That is something they need to tell us about and sometimes they do not.  They do not realise they need to tell us and then when we do a check or a survey, we find they have a lot more money in the bank than they declared when they were 65 of 66 and that affects their entitlement.</p></speech>

As such, payments are by their nature exceptional, it is very difficult to forecast what exceptional needs might arise year-to-year.  We often have a Supplementary Estimate for exceptional needs as well.  Sometimes it is negative and sometimes it is positive.</p></speech>

I just wanted to make that point.</p> <p>  I refer to administrative expenses.  Bank charges of &euro;2.2 million and negative interest of 1.1% were incurred in 2018.  I ask the witnesses to explain how the Department receives money and whether there are ways of reducing or avoiding the amount of money paid for administration.  Does that figure relate to drawdowns or arrears?  What is its nature?</p></speech>

We have to pay the bank when payments go through and they are driven by demand.  As the volume of payments such as jobseeker's allowance reduces, so does the amount of money we pay in bank charges.  I will explain how we manage our money and why there would be negative interest.  We are funded by the central Vote from the central account.  We draw the money down from that, put it into our own bank account, and then send any surplus back.  Unfortunately, there were negative interest rates during the year but we cannot operate on the basis that there is no money in our account.  There has to be money in our account in order to meet sums that are due.  There are negative interest rates, which is unfortunately the reality.  To give the Deputy some comfort, in terms of Social Insurance Fund receipts and the surplus there, we give those to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  We do not hold them in the bank for a moment longer than they need to be held because we do not want to incur negative interest on them.</p></speech>

In today's correspondence we received a reply from Mr. McKeon on the public services card.  It included an assessment of the public services card project which outlines what is or is not done and what stage everything is at.  The benefits realisation plan does not appear to have been assessed.  The organisation's capacity to undertake the project does not seem to have had a full evaluation either.  One of the criticisms of this project has been that there is no single on-paper business case, which is what this letter is addressing.  I ask Mr. McKeon to respond briefly to those two points.</p></speech>

It was also covered at length by my predecessor, the then Secretary General, in 2016.  There was no single business case document.  Looking back, one sees that there should have been, but there was not.  The reason for that was explained at the time and related to how the public services card project had evolved going back to 1993.  There are difficulties involved in estimating benefits in particular.  Most of the elements of a business case were in place in different documents, but were not compiled in one place.  I acknowledge that it would have been preferable to have everything in one document, and said as much in my letter.  However, such a document was not put together and there is no point pretending it was.  We have to acknowledge that it was not.  For the purposes of this committee meeting, I have tried to set out the marginal and incremental costs we have incurred.</p><p>We would have incurred a lot of costs in any event, which I explained earlier.  It is about &euro;37 million.  The benefits we have accrued to date are about &euro;20 million.  Those benefits will be ongoing-----</p></speech>

We specifically requested that the counsel who was advising on this would look at it, in some ways, from the most maligned perspective possible from our view.  We gave it very careful consideration.  We did not want to challenge the findings unless we could be absolutely assured that a challenge was not only appropriate but necessary.  The Attorney General came back with advice.  We did not seek to lead, inform or direct the Attorney General in any way.  We left it open to the Attorney General to advise on this.</p></speech>

It is constantly mentioned that we are at a below 5% unemployment rate.  Hopefully, that will continue or it will reduce further.  In the Celtic tiger era, 5% was generally regarded as full employment yet we are still awarding contracts for Turas Nua and JobPath.  What is the thinking behind this?</p></speech>

We did not award a contract, we extended it.  We extended it for a year and that is the limit of it.  The reason we extended it is two-fold.  The two issues that informed our consideration were, first, the approximately 600 people who work as employment advisers in Turas Nua and Seetec providing employment support and advice to people.  It would have been foolhardy to take that resource capacity out of our system when Brexit was on the horizon and there was talk of approximately 50,000 job losses in a hard Brexit scenario.  That is the most important point.  Second, we need to do a review of our contracted employment service provision across JobPath, local employment services and JobsPlus to comply with EU procurement rules.  We will do that review and we will determine the future of contracted employment services once that review is completed.  They are the two main reasons.  As I said it would have been premature to take a decision to stop something until we had completed that review.</p></speech>

Are there changes in the way in which they are dealt with when they enter the scheme on more than one occasion?  I continue to hear complaints about this scheme, although not on a weekly basis or anything like that.  One complaint related to a person who had completed a degree in nursing and had signed on while awaiting accreditation and was forced to participate in this scheme.  Why would such a person be brought into the system and a payment to an employer when it was known that person would have a job following accreditation?  I still do not understand that.</p></speech>

It sounds very strange.  The people who are referred to JobPath should be on the live register for at least 12 months.  Most of them are on the register three years.  If the person the Deputy mentioned has just received an accredited degree in nursing it does not sound as though he or she was on the live register for the past year or three years.</p></speech>

Also, customer feedback is good.  We survey JobPath participants twice a year.  The positive feedback is remarkably high.  The negative feedback is equal to that in respect of other local employment services.  I always caution people about tarring a particular service with a brush that could equally be applied to other services.</p></speech>

On the issue of biometrics, a couple of weeks ago, the committee received correspondence that indicated that there was funding of, I think, less than &euro;300,000 in the accounts - I cannot recall the particular year - and it specifically identified biometrics.  This is an issue on which the Department is in discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner.

What is the-----</p></speech>

In public commentary three different things tend to get conflated.  For example, people have said that the public services card contains biometric data.  We are very clear that it does not.  There is no biometric data in the photograph or on the card or chip.  We are very clear on that.  Second, people we say we share biometric data.  We are very clear we do not share biometric data with anybody.  Third, people say we collect biometric data.  Again, we are very clear we do not collect biometric data.  The term "collect" has a particular meaning in a data protection context.  We do not collect biometric data.  For example, it has been said that when people walk into our offices our cameras can immediately scan their faces and collect biometric data.  None of that happens.  In terms of what we do, we process the photograph to create a biometric template.  We have always said that.  In replies to parliamentary questions we have always been clear that we produce an arithmetic template.  We have called it biometric and we say that on our website.  We say it in the frequently asked questions and comprehensive guide for the Committee of Public Accounts.  We do create a biometric template for our own purposes.  That is what enables us to identify issues of identity fraud.  The information does not leave the Department.  It is not on the card, it is not collected and it is not shared.  People hear that there are no biometric data on the card and even though biometric is referenced they are different things.</p></speech>

Previously, an employer would pay and recoup the payment.  There was a change and there was a reluctance to do that.</p><p>Then there was a delay in paying redundancies because a lot of these happened at the same time.  Would the Department identify that as a particular risk?  What is the amount of money involved?  Some of the money has to do with insolvency and some has to do with employers opting for this method, as opposed to paying it.  Mr. McKeon might address that.</p></speech>

It is detailed in note 5 of the Social Insurance Fund accounts.  It is a risk but all debt carries a risk in terms of collection and we have to recognise that what the Social Insurance Fund is doing in that situation is effectively acting as a bond.  It is like a travel bond when one travels.  It is a payment of benefits to people, such as a redundancy payment, accrued pension contributions, holiday time or back wages where the employer is not in a position to pay the employees, because the employer is going bust.  Consequently, we pay it; the Social Insurance Fund steps in and makes that figure up.  It is like a bonding scheme.  We then raise the debt against the employer but the truth is that when debt is raised against an employer that is insolvent or going bust, the chances of ever recovering it are very low.  In practice, we will only ever recover about 10%.</p></speech>

There have been some employers that would raise hair on the back of one's neck with their behaviour but most employers in that situation are not there by choice and they are trying to do their best.  That is the reality.  One can always pick out the egregious case as an example and there have been one or two notable cases that we have gone to court with but most employers are not doing it because they are trying to avoid their liabilities.  They just cannot meet them.</p></speech>

If it is a limited company, the liability is with the business.  We work with Revenue and we raise issues in court cases about whether directors should be barred from holding future directorships and so on but in practice, the debt is owed by the limited company and not by the shareholder.  I understand the point but it is the same for Revenue or for any creditor.</p></speech>

I have a few questions on the public services card.  Mr. McKeon might be aware we had the Data Protection Commissioner before us a number of weeks ago and we put questions to her on this issue as well.  She published a report a number of months ago and made a number of directions to the Department on foot of that report.  There were three high-level findings in her report.  First, she found there was no lawful basis on which the Department can rely on the SAFE 2 register and issue PSCs to persons required to obtain a PSC in order to transact with a public body other than the Department.  That was the first high-level finding from her investigation.  Does the Department accept that finding?</p></speech>

It is not a decision the Department took lightly.  We took it on strong advice from the Attorney General.  The public services card delivers a lot of benefits to administration and customer service.

In any event, I will move on because I want to look at processes.  We had quite an interesting discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner on the interaction between the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department.  The Data Protection Commissioner had some stuff to say about that, which I will get to.  I have extracts from what she said.  There were a number of issues with that interaction.  On point 12 of the executive summary in her report, she says the Department was not in a position to meet in a deadline that was set on 31 October 2018.  It was a deadline for a draft report.  She stated the Department intended to send its response to the DPC by 30 November.  At that point the Department threatened the possibility of legal proceedings.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The context there, which is important to point out, is that we got the draft report from the Data Protection Commissioner, which ran to a number of hundreds of pages, at the end of August 2018.  We were asked to respond in a period of about four weeks.  We had to consult with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it was simply not possible to meet that deadline.  We indicated we needed a period of three months to do so.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner responded to say it did not accept that more time than four weeks was needed but agreed to give us eight weeks.  In that situation, we had to reply to say we really needed the three months, to point out that we were entitled to due process and to say that if it was necessary we would take steps to ensure we got due process.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commissioner had sent us 14 findings and 17 requests for further information.  To respond to those 14 findings and 17 requests for further information, we had to insert in the document many exhibits, technical specifications and so on, which were scanned documents.  They were not our documents but were technical documents.  That meant they were being scanned with pages numbers already on them, which meant that the numbering sequence, when we paginated it, did not make sense.

If we, as a committee, sought information from a Department and received 470 scanned, unpaginated pages, I am sure we would return them.  When this was put to her, the Data Protection Commissioner stated this was unusual and far from the norm when receiving information from a Department.  In fact, she was critical of the Department for the manner in which it was sent.</p></speech>

Ms Dixon stated she had indicated in her first response that she was prepared to meet.  She stated she had responded to a letter from Ms McCrum on 22 August, and indicated in the affirmative that the DPC was willing to meet and that a meeting could be useful once the Department had tabled the implementation plan, which she was entitled to do.  She indicated she would meet but that there would need to be an implementation plan, which she stated she had directed in the letter of 15 August.

That is all it is.  We sought an early meeting in our letter to the DPC on 22 August.  The DPC replied that for its own reasons, it was not prepared to meet us until we had submitted the implementation plan, which was to be in October.  We sought an early meeting but we did not get acceptance for an early meeting, which is the point we are making.  We then had to consult with the Office of the Attorney General and others.  We determined the appropriate response and, at that point, wrote to the Data Protection Commission advising it of our response and that we would still like to meet.  There is nothing untoward or difficult about that.  There is nothing contentious.  It is simply a professional exchange of correspondence.</p></speech>

She had directed that there be an implementation plan and she felt that it was appropriate for that plan to be put in place and to then meet.  She got a letter from the Department stating that officials wanted to meet her.  Her response stated that it would be entirely inappropriate for the commission to engage in a meeting where it had issued finalised findings and clear directions.  Is it correct that she had issued finalised findings at that point?  She contends that at that point, it would have been inappropriate for her to meet the witnesses.  I imagine the Comptroller and Auditor General has a similar process when he does his reports where he allows an organisation to come back.  Would he meet with an organisation once he has finalised a report?</p></speech>

We would have had engagement and meetings in the process.  From my point of view, it is important to have points made in writing because that has evidential value.

We felt we needed clarifications on the meaning of some of the findings and of some of the directions given in the letter.  We felt there were some inconsistencies.  We wanted to talk to the Data Protection Commissioner about that to get clarity.  The Data Protection Commissioner, as the Deputy rightly says, felt that that would be inappropriate until she had an implementation plan.  She subsequently continued to feel that it would be inappropriate.  I do not have a difficulty with that decision of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></speech>

The parliamentary question suggested that the Data Protection Commissioner, unfairly in my view, was not willing to meet.  In fact, Ms McCrum, when she initially answered the question, said that on that date in August, the Data Protection Commissioner was not in a position to meet.  The commissioner added a caveat that the implementation plan should be put in place.  My point is that a perception was being created by the Department that the Data Protection Commissioner was unwilling to engage with the Department when, in fact, she was willing to engage.  She made it clear that she had directed an implementation plan and it was not put in place.  She wanted that to be put in place and then she would meet.  By the time the Department wrote to her, she had finalised her report and findings and felt it was inappropriate at that point.  It is important for the facts to be made available and that the Department does not create a perception that the Data Protection Commissioner was unwilling to engage or to meet with the Department, when that does not seem to be the case, and she was more than willing to meet.</p></speech>

We received a final report.  There was no subsequent finalisation of the report.  It was received on 15 August, with a letter from the Data Protection Commissioner, setting out the steps that the Data Protection Commission would like the Department to take.  It stated it would take one week for one matter, three weeks for another and six weeks for an implementation plan.  We identified issues in the report and in the letter.  We also identified inconsistencies.  We wanted to clarify those with the Data Protection Commissioner and we wanted a meeting to do that.  We asked for an early meeting.  The Data Protection Commissioner did not feel that would be appropriate and told us so.  The commissioner told us she would meet with us when we accepted her findings and delivered an implementation plan.  It would be difficult for us to develop an implementation plan if we did not accept the findings and, even if we did, it would be difficult to develop an implementation plan where we felt there were inconsistencies and a lack of clarity about some of the findings and the analysis.  That is why we wanted a meeting.  While I do not object to this, the Data Protection Commissioner did not feel it would be appropriate to meet until we had an implementation plan and that is fully her prerogative.  There is no contention-----</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commissioner makes rulings and has statutory powers.  One of the points she made is that there is a growing awareness in some Departments about the role of the commissioner's office.  It is not an advisory role, but has enforcement aspects too.  I have one more question on the report.  It relates to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Paragraph 43 of the commissioner's report states:</p><blockquote>The C&amp;amp;AG Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2015 noted that the Accounting Officer for DEASP was of the view <i>&quot;that while a business case had not been developed, the project has been coherently planned and implemented in conjunction with DPER and with the support of relevant decision makers and stakeholders&quot;</i>.</blockquote> <p>The Chairman referred to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General earlier.  The report then states that the commission was of the view that &quot;the PSC was more piecemeal and less coherent than suggested&quot;.  I want to get the witnesses' view on what follows because it came from them or the Department.  It states:</p><blockquote>The DPC notes DEASP&rsquo;s objections to the DPC&rsquo;s description in this regard, firstly on the basis that it represents a &ldquo;collateral undermining of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s view on the PSC project&rdquo;</blockquote> <p>What did the Department mean by that?</p></speech>

It was not commenting directly on whether my report was reliable or not.  I think there is a bit of quoting out of context.  In the report in 2016, the team went through the process of looking at the elements that should be in a good business case.  It looked at documents compiled between 2003 and 2011.  We found that there were many elements there but there were some key ones that were missing.  I do not think it would be fair to characterise what we presented in the report as saying that that is as good as a business case.  It is not.  The conclusions of my report on that explain what a good business case is.  I refer to the fact that the Accounting Officer was of the view that it was not possible to build a single detailed business case.  While it had not been developed, the project has been coherently planned and implemented.  The Data Protection Commissioner was challenging the Accounting Officer's view, not mine.</p></speech>

It is an important point because the Data Protection Commissioner referred to this too.  The Department's response to the Data Protection Commissioner at that point was that it represented a collateral undermining of Mr. McCarthy's report on the public services card.  To be clear, that would not be Mr. McCarthy's view?</p></speech>

The other big payment that is a scheme pre-payment there would be child benefit.  The reason it increased a lot at the end of 2018 compared to 2017 was that the payment date for child benefit fell for 2019 just after New Year's Day so we brought it forward into 2018.  That would be by far the biggest amount.</p></speech>

Generally our appeals officers are more experienced officers at assistant principal level.  We have had a high level of retirement so we have had a lot of new people come in.  We have increased the cadre by seven appeals officers in the past year to try to deal with the backlog.

The highest level of appeals we have across any scheme is in the disability allowance scheme.  About 16% of disability allowance claims will be appealed.

It is not even really a role for me, but unfortunately we must put in some letters.  My role relates to the process, why it is taking so long and what should change.  When I go back to people in Galway seeking the disability allowance, I must tell them the 16% appeal rate is higher than normal and that is not reassuring.  It is something that should be highlighted, but I have not seen it highlighted.</p></speech>

The conditionality around disability or carer's allowance includes an extra layer of medical opinion.  Most of the claims we reject are based on a medical assessment and the person's general practitioner or consultant might say, for example, that John McKeon is incapable or unfit to perform full-time work of any type for the rest of his life.  Our medical assessor will look at the file and the condition and in some cases do an in-person examination before forming a different view.  In nearly all cases the person might have a consultant and against this would be the medical assessor.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. McKeon's openness and accountability in the general presentation but it seemed to desert him with the public services card matter.  It is just a comment.  We have already heard about the collateral undermining of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the comment should not have been made.  I have it in front of me and I have read it numerous times in different contexts.  Mr. McKeon should go back and read it.  The roll-out of the public services card is chapter 10 of the Report on the Account of the Public Services 2015.  Mr. McKeon quoted elements of good practice, which are in paragraph 10.18.  It states, "Elements of a good practice business case were included in several documents examined."  That is true.  The next sentence begins with a big "however".  It states, "However, there were a number of omissions or partially addressed matters."  There were five of them and we can start with the last of them.</p> <p>  They are "A single project initiation document (PID) was not prepared", "There was no plan setting out how and when the project's benefits would be measured, and who was responsible/accountable for their delivery", "Key dependencies were only partially assessed" and so on, "There was no initial assessment of DSP's capacity to deliver the project" and so on.  They are set out in very factual way.  I do not have time to read the conclusions but Mr. McKeon can go back on them to see why we have questions about value for money, even before we speak about privacy or other matters raised by the Data Protection Commission, which I will not get into.  The conclusions indicate that it was originally intended that 3 million public services cards would be produced by the end of 2013 but by the middle of 2016, two and a half years later, 2 million cards had been produced.  It was stated the Department expected to incur costs of up to &euro;60 million by the end of 2017, but what are the current costs?</p></speech>

I have already acknowledged that in retrospect, it would have been preferable to have a single business case document.  I agree with the points made in the 2016 document that the project had many of the elements of a business but not all of them.  I absolutely agree on that.  The Secretary General of the time indicated we would do an estimate of benefits, which have been done and produced for the committee.  In light of the concern expressed by the committee about value for money, although it is after the event it is still worthwhile doing a cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

For example, I quoted the number of cases on which we have found control savings, and they did not materialise on day one, two or three.  Many of them have materialised in the past year or two.  One of the reasons given at a previous meeting for the lack of a comprehensive benefits assessment was that this had to be allowed to happen so we could have the experience on which to do an assessment.  We are at the point now where it can be done.</p> <p>  Perhaps I can comment on what the Deputy said about the earlier exchange.</p><p>I acknowledge the point about the language of collateral damage and if we were to write the report again, which came to 470 pages, we would use different language.  It was not meant in the way it has been taken, which would be apparent if it was read in the context of the full report.  We were making the point about legality and transparency and we did not see the relevance of bringing the report into the debate at all.  We may have made this point clumsily.  Part of what was being suggested this morning was that the Department was being deliberately awkward in its response, but that is not the way this Department behaves.  We try to be as helpful as possible to people who are carrying out investigations.  I do not think it was fair to suggest that the Department was being obstructive or difficult.</p></speech>

I reread the report of the Data Protection Commissioner.  I acknowledge that Mr. McKeon has only been in the job for two years.  The issue of privacy, where a case is pending, is not a matter for discussion today but there are many other issues, such as function creep and no overall plan.  The commissioner states that the public services card project has many moving parts and that the complexity of logic and terminology attaching to that makes any analysis, legal or otherwise, challenging.  It was to start out as an enabler for services, which would have been great, but the card, as a physical piece of infrastructure, serves little purpose today.  There is an ongoing shifting of policy and direction relating to the public services card which has led to what the commissioner says is a fragmented and insufficient approach.  There are many and significant deficits in logic and consistency.  This project was rolled out at a cost of &euro;67 million with, according to what Mr. McKeon has said, savings of &euro;30 million, which we will look at in due course.  There is no business case, no review and proper analysis, so nobody could stand over that.</p></speech>

I would be happy to go into greater detail but I do not know if it would serve any purpose.  I disagree vehemently with a lot of it.  The policy in respect of the public services card was set out very clearly in 1998 and anyone who reads the legislation or the debates of that time, or about the changes made in 2004 or 2005, will see that the policy has not changed at all.  There has been no function creep.  If there is a legitimate criticism of the public services card programme, it is that it did not happen at the pace at which it was meant to happen.  There was non-delivery of mission, rather than mission creep, and this began to be addressed in 2011.  I was not involved at that time but I am happy to debate this with anybody.  Just because something is said does not make it true.</p> <p>  I have looked at the documentation relating to the business case.  There are specification plans, project plans and roll-out plans and the Comptroller and Auditor General has a list of the 17 or 19 cases.  There were gaps but I do not believe they were to the extent that is being suggested.</p></speech>

Employment progression outcomes for people who were unemployed for more than 12 months stood at 12% so we assume that 12% would have got into work in any event and we build that assumption into the pricing model.  We went further than that and increased the progression rate by 60% by basing prices on 16% of people getting into employment without help.  We are paying for everybody because it is very difficult to evaluate which person would have got in and which would not, but the prices were set based on an assumption that people would get employment.</p></speech>

In Mr. McKeon's statement he said a single business case document would have been preferable.  At a hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts just last September the Comptroller and Auditor General said that would be a fundamental requirement for something of this scale and nature.  In the document with which we have been furnished, Mr. McKeon has argued that 17 of the 19 elements were adhered to.  However the elements that were not covered are fairly substantial.  An assessment of organisational capacity to undertake a project and a benefits realisation plan are fairly big omissions.  More interestingly, five other elements were only partially covered.  Considering the two that were not adhered to and the five others which were only partially covered, it is fair to say that a lot was missing from the business plan.  Mr. McKeon has recognised that it was not thorough.  Would he still stand over what he has said was an adequate business plan, given that two elements were not complied with and five were partially adhered to?</p></speech>

I believe it to be true because I have looked at it myself.  Looking at the documentation I believe the project was coherently planned and managed.  I believe that we operated within the public spending code and got all the necessary approvals.  In that context, I am satisfied that the project was planned and authorisation was given for the money to be spent in the proper and correct way.  I do not think there is any question of that.  Of course we acknowledge that there are gaps.  One will always find gaps when looking retrospectively at any project of this scale.  It is easy to have 20/20 vision in hindsight and ask why this or that was not done.  This project evolved over a period of time from 1993.  It was an evolution of existing practice and it must be understood in that context.</p></speech>

Looking back, it would absolutely be preferable to have a single business case document, if for no other reason than the fact that it would be far easier for me to talk about it before this committee.

There was a project definition.  The project objectives and scope were outlined.  There was a stakeholder management plan.  The dependencies and procurement issues were planned.  The alternatives and consequences of not proceeding were evaluated.  Security and data protection were considered.  There was a timeline and a work plan.  Risks were assessed.  The staff resources required to support the project and the project costs were estimated.  Qualitative and quantitative benefits to the Department were estimated.  Qualitative and quantitative benefits to the customer were estimated.  The project structure and project roles were in place.  The project initiation document was in place.  The two items that were not in place were the benefits realisation plan and an assessment of organisational capacity.</p> <p>  An assessment of organisational capacity is inherent in a lot of other assessments, such as risk, procurement and staff resources.  It was not enumerated as a separate item.  I do not think that is a huge deficit, to be honest, though it should have been there.  Regarding the benefits realisation plan I note that the benefits were actually estimated, both in qualitative and quantitative terms.  Benefits realisation is about measuring the benefits consequent to the plan's implementation.</p><p>Again, it would be part of a best practice business case.  Was it absolutely detrimental to the project plan?  I do not think so.  I put my hands up in that regard.  On whether we would include them in a new plan, the answer is "Yes", but as to whether they were absolutely critical exclusions from the plans that were in place, the answer is "No".  It would have been better if they had been included, but they were not critical exclusions.</p></speech>

Is he saying there really is no point in including it in any business case at this stage?  Is he saying it really is a non-requirement because he regards it as better to evaluate the benefits after a period of time?</p></speech>

There was a benefits estimation in qualitative and quantitative terms and the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges the figure in paragraph 10.4.  My point was that in terms of the benefits realisation plan, it took time to realise the benefits.  It took several years to roll out the 3 million cards.  It takes time to realise benefits such as the capturing of data for administrative efficiencies, our not having to process second, third and fourth identity claims each time someone comes in and detecting fraud.  That was the point I was making.  Having an estimation of benefits actually achieved cannot be done, which is different from having an estimation of benefits which might be achieved, something which was done.</p></speech>

There are then the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner which the Department has chosen to ignore, having dismissed her rulings out of hand.  An assessment of organisational capacity to undertake the project was never carried out.  Now the Data Protection Commissioner says the Department is pretty much breaking the law by ignoring her rulings, while the general public thinks the Department made a pig's ear and complete hames of it from start to finish.  There are serious concerns which the Data Protection Commissioner has flagged time and again.  In hindsight, would it have been better for the Department to carry out an assessment of its capacity?  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is the agency with statutory power and the commissioner is telling the Department that it is in breach of the law which it is choosing to ignore.  It has got it all wrong.</p></speech>

We considered it very carefully and have invested time and effort in its consideration and obtaining the best advice we can from the Attorney General's office.  People should be clear that we did not dismiss the report out of hand.  It is not that we decided that we did not like the report and would object to it.  If we believed the report and its findings stood on their merits, we would have absolutely accepted them and I would be sitting here telling the committee that we accept them and that this is what we were going to do to deal with it.  However, it would be wrong to accept findings that we think are wrong.  There is no halo of infallibility on anyone, not on me, the Data Protection Commissioner or anyone else.  If we have learned anything from the financial crisis in the period from 2008 to 2012, it is that nobody is infallible, even a regulator.  We must respond to the best advice we receive.  The advice we have received from the Office of the Attorney General, the senior law officer in the State, is that what we are doing is perfectly in line with the law.  As Accounting Officer, I am not going to stop everything I do when the person whose job it is to advise the Government and me tells me that they are the senior law officer in the land and they say I am perfectly entitled to keep doing what I am doing and that we will deal with an enforcement notice should one arise.  That is where I am.  I am the Accounting Officer and I cannot do anything other than what I am doing.  We must be careful about the language used.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the public's feeling.  Our response to the Data Protection Commissioner, which we have since published, referred to customer satisfaction research on the public services card.  The evidence is overwhelming that there is public support for the card.  I know that there is media coverage, that there are activist groups and so on that say something different, but if the Deputy was to ask an ordinary person on the street, as we did in independent research, what he or she thought about the card, if he or she was happy with it and the services provided, if he or she felt it was sufficiently transparent, if he or she was satisfied that he or she understood why his or her data were retained, the answers would overwhelmingly be in the affirmative.</p></speech>

We are here at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I cannot talk for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am sure it sends information to the Department as part of its audit findings.  When it makes proposals and recommendations, it gives the Department a chance before they are published.  Is it the case that most people who do reports engage with the Department at some stage?  Maybe they are not obliged to engage with the Department.  Maybe it is a case of "here is the report".</p></speech>

As soon as the Data Protection Commission asked us for a paginated version in a readable format, we provided it.  I suppose I thought there was an inference in some of the questions asked during this morning's discussion that the Department was being deliberately obstructive.  That is not our form.  I think this committee would know that.  We were not being obstructive.</p></speech>

A number of weeks ago, I mentioned the fact that I did not have a public services card.  Ms McCrum nicely wrote to me and offered the services of the Department if I wanted to get one.  I wrote back to explain that a couple of weeks ago, I think, I arranged by appointment to go into the branch office in Portlaoise, and I received my public services card in the post the following Thursday, so it is a very efficient service.  I have not had a reason to use it yet but I acknowledge the efficiency within the Department and the courtesy of the staff.</p> <p>  I want to raise one issue with the card.  The witnesses will be aware of it as it comes up at our meetings quite a bit.  I refer to the free travel aspect of the use of the card.  There has been a lot of confusion among many committee members who are trying to understand how the free travel card works and who has details of it.  We asked the National Transport Authority, representatives of which were before the committee a few weeks ago.  They said the matter was the Department's affair and that it needs to answer.  We have had issues with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regarding a particular case I highlighted in which a person received a bill for use of a free travel card where the card had been cancelled some months earlier.  The person should not have been using it.  I have been very clear on this.  That was not the issue I was talking about.  I was just curious about the use of the free travel card and how it is known what travel has been taken on it.</p> <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has a system in place called a fixed penalty notice.  Most of us would not be expert on this, but the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann representatives said this was available, but seemingly it has a separate process.  It can issue a bill, which is a civil matter separate from the fixed notice.  I am giving Irish Rail - or Iarn&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as it is - the benefit of the doubt.  In some cases it issued a specific bill to a specific person for the use of the card and based it on actual travel or journeys used.  I would never have contemplated that it would issue a bill for an exact figure without having details of it.  I was being generous in assuming it had the details but it told me the statement I made was untrue.  This is not a matter for the witnesses before us; it is background.  What is clear is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has issued a bill to a person on the basis of a four-month period elapsing, whether or not it knows whether the card was ever used or how many times.  It has issued a bill just on the basis of time.  I find that even more disturbing than issuing a bill based on actual travel.  We have asked for clarification on that from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We will come back to the matter.  We were told recently in respect of the travel operator - in recent weeks we have had a couple of meetings at which this has come up - that when the card is used there is a number on it that the Department has such that it knows the trips that are taken on the card when it goes in and out through the machine on the platform, but it does not know who the person is.</p><p>This is the reference number the travel operator has and the Department can then match it to the individual.  The Department has details of the persons travelling through the public services card.  We will take it step by step.</p></speech>

In the particular case, it appears as if four months elapsed from the time the free travel was cancelled to the time CI&Eacute; was notified.  Irish Rail, in its letter back to the committee, said that sometimes the misuse of a public services card means someone travels for months or years without paying for a journey after his or her free travel entitlements are withdrawn.  That tells me the Department does not have a systematic method of telling CI&Eacute;.  CI&Eacute; has written to the committee to tell us that this happened for months in the particular case about which we are talking and we are not identifying the person involved.  CI&Eacute; states that this sort of thing can go on for years without it being informed by the Department.</p></speech>

I have two or three questions on the public services card and JobPath.  Mr. McKeon might have answered some earlier but I will ask specific questions I have.</p><p>In a previous response, Mr. McKeon said that there is no halo of infallibility around anybody.  We can accept that, whether we are talking about Mr. McKeon, the Data Protection Commissioner, me or the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is a serious issue.  Our job is to probe reports which are prepared by statutory bodies.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General produces a report, it is our job to put questions to the Accounting Officer who is subject to that report.  In this case, we have had a report from the Data Protection Commission, which is also a statutory body.  Reference was made to high-level findings.  The Data Protection Commissioner sets out three high-level findings in the first few pages of her report.  Mr. McKeon says that he does not agree with those findings on a point of law, which is fine and that is his right.  The difficulty that we have is that either the Department is right or the Data Protection Commission is wrong.  If the Data Protection Commissioner is wrong on three very high-level findings then, given that we are talking here about a statutory body whose job it is to protect and safeguard peoples' information and data and ensure it is used in an appropriate way, one way or the other we have a serious problem.  It is not a question of a nuanced difference; it is fundamental.  It is now being disputed on a point of law.  I assume there will be an enforcement order that will be in line with the letter cited by Mr. McKeon.  I imagine it will be appealed and ultimately, it will be dealt with in court.  One way or the other, for us as Oireachtas Members, there will be profound fallout from this.  This will have profound implications because somebody is wrong.  We will have to wait and see which party is wrong.  </p><p> There is one other issue with the public services card, which is important.  We dealt with this with the Comptroller and Auditor General when the Data Protection Commissioner appeared before us.  When the contract was first negotiated, it was on the basis of 3 million cards.  Is that right?</p></speech>

The background to this is that we set up the contract and then the economic crisis happened.  The Department went off doing other things in response to the economic crisis.  We had a provider in Bray who was employing 60 staff and who had set up to deliver this card but we were not giving it orders for cards.  I can get the details for the Deputy and am happy to send them to him but as I understand it, we agreed an increased price for about 200,000 or 300,000 cards that were delivered to begin with in order to tide the provider over.  We then agreed-----</p></speech>

Mr. McKeon mentioned that around 1% of all cases are appealed.  I ask him to send a note on how many refusals are appealed.  I presume that most people who apply for a payment and get that payment do not appeal.  The only figure that is relevant in terms of judging the numbers that will appeal is the figure for refusals.  Perhaps Mr. McKeon knows the global figure for the number of refusals.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. McKeon to send us a note on that so that we can have it on our records, rather than just approximate figures off the top of the head.  There is not a Deputy in this House who does not know of cases where further information is supplied to the appeals office that might not have been supplied to the Department at an earlier date.  This is often due to the passage of time because several months have elapsed in the process and there might be new letters from medical consultants that can influence the outcome and so on.  One of the contributory factors is the length of time it takes to process cases.  Sometimes people do not provide enough information on the first day but they get it together for the appeals office.  We understand that.</p><p> The second question that is not answered, and I have had several queries on it, relates to the fact that the qualified adult allowance is not mentioned anywhere in the context of the State contributory pension.  It is not listed in the scheme.  Will Mr. McKeon send us an note on that for information?  There is an assumption, and I know it is not correct, that if a person in the house is on the contributory pension, the spouse applies for the qualified adult allowance.  If he has the pension &ndash; I just put it that way as "him" &ndash; she should get the qualified adult allowance.  I know the answer is that it is means tested but I want to get that officially so that people will see it.  How many of those who apply for the qualified adult allowance do not get it because their income is above the limit?  People are shocked because they thought it was automatic and I have met many who were not aware that it is means tested.    What other payments that can be attached to a contributory payment are allowances?  Is the qualified adults allowance the only one?</p></speech>

If I am picking it up and Ms Stack tells me they have done work on it, there might be a connection.  Some people do not get it from the beginning because maybe the Department is more exact now in its assessments, knowing that it is a high-risk allowance.  That is as it should be, I am not suggesting otherwise.</p> <p>  I have met people who, having got the non-contributory pension at 65, let us say it is &euro;230 or whatever, and being very frugal old people living alone, do not spend it, and it then accumulates in the bank.  Years afterwards they are assessed again for some reason and are stunned when their pensions are cut because they might have thousands of euro in the bank.  I know the State pension is the maximum pension, although most people think it is the basic pension and are surprised that it is cut because they did not spend it as they got it.</p></speech>

He or she was too frugal and got caught out.</p> <p>  Mr. McKeon spoke about dental benefit and optical benefit in the context of the online applications.  That is largely because it is done through the dentist or the opticians, Specsavers or whatever.  I can easily see why there is a high percentage of applications for those schemes but he acknowledged that the Department has been behind the curve in getting online.  In another situation that we have dealt with, passports, we know that most people in the country have a passport now.  There might have been a feeling that people getting payments may not have been the most IT literate group or, if they are older, may not have access to IT.  However, they are able to manage passport applications.</p> <p>  The Department needs to take a lead from the other Departments that have moved on, dealing with the same population as Mr. McKeon deals with and have got a massive take up online.  The same is true for the Revenue Commissioners, I know many may not be on the Revenue online service but massive numbers are.  The other example is car tax.  There was a time we had to go in and pay cash at the counter every quarter or six months, now well over 80% of people do it online.  Many of them are in receipt of payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and are able to manage that some way.  I encourage the Department to do that and it will be a major cost saving.</p></speech>

Revenue and the Departments issuing driving licences, passports and so on are delivering the services through the portal we developed.  We did the IT development and they provide their services.  What is somewhat different about our service is that people are asking us to give them money so the standard of authentication in terms of identity and so on is a bit higher for us.</p></speech>

We will now be rolling out online, we have dipped our toe in the water and have had some good take up on some schemes.  Although the treatment benefit, which the Chairman instanced, is done through the dentists and opticians, it is a good example of what can be achieved within the organisation.  We want to do that with doctors and illness benefit claims.  We get 10,000 illness benefit claims each day.  If we could get those online it would have huge benefits for us.</p></speech>

People have to prove residency or that they are back in Ireland, whatever the case may be.  Will Mr. McKeon give a global breakdown, insofar as he can, of the reasons claims are rejected.  How many are rejected based on means?  How many are rejected based on the lack of contributions or other factors?  These three issues are cited in the recommendations made in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Mr. McKeon has given the main reasons.  He might give us a breakdown.

Now that I am mentioning benefits and PRSI contributions, what is the current position on the people, the majority of whom were women, who left work for family reasons and had their PRSI records re-examined for family leave to determine whether they could receive the higher pension payment?  How close is the Department to ending that process?</p></speech>

There are 70 cases in which we are still trying to work with the people concerned.  We were able to make automatic decisions for quite a number of people.  People on whom we had no information were in a different category.  There were those who, based on the new model we had developed, did not receive an increase when their cases were processed automatically.  We wrote to them and asked whether they had any childcare or other caring duties and to come back to us.  All have come back, except 70.  We just need to keep chasing them.  There will always be a very small tail.</p></speech>

It is not just for me but for the committee to be outlined when it receive it next week or whenever else.  It is good that the Department is near the end of the process.</p> <p>  One thing that has not been mentioned at all today, surprisingly, is the appropriation account for Vote 37.  Page 6 includes a big chunk about non-compliance with procurement rules.  It is included in the statement on internal controls.  Mr. McKeon made no reference to it and, surprisingly, the Comptroller and Auditor General did not refer to it this morning either as he normally does.  The committee is now concentrating on the number of Departments and public bodies that are not complying with public procurement rules.  For the viewers watching, will Mr. McKeon explain the statement made in the second paragraph of page 6 that "the Department has reported in the 40/02 return to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General fourteen contracts to the value of &euro;2,037,029 that were not subject to a competitive procurement process, of which five contracts with a value of &euro;590,320 are non-compliant".  Details of the five contracts are listed.  Will Mr. McKeon explain to the public the difference between a contract that is not subject to competitive procurement and the five contracts that are non-compliant?</p></speech>

Mr. McKeon will send us the information.  There is a lot of information to come, but the Department will have all of it.</p> <p>  Again on the Vote, paragraph A.33 on page 28 refers to the school meals scheme.  The Estimate for school meals provided by the Oireachtas was &euro;54 million, but the outturn was &euro;49 million.  The Oireachtas provided &euro;54 million for school meals, which provision is essential.  There is a row in most constituencies over the scheme not being extended to more schools.  Be that as it may, we find that there was under-expenditure of &euro;5 million.  It is stated some new schools were slow in submitting their applications.  I am thinking of the children who should have received school meals.  If somebody somewhere had their administrative side of the house right and got forms in and processed, it would have occurred.  I read it as &euro;5 million provided by the Oireachtas for school meals not being paid out because somebody did not get the paperwork in on time.  Will Mr. McKeon talk to me about this?  What is the Department doing to make sure it will not happen?  Other than writing the cheque and paying the money, the Department should have a slightly proactive approach to make sure that where there is such an important scheme in place, there is an uptake of 100% and a waiting list-----</p></speech>

I am back to my basic question.  A total of &euro;5 million provided by the Oireachtas for school meals for kids who deserve it but, in 2018, they did not get it because a provider, a tender or forms were not in on time.  We owe it to them to get that right.  How is the scheme looking for this year?  Can the Secretary General give me an update on where we are?</p></speech>

I know this is not the top priority for some others while other principals would kill to get every extra penny for their kids.  I would hate to think that some schools have students in a sports or art competition and the attitude is to deal with it after Christmas.   It should be a priority for school principals to make sure that they get school meals for kids where the money has been provided.  Please give us an updated note on that and we can take it from there.  It is disappointing that the funds have not been fully drawn down.</p> <p>  On the Social Insurance Fund, the total outstanding balance for social insurance redundancy is &euro;331 million; insolvency is &euro;900 million so &euro;431 million is outstanding.  I acknowledge Mr. McKeon said that a lot of it is not collectable as the companies are not there, which we understand.  That compares with an approximate equivalent number of debts due to the Department for various. </p></speech>

It has come down from approximately 13.5 days three or four years ago to approximately 11.5 days now.  A couple of things are different about our Department compared to others, which I mentioned the last time.  We have a lot of front-line staff and that creates its own issues.  Our staff generally have an older age profile than other Departments.  A total of 94% or 95% of all sick leave in our Department is certified by a medical practitioner.  The average is 90% in the Civil Service.  We tend to have more longer duration cases and it is related to the age profile of staff.  The figure now is approximately 700 people over 60.  We have 100 people under 30 and more than half of our staff are aged over 55 years.  They are the kind of metrics.  The people who get ill in that age category, in my experience, they have genuine long-term illnesses.  I have experienced throughout my career.  We have 80 cases of very long-term illness that account for a quarter of all of our sick leave.  They are people with very profound and serious illnesses.  We look after them, and I do not apologise for that, but that is the difference.</p></speech>

This is relevant to our earlier discussion on write-offs.  I asked for details on the outstanding customer debts.  I only asked for the large figures, over &euro;10,000, by scheme area at the end of August 2019.  I asked for the number of cases where payment plans were in place and the number of cases where no repayment plan was in place.  According to the schedule in the reply, there are 5,638 cases where a repayment plan is in place and the value of the debt for which the repayment plan is in place is &euro;156 million, and no repayment plans are in place for 6,075 cases and the figure is &euro;171 million.  In those cases, for all the schemes, the majority have no payment plan in place.  </p> <p>  I then sought details on the outstanding customer debts with a value outstanding of, again, over &euro;10,000.  I did not want to a lot of paper so I just kept to that limit, and asked for an age analysis.  According to the chart, in terms of repaying and not repaying, the figure adds up to &euro;327,000.  They are the same figures with these now broken down by an age analysis rather than scheme.  The first half of the reply was by scheme and the latter half was by aged analysis.  The Department has a case from 1984, where a person owes &euro;119,000 and the person is repaying, and two cases of debts, totalling &euro;28,000, where there is no repayment plan in place, going back to 1984.</p> <p>  I estimate that between 1984 and 1989 the Department is owned &euro;1.5 million by 100 people.  That is a long time owed.  Between 1990 and 1999 there is &euro;16 million owed in respect of approximately 600 cases.  Between 2000 and 2009, there is approximately 1,900 cases amounting to &euro;77 million.  How do those figures tally with what Mr. McKeon told us about the pre-2010 payments that were written off?</p></speech>

Where they do not have the information, they are able to get their hands on the information and send it on to us, which we appreciate.  It helps us.  It also helps the public have a bit of confidence in what is happening in the system when they see hard questions being asked and good answers being given.  That is good for everybody.  There are other Departments I cannot say that about.</p> <p>  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for being present.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I request that the clerk to the committee to seek any follow-up information and carry out actions that we have requested.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karlin Lillington" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#B00200"><p>I have been a technology journalist and columnist for more than 20 years, primarily with <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I am grateful to the committee for this opportunity to offer my perspective on these issues.<br/><br/>The existing business model of social media and search platforms, which is based on extracting and monetising as much personal data as possible from users while encouraging them to engage addictively with and return to the platforms, is a foundation for the serious problems we are discussing today.  It is a vicious but highly lucrative circle in which clickbait material of hate, outrage, conspiracy and tribalism proves the most engaging, while the micro targeting of ads and content means only a select receptive audience may ever see material that becomes impossible to refute.<br/><br/>Too often, policy discussions focus on the risks posed by social media in established democracies, but the most vulnerable victims are, ironically, those who fight most courageously on behalf of democracy, namely, human rights defenders.  For them, online threats can swiftly descend into violence, arrest, torture or death.  Activists do not wish to leave the platforms because, despite their serious flaws, they are a major tool of democracy.  They allow anonymity, communicate helpful information or help spread irrefutable evidence, and offer easy-to-use encrypted messaging.  Many of the proposed solutions and interventions to social media problems, such as the banning of online anonymity or account registrations being tied to formal identity, only exacerbate the problems.  If we better understood and more adequately addressed the serious risks and harms to human rights activists, we could better resolve the problems for all of us because studies indicate human rights activists are the outriders for these dangers.<br/><br/>In 2017, Front Line Defenders, an Irish-based international human rights NGO, analysed data on the murders of 312 activists.  In 84% of these cases, the activists had received threats, often made online.  As the organisation noted, the world's worst regimes know well that attacking the legitimacy and credibility of human rights defenders softens the ground and lessens the reaction when they are arrested, imprisoned or murdered.  Women activists are regularly the recipient of some of the most loathsome and sexually explicit threats.  In a survey of eight countries carried out last year, Amnesty International found that more than 40% of women who had been abused online feared for their physical safety and 24% feared for their family's safety because online mobs often issue graphic threats against their children.<br/><br/>Facebook has been particularly implicated in human rights reports, ignoring anti-democratic campaigns on the site and inexplicably viewing despots as opportunities to extend platform reach.  For example, in the Philippines, Facebook eagerly helped the Duterte campaign learn more about social media use and considered him to be, in its own words, a king of social media engagement, even though his vigilante drug squads were already well-known for carrying out summary executions.  The UN harshly criticised the company for its failure for many years to shut down co-ordinated threats that scaled into violence in Myanmar.  One Myanmar legislator concluded that Facebook had been dangerous and harmful to the country's democratic transition.  Avaaz, a human rights organisation, recently condemned the company for similarly failing to curtail violent threats to vulnerable minorities in Assam.  Similar difficulties arise with Twitter, YouTube and any other platform that can carry a message, photo or video.<br/><br/>Human rights organisations have stated that platforms regularly back down in the face of government requests to remove posts by or accounts of journalists, activists and organisations.  Acceding to a request of the Indian Government, Twitter recently took down 1 million tweets relating to Kashmir.  Activists have been deplatformed in Vietnam.  Algorithms that encourage and promote engagement also enable co-ordinated hate and disinformation campaigns such as a fake accounts broadcast propaganda campaign in Sudan to commend military generals who massacred demonstrators last summer.<br/><br/>The platforms need key reforms that will protect pro-democracy activists and start to remedy abuses elsewhere.  They should work more extensively with trusted regional and local NGOs to better understand the context of government requests for content and account takedowns.  They need to be more aware of and vigorous in assessing possible future harm and interference caused by their actions and promotional programmes.  Governments and regulators should foreground risks to activists as they consider ways to manage online problems.  Too many proposals undermine grassroots movements toward democracy and are as much a threat to democracy as the online harm they hope to combat.  States and regulators will not address these broad problems unless they terminate the core surveillance capital business model of platforms and reduce their operational size to a level such that platforms can begin to manage and fix these problems.</p></speech>

I represent Brave, a private web browser.  Our CEO, Brendan Eich, invented JavaScript and co-founded Firefox.  Since those early days, as all members are aware, the web has become grimy.  Millions of people use Brave to make the web safe, fast and private.  The problem of disinformation arises because of what happens every time one loads a web page.  As the page loads, a broadcast of information about the user is sent to tens or hundreds of companies.This is intended to allow technology companies that represent advertisers to compete for the opportunity to show the user an ad.  That sounds fine, but the broadcast data includes an inference of the user's sexual orientation, political views, religion, and any health issues from which he or she may suffer.  It generally includes the precise thing the user is watching, listening to or reading at that moment, as well as where he or she is located.  These data are bundled with identification codes for the user that are as specific to the user as his or her social security number.  All the data I described can be put into a dossier about the user, whatever age he or she may be.  This is a description of the multibillion dollar real-time bidding, RTB, industry.  The broadcasts occur hundreds of billions of times per day.  My written submission contains plenty of footnotes with evidence for this.  This relates to perfect information from micro-targeted disinformation.  I should say that I did not set a timer, but I will not filibuster.<br/><br/>It is almost certain that every voter in every election has been profiled based on almost everything they watch, read and listen to online.  That is problem number one.  The second problem is that the real-time bidding industry, which involves advertising, is a cancer eating at the heart of legitimate media.  That works in at least two ways.  If a person visits the website of <i>The Irish Times</i>, for which I used to work and for which Dr. Lillington currently works, and reads about a luxury car, and then later in the day that person goes to a less reputable website, it is very likely he or she will be targeted with an ad for a luxury car because the companies that received the information profiling that person as a high-value <i>Irish Times </i>reader interested in cars can now, at a significant discount, show him or her the ad on the poor quality website.<br/><br/>That happens even if one is not human.  What about an ad for a bot?  Not only does audience arbitrage, as it is referred to in the industry, commodify a worthy publisher with a unique audience, it also allows a criminal to operate fake people who pretend to view and click on ads.  This diverts an estimated $5.8 billion to $42 billion per year from worthy publishers out of the wallets of real advertisers and into the pockets of criminals.</p><p> There is a glimmer of light, though.  I admit that it comes from my company.  We have been pioneering a new system of private ads that are opt-in.  The engagement rate has been sky high over the past six months.  We are proving that privacy can be good business.</p><p> We at Brave urge the grand committee's distinguished members to take a single specific action, that being, to pressure with their intergovernmental weight the two entities that control this global system.  The first is called the Interactive Advertising Bureau, IAB.  Its largest members are Facebook and Google and it controls the rules about how real-time bidding, RTB, works and what can be in a broadcast.  The second is Google itself, which has its own proprietary version.  We have given detailed evidence to 16 regulators through colleagues across Europe and we have seen investigations triggered under GDPR into both entities.  This is good.  Twelve months later, though, we are still awaiting enforcement.</p><p> If there is one thing we can leave the grand committee with, it is a plea to stop the business model of the bottom of the web and starve the data brokers who enable micro-targeted disinformation.  There is an easy way to do that.</p></speech>

I will reinforce everything that Dr. Ryan said.  Everyone should think of that as the fundamental backdrop to what I am saying.</p> <p>  In the US and other countries, the institutions of liberal democracy are losing their ability to serve the needs of constituents.  Many factors contribute to this.  Historically reduced funding has been a major one, but, increasingly, the dominant role of technology in society is undermining the ability of liberal democracies to operate.  Internet platforms have exploited the weaknesses of democratic institutions and accelerated their weakening.  Platforms have positioned themselves to replace democratic institutions with initiatives such as Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs waterfront project in Toronto, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency, Amazon's efforts in law enforcement and Microsoft's services for governments.  The success of Internet platforms has produced harm to public health, democracy, privacy and competition on a global basis.  The driver of that is the algorithmic amplification of hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories as well as micro-targeted advertising based on massive surveillance.  Similar to the chemicals industry of the 1950s and 1960s, Internet platform profits are inflated because the industry does not pay the cost of the harm it causes.  This is important.  As Professor Shoshana Zuboff has noted, Internet platforms are gradually displacing democracy and consumer choice with algorithmic processes.</p> <p>  To protect competition, governments have an existing anti-trust toolkit.  To protect public health, democracy and privacy, however, they need new tools.  They need to constrain the business model of surveillance capitalism.  The best way to do this is to declare that personal data are a human right, not an asset.  This would limit business models to first party intended uses of data.  There would be no third party commerce or use of private data, no predictive models based on personal data, no web tracking and no corporate surveillance.  In this, I would like to go beyond the Brave solution.</p> <p>  Internet platforms behave as though governments lack the tools and political support necessary for meaningful regulation.  Our challenge is to prove them wrong.  We have to be prepared to shut them down for periods of time when they misbehave, given that they are clearly defying democratic governments and will persist in doing so until there is an incentive to change.  I have spent 34 years as a technology investor.  At one time, I was a mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.  I cannot be absolutely certain that I am right, but I am very confident that I am not wrong.  I thank the grand committee for its time.</p></speech>

I will focus my comments on electoral interference and large-scale disinformation operations because these are what I study on a regular basis.</p> <p>  This is a vast and fast-moving problem set.  According to the Oxford Internet Institute, 70 countries are now reported to be running organised social media information operations, up from 48 last year.  We do not have enough data to prove whether this stems from a rise in operations, a rise in reporting or both.  Either way, it indicates a global phenomenon.  Most of these operations are aimed at domestic audiences, but we must remember that the Russian operation that targeted the US from 2014 onwards also started out by targeting the domestic opposition.</p> <p>  The evidence suggests that a state that has the capability to run domestic information operations can quickly pivot to external targets if the political need is there.  Russia did so in 2014.  Saudi Arabia did so after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  China did so when the Hong Kong protests began.  Nor is this limited to state actors.  We saw the far right in Britain and America trying to interfere in the French presidential election in 2017.  These operations do not solely play out on social media platforms.  They also include websites and television stations.  They can include on-the-ground events and local activists, some of whom are unaware of the role they are playing.</p> <p>  All of these problems are underpinned by a perception that online information operations are easy, cheap, effective and profitable.  Since 2016, the narrative has emerged that Russia managed to tip the balance in the US election by running social media trolls.  That narrative is significantly flawed, but it has caught on.</p> <p>  Unscrupulous marketing companies around the world are promising to "change reality" for their political clients through social media campaigns.  Fake amplification on social media is very cheap.  One can buy a three year old YouTube channel with videos already uploaded for just $1.  Domestic actors on both sides in the US have experimented with Russia&rsquo;s playbook.</p> <p>  However, we also know that the environment in 2019 is much less permissive than it was in 2016.  The platforms, law enforcement and open source researchers are all actively hunting influence operations online.  The rate of takedowns has accelerated dramatically since early 2018.  Over the past 12 months, we have seen more than 50 takedowns just from Facebook, covering operations from some two dozen countries.  That has forced interference operations to sacrifice engagement to stay concealed.</p> <p>  In this environment, I bring four urgent needs to the committee's attention.  These are not the only four, but they are the areas where parliamentary work can have most immediate impact.  First and of most direct relevance to elections, parliaments and political campaigns must urgently improve their own cybersecurity to prevent the sort of hack-and-leak operations that Russia used to such devastating effect in 2016.  This is not a duty that can be passed on to the social media platforms.  Every parliament and every campaign should ensure that all its staff have cyber training and contingency plans in place.  This is expensive and many campaigns will argue that the money would be better spent on ads, but it is much less costly than seeing their emails leaked to the press a week before the election.</p> <p>  Second, we do not yet have a deterrence system in place.  We have seen individual nations react to interference attempts, but we do not have a credible system for imposing unacceptable costs on foreign actors who attempt to interfere in elections.</p> <p>  Third, we need legislation that imposes systematic costs on the commercial operators who sell fake accounts or hire out their interference campaigns.  Two weeks ago, we saw the first case of the Federal Trade Commission fining a US company for selling fake engagement.  Social media companies can, and do, ban such operators from their platforms, but they cannot impose a direct financial cost.  The black market in fake accounts is the easiest place for hostile actors to buy their assets, as China demonstrated over the Hong Kong protests.</p> <p>  Fourth, parliaments should lead discussions on how to reduce polarisation online, both through regulation and through education.  This is a long-term challenge, but we should always remember that if we did not have domestic trolls, the foreign trolls would not have anyone to pretend to be.  Such discussions will require technical analyses of how the platforms' algorithms suggest friends and content for users, but they will also require social analysis of how users select their online identities and tribes and how they can be encouraged to broaden them.  Every human has a complex pyramid of identities in real life, but the dynamics of social media often reduce that to one-dimensional tribalism.  If our parliaments can work across party lines and lead the debate on how to reverse the spiral of ever narrower partisan groups online, that would mark a step towards reducing the scope for online polarisation and online interference.</p></speech>

When I accepted the invitation, I thought that its British MP members would be in attendance.</p><p>The fact they are not here today because Parliament was suspended two days ago in preparation for a general election is profoundly disquieting on many levels.  The UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, DCMS, has painstakingly detailed the risks to our elections, and yet the Government called this election having done absolutely nothing to address them.  It has failed to undertake any of the committee's recommendations, which is a gross dereliction of its duty to protect the British public.<br/><br/>Nobody can be in any doubt about the risks to our democracy that are posed by these Silicon Valley tech platforms.  I have spent three years investigating these risks and we now know many facts.  We know the Brexit vote was fraudulently and illegitimately conducted.  We know the tech platforms, particularly Facebook, facilitated multiple campaigns to break the law.  We know the authorities have entirely failed to hold these perpetrators to account.  We know that Britain is set to leave the European Union on the basis of this fraudulent and illegitimate vote.  The failure to reckon with these crimes has led to a situation where the man who led one of these campaigns, Vote Leave, which carried out the single biggest electoral fraud in my country for more than a century, is now the Prime Minister, and the man who masterminded this scheme is his chief adviser.  This is not a situation that should exist in any well-functioning democracy.  Britain is now a warning to the rest of the world because what happened in our country could happen in this country too.  The vast unchecked power of the Silicon Valley technology companies represents a truly global risk, and it is not even clear that democracy will survive them.<br/><br/>It is absurd that I am here today but another invited witness, Mark Zuckerberg, is not.  The contempt he has shown to the nations represented here is extraordinary.  We are in a truly staggering situation where a single company plays an absolutely central and pivotal role in elections in almost every single country across the world, yet it is answerable to none of them.  This cannot and should not go on.  I urge Congressman Cicilline to invite the committee to Congress for its next hearing.  Mark Zuckerberg needs to be subpoenaed by this committee.  He needs to answer proper, rigorous and informed questions.  I believe Mark Zuckerberg has deliberately misled Congress.  Two weeks ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Mark Zuckerberg when he and Sheryl Sandberg learned about Cambridge Analytica.  He said he could not remember but he thought it was in March last year.  This simply does not bear scrutiny.<br/><br/>The entire story that Facebook has told about Cambridge Analytica, including who knew what and when, is crumbling.  Throughout 2017, I and other journalists were writing about the company and we now know, thanks to the SEC report, that Facebook had being lying to reporters, including me.  That, essentially, means it was lying to shareholders.  We know that Facebook employees knew about Cambridge Analytica abusing Facebook data before even the very first report by Harry Fox Davis in <i>The Guardian</i>, again thanks to the SEC report.  Mark Zuckerberg claims to have known nothing until March last year.  This defies belief.  Yesterday, we learned that the California Attorney General had tried to subpoena emails between Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg that would clarify all of this, but Facebook has repeatedly refused to hand them over.  One has to ask why and what exactly it is that Facebook is trying to hide.<br/><br/>Facebook cannot be trusted to run the world's elections.  No company can.  I hope the company moves towards a total ban on micro-targeted political advertisements and that it seeks to obtain the forensic evidence of what actually happened on Facebook's platform in 2016 in the US election and the EU referendum.  This information cannot remain the private property of a private company.</p></speech>

The recommendations have come from the Electoral Commission, from the DCMS committee and from the Information Commissioner's Office, ICO.  There is a whole suite of recommendations that say our electoral laws do not work, are completely inadequate, are not fit for purpose, and are placing our elections at risk, and the Government has failed to act upon any of them.  That is why calling an election in these circumstances is so particularly troubling.</p></speech>

There have been these very strong recommendations from bodies, such as the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, IPA, on a total moratorium on micro-targeted political advertisements.  At the moment, we know these elections are not safe, and that has been documented.  Until the platforms can prove they are safe and prove they will stay within the confines of the law, I think it is perfectly reasonable to have a pause, for which the Information Commissioner in Britain has asked, or a moratorium to give a chance to assess and to gather in the expert evidence, and see if the current situation is beneficial to our respective democracies.</p></speech>

My first question is to Mr. Ben Nimmo.  I admire his dedication and his previous work in the Atlantic Council's DFRLab.  I echo Mr. Nimmo's comment that disinformation operations are not some sort of innocent, so-called meddling.  Rather, they are blatant attacks against the core of democratic states.  In Russia, as we know, they are part of the military doctrine.  They are used as weaponry tools, and should be treated as such.  Hence, a proper co-ordinated international response is definitely needed.  It is something we have been missing thus far.</p> <p>  There have been recent examples of how Russia-backed influence networks and the manipulation techniques were used in Africa.  They did not use faked profiles created in the St. Petersburg troll factory on that occasion: they hired locals.  They basically bought their locals' profiles.  I ask Mr. Nimmo to comment on whether this is something we can expect in upcoming big elections and to elaborate on the next things we should be waiting for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ben Nimmo" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#E00600"><p>I thank Ms Pentus-Rosimannus for the question.  I would nuance the African finding slightly.  There was a combination of fake profiles and genuine profiles and they were using some genuine people on the ground.  It also looked like they had bought accounts from people.  One of the problem sets here is the black market in recycled accounts.  Something that we have seen consistently over the last three or four years is information operations taking more steps to try to hide because they are being hunted more.  The latest take-down of probable Internet research agency accounts was announced approximately one week before the African announcement.  They were going to extraordinary lengths to try to hide their traces.  Mostly, they were copy-pasting genuine American comments.  This means that one has to be looking for signals that are not content based because the content is all coming from somewhere else.  It also means that they are getting much less engagement because if all they are doing is parroting somebody else's words then they do not have their own voice.  </p> <p>  I think what we will see is more attempts to masquerade as other people.  We have already seen many attempts to co-opt local activist groups.  Part of the challenge is going to be communicating with activist groups ahead of the elections and teaching the broader electorate the type of cautionary steps they need to take before engaging with somebody else's Facebook group, which is asking them to take action on the ground.  We need to teach them how to verify who is behind that.  There are basic steps that one does in real life that people seem to forget online.  Much of this is about teaching normal users the same wariness online that they would have in real life.</p></speech>

On the deepfakes and synthetic reality, one can find the source when it comes to ordinary fake news, but it is so much more difficult when it is about the deepfakes.  What developments are happening in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1350" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ben Nimmo" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#E00800"><p>In the long term, deepfakes have the potential to be a problem but they will be the greatest problem in communities which are predisposed to believe them anyway.  Those communities will be predisposed to believe cheap fakes as well.  The simplest way of faking is to repurpose a video from some other time and place and say that this is happening right now.  That kind of content still goes viral.  In the long term, deepfakes are a challenge but they are secondary to the problem of emotional engagement and the virality which is driven by outrage.  If we start looking at outrage-driven virality, then we will have a good chance of dealing with the deepfakes fake problem at the same time.</p></speech>

Once upon a time, he or she would done this in a shed in the bank of his or her garden but now we have a business model that allows this to become a viable business. Instead of it being a single crank, there is an incentive to host and operate whatever content, including deepfakes.  My suggestion, in addition to everything we have already heard, is a focus on undermining the business model, the source of data and the source of cash.</p></speech>

The problem could be with young people, teen suicide or bullying or, perhaps, elections and democracy or privacy.  All of those problems derive from the underlying business model.  It is a business model based on capturing and maintaining attention.  Please do not be distracted by what in the United States we call First Amendment issues or free speech issues.  Algorithmic amplification is a business choice.  It is completely independent of speech.  One can put all voices onto social networks without harm.  Where the harm comes in is that the amplification looks to the most basic elements of evolutionary psychology, specifically , flight or fight.  That is why outrage is so effective.  The problem with outrage is that it is politically asymmetric.  One does not see outrage being equally effective across the entire political spectrum and so it has resulted in a uniform shift to the far right globally.  My observation is around how to stop this stuff happening.</p><p>It is very important to go after both algorithmic amplification and micro targeting because they together are what create the problem.  The great, unique opportunity of the committee is that it is the only place where we convene people and bring together all the different experiences.  It gives the opportunity for the political will to migrate to the root causes.  I truly hope the committee will flourish and that we can do everything in our power to support it.</p></speech>

A foreign company played a central role in all of the representatives' elections and is unaccountable to any of their parliaments.  It is wrong to consider it in any way a political issue.  In the context of the national security of countries, this foreign company is playing an absolutely pivotal role.  Politicians have no idea what role it plays in their elections and it is beyond the reach of any of their laws.  That is completely unacceptable and profoundly worrying.</p> <p>  Politicians have the power.  All of us are helpless and powerless in the face of such massive companies but politicians have come together, as a collective body of 12 parliaments, and have the ability to make a stand and say it is unacceptable, which I hope they do.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. McNamee.  Most online information is provided by consumers.  Are people aware of the web data collection process?  Do customers have a clear understanding of how data provided by them could be used in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roger McNamee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#F00600"><p>There is a grave misunderstanding of the data sets involved.  My estimate, which is by no means precise, is that less than 1% of the data that Google and Facebook have are the data contributed voluntarily by consumers.  The vast majority are acquired in the third party marketplace, either by tracking people online or by acquiring bank statements, credit cards, location from mobile vendors or purchase history from various companies and products.  The core issue is that the surveillance takes place largely outside the awareness of people and without their direct participation.  In the case of credit card processing companies, for example, which sell their customers' information, no consumer has a direct relationship with any of the companies or has any control over them.</p> <p>  One of the challenges is making people aware that the data being given up are not used to improve their experience, except to a small degree.  Most of the data are used in a way that has social impact.  In Myanmar, one would not have needed to be on Facebook to be dead but just to be a Rohingya, while in Christchurch, one did not need to be on Facebook or YouTube to be dead but just to be in the mosque.  That is the problem we face.  It is no longer an interpersonal, one-to-one relationship.  Data are being used against whole populations, which is why the committee is so important.  They are being used against populations globally.</p></speech>

I do my best every day, as does everyone on the panel.  I know many of the people in attendance.  Representative Cicilline, who is a friend of mine, has done an amazing job of making people aware.  I attended a meeting two nights ago for 2,300 people in Florida, and I am sure 95% of them did not know what I have just stated.  Making people aware remains the challenge.  This is an opportunity for governments to educate citizens and in countries such as Georgia or Estonia, an effort has been made to do that because there is a clear threat to their viability.</p></speech>

My second question is for Dr. Ryan.  In Georgia, any possible electoral interference is considered a managed process that could have been orchestrated or linked to forces outside the country.  Russia is often a suspicious country, not only in Georgia.  To address the problem properly, do we need to reveal who stands behind the orchestrated process and how they operate and get access to data collected on social networks?</p></speech>

If people can be shown how it worked on the previous occasion, it will inoculate them against how it will happen the next time, and put pressure on the information operator to change its ways because it will have to find a new tactic.  There have been at least four generations of takedown of content from the Russian Internet Research Agency, RIRA, and every time it has had to change tactics precisely because the previous attempt has been caught.</p> <p>  The more transparency, the better.  The challenge is the attribution.  We do not want people to say an instance must be the Russians because those behind the content behave the way the RIRA did on the previous occasion.  The attribution very much comes down to how much the platforms can attribute.  Transparency is important and educational but there is a limit beyond which attribution will probably not be able to go.  We are in the space where one tells what one can but one has to accept that, sometimes, if the threat actors are clever enough, a hard attribution will not be possible.  We want to avoid hysterical attributions to the effect that it is one bot online and that, therefore, it must be a Russian operation.  Sadly, there has been much of that in this space recently.  Part of what needs to happen is a realistic assessment of what we see, rather than an overexcited one.</p></speech>

We might agree that political micro targeting can be dealt with by national legislatures but that is only one aspect of a very complex problem.  If we look more deeply at the business model, given that Dr. Ryan, Dr. Lillington and Mr. McNamee all advocated going to the source of the problem, the main question, if we can get agreement today, is where the governance is and where the collaboration is in the international regulation to make it work.  It is hard to do it as a nation state.  Is it at the European Union, the UN Internet Governance Forum, some version of ICANN or the IAB, which Dr. Ryan mentioned?  What has the best structure to make the business model change?</p></speech>

The IAB is regulated, under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, from Belgium, and Google is regulated, under the GDPR, from Dublin.  The two regulators have appropriate law and massive legal authority.  The Belgian data protection authority is investigating the IAB, while the Irish data protection authority is investigating Google.  The Irish regulator received my complaint in respect of the issue well over a year ago.  I understand she is hard pressed and it is difficult to process a large amount of work.  Nevertheless, elections are approaching in various parts of the world and these are essential, life-and-death matters.</p> <p>  I suggest that the forum is, in fact, in this House, in the Chamber.</p><p>That is because our regulator can be scrutinised by no one other than Members of the Oireachtas.  I can sue the Data Protection Commissioner if she does not effectively act on the complaint and evidence I have given her.  That is something we have in reserve.  A far better way of forcing action is to provide resources to regulators in both jurisdictions and to make sure there is appropriate scrutiny of the regulator for these critical things.  I realise I am going over time.  The whole idea of this regulation was that it was risk-based.  We would focus on the key and important players and leave the greengrocer, for example, alone.  In that case, this biggest data breach we have ever had in digital history should be the number one item and it does not seem to be.</p></speech>

So far, we have been talking about the Silicon Valley tech giants and the social media platforms.  We are already in a world where those are not the only major platforms around.  We are also seeing major platforms from China, for example.  Whatever we build in we will have to do so with a sense that we will not just be regulating for companies based in democratic countries but also for large social media platforms located in non-democratic countries.  How we address that in the regulation will be a big question.</p></speech>

I have two questions which I will tie together and try to keep as brief as possible.  The first relates to an incident from social media yesterday.  As we know, the British general election is under way and we miss the presence of our British colleagues, with the exception of Lord Puttnam who is with us.  The official Twitter account of the Conservative Party sent out a tweet with a mock-up of the Opposition Brexit spokesperson, Keir Starmer, poised to answer a question he was not asked.  This is possibly the first time the headquarters of a mainstream political party has run fake news.  We have seen this from many fringe actors but this is probably the first time I have seen a mainstream party officially engaging in fake news.  It is probably no surprise because the main protagonist in that party is on the vote leave side.</p> <p>  Have we reached peak social media difficulty?  The flipside of that question is that, as legislators, we have to anticipate the counter-arguments and play devil's advocate to some extent.  With every new technology, from Gutenberg's printing press to the Pony Express when riders crossed the United States on horseback delivering telegrams, come those who will exploit these technologies.  We were discussing this issue last night.  Regulators and legislators have always tried to clamp down and sometimes it takes a while to get on board.  Sometimes the public get on board faster and apply their own filter by taking fake news or, previously, a bogus telegram with a grain of salt.  I fervently believe legislation and regulation are needed.  To what extent have we reached a peak?  Are people moving off the platforms already or will they remain an ongoing threat for some time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karlin Lillington" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#G00500"><p>I would like to make a quick point that we need to recognise that democracy, as a global aspiration, will be undermined when the political leaders of the countries that are supposed to be the central democracies are themselves using social media to lie, spread disinformation and question and undermine elections.  That emboldens and gives comfort to the dictators and autocrats in the most repressive nations and undermines activists.  We are leaching our own democracies of any moral authority.  I know this is a broader social issue that goes beyond concern about the platforms.  However, these problems are tied together and this is something to think about.</p></speech>

I direct my question to Mr. Roger McNamee.  The underlying issue is the business model.  Mr. McNamee spoke about surveillance capitalism.  If we dig deeper, the issue is that the more engagement, the better sensational news sells.  Mr. McNamee spoke about stuff that triggers a fight or flight reaction as well as hate speech, conspiracies and disinformation.  Given the various technological solutions at hand, there is little or no incentive for social media companies such as Facebook to prevent these harms as it would affect their bottom line.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roger McNamee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#G01000"><p>It is worse than that.  If one thinks about it from the perspective of the social media companies, they would like to appear to be co-operative without going after the business model.  When they put in place measures like moderation to try to capture things after the fact, the thing to understand is there is latency, that is, a lag between when content goes up and when moderators can take it down.  Almost all the harm from this stuff happens very quickly.  It is not just that they have no incentive to do it.  They have no technological way to solve these problems.  The scale is so great that moderation cannot work.  The business model has to be changed.</p> <p>  To respond to the previous question because these matters are related, we must remember that these companies are not sitting still.  The business model is migrating from advertising-based businesses to taking over the functions of liberal democracy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1381" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Amrin Amin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#G01100"><p>The key issue is they have community standards to appear to be helpful but in fact there is inaction.  This is evident in various incidents we have seen around the world, for example, in what happened in Sri Lanka where there was a refusal to take down a post that could clearly qualify as hate speech and a refusal to fact-check political advertisements.  There is clearly a profit motive.  They like to have community standards to give a veneer of co-operation and certain code words that appear to be helpful, but in fact the underlying purpose is the insatiable thirst for profits.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I would like to reiterate what Mr. Nimmo said a moment ago, that is, that we have passed peak ignorance on this issue.  The problem is the technologies are evolving and the surveillance is becoming so much deeper with technologies such as Alexa, Google Home and the ubiquitous facial recognition that is going around the world.  We should keep in mind that because these companies control information flow - people get their information by searching Google and Facebook - they have the ability to use the data they have, the voodoo dolls they have created of each person which are a digital representation, to control search results and, therefore, control the choices available to people.  That business model is the reason they can migrate from advertising into replacing government functions.</p></speech>

Would that be correct?</p></speech>

The punishments need to be measured in trillions not millions of dollars.  The companies need to understand that undermining democracy should be punishable by extermination of the company.  There is no reason any company should have the right to be an enabler of the destruction of the society in which it lives.</p></speech>

I bring apologies from Damian Collins, MP, for whom I was supposed to act as sidekick.  Suddenly, I have become the main part of the show.  One point I would like to get across is that my select committee would very much like to take evidence from the witnesses.  We have a problem because unless we get that evidence, either in writing or orally, I cannot use it in our select committee report.  The witnesses will definitely receive invitations and we will find a way of circumventing those obstacles.  There is a wonderful irony here.  I am an unelected politician, yet the one security I have is that I know our select committee will be reformed in January, whereas if I was in the House of Commons, I would have no such certainty.</p><p>It is a rather bizarre situation in which to find oneself.  As I see it, we are on the horns of a major dilemma.  The bad actors - Russia, China and whoever else - have no real interest in achieving specific outcomes, which is very unusual.  They do not, for example, really care who wins the British election.  What they care about is seeding confusion, disharmony and disrespect for democracy.  The very worst that could happen - I suspect it might happen on 12 December - is that there would be a contested election.  That would be a massive win for the people who wish to deal in disinformation.  I have no idea what the result will be.  Likely as not, it will end up in the Supreme Court.  There is irony in all of this.  The more one can create confusion, the more one justifies the sovereignty of the social media companies because, in their competence, they begin to look as if they are almost a safe haven, as opposed to the incompetence of plural democracy.  That is a very serious problem and the problem is amplified by the fact that within our own nation states, going by all of my experience of 20 years of legislation and as I am sure Mr. Cicilline will confirm, if a government wants to defeat something that is coming at it, it will try to split ranks and sow confusion.  What is happening is that each nation state is looking at the benefits of employment, the tax take and so on versus its own security and the security of democracy.  That becomes an internal discussion within each country.  It is certainly true in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries.  It further confuses the entire issue.</p><p> We are looking at various possible solutions.  I totally support everything Ms Cadwalladr said.  What she did not mention that is bang up to date is the suppression of the Grieve report.  We have a report that has been right the way through all of our institutions, but the Prime Minister personally has refused to release it.  We had a question in the House of Lords on Tuesday when the Front Bench spokesman, the Minister, confirmed that it was a personal decision of the Prime Minister.  That is outrageous.  Our entire democracy relies on what is termed the "good chap" principle, that the Prime Minister of the day, man or woman, behaves like a good chap.  I am sorry about the gender inflection, but that is the way it is.  We are going through a process, whereby all norms are being defied.  That is playing to the benefit of the major social media companies, which is very worrying.</p><p> We have had one suggestion made to us as a committee by which I am intrigued, namely, the possibility of having a Euro SWAT team of high competence that could be moved around in situations where there was palpable vulnerability to democracy on the grounds that the problem was so enormous no one country would be able to put together the permanent competencies to deal with it.  Having a European SWAT team that would be constantly looking for it and that could be moved around might be one at least temporary answer to the problem we are discussing.  Does anyone have a view on it?</p></speech>

There are probably more countries committing to information operations than there are people who are studying them; therefore, there is a massive problem.  I would not, however, want to see a Euro SWAT team run by governments because giving governments the right to decide what goes up and what comes down is fundamentally something to which I would object.  One nuance on information operations is that quite a lot of the time they do have an interest in achieving a specific outcome.  We could see, for example, that the Russian operation in 2016 was very definitely about stopping Hillary Clinton from being elected.  There are outcome-specific cases.  A lot of the information operations we see are about increasing polarisation.  That is where we need to have a conversation, not so much about the operations but about the underlying social dynamic of why polarisation happens in the first place.</p></speech>

These problems are not confined within geopolitical borders.  They are real and affecting our democracies in fundamental and lasting ways.  It is essential that we work together to find solutions to restore the Internet's promise.  The committee was established to work out some solutions to these problems, as Chairman Bob Zimmer noted during the last meeting, and I strongly support that goal.  To quote one of our panellists, Ms Cadwalladr, democracy is not guaranteed and not inevitable.  We have to fight and we have to win as we cannot let the tech companies have this unchecked power.  I want to begin with a question to Ms Cadwalladr.  I thank her for the incredible work she did in her extensive investigation and reporting on the impact of Facebook on elections and our democratic institutions.  Her work reinforces why a free and vibrant press is so critical to our democracy and holding those in power to account.  One of the challenges we face in the United States is having people understand the impact of this one-on-one micro targeting of politicals and issue advertisements and how they work.  I wonder if Ms Cadwalladr could speak to this for one moment, particularly about micro targeting in the political context.</p></speech>

Somebody who lives in the same house might be targeted with a different advertisement and people would not be aware of it.  This happens in darkness; therefore, it is influence being brought to bear on individuals based on unknown information that is being collected on them across the Internet.  It is a really different idea about politics and elections from those we have had at any other time.  It seems to be completely incompatible.  We previously had a situation where parties and politicians would come up with ideas and place them in the public domain.  We would have had a discussion about them and then voted on them.  Now they are finding out information on you and in what you are interested, crafting a particular policy that somehow might speak to it and showing it to you in darkness, as it were.  That is just not known to the rest of society at all and it is profoundly anti-democratic.</p></speech>

There was an open letter published by hundreds of Facebook employees who have criticised this policy.  Can Dr. Lillington see any defence for it?</p></speech>

It connects directly to what Ms Cadwalladr is speaking to also.  On the idea that one can be allowed to micro target people with advertisements and then justify letting politicians or campaigns state anything they like about issues in these secretive advertisements that the entire Commons does not get to see means that Facebook's defence that it is a free speech issue and that people should be allowed to say what they want and then the voters can decide, the thing is if I am highly targeted with a single advertisement that appeals to ways in which they understand, I can be persuaded owing to micro targeting and how does anybody else dispute it?  How do people have a discussion at the dinner table with their family if they have not all seen the advertisement in the newspaper or on television?  There is no defence.</p></speech>

I wonder if he would spend a moment speaking about the implications for the proposal he has suggested to recognise data privacy as a human right.  Would it solve the problem in a way that some of the things like purpose specification and a number of other approaches might not?</p></speech>

In principle, there could be 220 million campaigns, each completely isolated from the next.  The metaphor I use is imagine going to the doctor with a broken arm.  Imagine if the doctor repaired the arm and then said, "I own your arm now."  That is what happens with data.  Any corporation that touches a piece of data claims ownership and the ability to do whatever it wants with it.  Because there is a free market, they can create what Tristan Harris calls a data voodoo doll, a complete representation of a person's life in all respects.  It is effectively part of one's body.</p><p>The notion that they are allowed to unilaterally exploit it to predict and manipulate a person's behaviour strikes me as being profoundly inappropriate.  We can attack this by going after symptoms or we can attack the problem.  In my mind  I would like to reset and go all the way back to where we were 25 years ago and say data cannot be used in any way.  There would be no models or anything else.  We could then have a reasonable conversation about what uses of data were appropriate and which were not.  That is instead of starting with the assumption that all things are good and trying to subtract from it.  Such a process has brought us to a bad place.  The implication is very simple.  In the short run both Google and Facebook would lose profoundly in their earnings, but they would both have massive opportunities to rebuild them.  To my mind, their profits should not be the first consideration of society.  As somebody who has been involved with that world my whole life, I look at this issue while knowing the creative forces around the world will replace those functions instantaneously.  It would be only a matter of weeks before one would have a global standard for alternatives based on good business models if they were willing to do it.</p></speech>

It is possible and to artificial intelligence questions, the solutions are artificial intelligence ones.  It is impossible to handle those amounts of data manually, as Facebook is doing.  It does not really want to do it.  If there was a willingness to pursue these solutions, it would be possible.  With respect to business models, there are identity bubbles; therefore, why does it not do "pre-moderation" with artificial intelligence?</p></speech>

Speaking philosophically, Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and the founders of Google believe efficiency is the most important goal in the universe; therefore, they are trying to eliminate friction.  Everything needs to be automated and scalable.  As many things as possible would be ignored.  The notion of regulations and criticism is a form of friction with which they would not like to deal.  If Mr. Zuckerberg puts in place an AI-based moderation system that can find 98% of child pornography, the problem is we would be dealing with billions of transactions and being only 98% right still means there would be tens of millions or hundreds of millions of failures.  In the context of democracy, that is completely unacceptable.  As much as I believe artificial intelligence will evolve eventually to having very powerful capability, today it is far more limited than the people who are pushing it are willing to admit.</p></speech>

They say they are just a dumb terminal displaying binary code which is throwing up content and that in that way they are just a carrier.  To my mind, the companies are curating content and selling advertisements based on personalised content.  They are moderating content and making decisions about what can be taken down or left up.  They have many of the attributes of a publisher.  What do the delegates think?</p></speech>

We have to be careful with these industries, even when there are tight, legal definitions.  Where the enforcers are asleep in the middle of systematic infringement of this new regulatory framework which is emerging as a <i>de facto</i>global standard then this place being the home of that framework will show that the framework is not sustainable.</p></speech>

I will just hit some high points.  I thank the Chairman and the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for inviting me to speak to it and the other International Grand Committee members today.  I am the vice president of content policy at Facebook and based in our Menlo Park headquarters in California.  I joined Facebook in 2012 after serving 11 years as a US public prosecutor and as regional legal adviser at the US embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.  I now lead Facebook's global content policy team.  My team's responsibilities include developing and enforcing the rules for how people can use our services.  My remit also now includes work to further our company&rsquo;s goal of facilitating appropriate regulation of content on social media platforms and the broader Internet.</p> <p>  Facebook welcomes governments and regulators taking a more active role in addressing harmful content online.  Protecting the people who use our services is a top priority, to which we continue to dedicate a great deal of time and resources, but we do not believe any company should tackle these issues alone.  This is why we work together with governments, civil society, experts and industry peers to develop rules for the Internet that encourage innovation and allow people the freedom to express themselves while protecting society from broader harms.  </p> <p>  The aim of the committee&rsquo;s session today is to advance international collaboration in the regulation of harmful content, hate speech and electoral interference.  Facebook shares this goal and I am grateful for the opportunity to share our thoughts on how to meet it. </p> <p>  Freedom of expression is a core value of our company.  Facebook exists to give people a way to connect and express themselves.  At the same time, we want to make sure that people using our services are safe.  That means we must make decisions every day about what is and is not acceptable among our community of 2.8 billion people.  Some of these decisions are clear but many are nuanced and involve balancing competing principles like voice, dignity, safety and privacy.  We work hard to get these decisions right and we have community standards that define what is acceptable content.  Those standards are informed at every turn by relationships with hundreds of civil society groups and experts around the world.  </p> <p>  We invest heavily in technical solutions to quickly identify potential violations of our rules.  For example, more than 99% of the terror propaganda we remove from the site is content we identify ourselves using technical tools before anybody has reported it to us.  We also have more than 10,000 people working around the clock to assess whether content is violating our rules and removing it if it is.  We respond to the overwhelming majority of reports of potential violations within 24 hours.  We publish transparency reports about how effectively we remove harmful content.  These documents, which are publicly available, show how much content we are removing in each category and how successful we have been in trying to identify that content before it is reported to us.  Nevertheless, we know that with such a diverse community, the lines we draw will never please everyone and we will never be perfect in enforcing these lines.  To address these challenges, Facebook is creating an independent body called the oversight board to which people can appeal our decisions on content they have posted but we know that this too will not solve all of the challenges we face.  We believe that a more standardised approach would be beneficial.  Regulation could set baselines for what is prohibited and guide the development of systems to better address harmful content.  </p> <p>  In the area of elections, regulation could address important issues such as the definition of political advertising, who is allowed to run political advertisements and what steps those persons must take before doing so.  Regulation could also address how political parties can and cannot use data to target political advertising.  We believe that Facebook and companies like it are central to solving these complex challenges but it is clear that we cannot and ought not do this alone.  In that spirit, we look forward to collaborating further with governments, civil society, industry and all of the people who hold a stake in creating rules for a safe and innovative Internet.  </p></speech>

The committee's leadership on issues related to data governance inspires many well beyond Ireland's borders.  I am the retired chairman and co-CEO of Research In Motion, a mobile data services firm we scaled from an idea to $20 billion in sales.  My expertise is the commercialisation of technology, specifically for multi-sided platform business model strategies and their network effects.</p> <p>  In the attached appendix, I list the six recommendations I made at the IGC meeting in Ottawa in May.  Today, I will explain three foundational elements that underpin all of my recommendations because a stable, long-term solution to the current challenges lies in confronting them systemically.  </p> <p>  The current business model is the root cause of the problems the committee is trying to address.  Its toxicity is unrelenting.  It is not a coding glitch that a legal patch will fix.  Data at the micro-personal level gives technology unprecedented power and that is why data is not the new oil.  It is the new plutonium - amazingly powerful, dangerous when it spreads, difficult to clean up and with serious consequences when improperly used.  A business model that makes manipulation profitable is a foundational threat to markets and democracy.  Democracy and markets only work when people can make free choices aligned with their interests, yet companies that monetise personal data are incentivised by and profit from undermining personal autonomy.  Whistleblowers inside platform companies told us that "the dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will."  That is why we need to outlaw the current business model and reintroduce responsible monetisation, such as subscription-based models.  Strategic regulations are needed to cut off the head of this snake.  Anything less means governments will be perpetually coping with its slithery consequences turning policymaking into a losing game of regulatory whack-a-mole.</p> <p>  Silicon Valley&rsquo;s business plans are not political programmes.  The contemporary technology sector is an industry that celebrates engineering as an alternative form of governance.  It distrusts the political process and disregards the public interest.  Its concentration of power is owed to the features of the modern knowledge-based and data-driven economy that tip markets through its steep economies of scale, powerful economies of scope, pervasive information asymmetry and network externalities.  Technology is not governance; it must be governed.  The choice we face in 2019 is not between Facebook and China, which paradoxically borrow from each other the tools and tactics that encode their grip on power.  The option we face is either a social choice mediated by democracy or social outcomes engineered by unbridled, unethical and unaccountable power.</p> <p>  A global digital stability board is needed to institutionalise co-ordinated responses and underwrite a progressive digital future.  Cyberspace knows no natural border.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal involved Canadian technology on a US platform paid for by Russian and US money to interfere in a British referendum over its future in the European Union.  The business model that enabled this, nourished by discredited neoliberal policies, turns customers into products.  If left unaddressed, it will render liberal democracy and free markets obsolete.  The timing is urgent.  In North America, record-setting lobbying expenditures by data-driven platforms resulted in chapter 19 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which includes provisions that lock in the current advertising-driven business model and prevent lawmaker oversight of algorithms.  The current US Administration is working to entrench these rules globally through the World Trade Organization negotiations on the trade-related aspects of e-commerce.</p><p>We have arrived at a new Bretton Woods moment where new or reformed rules of the road at the international level are needed.  They should be rules that preserve an open global trading system yet, at the same time, respect a nation&rsquo;s sovereign ability to regulate the data-driven economy's profound cross-cutting economic, security and social effects.  I have proposed the creation of an organisation that would be akin to the Financial Stability Board that was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.  Industry can be part of the solution by acknowledging the toxicity of the current business model and migrating to responsible revenue generation for services.</p></speech>

I lead YouTube's public policy work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  I have over a decade of experience in online safety issues and I am centrally involved in our work to keep our users safe every day.  This committee's work over the past year has addressed a range of critical topics, including privacy, misinformation, election integrity and more.  In our testimony before this committee previously, we outlined Google's commitment to information quality and how continued collaboration improves the ways we all address harmful content online.  Today, I will focus on YouTube's efforts and outline improvements we have made to address misinformation on that platform.  I will also highlight opportunities for greater collaboration among companies, government and civil society to tackle this challenge.</p> <p>  YouTube is an open platform where anyone can upload a video and share it with the world.  The platform's openness has helped to foster economic opportunity, community, learning and much more.  Millions of creators around the world have connected with global audiences and many of them have built thriving businesses in the process.  At the same time, YouTube has always had strict community guidelines to make clear what is and is not allowed on the platform.  We design and update our systems and policies to meet the changing needs of both our users and society.  Videos that violate those policies generate a fraction of 1% of total views on YouTube, and we are always working to decrease that number.  In fact, over the last 18 months, we have reduced the number of views of videos that are later removed for violating our policies by 80%.</p> <p>  Our approach towards responsibility involves four Rs.  We remove content that violates our policy as quickly as possible.  We raise up authoritative voices when people are looking for news and information, especially during breaking news moments such as elections.  We reduce the spread of borderline content and harmful misinformation.  We set a higher bar for what channels can make money on our site by rewarding trusted, eligible creators.  Over the past several years, we have used those four approaches to address misinformation.</p> <p>  While we remain vigilant against new threats, we are proud of the progress we have made.  We have raised up quality content by, among other things, implementing two cornerstone products, namely, the top news shelf in YouTube search results and the breaking news shelf on the YouTube homepage.  These products highlight authoritative sources of content and are now available in 40 countries.  We have worked especially hard to raise up authoritative and useful information around elections.  For example, earlier this year, we launched information panels in YouTube search results.  For example, when users were looking for information about official candidates running for seats in the European Parliament in May we showed them authoritative information.  We have continued our strict enforcement of YouTube&rsquo;s policies against misleading information and impersonation.  From September 2018 through to August 2019, YouTube removed more than 10.8 million channels for violation of our spam, misleading and scam policy, and more than 56,000 channels were removed for violation of our impersonation policy.  We have also undertaken a broad range of approaches to combat political influence operations, which we have regularly reported over the course of the past two years.  For example, in September, we provided an update about disabling a network of 210 channels on YouTube when we discovered they behaved in a co-ordinated manner while uploading videos related to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.  We have also worked hard to reduce recommendations for content that is close to a policy line but does not violate it, including attempts to spread harmful misinformation.  Thanks to changes we have made over the past year, this type of content is viewed as a result of recommendations over 50% less than before in the United States.  YouTube has begun experimenting with this change in other countries, including Ireland and the UK, and we will bring it to other European markets soon.  We know that this work is not done.  That is why we continue to work with law enforcement, industry and third-party experts around the world to continue to evolve our efforts.</p> <p>  I will conclude by discussing opportunities for greater collaboration.  The EU code of practice on disinformation is an important foundation that we can all build on.  Launched just over a year ago, the code was developed in light of work that we and others had been pursuing with experts and publishers around the world to elevate quality information and support news literacy.  As part of the process, we have provided regular reports on our efforts to address disinformation and we have highlighted the work that we can do collectively in this regard.</p> <p>  We must continue to support collaborative research efforts.  For instance, we have invested in research on the detection of synthetic media, often referred to as deep fakes, and have released data sets to help researchers around the world to improve audio and video detection.  We have also made the data about our election advertising efforts available in the transparency report.  This information is available to everyone, including governments, industry and experts.  We can work together with this data to improve matters.  We strongly believe that addressing harmful content online is a shared responsibility, which is why we are so committed to meetings and collaborations like these.  We are committed to doing our part and we look forward to answering members' questions.</p></speech>

I am the director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronan Costello, public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.  We are pleased to be here with the committee today for this session which aims to focus on how industry can be part of the solution.  Twitter is committed to improving the collective health, openness and civility of the conversation on our platform.  Our success is built and measured by how we help to encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking.  Conversely, abuse, malicious automation and manipulation detract from it.</p> <p>  I will use this opportunity to briefly walk through three specific areas where Twitter has been doing critical work to prioritise online safety and election integrity.  These include our investments in proactive technology to better enforce the Twitter rules, our policies on political advertising and synthetic or manipulated media, and our focus on state-backed information operations.  I will also share some insights into the structural and operational changes Twitter has made since 2017 to protect conversations on the platform during elections while building partnerships that promote a better understanding of our online environment.</p> <p>  It would be instructive at this point to re-emphasise the public commitment made by our CEO, Jack Dorsey, in May 2018 to prioritise the health of public conversation on Twitter above all else.  He recognised that the platform had come to be used in ways that were harmful and unforeseen and he said Twitter would hold itself accountable towards progress.  Since then, we have leveraged a combination of policy, people and technology to yield positive results.  It is our view that people who do not feel safe on Twitter should not be burdened to report to us, so we have significantly ramped up investment in proactive technology and tools to better tackle issues such as abuse, spam and automation, which detract from people having healthy experiences on our service.</p> <p>  More than 50% of the tweets we remove for abuse are surfaced proactively for human review by technology, rather than relying on reports.  This is an increase from 20% last year.  While we will strive to improve this further, it is a significant enforcement milestone and a positive indicator that our investment in technology is helping us to tackle abusive behaviour at scale.  Figures released just last week in the latest edition of our biannual transparency report further outline the trends and progress we saw in the first half of this year.  We have increased by 105% our rate of action on violating content.  We took action on 133% more accounts for violation of our hateful conduct policy.  We took action on 68% more accounts for violations of our policies on abuse.  Taken as a whole, the progress I have summarised reflects Twitter's mission and commitment to enhance the health of the public conversation on our service.</p> <p>  The scale, speed and targeting effects of online political advertising have been widely discussed lately.  Last Wednesday, our CEO announced that Twitter had made a decision to stop all political advertising.  This policy is global, includes all candidate and issue advertisements and will come into effect in the very near future.  We continue to update our rules and policies in response to evolving threats and technological challenges.</p><p>We share the public concern regarding the use of disinformation campaigns that rely upon the use of manipulated and synthetic media, commonly referred to as deepfakes.</p><p> On Monday, 21 October, we publicly announced that we have been working on a policy to address comprehensively synthetic and manipulated media on Twitter.  In the coming weeks, we plan to open a public feedback period to get input on this from the public.  We want to listen and consider a variety of viewpoints in our policy development process and we want to be transparent about our approach and values.</p><p> We appreciate that some of the threats on our platform can be urgent, and our expertise and analyses can be bolstered by partnerships with external researchers, journalists and academics.  One area where we have unlocked these valuable partnerships to help provide more transparency on our platform is in the area of state-backed information operations.  For more than a year, we have been publicly disclosing comprehensive datasets of tweets and related media information we identify on the platform that we have attributed to malicious state actors.  We launched this initiative to empower academic and public understanding of these co-ordinated campaigns around the world and to enable third-party expert analysis of these threats and tactics.  Using our archive, these researchers have conducted their own investigations and publicly shared their insights and independent analyses.</p><p> Since January 2017, we have launched numerous election related product and policy changes, expanded our enforcement operations and strengthened our team structure.  We further expanded our enforcement capabilities for global elections by creating a dedicated reporting feature to allow users to report content that undermines the process of registering to vote or engaging in the electoral process.  This reporting feature was first used this year for the Indian and European Parliament elections.</p><p> The challenges we face as an online society are complex, constantly evolving, and often without precedent.  Industry and Twitter cannot address these issues alone.  Nor is our industry monolithic in its approach to these issues.  Each of us has different services, varying business models, and often complementary but distinct principles.  This should be recognised as we continue our engagement.  Every stakeholder in this conversation has a role to play.  We propose a whole-of-society approach to improving the health of online conversation and citizenship.  We all need and deserve a thoughtful approach and long-term perspective in this discussion, and Twitter very much welcomes the opportunity to participate.</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Carol Brown, and I, are Members of the Australian Parliament.  In Dr. Bickert's written submission, she states Facebook does not believe:</p><blockquote>... that a private company should be determining for the world what is true or false in a politician&rsquo;s statement.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean that politicians can say whatever they want on Facebook.</blockquote> <p>I appreciate Dr. Bickert will not know every nation's issues to do with her company and I am happy to speak further offline to her about the matter I am about to raise.  In our recent election in May this year, in which I was a successful candidate, a campaign was waged anonymously through Dr. Bickert's platform against the party I represent with regard to a death tax and inheritance tax.  This campaign was false and misleading.  Advertisements were posted and anonymous statements were made.  Despite our nation's complaints to Facebook executives, no action was taken.  Why was this?</p></speech>

I am happy to follow up.  In 2017, we introduced an advertisement library whereby we have brought unprecedented transparency to political advertising.  Now when somebody runs a political advertisement on Facebook, people can see who is running the advertisement and we verify identity.  We also make public the audience for that advertisement, the dates it ran, and any other advertisements that party is running.</p> <p>  It is not a free game for political advertisements.  They must adhere to our advertisement standards, which are a step above our community standards.  The community standards have measures such as a prohibition on hate speech and threats.  The advertisement standards go higher and they are the standards that are applicable to any of the political advertisements that are run.</p></speech>

How does that intersect with the standards?</p></speech>

They were run and sponsored by elected representatives of the Parliament.  Anonymous fake accounts were set up to support them.  Videos were collated with the unrelated and irrelevant words "death tax" and "inheritance tax", as said by my colleagues, spliced and put into advertisements that were sponsored and paid for on Dr. Bickert's platform.</p></speech>

We also have a mechanism for sending to third-party independent fact checker organisations, certified by the Poynter Institute, information that is likely to be false.  They can rate that themselves.  We also have tools and user reporting systems that will send information to them.  If those fact checking organisations rate something as false, we put that information next to the information that is being seen and we do not run the advertisements.  If something is directly from a politician and if the politician refers to something such as a link or an image that has already been debunked by a third party fact checker, the advertisement will not run.  However, if the politician himself or herself is engaging in direct speech, he or she is held to our advertisement standards but we do not police whether the information is true.  We do not believe we are the right entity to do this and we do not believe it is something we could do to the satisfaction of all involved.</p></speech>

I will say the verification process has proved to be not simple.  We mail people if they want to run a political advertisement.  Part of the authorisation process involves us mailing something to them to confirm their identity because we do see the upload of false documents.  These are challenging areas, but we are very open to regulation.</p></speech>

I have understood from the previous answer that the current state is still that Facebook does not fact check political advertisements.  Is this correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1454" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Monika Bickert" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#O01700"><p>Not exactly.  We do not send to our fact checkers advertisements containing direct speech from politicians.  Other political advertisements may be sent to our fact checkers.  I should point out the fact checking framework we have is relatively new.  We only developed a process for sending advertisements to fact checkers in August 2019.  Prior to August 2019, this was not something that would have been a process.  We have never sent direct speech from politicians in advertisements to fact checkers.  We thought it was important to make this clear, so recently we publicly reiterated it.</p></speech>

Why is it for all other Facebook users there is no right to lie on Facebook and Facebook does not take money from those advertisements but for politicians it is okay to lie and Facebook accepts money for the advertisements that spread the lies?</p></speech>

It is not that we think it is okay for people to lie.  We think that when people come to Facebook freedom of expression is one of the best ways the truth comes out.  The fact we do not think Facebook should be the truth police for the entire world and that we should not determine for citizens what they shall and shall not see in terms of truthfulness from their politicians does not mean we dismiss the importance of combating disinformation.  There are several things we do to combat false statements on Facebook.  First, we go after fake accounts that the data have told us time and again are disproportionately more likely to be sharing disinformation.  Second, we disrupt the financial incentives.  Most disinformation, and this includes political disinformation, is shared to make a profit.  It leads to ad farms.  We have gotten much tougher on that.  Finally, for content that is around the border and run in somebody's real name, we now have a process for allowing third party fact checkers to check that information.  When it comes to the direct speech of a politician, we do not think it is appropriate for any private company to interfere between that politician's speech and the citizenry and saying this is true and this is false.</p></speech>

However, it does not interfere when it comes to politicians and, therefore, it is all right for politicians to spread lies on Facebook.</p></speech>

We do not remove content simply for being false outside of a couple of small areas such as if there is an immediate threat to safety and a safety partner has confirmed for us that there is an imminent risk of harm or if somebody misrepresents voting times, locations and processes.  Generally, when we use those third party fact-checking organisations, we do not remove content they say is false; we mark that as having been rated false by the fact checker and we put the information from the fact checker next to it.</p></speech>

A few people have said the change in Facebook's policy, where it refuses to take down false political ads, has happened because it allows Facebook to accept millions upon millions of dollars from upcoming large and important campaigns and spread information that is knowingly false as political ads.  How does Dr. Bickert answer those accusations?</p></speech>

I do not have the exact statistic on hand.  We can follow up with Ms Pentus-Rosimannus on that but suffice it to say financial motivations do not lead us to have this policy.  We make very little from these ads.  That is because we do not believe that it is appropriate for a private company to decide for the world what is true or false coming from their politicians and we do not think we could do so effectively.</p></speech>

Many of them have done a good job and we are going in a better direction.  It is important companies take on their responsibilities beforehand.  We must have tight regulation with respect to what is bad and difficult for everyone.</p> <p>  My question is for Dr. Bickert.  With respect to false information, I understand it is very difficult to say what is false.  Something is false for one person and means something else to another person but hate speech is a much easier target to discuss.  For example, in Sri Lanka, people were burned alive because of the hate speech spread through Facebook.  In Myanmar, there was violence against the Rohingya minority.  I refer to what Facebook has done to prevent this.  It has more than 10,000 moderators, as Dr. Bickert mentioned, but what can it do with them?  The only way to address this is with an artificial intelligence, AI, solution.  Mark Zuckerberg told the US Senate in April 2018 that it might take five to ten years to have this kind of technology but that is not true.  A Finish company, Utopia Analytics, has offered to build Facebook a model in two weeks to get rid of the hate speech content originating in Sri Lanka but Facebook was not interested in it.  Many companies do AI moderation.  Will Dr. Bickert explain a little why Facebook will not go deeper into tackling hate speech and why it believes, with more than 10,000 moderators,  it can handle billions of messages?</p></speech>

It is, and has been, a focus for us and, like Mr. Packal&eacute;n, we think that technology is an important part of that solution.  We do not allow hate speech on our service.  We have very strict policies against it.  Our transparency report indicates that the majority of speech we remove for violating our hate speech policies is flagged by our automated systems before anybody has reported it to us.  That number is now is in excess of 65%.  Interestingly, Myanmar, is one of the areas where we have made the most progress.  Back when our detection efforts removed approximately 50% of the hate speech we found with automated technology, in Myanmar, our detection rate was at 63%.  We have focused on hiring people who are native language speakers and on building relationships with organisations on the ground that can help us spot trends.  Those are very helpful but we also think technology is very important.  We partner with others to improve that technology but we also invest significant resources ourselves.</p></speech>

Facebook is the most broadly used social network in Georgia.  It is the main source of information, especially among the younger generations.  That is why I have question for Dr. Bickert on Facebook's operational system.  In 2008, with Russia military intervention, Georgia experienced a severe cyberattack, which blocked critical digital infrastructure in the country.  Our citizens were denied access to Facebook.  In 2009, a similar cyberattack took place.  We had no access to Facebook and Twitter and one can imagine the effect of that when Facebook is most important source of information for the country.  That fact was brought to international attention and even <i>The New York Times</i>pointed out how vital web tools and services are becoming to political discourse and how vulnerable they are to disruption.  My question is whether, in 2019, Facebook has a policy to protect its users from political bullying or whether the company has a policy or any deterrent measures against countries which undertake attacks on Facebook users.</p></speech>

We have a team devoted to cybersecurity and that includes preventing hacking and cyberattacks, perhaps of the sort mentioned.  We also focus on disrupting what we call "co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour".  These are networks of accounts, sometimes state-run and sometimes not, trying to abuse our platform to share things such as divisive messaging, political messaging or intimidation.  We have a team focused on identifying and removing those instances.  It is not something we can do alone, so we partner closely with researchers, academics, security firms and others in the industry.  </p><p> Sometimes we will get a lead from somebody else, we will do the investigation and then we will remove that network.  When we do that, we are transparent about it and in our newsroom, we publish blog posts about the actions we have taken.  That has been a major area of investment for us.  Going after fake accounts has also been an  important part of disrupting bad activity that may, or may not, again come from state actors.  Our automated tools have got so much better that in the first quarter of 2019, we removed more than 2 billion fake accounts.  Not all of those were designed to share disinformation but we were removing the vast majority of these accounts within moments of their creation.  These are definitely areas of interest for us.  We believe people should have access to Facebook. </p></speech>

It is important that small countries should be the focus of big social networks.  The presence of Dr. Bickert in Georgia and her personal experience of the problems in small countries would be very important for Facebook, as well as for us.  It should be a part of the policies of big social networks to take care of the challenges and problems faced by small countries.</p></speech>

In its written statement, Facebook proposes to create an oversight body.  Who will be on that oversight body?  How independent will it be?  Will those members be paid employees of Facebook?  Will the body be funded by Facebook?  It also appears that this body will be an appeals mechanism for people who want content removed by Facebook.  We are here to ensure that social media platforms are safe environments and this does not seem to be helpful in ensuring we are working in a safe environment.  This oversight body is instead going to allow people who have their content removed to appeal to Facebook to have that content restored.  That is the opposite of what we are discussing.  I invite Dr. Bickert to talk to us about that oversight body and those questions first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1480" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Monika Bickert" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#Q01000"><p>We are launching the oversight board and while we do not think it is the perfect answer to all of these challenges, we think it is important to give people who have had content removed from Facebook the opportunity to appeal to an independent body.  To go quickly through the questions posed by the Chair, we put out a charter in September 2019 that was the result of nearly a year of consultation in many countries with many stakeholders from different backgrounds.  The result is that the board will have up to about 40 members.  Those members will be chosen through a collaborative process between the co-chairs of the board, who will be initially selected by Facebook.  Those co-chairs will then choose the additional members, with input from Facebook.  That said, the decisions made by those members will be independent and binding.  They will be paid by a trust that Facebook will fund, but those funds will be held and administered independently.</p> <p>  I will clarify the way that cases will get to this board.  We have millions of cases every week where we make decisions.  This board will be able to choose from among the decisions appealed to it by users.  If Facebook finds a case where it is hard to make a decision, we will also be able to proactively send something to the board for it to make a decision.  </p></speech>

Twitter has announced that it is not going to allow any political advertising anymore.  Mr. Zuckerberg has stated, however, that Facebook has no intention of implementing such a ban.

I believe that Mark Zuckerberg has talked about electoral advertisements and how they have been and continue to be a very small, percentage of our advertising revenue.

I welcome her comments concerning Facebook being committed to addressing the issue of co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour.  I would like to clarify that my understanding of how this functions is correct, however, and perhaps we could use the example given by Ms Cadwalladr and some others this morning concerning the upcoming British elections.  I refer to a situation where the authorities are potentially concerned about co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour as an attempt to alter the British elections in the near future and Facebook is made aware of this information through the security services, government agencies, think tanks, academics and-or voluntary organisations.  Ultimately, however, it would be Dr. Bickert's team that would then decide whether to act on evidence of co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour.  The execution and timing of that decision might affect the British election.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

This is my final question.  Dr. Bickert's comments and assessments do not address any of the issues that are happening in end-to-end encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp and perhaps what is being proposed for other messaging services.  They centre on Facebook's newsfeed-based products.  In places like India and Brazil, there is good evidence that WhatsApp has been compromised, weaponised and exploited for the purposes of disinformation as well as affecting elections.  Have any Facebook employees in its safety team or otherwise expressed serious concern about the weaponisation and use of WhatsApp and other closed platforms for this purpose?  Does Facebook have plans to address some of our concerns, as legislators and regulators, that these closed platforms would be used for these purposes?</p></speech>

In fact, my team is responsible for safety and security, and has on it people who have spent their careers in safety.  They did not just get assigned to it in Facebook.  These are people who came to Facebook because they cared about safety and security.  We cover WhatsApp as well.  So, we are focused on ensuring that this service is safe.  As we think about encryption on WhatsApp or on other services, part of that is figuring out the ways we can offer superior safety in an encrypted world.  Some of that means focus on behaviour, trends, using artificial intelligence.  However, absolutely this is an area of focus.</p></speech>

However, as hundreds of Facebook employees made clear in an open letter last week, Facebook's advanced targeting and behavioural tracking tools make it "hard for people in the electorate to participate in the 'public scrutiny' that we're saying comes along with political speech.  These ads are often so micro targeted that the conversations on our platforms are much more siloed than on other platforms."</p> <p>  It seems clear that micro targeting prevents the very public scrutiny that would serve as an effective check on false advertisements.  Does the entire justification for this policy not completely fall apart given that Facebook allows politicians both to run fake ads and to distribute those fake ads only to people who are most vulnerable to believing them?  This is a good theory about sunlight, but in practice Facebook's policies permit someone to make false representations and then to micro target who gets them.  This big public scrutiny that serves as justification just does not exist.</p></speech>

That is why we have the ads library, which is unprecedented.  We literally show them.  One can look up any ad in this library and see the breakdown of the audience who have seen the ad.  Many of them are not micro targeted at all.  In no way did this impair.  We saw this recently in the press coverage of political advertisements.

If the problem here is that Facebook should not be exercising this kind of power, is the problem not that Facebook has too much power?  Should we not think about breaking up that power rather than allow Facebook's decisions to continue to have such enormous consequences for our democracy?  Dr. Bickert said that Facebook does fact-checking for a number of other things but does not do fact-checking for political ads.  The cruel irony is that her company is invoking the protections of free speech as a cloak to defend its conduct, which is, in fact, undermining and threatening the very institutions of democracy it is cloaking itself in.  That is the cruel irony: the idea that it is only generating a small part of its revenue.  Its CEO said it is 0.5%, which is &euro;330 million in revenue.</p><p>That may seem insignificant to a company of Facebook's size but it is a substantial revenue source.</p><p> Does Facebook currently prohibit the payment of political advertisements in foreign currency?  Can a politician or someone else in the US use rubles, or any foreign currency, to pay for a political advertisement?</p></speech>

I will move on.</p> <p>  Is it the case that, essentially, the only way for political messages to get across on Facebook is by advertising?  The algorithms were changed about two years ago because there was a growth of negative news or, to an extent, spam on Facebook.  My understanding is that the algorithms were rejigged so that family and friends type content was primary in people's newsfeeds.  This means that the organic reach for political advertisers was so small, the only way they could get into newsfeeds again was by paying for it.  While it may or may not be a small percentage of Facebook's revenue, it is a constant guaranteed source because the only way to get political messaging into newsfeeds is by advertising.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

If we look at the major politicians, some of them have very large page followings.  The Deputy is right that the friends and family posts have been elevated in the past year or so but it is certainly not the only way that something would get into somebody's newsfeed.</p></speech>

One is that it promotes addictive behaviours in order to keep users on the platform.  The second is that it has exploited its dominant position in some ways.  An example that brings those two behaviours together is Facebook's advocacy for video content in recent years.  I am told that the statistics for video content supplied by Facebook internationally and in various reports were such that the primacy of video content was exaggerated and boosted to the extent that it was way over the scale in terms of what was actually being seen.  Video content was being reported as having such a humongous reach that newsrooms and media organisations began to recalibrate their offering, packages and reporting to model this trend but the video statistics, as reported, were a gross exaggeration of the reality being experienced on the platform.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

There have been many stories about the harshness, the pay inequality, the difficult conditions they work in and the psychological trauma and mental health issues that have arisen afterwards.  They may be subject to the same training but they are certainly not subject to the same pay and conditions.  What is the balance in that respect?  Is it 50-50 or two thirds to one third?

That goes for the  full-time employees as well as the contractors.  I want to acknowledge that.  I was a criminal prosecutor for more than a decade.  I worked a lot on child exploitation cases so that focus on making sure that we are providing resources is a major one.  I, too, have toured many of our contractor workforce locations, including in Ireland.  I have found them to be nice places to work.  I know that there are counselling and other wellness resources for them and I have talked to the employees there.  They always have challenges in their jobs but, generally, our attrition rates are very low and our family and friend referral rates are very high.</p></speech>

We heard it yesterday when we were deciding on a workshop on this entire issue.  Extensively, leading academics and researchers in the area agreed that the basic business model here is the core of the problem we face.  I refer to the use of algorithms seeking to attract attention.  I see it with YouTube in that one is immediately brought down a tunnel of confirmation of one's particular view.  This issue is very commonly discussed but Mr. Balsillie and others argue that we have to look at the business model.  What does Google say in that regard?</p></speech>

First, we believe that the open Internet has created an unprecedented opportunity for everyone, both on the user side but also small and medium enterprise creators from Ireland and across the world, to have a voice and find an audience to which to make their message, speech or, on occasion, economic message available.  There is a value in these and in creating a business model that makes this possible.  That is a key point.  There are different business models.  There are subscription models and advertising.  Advertising still represents a way to make these services available to the vast majority of people.</p></speech>

She has been focus of all the questioning because Facebook is probably the most toxic political platform.  Our Georgian colleague invited her to visit Georgia.  I would invite her to visit my Facebook page and see the nature of the commentary that is increasingly prevalent on the platform.  It is not a community, it is war.  For whatever reason, the algorithmic model, not just in recent advertising but in the 95% of other organic content, is leading towards political dialogue which is abusive.  I have yet to meet a politician who does not think that is what is happening.  To refer to the question Mr. Balsilli put, it is the business model, not just in respect of political advertising but the whole organic commentary model that is leading to political discourse which is not community, it is hate speech and abusive.  It tends towards that.  It is the experience of every politician I have met.  Are we all wrong?</p></speech>

I do not think this is related to the business model, which is largely a very good thing.  There is abuse but the data suggest that polarisation has been increasing since the 1970s.  That is a separate topic.  We take abuse of politicians or others very seriously.  We do not allow harassment, threats or hate speech.  We are not perfect at enforcing that line but we are committed to getting it right.  I welcome feedback from the Deputy.</p></speech>

Whatever about hate speech, I do not have Facebook, I do not read Facebook and I do not want to know what people are saying about me on Facebook, that saves me any concerns.  I am, however, concerned about an issue which is of such vital importance that, last Friday, the chief executive of the IWA told the 45 members of staff that they would be sacked on 29 November.  They had no voice and Facebook is the face and voice of the voiceless.</p></speech>

Like most politicians in Ireland, I have seen content put up on social media and all the rest that is not correct.  I accept that there is legislation coming in Ireland.  If people say things on Facebook or some other social media platform and it is incorrect, the law of the land must bring them to account.  To expect Facebook, which we have dealt with a lot today, to police itself about something an elected representative says is not a good enough standard for us.  It has been thrashed out here several times.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is considering legislation and I am well aware that this has been discussed in our own parliamentary party and it will I am sure make different amendments to it, like several politicians here.  We have to be serious as politicians.  There are different formats, guys pay for advertisements and say stuff but if they are saying stuff that is incorrect the court is the place they deserve to be grilled.</p></speech>

We are still working out the details of that policy with regard to political and issue advertisements that would encompass issues of national importance.  We hope to be in a position next week to provide more details of what types of advertisements will and will not be allowed under these new policies and I would be very happy to follow up with the committee then and to share more details.  Towards the end of the month, advertisers will have a chance to become familiar with, and educated about, that new policy.  It will take effect from later in the year.</p></speech>

I understand that Google is a search engine and it performs as a directory but I also understand that any content, illegal or otherwise can be retrieved by the search engine because Google's view is that it is a directory.  I was perturbed by this when I met Google recently, that it applies to disturbing content, freedom of speech, violent and pornographic content and illegal content. All it does is pull things back from the web and show them.  Is that acceptable?</p></speech>

The same content on YouTube can be taken down because we host the content.  The content that we link from Google, since it is not hosted on our networks, cannot be taken down by us.  What we can take action on is the link.  We can make sure that when somebody is searching something on Google, he or she cannot find the link that is leading to the illegal content.  For illegal content that is hosted elsewhere, we do not have any technical possibility to take action.  Of course we can work together with law enforcement and the technical community to solve the problem.</p></speech>

That means that anyone who accesses the ad in the future would see the original statement and the fact-checked correction.

One of the criticisms is around the lag time between the ad being fact checked and all those people who have already seen the original, and the fact that the correction is not sent to those who have already viewed the original ad.</p></speech>

Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people.  We believe this decision should not be compromised by money. [...] This isn't about free expression.  This is about paying for reach.

It was very good to hear from Dr. Bickert that despite that amount of money, financial incentives do not play any role in the decision to refuse to take down false political ads.  She has repeatedly said that her company, Facebook, is not in a position to decide if a lie is a lie or not.  If that is the case and if financial motivation does not play any role, I am still struggling to understand what exactly prevents Facebook from deciding that it will not run paid political ads and that it will not be a platform that can be used for amplifying the lies.</p></speech>

I thank them all for coming here today.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise our guests that any submission or opening statement they make to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The format of the meeting will be the same as previous sessions.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to share details of the role of the Irish Data Protection Commission, DPC, and position in relation to the regulation of online platforms.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that despite the great benefits and access to more and more information the Internet has provided all of us with, it also presents significant challenges to our rights and freedoms in how it now operates.  The challenge of combating disinformation in many contexts, such as during electoral cycles or in, for example, public health scenarios is a pressing issue of our time given the negative consequences for democracies and societal well-being.</p> <p>  Issues of harmful and-or illegal content and disinformation are issues that stretch well outside of the scope of the data protection legal framework.  Data protection is predicated on a fundamental right of individuals to have their personal data protected and, as a result, the remedies individuals may avail of under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, require the personal data of that specific individual to have been processed.</p> <p>  The DPC is very pleased to have an opportunity for interaction during this panel with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as the DPC has this year responded to his consultation on the regulation of harmful online content and the implementation of the audiovisual media services directive.  In the context of making a submission to that consultation, the DPC clarified that it supported the Irish Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendation in their 2016 report on harmful communications and online safety that a dedicated office with a statutory responsibility to promote online safety and to oversee and regulate a system of takedown orders for harmful digital communications should be considered.</p><p>The DPC, however, has responsibility for a number of areas of regulatory activity that relate directly to the theme of the hearing and are relevant to the panel.</p><p> First, it is possible that content relating to a specific individual posted online may be harmful to the individual or may contain false information about the individual.  In such circumstances, the individual may be able personally to exercise his or her data protection rights, in particular to erasure and rectification.  In circumstances where a platform does not comply with a request to exercise data protection rights by an individual, the individual may make a complaint to the DPC, following which we will take the matter up as appropriate on his or her behalf.  Equally, however, it is worth recalling that Article 85 of the GDPR requires a reconciliation of the right to freedom of expression with the exercise of data protection rights, and therefore they are not absolute rights.  The majority of complaints the DPC receives in respect of platforms are complaints about erasure.</p><p> Another issue of significance is the role that personal data play in a social media context through facilitating the so-called micro targeting of individuals with specific content, thereby amplifying any harmful effects of disinformation.  In such a scenario, the profile a platform has created of a user and the categorisation of that user as being of a certain lifestyle, passion or habit may allow an undecided voter in an election context to be pushed in one direction or the other.  All of this may happen without the user being aware his or her data are being deployed to reinforce the individual&rsquo;s existing viewpoint rather than the individual being in a position to take an objectively informed stance based on an understanding of both sides of an issue.  Given the rates of online users who consume their news exclusively on social media, this is a concern.  As a data protection authority, we have a number of ongoing investigations into how the online behavioural advertising system operates and whether in all respects it is in compliance with the GDPR, especially in respect of lawfulness and transparency to users.  In this regard, we have investigations open into platforms, data brokers and advertisement exchanges, which will conclude in 2020.</p><p> The issue of children and other vulnerable Internet users being subject to disinformation and harmful content somewhat overlaps with the protection of children&rsquo;s personal data in an online context.  To protect children, whether in respect of their personal data or to protect them from harmful content, presupposes that children can be identified as such on the Internet.  To date, a systemic solution to age verification online that protects younger users but leaves the Internet open and accessible to all has been elusive.  The DPC has watched with interest the attempts in the UK under the Digital Economy Act 2017 to impose age verification measures for access to legal online pornography.  That the legal provisions have not proceeded to implementation simply underlines how difficult it is to find a solution that meets all requirements.  The DPC has run a consultation over the past year on the protection of children&rsquo;s data, including a consultation directly with children through their schools and youth centres.  The DPC will next month publish a guidance note based on the outcomes of that consultation, proposing ideas and criteria that data controllers need to take into account when implementing mechanisms to identify and protect children online.</p><p> Finally, I raise an issue of interest to the committee, namely, that of how to foster international collaboration.  As an EU data protection authority, the commission is bound in close legal co-operation with all other European Economic Area data protection authorities.  Indeed, we meet in Brussels weekly.  In addition, the DPC is a member of the Global Privacy Assembly, has signed memoranda of understanding with a number of global data protection authorities, and this year we have been visited at our Dublin offices by a large number of other commissioners, including the New Zealand, Icelandic, Australian and UK commissioners.  The dialogue and the opportunity to discuss regulatory approaches and solutions to issues of common concern are invaluable in shaping better outcomes in our regulatory role.</p><p> I look forward to the panel discussion and questions from committee members.</p></speech>

I am head of the unit responsible for media convergence and social media policy at DG Connect.  Respect for democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law are core values of the European Union.  They bind us together and underpin the functioning of our institutions.  President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has announced that protecting European democracy will be a priority of the new Commission and underlined we must do more to protect our democratic processes and institutions from external interference.  Disinformation poses major challenges to our democracy as new technologies can be used, notably through social media, to disseminate disinformation on a scale and at a speed that are unprecedented.  They can create personalised information spheres and become powerful echo chambers for disinformation campaigns, polarise the public debate, and create tensions in society.  Media manipulation, however, and the strategic use of disinformation are not the exclusive prerogative of foreign actors.  Domestic actors, too, can exploit digital technology to interfere in electoral processes and, increasingly, to manipulate policy debates in areas such as climate change, migration, public security, health and finance.</p> <p>  While the conduct of free and fair elections is primarily a responsibility of member states, the cross-border dimension of efforts to manipulate democracy, as well as the importance of joined-up efforts to address such threats, make a European approach necessary.  What affects one member state affects us all.  The Commission, along with other EU institutions, has put in place a robust framework for co-ordinated actions against disinformation, with full respect for European values and fundamental rights.  We often mention free speech, freedom of association, press freedom, and pluralism, which are fundamental principles that need to be kept in mind.</p> <p>  Our work on combating disinformation has evolved over three major, interlinked initiatives.  Last December, the Commission adopted an action plan against disinformation, a plan that builds on the communication on tackling online disinformation and was adopted in April 2018.  Furthermore, in September 2018, the Commission put forward a comprehensive election package, setting out a variety of measures, with a focus on what were then the upcoming elections to the European Parliament.</p> <p>  Broadly speaking, the work carried out in recent months centred on the strength of action.  First, we improved the EU capability to identify and counter disinformation via our strategic communication task forces and the EU hybrid fusion cell, which operates within the European External Action Service.  Second, we supported member states by setting up a rapid alert system to facilitate the exchange of information between member states and the EU institutions.  The system has become a reference point for national authorities and a mechanism for strength and co-operation with platforms.  It also links up and facilitates co-operation with other international partners, not least the G7 and NATO.  Third, in the run-up to the European Parliament elections, we closely monitored the implementation of the code of practice on disinformation, to which the major online platforms signed up in October 2018.  The platforms, in particular Facebook, Google and Twitter, were subject to a programme of targeted monitoring that required them to report each month from January to May, inclusive, on the progress made on the implementation of their commitments under the code.</p> <p>  The monitoring was carried out in co-operation with the audiovisual authorities of the member states, the ERGA.  It focused on those actions that held particular relevance to the integrity of elections, namely, actions to disrupt the advertising and democratisation incentives for purveyors of disinformation; to ensure the integrity of the platform services against inauthentic behaviour, including fake accounts and malicious bots; and to ensure the transparency of political advertising.  In the final respect, searchable political advertising libraries were created and they resulted, for the first time insofar as online political advertising is concerned, in a better view of the identity of the sponsors, the amount spent and the basic targeting criteria used in the campaigns.</p> <p>  The fourth strand of actions included a number of initiatives directed to improve societal resistance to disinformation.</p><p>One of the aspects on which I wish to focus is the effort to promote media literacy, which is important to enable citizens to evaluate the credibility of information they encounter online and access alternative points of view when they navigate on social networks.  In the long run, media literacy initiatives may prepare users of online platforms and social media to better understand the effects of disinformation and the malicious actors with which they may be confronted.</p><p> We are facilitating the creation of a European multidisciplinary community of fact checkers and academic researchers.  The programme will arrive in 2020.  The Commission has supported investments in new technologies for content verification and network analysis through social media.  It has also launched a new platform, the Social Observatory for Disinformation and Social Media Analysis, SOMA, to facilitate networking, knowledge exchange and best practices among independent fact checkers.  The Commission will follow this up by founding a new digital infrastructure entitled the European Digital Media Observatory, which will offer tools and networking possibilities to link fact checkers and academic researchers to improve their understanding of the phenomenon and to exercise better oversight of the dynamics that disinformation shows online.  </p><p> Disinformation is a multifaceted phenomenon, which requires a multidimensional response.  Our preliminary view is that all the efforts I mentioned have contributed to narrow the space for malicious activities online.  On 29 October, we published a report that takes stock of the self-assessment reports prepared by the signatories of the code of practice.  Our initial view is that it is a mild kind of assessment.  After all, the recent elections to the European Commission were not free from disinformation and malign actors constantly change their strategies.  As such, we need to strive to be ahead of them.  The evolution of the code is ongoing.  When the full evaluation has been carried out, we will see what further actions are necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marc Rotenberg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#Y00200"><p>My organisation, the Electronic Privacy and Information Centre, EPIC, was established 25 years ago to focus public attention on emerging privacy issues.  More than a decade ago, we worked with an organisation entitled Facebook Users Against the New Terms of Service.  It was an international campaign joined by more than 150,000 people on the Facebook platform to oppose changes in the company's policies that would diminish personal privacy.  As a consequence of the campaign, in 2009 Facebook gave commitments to its users that it would allow them to actively participate and vote on changes in its business practices.  At the time, this was viewed as a great success and a demonstration of how Internet governance could promote democratic principles.  However, Facebook reneged on its commitments and backed off on its agreement to allow users to vote.  Chillingly, it shut down the political organisations, including the Facebook Users Against the New Terms of Service group and prohibited the use of the company's name in any user group on the platform.  I bring this story to the attention of the committee because there has been much reference to Facebook and free expression.  I know from ten years ago the company's view on free expression.</p> <p>  Thereafter, EPIC and a group of consumer privacy organisations in the US went to the FTC and laid a charge that the changes in the company's business practices violated US trade law and, specifically, were unfair and deceptive.  We spent two years persuading the FTC to act on our complaint.  We provided evidence, legal analysis and the blueprint for the remedies that the FTC announced in November 2011.  Once again, we thought we had obtained a victory.  The then chairman of the FTC pointed to the settlement with Facebook and stated the company would be held to account.  When FTC commissioners appeared before the US Congress and in Europe, they pointed to the Facebook settlement as evidence that the US had effective protection for personal data.  However, we almost immediately became aware of a problem, namely, that the FTC was unwilling to enforce its legal judgment.</p> <p>  In a related case, Google changed its business practice in violation of a consent order.  We sued the FTC and stated that it must exercise its enforcement authority to protect users.  The judge was sympathetic to our case but concluded that she did not have the authority to force the commission to take the action it should have taken in 2012.</p> <p>  We have spent many years trying to get the FTC to act against Facebook.  During that time, complaints from many other consumer organisations and users have increased and include complaints about the use of personal data, the tracking of people who are not Facebook users and the tracking of Facebook users who are no longer on the platform.  A request lodged by EPIC under the US Freedom of Information Act uncovered that 29,000 complaints were pending against the company.  The FTC issued a judgment in June of this year against Facebook, accompanied by a historic fine of &euro;5 billion.  However, the FTC left Facebook's business practices in place and the users of the service at risk.</p> <p>  My message to the committee is simple: it must act.  It must not wait ten years or one year to take action against this company.  The terms of the GDPR must be enforced against Facebook and that should be done now.  Facebook should be required to divest of WhatsApp not because of a scheme to break up big tech but, rather, because the company violated its commitments to protect the data of WhatsApp users as a condition of the acquisition.  Until adequate legal safeguards are established, Facebook must be prohibited from engaging in political advertising.  Its recently stated views on political advertising and the US First Amendment, which are not shared by US legal scholars, are reckless and irresponsible.  Advertising revenue from political candidates should instead flow to traditional media organisations, which would help to support independent journalism.</p></speech>

The background to the regulatory environment in Ireland is very much set in our broad plan on online safety.  It involves several Departments, including the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Justice and Equality, Health, Taoiseach, Children and Youth Affairs, and Education and Skills.  I am a former Minister of the latter Department, which provides strong online support mechanisms for students and schools.  The plan has a broad base.  The principles of what we are trying to do are clear and well set out in the committee's documentation.  They include transparency, accountability and protecting citizens while also respecting freedom of expression.</p> <p>  The devil is in the detail when it comes to regulation.  There are several main regulatory developments under way in Ireland.  I could name at least six.  The regulation of harmful online content, to which I will return, is being pursued by my Department.  The Department of Justice and Equality is facilitating a consultation on the regulation of hate speech and hate crime.  Regulation of transparency of political advertising has been developed in the context of an electoral commission that is being drafted and that will deal with the regulation of elections, including funding, which is another element.  Private Members' legislation supported by the Government has proposed the creation of new criminal offences relating to images displayed without consent.</p><p>Stronger protections relating to cybersecurity and cyberattacks are also relevant to my area.  The approach we are taking to online safety, for which I am directly responsible, is not dissimilar to that being taken in Australia.  We propose to define harmful content, require companies to have a code of practice and put an online safety commissioner in place to oversee the delivery of those codes of practice.  That online safety commissioner would receive third party complaints and could, on his or her own initiative, require takedown or notify companies that their code was inadequate.  Non-compliance with the directions of an online safety commissioner would be a crime and the commissioner could publish details of non co-operation.  That legislation is in development and we have had consultations on it, as Ms Dixon indicated.</p><p> Consultations are also ongoing on the area of hate speech.  There are issues around that and the characteristics of certain groups that have been defined.  Some argue that the bar is very high under the existing incitement to hatred legislation.  The definition of "hatred" in that legislation stipulates that an intention or likelihood to stir up hatred must be demonstrated.  We are also considering whether such laws adequately deal with online content.  Those issues are being developed.</p><p> This week, the Government announced the initiation of legislation to deal with political advertising, which will define political advertising, require its clear identification and labelling, and require the disclosure of any targeting or engagement metrics being used.  There is quite a bit of legislative initiative under development.  We also need to educate people and equip them with the right tools to help them be discerning in their use of the Internet.  That balance is very strong.</p><p> There is no doubt that the power of the Internet is accelerating.  When I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, we discussed aspects such as social, mobile, the cloud, and big data.  It has now moved on to the Internet of things and AI.  Principles of operation will be embedded within those areas, which should be subject to regulation.  This is a very tricky area for governments and it is absolutely essential that we work together across countries.  Media and politics are at the front line of this invasiveness, but it will start to move into other areas of our lives.  We need to decide the principles underpinning the roles of artificial intelligence, big data, micro targeting and so on.  This is a challenging area and this initiative is worthwhile in bringing countries together to be a part of this group.</p></speech>

This initiative is aimed at building up co-operation and constructive relations, particularly as regards access to the data that are necessary for analysing disinformation trends and threats, and better understanding the impact of policies on the phenomenon.  As such, the platforms must be external to this co-operation.</p></speech>

We heard evidence earlier that when an ad is fact-checked, there is no mechanism for getting back to people who have viewed something that may contain lies or disinformation.  The fact check does not go back to the people who have already viewed that ad.  Is there an avenue to request or put pressure on Facebook to take that very simple step?  It is really extraordinary that it has not done so.</p></speech>

This should apply not only to sponsored content or political ads, but to all information that has been fact-checked and discovered to be false.  This is not a question of public authorities - much less private companies - exercising censorship; it is a question of duly informing consumers.  This mechanism should enable users' awareness of the type of content to which they have been exposed.  Consumer empowerment is part of the fourth pillar of the code, which is now being implemented.  Priority was given to other parts of the code during the first months of this year as they related more directly to the integrity of the elections.  Those include the fight against bots and fake accounts and other malicious or co-ordinated actions.  For the first time, a transparency space will be created for political ads where the question is not the veracity of the ads.  The question is who is paying for them, how much they are paying, and what the targeting criteria are.  It will also monitor and track advertising revenues to avoid the monetisation of bad actors.</p></speech>

In his presentation, he gave a snapshot of what has happened with the various decisions and rulings that have been handed down, which Facebook and others that should be in a position to enforce seem to have simply ignored.  Based on the discussions I have been having over the past few days, that view seems to be shared by many.  Mr. Rotenberg spoke of his own recommendations.  Does he think the business model needs to be changed?</p></speech>

Facebook should be prohibited from using the platform for political advertising today.  That is a concrete action that is supported by plenty of evidence.  Other companies are already doing it.</p> <p>  I will make a further point, in partial response to Ms Brown's first question to Mr. Cesarini.  A good friend of mine, the former European Data Protection Supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli, who recently passed away, addressed the issue of election integrity last spring.  He made a very important point.  He said that, in his view, transparency and content management will not be sufficient to solve this problem.  This is about the collection and use of personal data.  If our aim is to safeguard the integrity of elections and to limit fake news, we must enforce these privacy obligations.  Transparency will not be a substitute for doing so.  Mr. Buttarelli was exactly correct on that.</p></speech>

The urgent need to forbid Facebook from accepting political advertisements has been mentioned.  It has been suggested that there is a need for regulation in this area.  I wonder how it is envisaged that it would be possible to make such a distinction.  If we say that political advertisements are not allowed on Facebook, should we proceed to say the same in respect of television and newspapers?  How can this distinction be made?  As lawmakers, how can we forbid political advertisements in one case by regulating, as opposed to their own self-regulation?</p></speech>

By tradition, we regulated political advertisements.  We required people in print and broadcast media to identify the source of their advertising.  Facebook quite brazenly claimed it was unnecessary for Internet companies to be bound by the same obligations that apply to print and broadcast media.  It removed itself from what traditional journalists and news organisations were required to do.  I believe this accelerated the trend towards fake news and disinformation.  My view at this point is that the time has long since passed for Facebook to come before this committee to say what type of regulation it thinks it will find acceptable.  There is enough reason now to say this is one place where we no longer need political advertising, which is a source of significant revenue.  It could help to support independent media, which needs the support.</p></speech>

During a previous session, we heard from representatives of Twitter, which has decided - without any new revelation - that it will no longer allow political advertisements to run.</p> <p>  I would like to put some questions to Mr. Cesarini.  Before the European Parliament elections, the EU worked with online platforms on the basis of the code of practice.  How can that be evolved?  What is the conclusion?  Shall we continue with a similar formula?  What were the main problems with the code of practice?</p></speech>

I cannot anticipate the conclusions that will be known to the next Commission, which is now carrying out caretaking duties but is unable to take political decisions on the next step forward.  This moment will come very soon, early next year.  My view is that today we are in a better place than we were a year ago.  It is clear that much more needs to be done as well.  There are several areas we may need to consider.  I will not mention them all.  As we are focusing in today's debate on political advertising, I remind the committee that the devil lies in the details.  I refer, for example, to the definition of "political advertising".  What would the ban be about?  What about sponsored content that communicates on social, political and economic issues that do not come within electoral contests and, therefore, escape the definition?  We are well aware that such content can influence and shape public opinion artificially and in a much more pernicious way in the long term.  These complex questions need to be taken in their integrity and in their totality.</p></speech>

If I am correct, the rapid alert system that was put in place before the European Parliament elections was never triggered during the campaigning period.  Was it not needed because there were no disinformation campaigns?  Does Mr. Cesarini envisage that we will continue with a rapid alert system that will alert us if something bad is happening on social media?</p></speech>

It had the merit of creating links and connecting dots that had been completely separate and did not communicate between one another at the level of the different member states.  Each member state has a different authority that deals with issues concerning electoral integrity and disinformation attacks.  While it is true that the rapid alert system has issued just one alert, an increasing flow of information is being exchanged.  This shows and demonstrates the usefulness of the tool.  It certainly needs to be developed, especially in terms of agreeing common methodologies, discussing the thresholds for triggering an alert and having better ways of co-operating with platforms, particularly when disinformation leads to investigations into groups that co-ordinate their behaviour and, therefore, require the intervention of specialised authorities within the structures of member states.</p></speech>

Fact-checking is an important part of the growing problem of false media and fake news on the Internet.  It is a difficult question when there is clear fake news and when we should somehow verify where the limit is.  There is no one truth in the world when it comes to difficult and controversial questions such as climate warming.  It is very difficult to say what is fact and what is not.  I ask Mr. Cesarini to speak about what the SOMA project is doing.  How are the things it is working on chosen?  I would like to open up this question.  How is the project seen in the European Commission?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paolo Cesarini" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#AA01200"><p>I agree fully that fact-checking is not a silver bullet.  Nevertheless, there is a need to create more clarity about the trustworthiness of the information space within which we experience our access to news on a daily basis.  Fact checkers can make an important contribution that has to remain independent from any public interference.  The initiative must come from the media sector.  The SOMA project is helping fact-checking organisations that have been growing over the past couple of years, having entered this newly emerging market, to work together to avoid duplications, to learn from one another and to develop fact-checking in a proper way.  Mr. Packal&eacute;n's question raises the important question of where to draw the limits between news and views, or between what is false and what is real.  It would be a dangerous move to concentrate on the idea of regulating content.  We have to focus much more of our attention on detecting, analysing, preventing and, where necessary, sanctioning online behaviours that are systematically directed towards the amplification of certain stories and narratives and that use the vulnerabilities that exist in the current digital media ecosystem to mislead the users of such media by making them believe that a certain story has popular support when, in fact, it does not.  We need to hide the authors and vectors that have been helping this manipulation to happen.</p><p>In other terms, we should be much more focused when we talk about regulation and much more concerned about the conduct than the content, although the content FactCheck has provided and the analysis it has carried out are important in order to provide leads to identify the kinds of conduct that could be reprehensible in a regulatory framework.</p></speech>

Is there communication?  If so, how much?</p></speech>

The code of practice is their own code of practice; the Commissioner has acted as a facilitator.  Without the intervention of the Commission, the code of practice probably would not be there.  However, the implementation of these principles remains entirely within the responsibility of the signatories to the code.  The Commission has the very precise role of an independent oversighter - I do not know whether that word exists - to exercise oversight over the actions taken and then to take the appropriate steps on its own, using the powers that can be used in this tricky field, in order to ensure that the objectives that underpin the code are actually achieved.</p></speech>

For example, the general data protection regulation provides for something new called joint enforcement operations.  We have not really got them off the ground yet in the EU in terms of data protection authorities lending resources to one another that can be authorised on investigations, so there is lots of room for improvement there.  Regarding co-operation with the big platforms, the relationship is one of regulator to regulated entities.  The regulated entities are obliged under the GDPR to co-operate with investigations conducted by the data protection authority.  To date, the 21 big tech organisations in respect of which we have large-scale investigations open are engaging and co-operating.  With equal measure they are challenging at every turn and seeking constant clarifications on due process.  They are obliged under various measures under the GDPR, for example, to conduct data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances and to consult with us as a data protection authority where they identify high risks they can mitigate and so on.  Again, that form of co-operation with, or submission to, the regulator is already in effect.  What remains to be seen is how the investigations we currently have open will conclude and whether there will ultimately be compliance with the outcomes of those investigations or whether they will be subject to lengthy challenge and so on.  The big question of whether we will be able in the near term to drive the kinds of outcomes we want is still open and awaits us as a data protection authority to put down the first final decisions in a number of cases.</p></speech>

Preventative measures are very much important and sometimes it is much more important to prevent new harmful actions on social networks.  To what extent are they flexible, and are they willing at all to co-operate actively on effective measures?</p></speech>

From our point of view, it is a very good platform over which we can regulate.  All organisations, including the platforms, despite how large they are and the resources they have, have an issue understanding with any degree of certainty how these principles should be applied in specific scenarios.  For example, the GDPR for the first time now in the EU calls out that children merit specific protections in a data protection context, but it really gives us no clues as to what those specific protections should look like.  I mentioned earlier the challenge of even knowing how to identify children on platforms without limiting the rights of adult users or making platforms inaccessible.  It is a challenging question.  We find when we engage in exercises such as the consultation we have run on protections for children's data that the platforms are willing to come forward, make submissions and engage in ideas to ultimately find solutions that work across the board and drive up the levels of protection.</p></speech>

I asked it during our morning session and I will ask Ms Dixon the same question.  Some items of information collected by big social platforms are provided by consumers themselves.  I believe that in many cases people are not aware when they provide and share information of the possible usage of that information in the future.  I am very much interested in Ms Dixon's opinion on this.  What does she think?  Should social platforms and the big social media companies be responsible for informing people before they share their personal data on a network?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1661" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#BB01300"><p>Probably the first large-scale investigation we will conclude under the GDPR is one into the principle of transparency and involving one of the large platforms.  We will shortly make a decision spelling out in detail how compliance with the transparency obligations under Articles 12 to 14, inclusive, of the GDPR should look in that context, but it is very clear that users are typically unaware.  For example, some of the large platforms do have capabilities for users to opt out completely of personalised ad serving, but most users are not aware of this.  There are also patterns in operation that nudge users in certain directions.  Aside from the hard enforcement cases we will take, we also published guidance recently on, for example, that issue of how users are being nudged to make choices that are perhaps more privacy-invasive than choices they might otherwise make if they were more aware.  There is a role for us as a regulatory authority in regulating the platforms as well as driving awareness among users.  It is an uphill battle, though, given the scale of what users face.</p></speech>

She put very well some of the concerns a number of people have articulated about the business model when she said in her testimony, "All of this may happen without the user being aware his or her own data are being deployed to reinforce the individual's existing viewpoint rather than the individual being in a position to take an objectively formed stance based on an understanding of both sides of an issue."  In other words, this is having the consequence of an increasingly self-reinforcing polarisation.  Ms Dixon went on to say her office is looking at "whether [the online behavioural advertising system] is in compliance with the GDPR, especially in respect of lawfulness and transparency to users".  In coming to conclusions on this, is any decision the commission makes binding on all of Europe?  Is the decision the commission has to make an all-Europe one?  Ms Dixon made the point that the GDPR is a very good, broad, principles-based regulation.  Does it give her the powers to address some of these issues if she feels there is a real lawfulness or transparency issue in the consequences of this characteristic of the platforms?</p></speech>

However, I did mention in response to the last question that there is a demand from controllers of all types for more certainty as to what the correct objective standard in application of the principles looks like.</p><p>We anticipate that any of the decisions we make in these larger scale cross-border investigations will serve as a precedent and will be followed by others, not least because they will wish to avoid enforcement action subsequently being taken against them on similar issues.  It is important to be aware that when we are applying the principles to something like online behavioural advertising, we must go back to what Mr. Rotenberg was saying about underlying business models.  The GDPR is not set up to tackle business models <i>per se</i>but to apply principles to data processing operations.  When we come to look at something like advertising technology or online behavioural advertising, there is, therefore, a complexity in that we have to target multiple actors.  I mentioned earlier that for that reason we are looking at publishers at the front end that start the data collection from users.  It is when we first click on a website that the tracking technologies such as pixels, cookies and social plug-ins start the data collection that ultimately ends up categorising us for the purposes of sponsored stories or ad serving.  We are looking at the advertisement exchanges, the real-time bidding system, the front-end publishers and the advertisement brokers that play an important part in all of this in combining offline and online sources of data.  We will rigorously apply the principles against those data processing operations.  When we conclude we will then have to see if that adds up to a changing of the underlying business model.  The jury is out on that until we conclude.</p></speech>

On that issue, if the GDPR directive does not sufficiently address some of the underlying principles or approach in the business model, is the European Commission looking at how the e-commerce directive might provide further support if there is a desire within the European Parliament and Council for that sort of approach?  This spring the Spanish data protection agency temporarily banned micro targeting in political advertising, although the decision has been withdrawn pending an appeal.  From the European Commission's perspective, has any individual data protection regulator taken action to initiate a ban on micro targeting, whether in political advertising or another sector?  Is there a fundamental difficulty with doing that?</p></speech>

What can be done in the perspective of the review of the e-commerce directive would point more towards the issue of fairness in a commercial relationship than to the legitimate use of personal data for micro targeting purposes, which is within the realm of the GDPR.  One point I would like to stress is that micro targeting is only one of the possible vulnerabilities of the ecosystem.  When we talk about disinformation, clickbait, which works by directing traffic into a malicious website, operates in a different way.  Micro targeting is typical for sponsored content and that is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed.  Then there are other issues that are not necessarily data-driven or are not so linked to the use of personal data.  For instance, the manipulation of media for amplification purposes where bot accounts behave in a co-ordinated manner and the trade of engagement indices or signals in the black market are not necessarily linked to the manipulation of personal data.  Another issue about personal data may appear in the area of algorithmic bias.  When the recommendation system operates in order to provide the user with certain recommendations, there we have an issue again with the usage of personal data.</p></speech>

I have two questions, one for the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the Irish environment and the new proposals, and one for the panel as a whole on regulatory enforcement.  I welcomed the announcements this week and the Minister alluded to a number of other proposed measures.  I look forward to reviewing the details of those when they are published.  One of the findings of the committee in its discussions today and in some of the preliminary discussions yesterday has been that we should not delay because, as Mr. Rotenberg said, delay only suits the platforms.  There is an urgency about all of this.  Our Canadian colleagues told us yesterday that we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good but must plough on and take steps.  That point was well made.  We may not take the final step but we must take the first steps and every step forward is progress.  In that vein, on the proposals the Minister mentioned, two Private Members' Bills that deal with these matters are before the committee.  These are the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017 and the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017, which I proposed.  Both of these Bills have undergone detailed scrutiny on First and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It would be prudent to consider these as vehicles to make progress, even if they are superseded by Government legislation.  That would certainly fit the theme we discussed of making rapid progress and putting something in place rather than letting more elections take place in the absence of action.  Perhaps the Minister will respond before I put a question to the panel. </p></speech>

We will look at how we accommodate those.  Nonetheless, getting legislation through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel requires the Attorney General's sanction for the different elements.  A number of elements of these Private Members' Bills run into significant problems.  While we can transpose significant blocks of these Bills in our legislation, we also have to change significant blocks of it.  The difficulty is that I have to get someone to stamp the legislation.  I am exerting maximum pressure to have exactly what the Deputy says done.  He is correct that the best is the enemy of the good and there will always be a reason to have another legal assessment done of this or that aspect of legislation.  I am trying to avoid that scenario and trying to hit the end of the year deadline I have set.</p></speech>

It is part of the electoral legislation.  I am sure the Minister will seek to adopt the principles set out in the Bill.

Those requirements will have to be set out in legislative form so I expect there is a bit of work left in that.</p></speech>

I have a brief question for the panel.  We are attempting to formulate regulation and legislation and while some countries have had more success than others in that regard, we are all moving in that direction.  However, enforcement is the key to legislation and regulatory activity in any sphere.  The Data Protection Commissioner has had some success in enforcement and has acquired some additional powers.  One of the difficulties, however, and one to which the Minister alluded to in his opening remarks, is that this area tends to fall across a number of different Departments and agencies.  What is the most appropriate model?  Is it a multi-agency response?  Is it a dedicated agency being tasked with online regulation?  Is it a first on the scene type scenario?  What is the best practice or what have the witnesses seen work best?</p></speech>

I have taught privacy law and have two different case books.  All roads lead to the GDPR.  I say this for three reasons.  First, the GDPR is not a set of principles but a set of rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal data.  When companies choose to collect personal data, they should be held to account.  Second, the decision in the Schrems case of 2015 makes clear that while co-ordinated enforcement anticipated under the GDPR is important, individual data protection authorities, DPAs, have their own authority to enforce the provisions of the charter, which means individual DPAs do not need to wait for a co-ordinated response to bring an enforcement action.</p><p>My final point is a matter of law.  The GDPR contains the authority within its text to enforce the other laws of the European Union.  This is largely about the misuse in the collection and use of personal data for micro targeting.  That problem can be addressed with the GDPR but it will take an urgent response and not a long-term game plan.</p></speech>

Ireland is no stranger to attempts of foreign interference, as was seen in the May 2018 referendum when some civil society organisations tracked various inauthentic accounts and suggested that up to 70% of them came from across the Atlantic on the basis of time zones.  How has the experience with foreign interference altered or informed the approach to designing the online safety legislation?  Are there concerns that once the legislation is passed, the online safety commissioner is in place and the various processes are working, those processes might be used by foreign actors to interfere with domestic matters?</p> <p>  In the previous session I was quite struck by the assertion from Dr. Bickert from Facebook that even if this proposed Act, the safety commission and the processes provide directives and measures for content to be removed or adjusted, Facebook would test these directions against its internal policies.  Does the Minister have a view on what this means for the operation of that legislation?  We have had some arguments as to whether the fundamental problem is the underlying business model of the social platforms.  Does the Minister have a view on the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#DD00300"><p>There is no doubt there was an attempt to interfere in some of the referenda and in those instances it was a voluntary take-down policy that was adopted by platforms rather than a legal provision.  I spelled out earlier that aside from the requirement to have transparency around political advertising, the reporting of targeting and so on, much broader legislation will cover the funding of referenda in particular.  We have ceilings on funding for individual candidates and parties but funding from overseas is not regulated.  Foreign donations to Irish political organisations are banned and a lacuna will need to be addressed.</p> <p>  The legislation I am introducing is limited to harmful content such as cyberbullying of individuals rather than the addressing of political fake news or distortion of views.  We are not designing it in that way and we are defining harmful content in quite a narrow way.  We are working on how such definitions can evolve over time in a way that is legally robust.  That will have to come back in some form to the Legislature and an online safety commissioner cannot create that legislation.  We must devise a vehicle for that.</p> <p>  It is a fact that any online platform operating in Ireland must respect Irish law and would find itself with enforcement action against it in an Irish court if it failed to do so.  There is no doubt that these Acts can be enforced.</p></speech>

That is why I asked the second question as to whether the Minister had concerns around issues covered in the proposals for this online safety effort.  From our perspective, such issues may well be exploited for political gain through foreign interference.  Does the Minister have any comment to make?</p></speech>

We have been working on a narrower definition of creating legislation that would require companies to have codes and an online commissioner to vet those codes.  There would be a power to serve notice on platforms where a code is deficient in some respects.  The crime would be created if there was a failure to comply with notices.  That is the structure we are seeking to put in place.  We have not identified in that work foreign interference as being a feature of this legislation, although it would be with some of the more politically orientated legislation.</p></speech>

I am looking at this from the perspective of somebody who is worried that the big tech companies are beginning to see themselves as nation states, in effect.  That is not an overstatement.  One of the very few successes we have had in the United Kingdom is getting adequate resources, staffing and money to the authorities to take on their responsibilities.  If the UK Information Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Denham, were here today I am sure she would confirm that.  It was quite a struggle within the British Parliament but I believe she feels she is adequately looked after.</p> <p>  I am concerned that a number of nations are engaging in a dangerous tension between going out of their way to get investment income from big tech companies while not looking at the investment required to regulate those companies they have actively encouraged to come to this or that country.  It is a real worry.  Does Ms Dixon absolutely believe her office has the resources to take on the responsibilities that in effect it is taking on for the European Union to regulate the companies already in Dublin?</p></speech>

We started with approximately 27 staff when I came on board at the end of 2014 and we now have over 140.  The composition of the staff has changed significantly in that we have hired top class lawyers, litigators, technology experts and investigators.  We are in a radically different position.  We have just had the budget for 2020 announced last month.  I made a submission on the resources I anticipated I would need in 2020 as part of that budgetary process.  Ultimately, we secured significantly less than what we sought for 2020.  However, we secured increased resources for next year that will allow me to recruit an additional 30 to 35 experts to the staff.  I should say that in that context, even if 140 sounds like a relatively modest number, we are among the top tier of highly resourced data protection authorities both in the EU and globally.</p> <p>  I agree with the statement.  We do not have enough and that is why we sought more.  We see the scale of the challenge more clearly than anybody else can see it in terms of what we face.  All of these hard enforcement cases we are trying to drive in the investigations we have open are extremely labour-intensive in terms of the process we must follow.  I mentioned that we are being challenged and questioned at every turn.  We need more resources and this must see continued investment as an area of regulation.</p></speech>

I cannot think of a better invitation to populism than that.  The Minister referred to draft legislation or the development of such legislation.  An election will certainly come next year so is there a chance the legislation will be put in place?  Our experience in the United Kingdom is that we badly dropped the ball.  We are having an election right now with nothing like the recommendations the British Electoral Commission suggested are needed to have a fair and free election.</p><p>My concern is this.  If the results of the UK election are contested, that would set up a time bomb in democracies throughout Europe, which would be very difficult to control.</p></speech>

As for, artificial intelligence, I read a book by Mr. Jamie Susskind, a US writer who has written about the processes embedded in artificial intelligence that will determine things like our right to get insurance and jobs.  The political and governance system, in Ireland and internationally, has not yet caught up with this and struck a balance between freedom of expression and regulation.  These are complex issues.  The problem is not a lack of willingness to find solutions.  I have found that even the narrow aspect I am trying to deal with, the definition of harmful content, is quite tricky to regulate in a way that balances freedom of expression with the need to protect citizens, particularly vulnerable citizens, from its abuse.  It is not as simple as governments not bringing resources to bear.  These are genuinely tricky issues.  We need international co-operation in the design of a robust and enforceable response.  While it is important to ask whether sufficient resources are being devoted to the enforcement of existing legislation, many of these challenges are far more profound than that.  The regulators have not quite caught up and learned how to design these systems.</p></speech>

That is why a lot of work has gone into this and it is being led from the Taoiseach's office.  There is no doubt that the importance of this is recognised.  Equally, we recognise that what we do is interdependent with what colleague nations are doing.  We need to work together in designing systems that will be enforceable, robust and consistent across geographies.  As Lord Puttnam rightly said, these are not nation state companies.  These are companies for whom we, to are large extent, are the product and they transcend boundaries.  That is the greater challenge, not the issue of finding resources to enforce well designed policy instruments.</p></speech>

Mr. Rotenberg has argued that the $5 billion settlement concluded by the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, with Facebook was insufficient, saying it was too little, too late.  I have raised similar concerns, saying that this fine was essentially a speeding ticket that will not help consumers and that the remedy in this case will not serve as an effective form of deterrence.  Can Mr. Rotenberg describe for us what an effective remedy in that case might have looked like?</p></speech>

In our statement to the FTC prior to the judgment, we set out several proposals.  We said that effective data protection standards should be imposed on the company.  The FTC has failed to do that.  Second, we said that WhatsApp and Instagram should be divested from the company, not because of any grand political philosophy but because Facebook violated its commitments to protect those user data.  We had additional recommendations with regards to civil rights issues, which are widely discussed in the United States.  These proposals were not taken on board and as the Representative says, the settlement is a speeding ticket.</p></speech>

A key point, which I believe was made on an earlier panel, is that the vast majority of this information is not collected directly from the user.  This is particularly true with Facebook.  Users are tracked across the Internet, which makes notice, consent and transparency mechanisms effectively useless.</p></speech>

It seems increasingly clear that this combination is lethal for our democracy.  There was a reason AT&amp;T was never allowed to surveil the conversations of telephone users to sell them advertisements.  What problems does Mr. Rotenberg see with the behavioural advertisement business model?  What does he think should be done about these problems?  Rather than improving transparency in the online ecosystem or policing the use of data collection, should there be an outright ban on behavioural advertising?</p></speech>

People fail to understand that the behavioural advertising model of Facebook has taken advertising revenue away from contextual advertising, the advertising that supports the editorial content of genuine news organisations.  This is a zero-sum game and journalists are losing it.</p></speech>

The fact that the press has to rely for survival on the Facebook News tab and Mark Zuckerberg's views on the First Amendment shows how dire the situation really is.  What is the European Commission doing to ensure that enforcement is effective and timely and that it stays ahead of the curve?  What is Ms Dixon's response to concerns that delays in enforcement have entrenched the market power of firms that are dominant online?

This regime is 18 months old.  As an individual data protection authority, we have handled 11,000 user complaints, many of which have been in respect of the platforms where individuals have tried to exercise rights.  We have intervened and ensured this has happened.  We have also prosecuted several companies in the last 12 months for e-privacy regulation infringements.  We have 29 litigation cases in the Irish courts at the moment.  Mr. Rotenberg referred to the Schrems I case earlier.  We have brought forward what is referred to as the Schrems II case in the meantime.  There has been a hearing on the critical issue of transfers of EU personal data to the US this summer.  It is pending the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  It is a mistake to say there has been no enforcement but I think the Representative is referring to the fact that there has not yet been an outcome to the large-scale investigations into the big tech platforms which are currently under way on lawfulness, transparency, privacy by design, default and so on.  Eighteen months is not a long time and not all of the investigations have been open for 18 months.  We must follow due process or we will not secure the outcome in the end.  As these companies have market power and have the resources to litigate forever, we have to make sure we follow due process and allow them a right to be heard.  We conclude the legal analysis carefully by applying the principles of the GDPR to the scenarios at issue, and then we can hope to deliver the outcomes that the GDPR promises.  That work is under way.  We could not be working on it more diligently.  The first set of decisions will start rolling out in the very near future.</p></speech>

Are the special categories of personal data under Article 9 a tool her office could be using?  How do they relate to observed data, that is, behavioural activity?  How does one make sure that observed data, which relate to the Article 9 categories, are included?  Is that a key tool which could be used in the regulation of micro targeting?</p> <p>  My second question is directed to the whole panel.  The business model has been talked about again and again.  One of the key things we can do to disrupt a business model is to apply financial penalties.  How important are financial penalties under the GDPR to disrupting the business model?

There is no doubt that sensitive categories of personal data come into the online behavioural advertising model.  On the question of fines, there have been studies done and David Wright and Paul De Hert published a book on enforcing privacy in 2016, which looked at the effects of what was a new fining regime in the UK from 2010 that applied to the information commissioner's office.  It concluded that the fines made no difference.  We will be obliged to impose fines where we find infringements so that is what will happen but we expect the corrective powers we apply, such as bans on processing and requirements to bring processing operations into compliance, will have the more significant effects.</p></speech>

I would like to use my time to share with the committee some of the challenges that we see from the perspective of our organisation for parliaments being mobilised around the topic that is under discussion today and some of the opportunities.</p> <p>  For those who are unfamiliar with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it is the world organisation of national parliaments.  There are 179 parliaments in the world that are members of the organisation.  With the exception of one, all of the parliaments that are represented here are members of the organisation.  As an international organisation we are grappling with this question.  In terms of challenges, we see that parliamentarians are not well equipped to deal with it effectively.  I am speaking from purely from a global perspective.  They have a lack of understanding of the technical issues that are at stake.</p><p>They are also finding it very difficult to situate the debate between what needs to be done at the national level and what is happening at the international level.  In addition, as was said earlier, there is a lack of clarity for them as to the governance structure which is dealing with this question at international level.  There is also a challenge for them in getting access to the right information.  What I really appreciate is seeing a variety of Members of Parliament represented here in the room.  That said, they are obviously from advanced countries so they have some similarities when it comes to their own national context.  Maybe also, because they are from advanced countries, they can more easily access representatives of tech companies because I would doubt if high-level representatives of the major tech companies would come before national parliaments far away from the West.</p><p> There is also the reality that we see in our discussions at the IPU about differences - legal differences and philosophical differences - around some of these major questions between countries but also between continents.  Even today, obviously we have two sides of the pond being represented.  Also, I guess there are fundamental differences between how freedom of expression is seen and what the limits are.  We all know that hate speech is not necessarily criminalised in the United States.  In addition, there are issues with regard to the financing of political campaigns.  In the United States, spending is pitched whereas, in Europe, the tradition is more one of using public funds to finance public campaigns.</p><p> We come from different realities and this is just the western world.  So what we are also facing in our discussions within the organisation is that there is a real variety of organisations and bringing everyone together is very difficult.  Where do we find common ground?  In trying to adopt a shared vision both of the problems but also the solutions.</p><p> We have seen that there is a growing sense, which was stated in the course of this morning, is that the business model is the real heart of the problem and that is something that needs to be tackled.  Now, also within the IPU, there is discussion around that.  I really like the statement that was made this morning around human rights and personal data.  Of course, if we could reset the clock and start again things could possibly look differently now.  Is that realistic?  Short of a radical reform, there is discussion within the organisation to push for increased transparency of the work of the tech companies, particularly when it comes to the algorithm amplification and political ads.  There is also a lot of debate on making a distinction between illegal versus harmful content.  Also, to see the issue as something slightly larger than misinformation and see it really as something that concerns society, as a whole, in the sense that we are faced by what has been termed "junk news" rather than fake news, which requires us all to move and come together to promote better civic education, to help promote civil discourse and help the people, at large, to be better able to recognise fake news.</p></speech>

The foundation is a non-profit organisation founded by the inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, to promote and defend the web as a basic right and public good for everyone.  We work to achieve this mission by securing policy change based on evidence and robust research.  Crucially, to a point that the previous speaker, Mr. Huizenga, has just made, we work equally and are equally active in developing countries as we are in the countries represented by the Parliaments here.</p> <p>  I guess the committee has heard a lot of important things today, many of which I would agree with, but I would like to make one further, very specific, proposal for the members of the committee and that is as follows.  We believe that a crucial step for lawmakers like yourselves is to require companies to publish regular human rights impact assessments and transparency reports.  That means companies will be expected to tell us how they have weighed the impact of their policies and products on individual human rights, and on our societies.  These reports should be grounded in international human rights frameworks and focus on disinformation and misinformation, hate speech, electoral interference and political ads.  These kinds of assessments have been more and more prevalent in other sectors such as extractives, manufacturing and agriculture but less so in technology.  Although some tech companies have started to publish transparency reports but we think they can go further.  The more we learn about how companies make these decisions then the more informed and empowered governments will be to regulate effectively in this area.</p> <p>  Before I go back to a little more detail on that, I will step back for a moment.  When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989 - 30 years ago - he changed the world.  He expanded our access to knowledge and freedom of expression more than arguably any other development in modern times.  In recent years, and as today's conversation has shown, we have seen the web misused to spread lies and hatred, and sow division within our communities.  It is a complex dynamic and tackling it, we think, will require an equally complex set of policies and, crucially, long-term thinking.</p> <p>  As public representatives, you are faced with a difficult balancing act: the need to respond swiftly to the harms caused to your constituents by disinformation, with the responsibility to uphold people's human rights and freedom of expression and avoid triggering unintended harms.  There are numerous challenges in the context of international co-operation on disinformation, and a number of them have been mentioned already.  Like the web itself, the platforms where much of the disinformation is spread operate globally but national laws vary and sometimes diverge.  Platforms struggle to fact-check content consistently at a global scale.  While platforms are making decisions that impact billions of lives globally, we have not had real insight into how those decisions are made.</p> <p>  Despite all of this, our sense - and certainly Sir Tim Berners-Lee's sense - is that there is hope.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee would maintain, in spite of it all, a determined optimism that there are ways we can come together now and in the future to address these challenges.  Last year, Sir Tim announced the creation of the contract for the web.  It is a social contract that would bring together governments, companies and civil society to agree on a set of ground rules to guide digital policy agendas.  More than 350 organisations have been part of the process so far.  The initiative began with a set of nine principles small enough to fit on a postcard.  In the next few weeks we will announce the full contract for the web with 76 clauses that emanate from the nine principles.  It is intended that this contract, which we will launch at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin, can play its part as a broad plan to protect and secure the web as a public good.</p> <p>  In that context I shall return to that one specific proposal, which, in our view, sits very much at the heart of the contract for the web.  I refer to the increased commitment to transparency around risk assessments by companies.  While transparency is not, and should not be, the end of the road, it is an essential first step that supports evidence-based regulation and enforcement but it is that necessary first step.  So we call on companies to publish regular transparency reports that tell us how they have weighed the impact of their policies and products on human rights when it comes to misinformation and disinformation.  We also call on national parliaments around the world to take this first step by requiring platforms to take that step of their own.  I am happy to discuss this matter more as we get into questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Kerr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#LL00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to speak here today.</p> <p>  We are in the midst of a wicked problem and are running out of time.  A wicked problem is, by its very definition, something that is difficult or almost impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory and ever-changing requirements.  It cannot be solved through one solution alone.  Our wicked problem is an information disorder and that disorder is a symptom of a much wider societal problem - a collapse of trust in institutions, including media.</p> <p>  I have worked as a traditional journalist with Ireland's main newspapers, with Storyful, the world's first social media news agency, and with Facebook, the world's largest social media platform.  I launched a new start-up called Kinzen, the purpose of which is to reconnect people with quality news and information.  Throughout 16 years in the industry, I have remained very resolute about the importance of journalism to better help people to understand the world around them but also ever concerned about the phenomenon of more and faster content everywhere.  I have seen a new information ecosystem emerge in which everyone became a publisher, the means of consumption changed and the modes of distributing news became fragmented.</p><p>There were positives, of course.  We have largely become more connected, engaged and educated because of the Internet.  However, amid that period of massive disruption and digital transformation wherein online experiences were built for speed, clicks and scale, the connection between people and journalism was lost.</p><p> We are at another crossroads now and there is an opportunity for correction.  While the task list is long and complicated, there are three core areas in which to make a start: to ensure that we connect people with quality news and information; to build collaborative projects across multiple sectors so there are shared learnings; and to find thoughtful and pragmatic ways to hold technology companies accountable.</p><p> What does that mean in reality?  I believe that today&rsquo;s recommendation systems are a root cause of information disorder.  We need radical transparency on the programming of algorithms.  A new generation is seeking alternatives to the toxic noise, hidden surveillance and the endless distraction of their social feeds.  They demand an experience of information that rewards their best intentions, fits their daily routine and protects their privacy.  That means, we as an industry, need to build radically different news experiences.  In Kinzen, for example, we are building a citizen algorithm, in which data science and machine learning is guided by human curation and explicit user feedback of every single individual person.</p><p> We also require collaboration at an unprecedented scale across multiple industries.  In journalism, we need to find more opportunities for newsrooms to collaborate and not compete.  That means funding projects like the CrossCheck initiatives undertaken by the news organisation, First Draft, in places like Brazil and France where journalists from competitive organisations worked to find, debunk and report on different rumours during election cycles.  In digital literacy, we need long-term joined-up education initiatives, rather than one-off campaigns, when it comes to giving people - young and old - the skills and tools for consuming information online.  That means taking successful models like the Finnish Newspapers Association's work in schools for the past 50 years or the news literacy project curriculum in the United States, and using schools and libraries as the key gateways to build global media and information literacy, MIL, playbooks.</p><p> In research, we need to find more opportunities for academia to study anonymised data from technology companies so they can better understand what is working and not working.  That means scaling efforts like Social Science One - the non-profit commission launched in 2018 - to establish concrete partnerships between academics and data-rich institutions.  It now has 32 million individual links extracted from Facebook upon which to conduct research.</p><p> To be truly collaborative, we need to bring together civil society, technology companies, publishers, academics and governments so we can answer the question: what can we do together to tackle this wicked problem, while protecting freedom of speech?</p><p> Regulating the Internet is complex.  The risks are immense and committees such as this one must ensure there is careful deliberation of well-researched evidence so that practical enforceable standards and laws can emerge.</p><p> A new report emanating from France outlining a detailed strategy for increasing oversight of social platforms while allowing for an independent regulator to ensure compliance with standards, deserves consideration.  Ideas are emerging from the Transatlantic High-Level Working Group on Content Moderation and Freedom of Expression, which propose to enable platforms to set standards while enabling governments to hold those platforms accountable to those standards via Internet courts.</p><p> Wicked problems are difficult but not impossible to diminish.  It will now take collaboration, transparency and innovation on an unprecedented global scale for us to realise if the moment for correction is upon us. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1710" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frane Maroevic" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#MM00200"><p>It is my honour to contribute to the committee's deliberations on advancing international collaboration on online regulation.  Clearly there is no need to stress that this is a transnational issue: that the committee has come together to discuss this issue speaks for itself.  The initiation of the Grand International Committee is also a sign that the existing institutions and processes are not adequate to deal with these issues.</p> <p>  Most online interactions and data flows today involve multiple jurisdictions based on the locations of users, servers, Internet platforms or technical operators.  Current frameworks for interstate legal co-operation struggle to handle this new digital reality.  In many cases they hinder or even prevent co-operation.  In some cases, they empower those who want to do harm or commit crimes.</p> <p>  How do we address issues such as the interoperability between the different norms; the interplay and the hierarchy between companies&rsquo; terms of service, national legislation, international treaties and commitments?  Who sets the standards?  What are geographically proportionate and relevant responses to these issues?  How do we ensure the rule of law and transparency of all these processes?</p> <p>  How do we effectively co-operate to ensure that those who commit crimes and inflame hatred or violence are prosecuted?  What is an appropriate punishment and what is the recourse for the victims?  We need institutions for all these things because the most common forms of punishment and redress seem to be take-down of problematic social media posts or accounts.</p> <p>  In order to come up with workable answers, we need new international tools and institutions for Internet governance.  This is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century that no one can solve unilaterally.  In the absence of policy standards and appropriate frameworks, we face increasing tensions that trigger unco-ordinated short-term solutions.  National laws are enacted to try to deal with transnational problems, resulting in a legal arms race that risks unintended and harmful consequences, including jurisdictional conflicts and unwanted fragmentation of the Internet.</p> <p>  The organisation I work for, the Internet &amp;amp; Jurisdiction Policy Network, is about to publish the first ever report on the status of global Internet governance which shows that globally there are more than 300 such laws or Acts.  As the majority of them are not co-ordinated we risk fragmenting the Internet.</p> <p>  We need solutions that will bring values and rules-based international order to the Internet, while at the same time ensuring that our democratic institutions and all our fundamental human rights are fully respected.  This is a colossal task and shows why Internet governance must be a multi-stakeholder process.  In reality it is not because in most cases when we discuss inter-governance it ends up being an intergovernmental process.  In a true multi-stakeholder process all three branches of the state need to work with the fourth estate, the media, along with civil society groups, academia and the companies.  This is what the Internet &amp;amp; Jurisdiction Policy Network does as a multi-stakeholder Internet governance process.  We bring together approximately 300 key stakeholders from governments, Internet companies, technical operators, civil society groups, academia and international organisations from more than 50 countries to work together to develop policy standards and operational solutions.</p> <p>  In recent months our contact groups, working in three separate jurisdiction programs on data, content and domains, produced a series of proposals norms, procedures and mechanisms that we call operational approaches and I would be happy to share them with the committee.  The next focus for us will be on standards for recourse mechanisms, looking at issues of normative interoperability and transparency.</p> <p>  Regarding the committee's work I would like to highlight transparency, a matter mentioned by a number of people today, as one of the most useful tools in tackling disinformation.  I am referring to establishing standards and mechanisms to deal with the abuse of platforms and technical infrastructure for political, financial or other gains.</p> <p>  Members of the committee know the challenges of regulating speech.  The most problematic content does not fall neatly into what could be restricted under international human rights standards on freedom of expression.  These issues are constantly evolving and changing, and artificial intelligence only contributes to the speed and complexity of the problems to be solved.</p> <p>  I call on the members of committee, as representatives of the people, to support a multi-stakeholder, transnational Internet governance process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Lorna Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#MM00300"><p>I am grateful for the invitation to give evidence to the committee.  A way forward is to try to identify a model which is common - perhaps not a model law, but an underlying model that can then be deployed around the world in different jurisdictions.</p> <p>  The difficulty that is often raised with regard to content regulation is the subjectivity of content and the fact that standards differ from state to state.  To address this problem, I would suggest a regulatory system that looks at the underlying systems, one that moves the focus from the content to the mechanisms that encourage content, facilitate its sharing and distribution, and select the content that comes to people's attention.</p><p>It is my contention that the platforms have developed with a disregard for the impact on the sorts of content and the sort of content that is prioritised and widely shared.  This goes back to the discussion about the business model, which is about encouraging user engagement with the aim of getting more data, which is then used as a commodity.  The principle put forward by Carnegie United Kingdom Trust is that there should be a statutory duty of care as regards the systems.  It is starting with an assessment of risk; identifying the consequences, be they intended or unintended; and, crucially, taking steps to mitigate.  Rather than leaving it at transparency, it involves asking why something has been deployed and how it can be made better.  </p><p> When Google first started, it said that it viewed data as an exhaust product of the search engine business.  I now wonder whether we have reached the point where people's content is the exhaust product of the data collection business and that we should be moving to try to get a cleaner engine rather than a dirty diesel one.  That is what the Carnegie project is about.  I am happy to share further detail.  We have done quite a bit of work on this but I do not want to weigh discussions down.  I would suggest that using a model that focuses on systems is beneficial in an international context because one does not have the difficulty of agreeing about difficult content.  What one is looking at isn on the whole, further up the process and it is possibly easier to find common ground there so one can then be in a position of deploying a common model that can be responded to within an individual state context.  I would emphasise that this can never be a silver bullet.  There will probably always be a role for moderation for take-down and in some instances, possible law enforcement engagement but this sits on top of this common model.  It is when one starts looking at particular items of content that the difficulty and differences arise.  That is the proposal.  It involves a statutory duty of care aimed at the systems - the infrastructure itself.</p></speech>

My next question is directed to Mr. Lovett and possibly the IPU.  In terms of best practice, which countries either through the IPU or otherwise are leading by example?  This is where the rubber hits the road in terms of where we move forward.  I have not heard a lot of examples today of any nation states or countries leading by example with new laws, technology or common models to deal with the "wicked problem".  Are we the people who are setting the scene or are there other people, who I would hope are outside this room, who are dealing with this?</p></speech>

There is no full analysis of how these different national initiatives regarding hate speech compare to each other.  There are a number of what seem to be good examples but with some potentially difficult implications.</p></speech>

The law adopted in Germany is another example so there are a number of examples.  The challenge is that these examples differ from each other so how do we compare them?  This is also where we see real merit in having these kind of discussions among parliamentarians possibly first as a start, as is happening here, for more like-minded situations but also extending it to a slightly wider audience.  I certainly think that the countries from which the participants today come are already tackling this.  I am not saying they are producing the best of results but they are already to the forefront of dealing with this.</p></speech>

Australia has been leading the way in some respects in terms of our eSafety Commissioner and the laws our nation has passed.  I will use Australia as an example; to our north, there are countries like Indonesia and further north, there are anti-democratic countries like China and Vietnam.  Regarding a common regulatory system, the involvement of law enforcement was mentioned.  What would suit our nation in the Indo-Pacific region - the freedom of speech argument - would not apply inside China and Vietnam.  I would not want a system that is one-size-fits-all so I disagree slightly with the witness statement about a common ground versus what is already happening around the world.  I would be interested what the panel thinks about that - either a two-series or a two-step process in terms of democratic reforms versus the opposite.</p></speech>

The model that I said might provide a common ground is based on process.  It is not based on specific items of content.  In a way, it is a two-step process.  There is common ground about standards for recommender algorithms or whether metrics such as "likes" and those sort of devices have unforeseen consequences.  I think agreement can be reached there.  It is when one goes into the question of whether a particular item of content is problematic that one finds a lot of difference.  We must accept that there is a limit to how far we can go with that.</p></speech>

Regarding the first question, I wish we could put an excellent national model before the committee.  I think what has happened in Australia, and Ireland is looking at something similar in terms of the role of the Data Protection Commissioner, is important.  Our view is that what has been taken forward in Germany is not a model to follow so there is a lot of work to be done there.  The committee is at the front line of trying to figure this out - what it looks like at a national level.  I agree with Professor Woods that for us, a focus on the process is as, or possibly more, important as a focus on the end content.  Our hope is that the idea about transparency reports and human rights assessments will expose not just the numbers of take-downs and so on, which we are starting to see more of, but the basis for decisions.  One could look at it and say "well, we wouldn't have done it that way" or "we can see why they came to that conclusion".  It involves having that qualitative understanding of how decisions are being made.</p> <p>  Mr. Dick mentioned Indonesia.  I was there earlier this year and spoke to Ministers and so on.  To underline the challenge mentioned by Mr. Dick, it was clear that when we and some government officials were talking about a healthy Internet, we meant very different things.  </p></speech>

Regarding the point that this is about process and framework, I mentioned that high-level working group earlier.  There is a formula - a framework - there to which it has given a lot of thought.  It involves whether one can work with the public, civil society and a coalition of organisations to build standards that are about behaviour and, in parallel with that, the technology platforms would build covenants - that these are their warranties - so that they are held responsible as well to ensure there is platform responsibility matched to those standards.</p><p>Layered on top of that could be independent regulators tracking and monitoring the implementation of the standards and covenants and, ultimately, imposing huge fines where there has been a stepping out of line.  In parallel, there may be a need for Internet courts on very specific issues to deal matters on a case-by-case basis.  Obviously, Facebook would be considered.  There is a role for the oversight boards.  We are starting to see, in some of the high-level working groups and in the conversation today, that there is a framework and process that could be built in country by country and company by company.</p></speech>

I agree very much with what was said.  I do not believe we have come across perfect legislation that we could just forward or copy.  Most legislation that deals with content and its regulation has potentially serious implications for freedom of expression and freedom of speech.. That is why we are all talking about trying to find processes to deal with these issues, examining issues of impact, virality, reach and proportionality.  Regulating speech in the analogue world was also about the impact and the possibility speech having an effect.  That is important.  It is not just about the speech but also about the context.  That is why the call is to try to find models and mechanisms that would be agreeable to a larger group of nations in terms of systems.  One will never find an agreement on specific regulation of content between each country.  We need a certain level of flexibility.</p></speech>

There are great dangers.  What really is fake news?  There is nothing there but there are also different kinds of realities, and people see the same issues in different ways.

If we are clear that we are equally concerned about a range of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression but also the right not to be harmed in various ways, that has to be the starting point.  The way we look at it, the disinformation and misinformation have three parts.  First, there is deliberate, malicious intent, whether it is state-sponsored or otherwise.  That was talked about today.  I refer to intent to bring about an income systematically and in a very determined way.  There is system design that creates perverse incentives and rewards.  The teenagers in Macedonia churning out factually incorrect stories about Hillary Clinton's health, for example, did not in most cases have a political axe to grind.  They figured out how to make a few euro.  That was a result of the incentives created by the system.  Then there are the unintended negative consequences of design, which also come with what we might argue are positives associated with the more open discourse we are now able to have online.  It breaks down into those three areas, at least, and a different approach is required for each.</p></speech>

There is no easy answer.  It requires a really determined effort and dedicated resources tailored to different contexts, countries and languages to deeply understand the nature of the content being looked at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Lorna Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#OO00700"><p>Let me follow up on that.  Maybe solutions are not about looking at content but about companies looking at the factors they put into their recommender algorithms in terms of whether they value reliable content rather than content about particular stories.  There was some research done on the recent Indian election and the role of WhatsApp.  Some of it was suggesting that the intimacy of a WhatsApp group has an impact on people's tendency to believe.  A question arises, therefore, about the design of groups.  Are they really small groups of friends or are they just conglomerations of relative strangers?  One might want to consider how easy it is to embed content from sources because one then gets contextualisation, which makes it more difficult for people to assess.  There are issues with unintended consequences and design in respect of how we share information.</p></speech>

On the technology level, we require fundamental rewiring of the recommendation or algorithm I talked about in terms of transparency.  This is so people will understand why they are seeing certain recommendations.  They should have the ability to reset their preferences.  We need to accelerate our AI machine-learning efforts ultimately to be preventive and remove bad actors who are trying to spew confusion.  There is a human layer on top, whether it is through the fact-checkers and efforts like First Draft, which I mentioned, whereby one is ultimately accelerating the efforts of the fact-checkers but ensuring the fact check travels back to those who might have viewed something false.  A problem with many of the fact-checking efforts mentioned earlier is that they often occur long after the viral peak window.  We are not capturing the people in the first 12 hours when there is peak virality.  Therefore, we need to build systems and technology that identifies and goes back to the people and asks them whether they have seen a certain other perspective, which is from a trustworthy source.  On that, there is a considerable amount of work happening across the industry on trust metrics and nutrition labels.  We keep talking about transparency today.  What does it look like if one can click on a little icon across multiple platforms or websites that indicates who owns information and how long the owner has been up and running.  Thus, people can engage in critical thinking to determine whether they want to trust the information.</p></speech>

The issue has already been covered in one of the statements but I would like to go a little more deep in discussing it.  We know that there is no unified definition of hate speech or harmful content.  There is no common understanding as to what constitutes information or fake news.  There is no one certain definition for these terms.  The legal frameworks of the countries show there is no common approach among countries towards regulations.  Today, when we are discussing the possibility of parliamentary co-operation and how we can work together and address the challenges together, do we need to agree on basic definitions of terms or basic issues of regulation?  Would this have a role in addressing the issue?</p></speech>

It would be a very difficult and useful discussion but, as we are all saying, we should start off trying to examine regulatory aspects and what we can agree on.  Sometimes the problem with speech is not just what is said but the context, virality, reach and impact.  These can be examined in much greater detail and measured.</p><p>I call for us to try to find a way to get together and reach agreement on the terms of the regulation on as broad a scale as possible.  That would allow us to compare different countries and it would be much easier to implement.  It would give the experience of the Internet a much more uniform approach; therefore, it would be much more positive and useful in this context.  Nevertheless, the discussion on what constitutes difficult, harmful speech needs to continue, but it would be difficult to implement.</p></speech>

I emphasise the point that if one is putting the obligation on companies to look at how their systems are facilitating the spread, one does not rely so much on definitions of how one categorises certain kinds of speech.  The techniques for allowing the content to spread cut across a range of harmful content.  It softens the need to understand it.  Finding an agreement on hate speech would be difficult, but perhaps one could start with asking whether there were repeat instances and other such technical questions, on which there might be agreement.</p></speech>

Most countries have ratified that treaty.  The UN human rights committee has jurisprudence.  There is a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression who has just produced an interesting report on precisely this topic and human rights.  A lot material is available.  There is the Rabat plan of action on hate speech which was developed eight years ago.  It is supposed to serve a global audience.  The international standards are in place for some specific forms of expression.  They need to be adapted to the national context.</p></speech>

Tim Berners-Lee and the Web Foundation have a very good insight into how that is happening.  Our key question is where is the governance and how do we secure collaboration on it.  Mr. Lovett has said he is travelling to Berlin at the end of November with the Internet Governance Forum.  To use an expression he might know, he and whose army?  How can national jurisdictions and the European Union, as several others have said, make sure it is collaborative across jurisdictions?  Where are the teeth?  How will that collaboration be brought about?</p></speech>

Tim Berners-Lee's idea on which we have been working for the last year or so has three phases.  The first was to land the set of top line principles that I mentioned.  They consist of nine principles, with three for governments, three for companies and three for citizens.  On the question of us and whose army, approximately 350 organisations signed up in support of the principles and committed to engaging with the process of turning them into concrete actions.  The 350 organisations include most or all of the major platforms, a number of governments, including the German Government and the French Government, and some terrific civil society organisations in the global south and elsewhere.  That was only the first step and if we had stopped there, it would have been useless.</p> <p>  The second step is the one at which we will land in two or three weeks' time in Berlin.  Approximately 80 experts from different sectors and backgrounds have deliberated over the last three months or so to announce 76 clauses related to the nine principles, covering the whole range of what we saw as challenges in ensuring the web worked for everyone.  </p> <p>  The third stage is to ensure all those who have signed up to these commitments - we hope as many as possible of the 350 organisations involved in the first stage will do so - will be held accountable.  The Web Foundation will take it on itself to ensure there will be a robust monitoring mechanism that will track progress against the commitments made.  Part of the conditions in endorsing the contract for the web in Berlin by companies, governments and civil society groups will be publishing an annual accountability report of their own addressing the elements of the contract.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a good point about the web versus the wider Internet, including the big platforms.  We absolutely recognise this.  Tim Berners-Lee has always had a strong sense that while Facebook and Google are not the web, there is an opportunity which perhaps is unrealised for those players and others to help to strengthen and build the web and, within the wider Internet, to reinforce the values of the web, including transparency and openness, to have a permissionless space and enable people to have the opportunity to be creators, as well as consumers.  While we are, first and foremost, concerned about the worldwide web that Tim Berners-Lee invented, we are also determined to see how much of the spirit, value and ethics behind it can be experienced.</p></speech>

It is a sad day for Irish media, with job losses having been announced at the national public broadcaster.  I thought her contribution was very important as we have been thinking about the business model.  Is it data harvesting to fund advertising or is it a paid subscription model?  That is not, however, the whole picture because, as Ms Kerr says, everyone has to be able to connect to quality journalism.  As some people will not be able to pay subscriptions, we need public service, high quality journalism that everyone can access.  What is ironic is that the current business model for social media makes it impossible to fund public service broadcasting in this country.  Does Ms Kerr have any specific proposal for the funding of public service broadcasting?</p></speech>

We need to think about devising radically diverse models for the funding of journalism.  The Deputy is right that, when it comes to public service journalism, we need to help to fund it.  In this country that includes rethinking the television licence fee.  As we all know, the mode by which we consume media has changed.  We are the Netflix and Spotify generation.  We need to think about taxes and subsidies that address this device by device mode of consumption.  </p> <p>  On the model itself, we have to think about a system wherein people will understand why journalism is important and make a donation or contribution or become a member.  That means that we will have to do a better job as an industry in amplifying the reasons.  With that comes a new form of journalism that will be people-powered.  It states less is more and that we are going to stop annoying people with irritating advertisements.  Instead of having a lot of content that keeps people scrolling endlessly on platforms, applications and websites, the new form of journalism should give people a productive experience.  That means giving them the right content and right format in the right amount of time that feels purposeful and productive.  Right now all of the evidence shows that people feel incredibly overwhelmed by the amount of content online.  They hide their digital footprints and turn off.  There is, however, an opportunity.  There are means for governments to ensure taxes incentivise and subsidise media.  Perhaps there could be a tax incentive to pay a subscription or become a member of a media organisation whereby they could claim back the fee when making their tax return each year.</p><p>It also comes to funding it from the ground up to ensure that local journalism can survive.  If we look across at the US desert, that is a phenomenon that increasingly, we will see across Europe.  We must ask how can we fund local and public service journalism and ensure that there are institutions that can take the funding and distribute it to the media at large.</p></speech>

That took a while to be sorted out and was at the brink of coming in when the Government said it would not do so.

We suggested Ofcom, the communications regulator in the UK, which has a track record for evidence-based and proportionate regulation.  We envisaged that there should be sanctions for a company that did not comply but that there would be a sliding scale in order that the starting point for the regulator would be to try to engage and inform before going to enforcement.  We thought that given the size of some of the companies at issue, we should look at GDPR-sized fines and we discussed whether, in the financial model, there might be personal liability for directors to get them to pay attention.  The underlying model was the Health and Safety at Work etc Act.  The Health and Safety Executive, which is the enforcer for that legislation, has the power to prosecute.  Then the question was whether one goes further with recalcitrant operators.  The problem with that is that we are still in a free speech context and that would be a very heavy sanction and would be difficult to make proportionate.</p></speech>

In the UK's every attempt, we have been unable to find best practice.  Many countries say they are doing various things but there does not seem to be a European agreement about best practice.  Finland is at the top of the list, UK is in eighth place and Estonia is fourth.  It has become quite clear to me that the Department for Education, and this is probably true in other countries, is not equipped to deliver what we are talking about.

In Europe, we do not have first amendment rights.  Ours is not binary.  It is quite subtle.  I sometimes feel that in Europe we get dragged into the same basket as first amendment issues and in a sense we have more space.  That is an observation.</p><p> My last question is to Ms Kerr.  Deputy Ryan, to an extent, asked it already about public service broadcasting, which is under pressure everywhere.  What I find extraordinary, and we got this more of less right in the UK when I was growing up in the 1950s, is that an understanding of the subtleties and importance of public service broadcasting was entirely understood.  It got badly beaten during the Thatcher years, and reconstructing the understanding that existed generally - it was not an imposed but a societal understanding - is extremely difficult.  It possibly means levies and it definitely means a transfer of revenues from the major players to public service broadcasting of some sort, be it online or offline.  Has Ms Kerr an observation on that?</p></speech>

As we know, the monopoly platforms are acquiring much of the new digital revenue.  Is there an effort that can be made where we can create a fairer competitive space?  It comes back to the point I tried to make earlier, that for public broadcasters or journalism in general, we have to get away from the attention economy to the intention economy.  What I mean by that is that we are being tracked across the Internet.  What does it look like for a public service broadcaster and others to give power back to people, to give them control of their experiences and, by doing that, for them to feel that experience with journalism?  That is where the imperative is at in general for us, but it will take a level playing field and taxes and subsidies to ensure that from the ground up people understand that role.</p> <p>  That is why Lord Puttnam's media literacy question is important.  We have to ingrain this from the get-go for people to understand why the institution of media is important.  Critical thinking skills are important because, unfortunately, misinformation and disinformation are a part of our lives.  They are part of the human condition.  There will always be bad actors.  They will get more sophisticated about how they go about their business.  Much of the analysis from the United States suggests we will want to inoculate children from the age of 12 against misinformation so that they will seek out the public broadcaster and engage with it as a source of truth, fairness and accuracy.</p></speech>

That is a critical step.  We look forward to that report for some guidance.</p> <p>  Mr. Lovett, in his written testimony, referred to prohibiting the use of micro targeting for political ads.  Will he explain why he believes that is a good recommendation?</p></speech>

We as the Web Foundation joined with the Mozilla Foundation and others in recent days to call for a temporary ban or moratorium on political advertising in the UK around the current general election.  We did that not mainly because of the threat of clearly false information being put into the public domain.  A very bad example of that in recent days was a doctored television interview with one of the major UK party spokespeople, but everyone could see that and it was quickly exposed.  We think it is right in the UK context to pause because of what is not seen and because of the degree of micro targeting.  There has always been targeting in advertising and we have had that for centuries, but what is different now is the scale and speed at which that works and the opacity of it and the great difficulty we have in seeing the effect of it.  We should recognise it is not a simple question, because while there may well be a place in some form for political advertising, properly regulated and fully transparent, there is not enough confidence at the moment that the unseen is not doing great harm.  While that is the case we think it is important to step back from political advertising, but in the longer term what is required is a way to be found such that micro targeting is not applied in the case of political advertising because it is too important a context for that.</p></speech>

We are seeing this in real time with Google's threats to withdraw its Google news service in response to the European Union's copyright directive and its more recent decision to stop displaying news previews of articles in France to avoid complying with this law.  What recommendations, if any, does Mr. Huizenga have for harmonising regulations internationally to avoid this kind of dynamic?</p></speech>

It is about seeing if there is a real willingness for countries to come together around a common norm.  I could see that happening with regard to some issues.  I mentioned hate speech, and there are quite a number of international standards in jurisprudence, but there are still many differences between countries, including at the European level, and different approaches are being followed.  I do not see an immediate end of the tunnel with countries coming together with a unified approach and vision as to what harmful content, and even hate speech, should exactly look like.  This is all the more reason for countries to make that extra effort to see if it is not possible after all to do just that.  Ultimately, if tech companies can move their business around and simply disappear but continue with the same business model wherever they can, that is not a long-term solution.</p></speech>

Has he thought about what would be the most effective way to operationalise that because, as we have seen, there is very little likelihood these technology platforms will regulate themselves or correct their own misbehaviour?  They seem to be driven by a model that is about growth and revenue.  Therefore, does it involve public shaming or is it intended jurisdictions would take these principles and directives and incorporate them in legislation, or what is his view on these issues?</p></speech>

For example, we think the GDPR standard will be pretty much reflected in the relevant parts of the contractual web clauses because it exists, is a good start and can be built on.  The contract with the web does not try to offer an overall regulatory approach.  It tries to acknowledge where there are relevant initiatives and mechanisms already in place.  Beyond that, we believe in the power of transparency and the public spotlight not as an answer to everything but as an important element.  The reason the human rights assessments I spoke about earlier would be important is that it would put information in the public domain.  Companies would be required to do that, we would then see that and those companies could be held to account.  In some aspects of the contract for the web's scope, there would be regulatory and legislative means to do so.  In other parts, it would be the within the power and ability of the public to scrutinise and see what companies are doing and to judge them accordingly, including where they take their business.</p></speech>

It is pushing it back to a company and essentially saying to do a proper risk assessment, identify what is happening with one's platform and the way one has designed one's services.  Where there are downsides, companies should try to mitigate these.  This is in the context of the service provided.  One would look at how large the platform was and also at the sort of services offered.  Live video streaming, I would say, is quite a high risk thing to do, as opposed to just text.  If one is aiming a service at children, then one will want more safeguards than if one is aiming at adults.  This allows a certain flexibility to the company to do things in the way they want to, but within a framework of having to do it, keeping an eye on this, not just doing a tick-box exercise but to keep monitoring.  I am afraid that the time for self-regulation is over.</p></speech>

How do we aspire to it?  This is dual-layered because even if we manage our service providers, and legislate that service providers cannot boost or block particular types or sources of content, social media platforms are themselves adopting a net bias, in that they are promoting sponsored contents and applying their own algorithms as to what bubbles to the top and what does not.  Going back to Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Mr. Lovett eloquently described his original vision earlier on.  The power of the web was that sort of randomness, where it was built on meritocracy and random discovery.  That, in turn, drove content producers where indigenous content and citizen journalism could come about.  Ms Kerr has talked about that as well today.  That was the dream, the goal and the utopia of the web at the outset.  That has been choked back in two ways.  The net neutrality debate rages on.  The platform is layered on top of that and is equally filtering material out.  For some people Facebook, or Google to an extent, are the Internet.  In this context, and with a view to the platforms and the kind of regulation we are discussing today, how do we best manage that?  I do not know if we can turn back the clock, and maybe we do not want to completely turn the clock back, but there is a goal from the earlier days of the web that is worth preserving, which is the meritocracy model and that citizen journalism and openness to anyone to have their 15 minutes of fame on whatever channel it may be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-07a.1778" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Lovett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019110700002#SS00600"><p>We are still very focused on that fight for net neutrality, most particularly in the United States, where there was a great step forward, and now we are fighting to re-secure that several years on; we have not given up on that fight.</p> <p>  On the broader question, it is true that we cannot turn back the clock.  Tim Berners-Lee and others of those Internet pioneers would not want us to do that.  Channelling some of the inspiration and vision of those early days and applying it to the very different times we find ourselves in now, it may be time to think about a new connecting imperative.  Perhaps this might help.  I was talking a little while ago to one of the chief executive officers of one of the big airlines.  I was asking him what his focus was.  He was quite new in the job, six months in, and said obviously his was an airline company so the first priority is safety.  He went on to talk about the things I thought he was going to talk about around the brand, staff relations, and so on.  He got me thinking then about the aviation industry being a place where businesses make healthy profits and provide a service to customers but also where public safety is the first priority and where companies are required to co-operate with each other, as well as with regulators.  There is zero-tolerance of mistakes and a significant degree of transparency.  If we agree that the Internet can not only improve and enhance lives, upon which we all agree, but that it can also profoundly damage and -  it is not too much of an overstatement - can cost lives, then surely the evidence is that we could agree that for companies on the web, the universally-accepted imperative must be public safety.  That might be a new driver for how we organise all of this thinking for the next 30 years, quite different from the thinking that has prevailed for the past 30.</p></speech>

I asked members in advance to think about which organisations or mechanisms they would consider appropriate for working together to advance a cohesive multilateral agenda of regulation.  This is our third international grand committee hearing.  We have had social media companies before us.  We often hear many of the same answers to our questions.  Today's meeting has been very productive.  We have heard expert views that have given us options for a path forward.  It is clear that no international rule-making body is dealing with this issue in a coherent way.  We need the rule of law to apply to social media when it comes to political interference, political advertising, online harm and fake news, but it is not there at the moment.</p> <p>  We will hold a press conference at 5.30 p.m.  I want to open the meeting up to members before then.  What is the overriding message that is coming forward?  From my own point of view, I think the issue of targeted political advertising on social media has been recurring throughout all the hearings today.  I will let those present think about our message for a moment.  Maybe we could consider recommending a moratorium on micro-targeted political advertising until regulation is in place.  I am not suggesting that there could not be political advertising online, but that the micro-targeted approach could be stalled temporarily.  This is something the members might want to discuss.  Perhaps we can all agree on this as an issue that could come out of today's deliberations.</p> <p>  There is another issue that I would like to open up to members.  We might consider the taxation of social media companies to support public service broadcasting.  There is real concern about journalism, factual information, factual news, combatting fake news and supporting public service media and public service broadcasting.  We are looking at ways to support that.  Are members in agreement on coming together on these issues before the press conference later this afternoon?</p></speech>

One of the real concerns in the UK, where an election campaign is just beginning, is that the micro targeting of individuals avoids the rules and regulations regarding constituency expenditure.  I do not know whether that needs more explanation.  National parties can spend X amount; constituencies are restricted to &pound;15,000 each.</p><p>If those individual voters are micro targeted, it does not count as part of the &pound;15,000.  In fact what has happened is that a coach and horses has been driven through a law that has existed for 100 years that did attempt to control electoral expenditure.  It sounds like a small thing but actually it is a very big thing.</p></speech>

We have done very good work today and yesterday.  It has been very informative.  We set ourselves the ambitious target of answering where is the point for international collaboration.  As the Chair says, there are myriad different possible points but none is immediately achievable.</p> <p>  To cite our experience in the referendum, which our Singaporean colleagues cited several times, this became an issue of concern and at the last minute the platforms withdrew from advertising because it was so contentious.  It would be very useful if we, as a group representing several parliaments, came out with the sort of moratorium the Chair talks of because it would not just leave it to the platforms to make the decision.  It would be one political voice in this space asking for that action to take place.  As Lord Puttnam says, this is a fairly immediate issue in the UK.  We have an election coming up in the spring and our Singaporean colleagues are on the same sort of timeline and the US presidential election is not very far away.  If we could get broad agreement on such a moratorium, it would be very beneficial and it would prevent what happened in our case, when it happened by default without any political contribution.  Our contribution would be useful and timely and may encourage the wider collaboration that is our overall aim.  It is only one measure, it is interim and temporary, but it would not be insignificant.</p></speech>

There are many MPs and there is a huge difference between the US presidential election or elections in some small countries because the budgets are totally different.  There is a big difference if somebody has a budget of &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 because with these kinds of resources they do not have enough resources to use TV or other media and need to be careful where they put their money.  If we ban this, we could also do a lot of harm.</p></speech>

It seems to me the harm is much less serious in micro targeting if it is accurate.  The fact that it is one on one is not perfect because there is not that public discourse that is the business, but it is really egregious and harmful when it is false and is micro targeted because there is no public square.  It would be strange for us to leave here and not say something about this publicly articulated policy of Facebook that says it will sell completely false advertisements for anyone who wants them and in whatever quantity they want.  The really pernicious harm is the false declaration combined with the micro targeting.  Maybe we can speak about the two together.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem if micro targeting happens and is about a factual issue or a local campaign or particularly in developing countries.

The thinking behind it is to include this ticker.  How we do it is immaterial but it is to include a transparency or disclosure notice such that all of these political advertisements have a ticker tape running beside or under them where the user can click to see who brought it to them, who sponsored it, and who funded it.  That gets around many of the issues we have been talking about.  It promotes transparency in the political advertising but also in terms of micro targeting and when it is and is not permissible.  It is always permissible if everybody else can see it.  It is the dark hands that are hidden away behind micro targeting to see one particular micro sector of which nobody else has visibility.  If there is transparency on it and disclosure behind that, and if we mandate that it must be available through a library or regular access, that takes away the dark web and dark advertising.  I hope that paragraph summarises that.</p></speech>

We would be more than happy to support the suggestion.  Under our legislative framework we have targeted the issue of falsity and as a result have also put into place codes of practice around advertising transparency and political advertising transparency.  The legislation that came into force in Singapore on 1 October is entirely coherent and consistent with what has just been described around a moratorium on a false politically motivated micro-targeted advertising.</p></speech>

If we start off by saying disclosure is an important value in terms of knowing where the advertisement came from, who paid for it, that is right.  If we say micro targeting, when coupled with false or erroneous misleading information, is particularly pernicious, the next question people will ask is whether, if it is not micro-targeted, we are okay with false political advertisements broadly being placed on these platforms on the Internet.  That would be a fair question for a reporter to ask.  My view of that would be no, we should not allow it.  In fairness, however, people should be comfortable with that because it is the next obvious question.  Micro targeting is very dangerous when it is false and everyone agrees that should not be permitted, but the next question is whether we support a ban on false political advertising, even if it is of a high standard but is demonstrably false and the platform is put on notice of it.  That is the next obvious question, which I would support if I were asked that, but I would not just raise it with my colleagues here.</p></speech>

Whether it is a company such as Twitter, which takes a certain stance and has to answer that question, or whether someone takes a different view, I do not think we were able to answer that here.  Some of the various collaborative measures we have seen and that have been presented to us have an urgent task in managing that.  I do not think, however, we can definitively give an answer on that here this evening but it is right for us to call for the sort of moratorium, with the caveats we have presented, recognising that some of the details have to be worked out.</p></speech>

It is the first committee meeting I have attended and it has been very interesting to look at the issues involved from the perspective of different countries.  Georgia applies very high standards of freedom of expression and freedom of speech, although I would say we apply more American, rather than European, standards.  Stakeholders in Georgia are very reluctant to regulate freedom of expression in this or that way, or the Internet and so on.  This discussion has given me some ideas to take back home to discuss with my colleagues and political party representatives.  It is a unique format.  We have to work together to deal with the challenges all of our societies are facing.</p></speech>

We had a discussion earlier with some of the panellists about this, but I am not sure if we reached any definitive conclusion.  In the absence of an external framework, the grand committee retains the mantle and it falls on us as parliamentarians working collectively.  I assume there will be another session, perhaps in a few months' time, wherever it takes place, but it would be useful if we could agree among ourselves to keep up the momentum and activity level.  What is measured is managed and done.  We have the principles, as part of which we are all making certain commitments.  If we can begin to trace and track them in our own systems and our own way and then report back at the next session such that we are taking away some actions and can begin to translate words into doing, that will be a very positive outcome from this summit in the absence of an alternative international mechanism.  I do not see anything else jumping out from our deliberations.  We retain the mantle until such time as there is something preferable.</p></speech>

One of the most important responsibilities of good journalists is holding the government to account and exposing misconduct in government.  Therefore, the notion of taxing a private entity for the purpose of generating revenue for the government to provide training or invest in good journalism would cause a lot of anxiety for historical reasons, but that is not to say public service announcements would not be fine.

We are here to talk about IORP II, which is a European directive to try to harmonise governance around pension arrangements in Europe.  IORP stands for institutions for occupational retirement provision and the primary objective of the directive is to try to harmonise governance and arrangements for institutions or collective schemes which provide retirement provisions.</p> <p>  By way of background, Ireland is a little bit unusual in what it considers to be an institutions for retirement provision or a collective scheme.  Ours is the only country in Europe where one-person arrangements are considered to be a collective scheme or institution.</p><p>More than 110,000 of those institutions are in Ireland.  That is because of the unusual position we take in counting one-man arrangement schemes as institutions. </p><p> The directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II, recognises that there are many differences in pension arrangements throughout the various European countries.  The directive advises member states to tailor the provisions for smaller arrangements if they see fit to do so.  The UK availed of one of the clauses within the directive allowing a cost-benefit analysis to be carried out for smaller arrangements.  The UK concluded that the IORP II directive should not apply to any collective scheme with fewer than 15 members.  The administrators of arrangements with between 15 and 99 members were required to make themselves aware of what was set out in the directive but they did not have to apply it to their own schemes.  To our minds that is a very sensible approach. </p><p> The schemes in Ireland which have fewer than 100 members and will be affected if this is applied in full cover about 150,000 people.  These are typically small businesses, self-employed people or traders who are trying to make provision for retirement.  Their pension pots are modest.  Typically the salaries of people paying into these schemes are just above the industrial average wage.  The average pension pot size for one-man arrangements in Ireland is just over &euro;75,000.  UK cost analyses estimated that the base level cost of implementing this for smaller schemes would be &euro;500 in the first year of implementation and &euro;370 per annum thereafter.  If schemes were required to produce full audited accounts, another requirement outlined in the directive, that cost would be substantially higher, perhaps as high as &euro;3,000 per annum.  This is a disproportionate measure given the population at which it is directed.  The costs of introducing this could wipe out these scheme's investment returns.  That will have a significant impact on pot sizes at retirement.</p><p> When a country considers whether the directive should apply to smaller arrangements, it must consider the existing arrangements around the governance and protection of schemes.  We contend that these schemes already get very good information from the regulations that apply in Ireland.  Members of these schemes get annual benefit statements and projections of what they will get at retirement.  We do not really see what additional information people will get if the provisions are applied.  Regarding governance, I note that live company pension providers are overseen by both the Pensions Authority and the Central Bank.  Oversight is already very good, which should be taken into account in any cost-benefit analysis.</p><p> Our fear is that if IORP II is applied in full and the right to assess the benefits for smaller arrangements is not exercised, it could act as a barrier.  There will be more work involved for individuals in setting up and using schemes and for small companies in setting up arrangements for their employees.  The additional cost of putting it in place will reduce the size of the pension at retirement of those covered by existing arrangements.  There is also a danger that existing arrangements may simply cease to exist because of the administrative burden and overheads.  It would be strange to do this when there is general consensus around auto-enrolment and trying to encourage future pension provision.</p><p> We have three asks for the committee.  The first is for a cost-benefit review of the implementation of IORP II to be carried out by the Department for all schemes with fewer than 100 members.  We do not agree that one-member schemes should be considered as collective arrangements or institutions where retirement provisions are concerned.  They should be fully exempt and should not be affected in any way by IORP II.  A proportional approach should be taken for arrangements that have between one and 100 members.</p></speech>

I can answer the question the Chairman put to Mr. Harney.  I raised this with the Minister in the D&aacute;il and I found her to be particularly unyielding.  She was very insistent that implementation should go ahead without reference to the exemption.  There is obviously a case to be made for a difference in treatment between smaller schemes and larger ones.  If there was not, the EU would not have included that escape clause in the first place.  Mr. Harney has pointed out that in the UK schemes with between one and 15 members are exempt and separate arrangements are made for those with between 15 and 99 members.  Does the directive allow for that?  I thought it specifically set a limit of 15 members.  Does it allow exemptions for schemes with more than 15 members?</p></speech>

The three countries within Europe with a lot of these types of schemes are Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands.  Things are quite different in Portugal, Spain and Germany.  The most similar country against which to benchmark ourselves is the UK because of the nature of individual arrangements and the protections currently in place.</p></speech>

I think a cost-benefit analysis will ultimately show that this should not be applied to smaller schemes.  If an analysis is carried out and shows that the provisions should be implemented, that is fine.  However bypassing the cost-benefit analysis seems to be a mistake.  That is not that controversial.  People can debate the findings of a cost-benefit analysis.  Our view is that it will find that one-man arrangements are not collective schemes and should be fully exempt.  An analysis may go further than the UK analysis.  IORP II is to be implemented across Europe.  An analysis may conclude that in light of the protections and information requirements already in place, Ireland is pretty well positioned on schemes with between 1 and 100 members and there is no need to implement a lot of these provisions anyway.</p></speech>

A large part of IORPs is the need to put in place governance structures such as internal audit functions and risk functions, which makes total sense for the very large pension schemes.  We are working on the assumption that for smaller schemes they will not be applied.  Again, if they do apply, how they will be applied to the smaller schemes could also have a huge cost with regard to what is going on.  Part of the problem is that we have no visibility regarding what the Minister or the Department are thinking on the communication and the Government structures they will require for these very small schemes.</p></speech>

Are the figures estimated to be of similar magnitude here in Ireland as a result of the imposition of this directive?</p></speech>

This would come out in the review.  I would be surprised if they were much different.</p> <p>  IORPs is not suggesting that this needs to be in place in Ireland because of deficiencies.  The IORPs view is that it is trying to harmonise across the EU and certain countries are already better placed than others.  IORPs is saying that for smaller arrangements it is up to each country to assess against what they currently have in place.  This is what the cost-benefit analysis should do.</p></speech>

We disagree that these one-man trust arrangements should be considered as institutions.  These are individuals saving for retirement, they are not IORPs.</p></speech>

I am agreeing that we will request the Minister to conduct a cost-benefit analysis.  Have our guests any idea as to how long it took to carry out the UK cost-benefit analysis?  Do they know the mechanics of what was involved?</p></speech>

They published the paper, which is quite detailed.  We can forward this to the committee, so members can look at the exercise they went through.  That was carried out by the Department, which considered the current regulation it has in place for those schemes and how much more it will cost to put on the IORPs regulation.  We do not know, however, how quickly that was done.  We would certainly be happy - and I am sure Insurance Ireland would also be happy - to assist the Minister in providing any information she might need to carry out that cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

The Minister is currently subject to a judicial review regarding the transposition of the directive as it stands.  This does not preclude the Department carrying out the cost-benefit analysis in the background to assess what should or should not occur on the transposition.</p></speech>

These trustees deal mainly with the one-member schemes.  The association has launched the judicial review specifically because it does not believe the one-member schemes should be included within the provisions of IORPs II.  That case was heard before the High Court in October and is currently adjourned.  Irish Life would support that case as far as the one-member schemes are concerned.</p></speech>
