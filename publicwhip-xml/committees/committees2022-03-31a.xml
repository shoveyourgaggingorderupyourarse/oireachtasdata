Apologies have been received from Deputy Cormac Devlin.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The service requests that members continue to wear face coverings when moving about the campus and when in close proximity to others, and to be respectful of other people's physical space.  We urge people to heed the public health advice.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in the public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  This morning we will engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine the 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 20.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by officials from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: Mr. Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Dr. Shawna Coxon, deputy commissioner for strategy, governance and performance; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Ms Kathryna Clifford, executive director, finance and services.  We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer in the Justice Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  You are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all of those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before starting, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p></speech>

This was an increase of almost &euro;134 million, or 7%, on the prior year.  Almost two thirds of the expenditure was related to payments of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;1.23 billion in 2020.  A further &euro;354 million was spent on pension and gratuity payments to retired garda&iacute;.  These two areas account for over 80% of voted expenditure in 2020.</p> <p>  Most of the larger Votes are presented in terms of expenditure in relation to key functions or service areas.  In contrast, Vote 20 is presented mainly in terms of expenditure by resource type or input classifications.  These include standard administration input costs, as well as costs associated with construction and maintenance of buildings, vehicle purchase and operation, and IT and communication systems.  As a result of this budgeting and accounting approach, the account does not disclose the cost of individual Garda outputs and deliverables, such as community policing, traffic policing, white-collar crime investigation or other specialist functions. </p> <p>  At the end of 2020, approximately 17,800 whole-time equivalent staff were employed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of these, just over 14,500 were attested garda&iacute; or trainees, and 3,100 were civilian employees in a variety of roles.</p> <p>  The amount of the budget provided for 2020 that remained unspent at the end of the year was &euro;16.3 million.  Of this, &euro;12.7 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2021.  The remaining &euro;3.6 million was liable for surrender.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal financial control of non-compliant procurement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of &euro;8.8 million worth of goods and services in 2020.  The statement on internal control also discloses significant financial and other risks faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as the steps taken to address those risks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#A00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to the meeting to examine the 2020 appropriation account of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My team has already been introduced to the committee.</p> <p>  The 2020 gross expenditure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was &euro;1.94 billion.  After taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;115 million, the net expenditure was just over &euro;1.8 billion.  Funding is provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through Vote 20 and it supports all of our policing activities.  The year 2020 was an unprecedented year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and was an extremely challenging year for policing and for all of our citizens.  Public health was of the utmost importance and required unparalleled restrictions on freedom of movement of people, normal business activities, sporting and social activities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was tasked with policing and supporting the Government, the community and businesses on the measures imposed due to Covid-19.  As an organisation, we responded quickly, and in doing so garda&iacute; and staff members demonstrated commitment, flexibility and resilience in this emergency, and dedication to the continued protection of our society and citizens.</p><p> Some immediate actions undertaken included maximising the availability of garda&iacute; for high-visibility community policing, which necessitated new roster arrangements, restrictions on annual leave, the postponement of some retirements, the acceleration of the attestation of some 300 student garda&iacute; and the allocation of additional garda&iacute; to front-line duties.  Operation Fanacht was put in place and this consisted of an extensive network of thousands of checkpoints established across the country, with more than 2,500 garda&iacute; involved with these checkpoints daily at the height of the restrictions.  Other activities included supporting members of the public and community who were cocooning.  We delivered essential supplies, including food and medicines, worked with the Government on Covid-19 emergency legislation and the provision of Covid-19 advice with our office of internal communications, OIC.</p><p> Importantly, 2020 also saw the launch of Operation Faoiseamh in response to the increase in domestic abuse-related calls received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The objective of this operation was to provide enhanced support and protection to victims of domestic abuse, and 22,795 contacts and attempted contacts were made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with victims of domestic abuse during 2020.  The organisation also responded to more than 43,000 calls for assistance in respect of domestic abuse incidents and more than 11,600 criminal charges were created in 2020 for crimes involving an element of domestic abuse, including breaches of domestic violence orders.  We also accelerated the implementation of technology across the organisation, providing the platform for personnel to move quickly to remote working and the provision of 3,000 mobile data stations to front-line garda&iacute;.  We also provided essential personal protective equipment, PPE, in an effective manner to our members and staff during this time, resulting in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintaining an employee resilience rate of approximately 95%.</p><p> In addition to policing activity related to Covid-19 measures, normal policing services continued.  This was essential for the prevention, detection and investigation of crime, which continued to be committed.  An example was the collection of more than &euro;45 million related to seizures of illicit drugs and cash.  Numerous firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition were also seized.  Work also continued on cybercrime, with some 400 new cases reported and 333 cases closed in 2020.</p><p> Policing activity in Ireland is funded in the main through the Exchequer, and while the activities required due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic can make comparisons with other times somewhat difficult, I am confident as the Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that public moneys under my control were expended in 2020 in accordance with the ethos of value for money and investing in the future of our services on behalf of the Government and our citizens.  This investment included maintaining and building the capital structure to support our policing.  We continue to invest in our fleet, which is obviously an essential resource for Garda operations, and we reached a record number of 3,100 vehicles in 2020.  In line with Government policies on sustainability, climate change and low carbon emissions, we are in the process of developing strategies to move to a more sustainable fleet of electric vehicles, EVs, and a pilot programme is in place.</p><p> The property portfolio in use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is extensive.  It includes more than 560 stations and a range of other national support, administrative and specialist facilities.  As the structure of the organisation evolves, there is also a need to ensure the estate aligns with evolving operational needs.  A number of refurbishments and upgrades were completed in 2020 and work commenced on the site of a new Garda security and crime operations centre at Military Road.  Not all the bureaux currently based in Harcourt Square will be transferring to the new centre at Military Road, with some being allocated elsewhere.  Accommodation solutions are being provided by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to meet the requirements of all these bureaux.  Accommodation is a crucial element of facilitating policing activities and we must further future-proof in this area.  Hence, my officials continue to engage with the OPW on capital and maintenance works across Ireland.  This includes an exciting project where we are working with the OPW in Dublin City Council on the proposed development of a substantial new Garda station and facilities on Dublin City Council lands at the corner of the R139 and Malahide Road at Northern Cross.</p><p> My officials have provided a written response on the implementation of the committee's previous recommendations.  While the pandemic has impacted the rate of progress on some of these matters, I assure the Chair and members that I take the committee's recommendations very seriously and that we are working on completing the implementation stage.</p><p> Tragically, we were all given a stark reminder in 2020 of the risks run by garda&iacute; while carrying out their duties when our esteemed colleague, Detective Garda Colm Horkan, was killed on duty on 17 June 2020.  Colm had served his local community for 24 years and was well known and respected for his police work and community work, particularly with his local GAA team.</p><p> I take this opportunity to thank most sincerely all the people who worked in and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the delivery of policing services during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Minister and the Department of Justice for their assistance and support.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his staff for their work and the committee for the time provided for this opening statement.</p></speech>

I call Deputy O'Connor, who is the lead speaker today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Commissioner and his management team to the committee.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na served the State greatly in recent years.  It has been a difficult time with Covid-19.  My first question is a consequence of what arose in 2020.  Has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased the mental health supports it provides for members of the force serving on the front line?  Garda&iacute; on the streets are facing new challenges.  Unfortunately, we also saw a major increase in online abuse directed at garda&iacute;, which proved difficult for some members of the force to deal with.  It contributed, unfortunately, to a number of serious and problematic cases, including cases of suicide.  I ask the Commissioner to comment in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#B00400"><p>Before I pass over to Mr. Nugent, we take this area seriously and we are investing in it.  The duties undertaken by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are difficult and, at times, traumatic.  Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and in the years before that, our members have been dealing with difficult operational situations on the ground.  We are conscious not only of our members' physical health but also of their mental health in respect of repeated exposure to traumatic incidents.  Mr. Nugent will comment further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#B00500"><p>I thank Deputy O'Connor for his words on this subject.  As the Commissioner said, we recognise the need to engage with our members and to provide supports for members who are dealing with traumatic circumstances all the time.  In recent years, we have invested in a range of different options in providing those supports.  These have included matters like a confidential, independently-run 24-7 counselling service being made available to members.  Our chief medical officer, who takes the lead in this area, has got agreement for and has put in place a new well-being strategy for the organisation in general.  In the last year, we have launched a specific app that provides a range of supports and advice in this regard, including contact details for our existing services.  Our employee assistance service has officers around the country delivering that piece.  Peer supports are provided by colleagues who are in a position to provide guidance and assistance and technical supports are provided by independent agencies.  It is an area we feel we need to do more on, and certainly the well-being strategy will see us do more in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#B00600"><p>I thank the Commissioner and Mr. Nugent for their responses.  We must show increased concern given the rise in these types of issues facing members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the beat, patrolling our streets.</p> <p>  There have also been serious issues with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years.  To outline a few, we are potentially looking at the omission of capital projects valued at approximately &euro;97.8 million in the Garda appropriation accounts and flawed budgetary processes, which it could be argued would have required Supplementary Estimates for the previous six years.  This is of great concern.  There were also issues concerning the Garda training college.  </p> <p>  I will direct some questions to the Commissioner and I would like to get brief answers, if possible.  Can he confirm that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has complied with all procurement regulations, with particular reference to the procurement of armaments and Garda cars, for example, and also including the procurement of legal services over the value of &euro;25,000, as per the guidelines of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#C00100"><p>We comply and where we do not comply, we make a statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General around the non-compliance.  There are areas that have presented challenges, particularly in the procurement of storage and towing of vehicles, some medical services and, in the past, the provision of uniforms.  Since this period, we have addressed many of those, including as we speak.  Evaluations are ongoing on the contracts for storage and towing of vehicles.  As members will be aware, we awarded and are about to roll out a new uniforms contract and we are satisfied that will address many of the concerns presented around the procurement area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#C00200"><p>On the fact that we have had Supplementary Estimates for the past six years, can Mr. Nugent guarantee us that this will not be the case this year?  Is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertaking work to address that fact?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#C00300"><p>The Supplementary Estimate has fallen in recent years as a percentage of the total amount that has been in place.  We continue to seek to resolve those issues.  Over the course of the past couple of years, the challenges of the additional expenditure required in policing the pandemic has had an impact on us and has had a requirement for us to move into that Supplementary Estimate space.  We are keeping our funding and expenditure under close review and the intention is to come in within budget this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#C00400"><p>I thank Mr. Nugent very much.  I will also ask the Commissioner a number of questions on the years we are studying, 2020 in particular, as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faced an extraordinary year that year.  It was also extraordinary from a controversy perspective in that a number of high-profile cases involving people in public life arose during the early stages of the pandemic.  Section 41, of which I am sure the Commissioner is very familiar, is around how the Commissioner communicates sensitive information to the Government in respect of people who are in public life and other aspects where he feels there may be a matter of concern.  Generally, when the Commissioner is engaging under section 41 does he communicate with the Minister for Justice directly or with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-31a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022033100002#C00500"><p>In the main, a section 41 communication is a written one and I have to complete a return of those communications every year.  There is, therefore, more a formal process of writing a letter as opposed to a verbal communication.  Inevitably, I write to the Secretary General under the section 41 process.</p></speech>

We were given regulations that varied in terms of people&rsquo;s ability to move and businesses that could be undertaken.  We were given charge of the enforcement of those regulations.  One issue was the amount of community concern and fear there was as Covid-19 broke out and as to how we would respond appropriately.  The very appropriate response, I felt, was one of community policing.  However, in respect of enforcement we also adopted what we call the "four Es", where we would engage with people, educate them in respect of what the restrictions were, encourage and then the final matter would have been around enforcement.  Much of what we were doing was encouraging people to comply but, in the main, the vast majority of people were very compliant with the regulations.  The regulations were separate from Government advice.  We were enforcing regulations.  We were not enforcing what was, in effect, health advice, which had no standing.</p></speech>

This has included the development of a new policy, which is currently the subject of discussions with the representative bodies.  We are progressing the reduction as fast as possible.  One of the challenges we face is in the pensions area, over which we have no direct control, and involves pension payments to Garda members in advance.  That presents, as the Deputy can appreciate, a systemic issue around the possibilities for overpayments.  We are in discussions with the Department of Justice around this issue seeking change that would, in time, move that to being paid in arrears to reduce the likelihood of that.  We are very confident that we will reduce overpayments in the general area of salary.</p></speech>

We have set in place a very high standard in respect of the response to domestic abuse.  In effect, what was happening was that our processes were not being followed in respect of those domestic abuse calls.  The actual act of cancellation of a call can be warranted because we have calls that can resolve themselves, for example, alarm calls, calls by other agencies for assistance which are then resolved and also multiple and duplicate calls for, say, a serious road traffic collision.  The numbers are huge but we found when we worked through the cases that the numbers distil down to 5,871 incidents that we had particular concerns about.  Of those, we found there was an invalid closure in 2,689 cases, in that a PULSE incident should have been opened.  A CAD incident was opened but in 2,689 incidents a PULSE incident was not opened.  Of those, we have created 2,316 incidents and have uncovered what we believe is 134 crimes not recorded.</p> <p>  All the reasons for invalid cancellations have been analysed.  There are almost 20 reasons, one of which is very prevalent.  In 28% of cases, or over 800 calls, the call was cancelled by the caller.  In other cases, there was either no offence, or the case was closed or cancelled by the car crew.  That is where we run into problems because if a caller rings back and says they want to cancel a call, it is our policy that we should still attend, investigate and follow through in completion of a PULSE incident.  There was a breakdown in terms of practice and behaviour within the control rooms but also among those responding.  We have addressed that in terms of processes around who can cancel - only supervisors can cancel - and then dip sampling and supervision.  We have revisited the training provided to those working in command control as well.</p></speech>

Because of the records we keep, in all the incidents there is a CAD incident and, therefore, there is a record of who the call was received by, who it went to and how it was finished off.

We have in fact started the disciplinary process.  We are probably about halfway through it at this point in time.  I do not want to answer the question about the WhatsApp chat group because as we move forward into disciplinary hearings, including tribunals, and having cases reviewed potentially by the DPP, I do not want to get into evidentiary pieces that could compromise that.  However, we have started the process.  Several discipline matters have commenced in terms of laying of misconduct on individuals and that process continues.  It is an extremely lengthy process where the calls must be reviewed, all of them, by each member by the chief in charge, so it is quite a comprehensive process.</p></speech>

I begin with the potential for gender balance in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the context of the previous question from Deputy Munster, the numbers in relation to gender are very low.  Is there any significant recruitment drive to address this?</p></speech>

On a European comparison we would be one of the best with respect to gender representation.  In our latest recruitment competition it is recorded that approximately 40% of our applicants are women, so those are very positive.  We have very powerful women represented throughout the senior leadership team and senior management within the organisation.  All of that is positive with respect to the outlook, behaviour and culture within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is obviously more to do.  We hosted a recent International Association of Women Police conference and that really threw down the gauntlet about what else might be done in respect of increasing the number of women within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly within the ranks of those who are sworn members.  I am very conscious I am sitting beside Deputy Commissioner Coxon.  I wonder whether she has more to add in respect of this.</p></speech>

I love the Deputy's question because that is the place we want to get to.  We want to get to gender balance, looking at the population, and to be reflective of the population.</p> <p>  There are a number of things we are looking at.  Certainly, action 16 is something the Commissioner has sponsored, along with the Minister.  We also sit on other initiatives around this but it is about looking tactically at some of our procedures like, for example, how we manage family leave.  When we speak to women across the organisation those things are pivotal to deciding how long they stay and whether they come into the organisation at all.  In addition, we have a women's support network now.  It was championed by the Commissioner and has been in place for just under two years.  The benefit of that is in women coming together and sharing what barriers they see from their lived experience in the organisation and in looking at how we can get those barriers out of the way in order to we can encourage women not only to come into the organisation but to stay in it.  The most compelling reason for women to want to come to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is when you can see yourself in the organisation.</p></speech>

We are going through an exercise that is an analysis of the PPS numbers.  That may give us anonymised information in respect of the composition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is being done, in effect, outside the organisation and the information is being provided back to us.  That will give us a benchmark of where we are at the moment.  The figures around our recent recruitment competition are still being analysed but look very favourable in terms of representation among those who have applied for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are pleased about that but are very conscious of our composition and our make-up.</p> <p>  On gender balance, it should very obviously be 50:50.  That is an obvious point to make and one that was made at the recent International Association of Women Police conference.

Moving on to capital expenditure, a beautiful new Garda station was recently built in County Wexford that came in under budget in excess of &euro;500 million.  However, it transpired early on that the Garda station is too small.  What input has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the design?  Does it take into account the expansion of the force in the future?  How is that worked into the provision of capital expenditure for new builds?</p></speech>

The need for capital investment in refreshing our sites is quite obvious.  The Commissioner has often said that if we were to replace 10% of these stations over ten years, some 50 stations would require change on an annual basis.  Clearly, the financial impact of that would be significant.</p> <p>  We operate on the basis of the capital allocation that is available.  We made a case to the national development plan for additional sites.  At the outset, the Commissioner referenced a site in Northern Cross that would cope with a broad population expansion in the general Coolock-Darndale-north Dublin domain, as an area that we consider needs to be progressed.</p> <p>  As well as refreshing the stock we have, we also need to look to those areas where there is population growth, as well as other issues such as crime trends etc.  We operate with the budget provided to us and we maximise what we can achieve around that.</p></speech>

In the Northern Cross example, there has been a significant increase in the number of Garda members assigned to that Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, north and Coolock district area.  We factor that into our requirements and look at that as one of the key requirements.  Members are associated with activity as well as population.

I have already referenced the pension overpayments, which is an issue about the timing of payments.  Paying people in advance is an issue.  Salary overpayments primarily relate to issues associated with notifications at station level that go to the payment processing unit in Killarney in a timely fashion.  For example, if individuals take periods of unpaid leave for a variety of purposes which is not communicated in a timely way, that has lent itself to the overpayment.  Through the development of our new business service functional areas around the country, we are seeing that as a key enabler to speed up the process of notification of those types of issues and, separately, the policy approach to the retrieval of the overpayment, which will resolve some of those matters.</p></speech>

We have been working a lot in devolving the budgets and responsibilities that are taken at assistant commissioner and executive director level.  Generally, in the beginning when submissions come in, we know what will be spent.  We have the profiled budget and then the expenditure against it.  On a monthly basis, our senior leadership team and their executive review that.  We look at the variances and the performance of the finances at that time.</p></speech>

Ms Clifford has touched on the financial elements but I mean the operational element as to the investigations of crimes, such as domestic violence or cybercrime, and the convictions as a result of those investigations.  How does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conduct its yearly evaluation on meeting these key metrics?  Are these data presented to senior management?  I seek an understanding of this in order that we can get value for money in each of the value streams referred to, in terms of where resources should be prioritised and focused.</p></speech>

In recent years, it is a fact that in Ireland and in other European nations, we have seen a rise in the reporting and incidence of domestic abuse, serious sexual assault, child abuse, as well as crime that is facilitated via the Internet, be that the abuse of children on the Internet or cyber-related or cyber-enabled crime.  As we look forward to what our policing priorities are and how they might change, and they do change over time, that is how we determine the resourcing of what we put in place.  New standards are also required of us.  I refer to the introduction of the armed support unit.</p><p>It is really an organisational reaction to some of the very dangerous situations in which members were engaging, and to ensure we can protect the public and our members when dealing with them.  They are new standards that are required of us and we have to resource them accordingly.</p></speech>

A review of the finance function has taken place and there is a series of recommendations flowing from that regarding changes we will make.  Equally, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looked at the question of what was a costed policing plan and concluded there was not evidence of similar activity around the world that we could apply, so we had to look at this in a different way, very much along the lines of what the Commissioner referenced.</p></speech>

When the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform considers allocating resources and funding, is a business plan presented?

Ours is not like other Votes, where there would be a very large residual amount.  The financial indicators we provide and on which we engage with the Department relate very much to budgetary control and budgetary pressures, and we are equally engaged with that.  As the commissioner said, internally, as part of our discussions on how resources are allocated nationally or locally, discussions on crime patterns and trends form a significant part of our consideration.</p></speech>

Against that 800, obviously, there is a training time and a lag time before they go out onto the ground but, at the same time, we expect 350 to 400 cessations in any year.  As with any big organisation, as we try to recruit people, other individuals leave.  We still have a target of 15,000 members and 4,000 Garda staff.  We are a big employer but Covid has not helped us in that although our Garda staff numbers grew, difficulties relating to training meant that we pretty much marked time, by and large, in respect of our Garda members.  We are now again into a time of expansion, and it will probably be early 2024 before we achieve the figure of 15,000.</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the local connections provided by our stations in many areas, particularly rural areas, and how we deliver and effect community policing from those stations.  It is very much our strategy to maintain that number because doing so creates a presence where otherwise the presence of garda&iacute; would be fleeting.</p></speech>

We have repopulated stations as our numbers have increased and we have recruited Garda staff, who have displaced Garda members into operational front-line roles.  All those displacements have been to build up, in effect, divisional policing, that is, uniform policing.  Moreover, stations that may have been open only once or twice a week have had a member or maybe two members assigned to them.  All of that is positive.  We still have growth yet to come of some 700 to 800 members, and that is positive as well.  The number of Garda staff we employ should free up more Garda members for front-line duties but that will include staffing the national units as well.</p> <p>  There is always more demand than we can meet.  There is a lot of demand for visibility of policing but we also have a lot of demand for less visible policing, whether relating to cybercrime, economic crime or the protective services.</p></speech>

That is causing some concern in regard to community policing whereby visibility is present only between, perhaps, Tuesday and Thursday.  Staff are being redeployed to other, larger areas within the county.  How can we free up resources to maintain these stations and allow them to remain open continuously?</p></speech>

We have a mandate for further modernisation of the workforce and that involves the displacement of sworn members into operational duties, which is ongoing.  Furthermore, we still have growth.  In all three areas, one of which relates just to our roster and the management of our workforce, we have improvements and further advances to make.  A rising tide lifts all ships.  We also have resourcing requirements for the national units.  I would say we are in a positive position.   There is ongoing investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that is shown in an increase year on year in our budget.  The Government has backed up its policy initiatives regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with funding and it is now for us to make sure that is used in the most effective manner.  Part of it relates to our visibility, as well as to the policing we provide to communities through stations, which may have only one or two members.  Stations of one or two members will not be open 24-7.  In effect, they are based on 40- or 80-hour working weeks.</p></speech>

Without fail, in every division I attend, we have shown an increase in both Garda members and Garda staff, and in the support that is available for divisions, whether roads policing or the armed support unit.  We have good visibility and we have invested in vehicles to improve that visibility, even through the chequered nature of our patrol vehicles.  We have also invested in community vehicles for local patrolling.  There has been a huge effort and investment on our part in that outreach and demonstration of our intent regarding the connection with the community and providing that local, community-based service.</p></speech>

If you wish, Chairman, I can refer back to you on that matter.  On the first question, where the plans are not in place payment plans have been put forward to the individuals.  It is a question of the formalisation of agreement to that.  Where that agreement is not forthcoming, we will be retrieving the money.  We can assure the committee that this is going to happen.  We are not letting that money disappear.  We will be pursuing it.</p></speech>

That would be the vast majority of it.  The specific action we are taking on that issue is through more local responsibility for managing this.  Clearly, one cannot see that for 15,000 or 20,000 people from a centre.  Our business service functional areas and divisional areas will be much closer to the ground and the response is much more immediate.</p></speech>

All calls were answered.  All the 999 calls or calls for assistance to stations were answered.  They were entered on CAD.</p> <p>  There was a deficiency in respect of these domestic abuse incidents.  In the ones we identified, in 2,900 cases they were not correctly closed in that a PULSE incident was not created and, therefore, the subsequent callbacks, investigations and supervision of the response did not happen.  That is the failing and we have addressed that through processes that we put in place and the supervision and training we have done.  Also, we have made contact with all the victims, or all of them who we can possibly locate.  Some are no longer in the jurisdiction.  However, we have made contact and they know about our efforts to reach out to them and to rectify the situation in terms of trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

He used the figure of approximately 80% - I apologise if I am misquoting him - for personnel and staffing costs.  The more ways we can get personnel to work better, the more value for money we can get from that 80%.  Technology is something the Garda has been significantly lacking over time.  It is a criticism but it is a necessary criticism to ensure that we continue to invest in technology for the Garda.  I have heard stories of people using their private laptops to type up statements for court because they could not access a PC in their stations.  All of this should be in the past.  It should not happen in a modern Garda force.</p></speech>

The mobility project is about putting connectivity in the hand for operational purposes.  I would highlight that all Garda stations are networked.  We are well supplied with computer equipment, which is available to all members and staff.  We need to do more with regard to the ongoing digitisation of our work, such as completing the roll-out of the investigation management and resource deployment management systems.  We have new things coming on line.  The digital recording Bill will bring us significant operational advantages in the deployment of various forms of mobile cameras, including body-worn cameras.  All of these are significant advances but they come at a cost.  There are significant ongoing ICT costs as well as maintaining what we have and maintaining a secure network.  We have a big network but it has to be rock solid in terms of security.</p></speech>

We all want to see this.  I am a great believer that technology is the way to leverage the resources we have.  I encourage Mr. Harris to keep spending in this direction.</p> <p>  People often quote the Commissioner back to him.  When he was first appointed, he stated that crime is not like rain and does not fall equally everywhere.  Unfortunately, the community I represent, which incudes Ballymun, Finglas, Glasnevin and Santry, has disproportionate levels of crime.  I was involved with Dublin City Council on the Ballymun - A Brighter Future report by Andrew Montague.  That report refers to the level of policing in our community and the level of crime.  For an area with such a high murder rate, we have one of the lowest rates of policing in the country.  The average rate is 2.8 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  Our rate is 2.3 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  If we discount from the district the 45 garda&iacute; in Dublin Airport because they are not accessible in a community sense, we drop down to 2.1 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  Has the Commissioner done work with the Pobal deprivation index on hotspots of crime and how resources are allocated?  It seems unbelievable that an area with such high murder and crime rates would be at the lower end of policing resources.</p></speech>

We want to take into account other factors.  The socioeconomic index and the prevalence of crime are important within this, as is the road network and traffic flow.  As well as the figures the Deputy has for the local division in north Dublin, support is provided by the national units.  Much of this has been in respect of responding to organised crime and operations specifically relating to drugs. The organised crime bureau is supported regularly by the armed support unit or the emergency response unit.  This is a regular daily occurrence.  We provide a policing service beyond local divisional policing.  The national units do a lot of work to counter the very issues the Deputy is highlighting with regard to drugs crime.</p></speech>

There are other areas where the illegal drug industry has agency capture of communities.  Ballymun and Finglas are two of those areas.  The Commissioner has already considered the Ballymun - A Brighter Future report.  The assistant commissioner for Dublin has met me to discuss it.  I ask the Commissioner to revisit the report in order to examine it and perhaps respond to me.</p> <p>  I want to correct the exact Garda numbers, because I would not like to mislead anyone in the context of the Official Report.  There are 2.3 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population in my area.  The figure is 2.8 in Ballymun.  If we take out the 45 garda&iacute; from the airport, it is 2.1 garda&iacute; per 1,000.  I wanted to make sure the numbers are correct.</p></speech>

The Commissioner has probably gone over this previously with regard to capital projects.</p><p>Is the Commissioner satisfied that there are sufficient mechanisms in place to make sure there will be no overspend on the capital projects that are currently in the pipeline?      </p><p> The second issue I want to raise are changes in infrastructure for garda&iacute;.  For instance, a few years ago I came across a case where there was a house belonging to the Garda that had been originally used as a Garda house and it had been vacant for over 20 years.  In fact, the garda&iacute; in the current station, or the Cork garda&iacute;, were not aware of its existence.  All of those properties are under the auspices of the OPW but have they all been identified and either put into use or disposed of?</p><p> Lastly, where there is major urban residential development are the Garda authorities looking at further development and having the infrastructure in place to provide the necessary policing of those areas in the long term?  I have covered a bit of ground with my questions but they concern both what has happened in the past and future plans.</p></speech>

In terms of building strategy out to the next ten years and beyond, we want to see where population change is obviously going to happen and, therefore, what new areas or what areas are going to actually increase in size.  We can see that considerably both in north and south Dublin, and we have put proposals, in effect, for brand new stations to help to deliver on a policing service there.  We can also see it right across the country where we have our towns gathering in considerable size.  What were once quite small villages are now becoming, more and more, substantial commuter towns and we want to respond to that accordingly.  That is built into what we have asked for in terms of our State capital projects for the next ten years but also, thinking of the ten years beyond that, how we want to be set up or how our capital investment should then deliver an estate, which is fit for purpose, going forward for the next 15 to 20 years.</p> <p>   Mr. Nugent will take the first two points around capital.</p></speech>

They are the eyes and ears around those project costs whereas we carry them.  On the funding for a lot of these, we rely heavily on the OPW for the management and oversight of the cost elements.</p> <p>  In terms of the current range of ones that are under way, I am not aware of any that the OPW has coming to us.  By that I mean that there just are not any where they have come to us to say that there are substantial or significant cost drifts.  Where we have had one, I think there have been issues associated with Government policy around certain payments related to Covid elements.  There would have been periods where certain building programmes had to pause in line with Government requirements, so there would have been some Covid payments there.  In those circumstances they have been dealt with, and the contingency part of the budget has been allocated to those programmes.  To answer the Deputy's question, I am not aware of any substantial issue.  </p></speech>

Then there was litigation, and six years later it paid out for the building plus six years' interest.  Is Mr. Nugent satisfied from his organisation's own information that there is adequate infrastructure to deal with the OPW as regards cost-effectiveness?  I have been involved in projects where because the OPW was in charge, I had to deal with five different State agencies.  When there is that complication, the period it takes to complete a project increases.  Macroom Garda station is a typical example.  Macroom is not in my area but I know that the project has lasted for quite a long period.  It seems to me that every one of these projects goes on <i>ad infinitum</i>whereas in the private sector a decision is made and one gets on with the project.  Is Mr. Nugent satisfied that there are sufficient mechanisms in place to expedite projects and deliver them in a timely manner thus avoiding increased costs?  It seems to me that when a project is estimated to cost &euro;5 million, it will cost &euro;10 million by the time it is built.  Does he believe we should review the whole process?</p></speech>

To deal with the Macroom issue, Macroom is being dealt with in a different funding pattern than would normally be the case.  It is being dealt with by means of a public private partnership, PPP.  I think it is fair to say that our experience in that area has been mixed.  Getting the PPPs off the ground is something that we would like to see move faster.</p> <p>  In terms of the broader programme, there is regular and frequent contact between ourselves and the OPW, including at very senior levels.  For example, the Commissioner would meet the chair of the OPW on a periodic basis.  There are meetings of senior officials, and then there are very specific programme meetings around particular areas that are going on.  Insofar as we can put in place a range of governance programmes, I believe that is a very adequate approach.  Clearly, in the midst of that, there are issues around time and costs that are being discussed all of the time.</p></speech>

It is the same problem when building new infrastructure and new capital projects in the health service.  Mr. Nugent has said that meetings take place regularly.  I contend that the solution is not regular meetings but making decisions and getting on with projects.  I find the situation frustrating.  Representatives of communities contact me after they have been told that a Department has confirmed that it has agreed to do certain work but the work is still not done, say, three years later because someone along the line has held up the process.</p></speech>

As it stands at the moment, I am not aware of problems with ongoing projects.  As I mentioned, the funding approach that has been taken in relation to two of our major builds was through the PPP process.  That has taken a long time to get started and we are still not in a space where a contractor has been appointed.  I would share his frustrations around that particular approach.  However, that is the process that has been put in place.</p></speech>

In all organisations, one has members who face various challenges in their own lives, including health problems and family problems.

This is something that we have invested in and we concentrate on.  We have an employee assistance service which provides one-to-one support for members in the most difficult of circumstances.  We also have a helpline, which is available 24-7.  We have our own occupational health unit, in effect.</p><p>Our chief medical officer is actively engaged in protecting the welfare, both physical and mental, of members.  We are very conscious of the huge pressures on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I mentioned earlier some of the very difficult incidents they must deal with and the trauma.

If you are viewing abusive material online, you need specific supports.  We want to put those in place.  Those involved in firearms incidents in the past year need specific support as well.  We have had members shot at and shot and members who discharged firearms.  These are areas in which work is under way and is being developed.  They relate to gaps I have seen.  As we deal with one issue, we see another, and then we see the next.  I am content with the work we have done but there is always more to be done in this area.</p></speech>

I would like a better understanding of the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau and how it operates.  How many investigating garda&iacute; or officers are assigned to that unit?</p></speech>

The unit was created as a national unit in 2019.  In the past two years, we have invested in regionalised functions.  There are regional cybercrime bureaus that members can liaise with.  We have been building up the national unit by assigning more Garda members to it.  There is an ongoing process to recruit Garda staff technicians to work in the cybercrime bureau.  I can get the Deputy the specific numbers.  Prior to 2019, the bureau was not a national one.  It now is, and it has grown quite considerably in size.  Some 30 additional garda&iacute; have been appointed to it in the past year.  We want to add another 34 Garda staff technicians, who will be carrying out technical and investigative functions.</p></speech>

I suppose I am trying to get at whether it is seen as a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the basis of the growth of cybercrime.  It is now such a vast area of crime.  It is a relatively new frontier or phenomenon.  One worries that not enough resources are being deployed at the coalface to meet the crime detection requirements.  If one could be disabused of that notion, it would certainly give some confidence.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that nearly every crime has some element of computer involvement, particularly mobile phone involvement.  That even includes serious road traffic collisions.  One would check to see whether a mobile phone was in use at the time of, or just before, a collision.  Every incident invariably involves some form of phone examination or computer examination.  That is why we further invested in this area.</p> <p>  During the pandemic, we saw an upsurge in fraud.  Much of it was perpetrated through texts, emails or investments.  There was also romance fraud.  These are areas we are very aware of.  It is a growth area.  The growth is actually related to the amount of technology and how all-pervasive it is.  Crimes are happening against that backdrop.  Some of the crimes are enabled because the Internet exists.  The sharing of images of child abuse exists because it can happen over the Internet.  With regard to other crimes, it is an extra complication that there is ICT or phone engagement.</p></speech>

I appreciate the answer.  If the figures on personnel were made available to the committee, they would certainly be very useful to us.  A statement of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s intention from a policy point of view to increase the numbers of staff in the cybercrime unit would give the public some confidence also.</p> <p>  I just want to move on to-----</p></speech>

The target is to have 220 personnel trained nationally in computer forensics and cybercrime investigation.  We are on course to train 130 members in 2022, on top of the 220 who were trained last year.  Regarding the bureau itself, we have 67 staff and there are plans to grow further.  A further 34 are to be deployed through resource allocation.  Also, there will be further recruitment of Garda staff to the bureau.</p></speech>

In this regard, the training is ongoing.  The staff we trained last year are providing a local service in the form of triage.  We have triage and advanced investigation where it is engaged.  We are investing in both the front line in terms of people who are skilled in doing this work and in the national bureau and regional centres in terms of more specialist capability, once we triage the examinations.</p></speech>

The Commissioner made reference to the digital recording Bill.  The Garda Representative Association has been very strong on the need for body-worn camera, bodycam, units.  These will be legislated for in the digital recording Bill, presumably.  What engagement has the Commissioner had with the Minister for Justice on that Bill?  Assuming that the Bill becomes law, how will the Garda deploy resources?  While my question is theoretical in advance of the legislation being passed, I am sure the Commissioner is planning for the eventuality of body-worn cameras being rolled out.  I would like a sense of his perspective on this issue and how he envisages the technology being deployed as a resource for garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

The purchase of a model of body-worn camera is one of the easier pieces to deliver.  What would be more difficult to deliver would be the infrastructure, particularly the storage required.  We require a huge amount of digital storage to an evidential standard, not only to receive the body-worn camera data but also to receive material from CCTV and other digital recording devices, be they mobile phones or handheld camcorders, and also from aerial surveillance, including by drones, and vehicular surveillance.  There is a lot of material.  The digital recording Bill is actually about all the digital evidence we would record.  The body-worn camera is one element of that.  We anticipate that we will commence a roll-out.  In terms of risk, we would have to think about our specialist units and the ability to deliver connectivity.  A huge amount of connectivity is required, along with the ability to transmit data.  A camera plugged in and switched on for half an hour will require the movement of a huge amount of data across a network.  Considering that 25 to 100 members may be doing the same thing at the same time, we need a very robust structure.</p><p>There is an expense in that, but we will step our way through it.  I am thinking of things like the armed support unit, the emergency response unit and uniformed members on the 24-7 response who, obviously, would use that for evidential purposes, be it at the scene of domestic abuse, in street encounters where they feel there is some tension, etc., or when recording scenes of crimes or crime in action.  There are multiple uses.  They have been shown to moderate behaviour with the public but also police.  They moderate behaviour, reduce complaints and provide good evidential footage for subsequent court appearances.</p></speech>

I have less than one minute left.  I want to dovetail with Deputy Colm Burke's point in respect of Macroom.  The issue relating to Macroom is important for policing in an entire region, as the Commissioner can imagine.  It is quite literally policing from the Kerry border over to the Waterford border and north to counties Limerick and Tipperary.  That is not an insignificant area.  It is arguable that Fermoy, which is the pre-existing divisional headquarters in County Cork, is a building that was fit for purpose when it was constructed but that is no longer suitable.  Until Macroom comes on stream, an increasing number of garda&iacute; will be going into pre-existing infrastructure.  I wonder what kind of affect that has on the morale of garda&iacute; when they are going into buildings that are substandard or not fit for purpose.  What we want is modern buildings for garda&iacute; to police from.  That would be my humble opinion.  I am sure if one is in a fit-for-purpose building, one's morale is that bit higher and so forth.</p> <p>  I support Deputy Colm Burke's point about the need to ensure resources are deployed.  I might have views with regard to Fermoy and Mallow, for instance.  I might be a bit parochial about the fact that we found it strange that it was going to Macroom, but that is a matter of policy.  We need to ensure that resources are deployed in terms of capital expenditure on buildings, however, and they need to be rolled out as quickly as possible.  That is the general point in support of Deputy Colm Burke.</p></speech>

With us being a customer, in effect, and getting a service from the OPW we have given the OPW a good deal more certainty about our requirements in terms of rolling out the operating model and saying these are the divisions, these are the headquarters and this is what needs to be supported.  We still have requirements with the OPW, obviously, but as has already been said, I meet regularly with the Chair of the OPW, in effect, to drive these things on and then to actually make decisions and choices around our building programme and capital programme going forward.  Our capital programme is ambitious but if we had more money, we would certainly spend it.</p></speech>

I have a number of other issues I want to raise with the Commissioner.</p><p>With regard to the appropriation accounts, there is a reference on page 5 to the Garda youth diversion programme.  I have been looking at the crime statistics and what happens with a formal caution or whether somebody is unsuitable.  I am a great believer in the juvenile liaison officer, JLO, system and diverting young people.  We know that not every young person who commits a crime is suitable to go into the JLO system, however.  On page 5, it states:</p> <blockquote> 	An internal review of youth referral incidents, deemed suitable for inclusion into the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, found a significant volume of cases were not processed to an appropriate conclusion by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the period January 2010 to July 2017.  A victim engagement consultation process was initiated to proactively engage with all concerned external stakeholders. </blockquote> <p>I may be wrong, but that reads as if there were people who should have been progressed through the criminal justice system and who were not in the JLO system, and there were victims of crime who felt aggrieved by the fact that did not happen.  Is that a correct reading of that situation?  If so, what kinds of numbers are we talking about?</p></speech>

There was a national youth referral review.  One of the things that comes up repeatedly for us public representatives is that people think if someone is aged under 18, they are told there is nothing that can be done about it.  That is a very dangerous message, including for the young people themselves.  What starts out at a low level escalates.  Is Mr. Harris satisfied that we will not be seeing a repeat of that statement in a set of accounts in the future?</p></speech>

Again, in part, this was a fixture of the PULSE system.   When the cases were analysed at a national level and then were returned for investigation, in effect, those referrals were being lost as they went to individual members as opposed to a supervisor.  All of that has been fixed and the system updated.</p></speech>

Mr. Harris referred to the sophistication of his deployment of staff, but it does not look very even.  The east coast is significantly lower in terms of the ratio of personnel to population compared with the rest of the country, with the exception of County Kerry.  Counties such as Meath and Kildare always feature at the lower end of the ratio and have done so for a long time.  Those happen to be two of the counties that are growing more quickly than others.  Fingal is probably lost a little bit lost in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Mr. Harris referred to this being a sophisticated allocation of resources.  I have looked at the policing plans every year and compared them before the census and after the census.  I do not see the kind of change I would expect in the context of the deployment of personnel.  It is not all about population.  There are socioeconomic issues and crime issues and I completely accept that.  This picture does not scream that out to me, however.  Does Mr. Harris accept there is an issue here that needs to be addressed?</p></speech>

I am drawing the Commissioner's attention to it, as I always do, because he can see there is a trend in population growth and it does not match.</p> <p>  Portlaoise was selected as the location for the divisional headquarters for Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  Laois and Offaly combined have 73% of the population that Kildare has.  Why was that location selected?  Is it because a new station was being built there?  Is it because there were personnel there who were going to lead it?  It certainly was not done on the basis of population.</p></speech>

My apologies if I have missed important points but I cannot attend both meetings simultaneously.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the questions of Deputy Catherine Murphy in respect of the Garda diversion programme and the JLO scheme.  I have an interest in this as I was on the section 44 committee from 2015 to 2019.  It was a valuable insight.  I really admire the work that Colette Quinn and others do in that section.  To my mind, it is a quasi-judicial office of significant importance where one is making decisions about children's lives and whether they go through the criminal justice system, but also whether they are getting appropriate welfare-based interventions An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified they need.  I have a concern in this regard.  This is important in terms of cost in an ongoing way because if these interventions can be identified and made appropriate at this stage, it can have significant effects.  I acknowledge the issue raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy but my understanding is that where a decision is made not to prosecute and that what is necessary is a welfare-based referral, that may take the form of anger management interventions or sexual awareness interventions, for example.  Those responses are largely Tusla-based or with another agency, such as addiction-based responses.  Deputy Bacik and I were in the D&oacute;chas Centre and in Mountjoy on Monday as co-convenors of the penal reform group.  The two big issues identified as being faced in both communities were addiction and mental health.  Difficulties in respect of training and education for those who were going to engage in that were preceded by an urgent need to deal with both those issues.  My concern is that I am not sure how much visibility An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in respect of the follow-up to those welfare-based referrals.  Is it getting reports back that the young individual or child had access to the referral and attended it and what the outcome, if any, has been?  I am not sure whether it is the job of the Garda to have that information but it seems to me that if a quasi-judicial decision not to prosecute is being made on the basis that a referral is what the child needs, it should have the information in some way.  We have always argued that there should be a Tusla presence in the Garda youth diversion programme to provide for a seamless link between the programme office and Tusla to make sure the Garda is able to satisfy itself that those referrals have been completed.  I ask Mr. Harris to address that issue.  Is my question clear?</p></speech>

It was raised at the level of the Department of the Taoiseach.  There was a need to bring in a person from Tusla under section 11 or section 12-based interventions that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could make.  The point is that the Garda and Tusla came together very quickly to be able to make better assessments than the one that was made on that occasion.  The Commissioner is quite right that the success of the Garda youth diversion programme is astoundingly good, but what we persistently end up with is a group of young offenders who are the most active offenders but also very much the most vulnerable children in the community.</p><p>We have the joint agency response to crime, JARC, for adults and we have constant calls for a JARC for young offenders, bringing the Garda youth diversion programme, GYDP, up to 21 or 24 to be able to target resources very effectively at a smaller group of people who have very challenged behaviours and very challenged lives.  A lot of the referrals that the GYDP gets are &ldquo;one child, one time&rdquo; or &ldquo;one child, a very small number of times&rdquo;.  If the Garda has the quasi-judicial power to make a decision for referral, there must be some mechanism to be able to check that that is so, rather than just information sharing.  In particular, a solution along the lines of &ldquo;If they come to our attention again, we will find out what happened last time&rdquo; is by definition insufficient and there must be a stronger way of linking that back in.</p></speech>

I know there is always work ongoing around improving the process, particularly in the context of the community safety legislation that is forthcoming and how we are going to work together.  I know that Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman will be advancing these issues.  I might report back on that specific point.</p></speech>

The other point on the time saving and cost saving measures is whether it is appropriate to have a DPP presence from time to time in that office to streamline decision-making.  These are very important resources within the Garda and anything that can expedite the decisions one way or the other is important from the perspective of children as well.</p> <p>  I will turn to procurement.  We have 44 instances of non-compliant procurement to a value of &euro;8.7 million in 2020.  I know we had correspondence from Chief Superintendent Dollard of the Commissioner's office of 18 February of this year, and we were assured there was an appropriate focus on good practice and procedures in regard to procurement.  Can we have an update on that?  Our concerns are that internal controls did not identify a non-compliant contract.  What has been done since then to make sure we pick up those instances in the future?</p></speech>

The primary problem in those areas has been around access to providers who were prepared to compete for the business.  As to what we have done since then, we have run a series of procurements in those individual areas.  In regard to the towing and storage contracts, a series of procurements are currently being evaluated and we expect to award contracts over the coming month or so.  In terms of the uniform, we have awarded that and we will have a new uniform in place next month.  We have taken action around these and we continue to keep matters under review.</p> <p>  There are areas where we face difficulties and we spoke earlier about this when it was raised.  There have been challenges in parts of the country around getting access to particular providers in the medical space.  That is something where we have engaged separately with the broader medical community to see how we can address and deal with those.</p></speech>

We had to close the college because of the risk of transmission and, at that time, it was thought that the college might have to be used as emergency accommodation.  We were forced into that and to either, in effect, send them home or bring them online, so they were brought online.  They were always accompanied by other members and when they went back into their training regime, because they had context around what they were learning, the college assessed that their ability to understand and to learn was actually improved.</p></speech>

For example, when they are being taught about a road traffic collision investigation, they have a practical sense of that and can say, &ldquo;I remember I was at a road traffic collision and this is what the experience was like as I watched other members.&rdquo;  There is also a huge variety of incidents that they are trained on.  Within a classroom, at least somebody can say, &ldquo;I dealt with something like that&rdquo;, or can reference it and give some context.  Otherwise, they are being taught in a vacuum of knowledge and they are being taught without actually knowing practically what police work looks like.  We found it beneficial that they have some sense of the practicalities of operational uniform work.</p></speech>

It automatically highlights matters which are of risk or high risk.  At a glance, it provides a visible information display which gives a huge amount of information in colour and chart form as to how resources are being deployed, what calls are outstanding and what calls are a risk and should be dealt with immediately.</p></speech>

According to it, as a result of complaints received in 2020, 572 criminal investigations were opened, which contrasted with a figure of 485 in 2019.  This could have major financial implications.  In its response, GSOC also stated that its investigators had carried out non-criminal investigations, those being, investigations into alleged breaches of Garda disciplinary regulations.  In 2020, 150 cases of this nature were opened with GSOC compared with 148 in 2019.  GSOC investigators also supervised disciplinary investigations that had been returned to the Garda for investigation, with 106 such cases opened in 2020 compared with 105 in 2019.  What is the situation with the 485 criminal investigations opened in 2019?  It struck me as a high figure for a service of between 14,000 and 15,000 people.</p></speech>

I do not have an insight into what happened next in respect of those allegations.  The investigations may have been opened as criminal investigations only for the allegations not to be substantiated or the complainants not to give further information or even make complaints.

What does he mean by "interactions"?  For example, GSOC turns some investigations over to us.  Is the Deputy looking for the number of hours we spend conducting investigations or is he looking for strict reporting mechanisms to GSOC?  We do not track that.

According to GSOC's correspondence with us, it had a substantial impact on the outworking of its investigations.  I am trying to get a sense of how that arose and whether it was appropriate that industrial action was used in that way.  Essentially, a group of workers implemented industrial action, mitigating their regulator's ability to monitor the work of the service.</p></speech>

Chief superintendents, but more likely superintendents, then undertake those investigations.  In any one year, several hundred complaints by members of the public can be given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate.  There was a hiatus in investigations for a period of almost seven months when superintendents and chief superintendents, as part of a dispute, refused to undertake further investigations or receive new matters.  That action has finished and superintendents and chief superintendents are catching up on that work, but that action was not the only one they took.  They retreated from other areas of their work as well.</p></speech>

Shane O'Farrell was a young man from my home town who was killed in a hit-and-run accident in 2011.  The GSOC report on same took an inordinate amount of time and was very incomprehensive.  The only substantial finding related to those findings of negligence but according to this newspaper report, Mr. Harris revoked two out of the three findings.</p></speech>

This event took place 11 years ago.  The man who was driving the car that killed Shane O'Farrell should have been in prison at the time.  He had been stopped in his car by garda&iacute; about a half an hour before the incident.  He was in breach of multiple bail conditions in several court jurisdictions.  One of his bail conditions was that he was supposed to sign on daily at a Garda station.  He was actually imprisoned as a result of a court judgment in Newry.  There are lots of questions to be answered.  In cases like that, where families have serious questions that need to be answered and when they feel that garda&iacute; have not been upfront and where GSOC has not been able to identify the reasons for those failures, what does Mr. Drew consider to be the most appropriate mechanism for those families to get the answers they are looking for?</p></speech>

I have not seen a draft report or been given an indication as to timing.  In effect, that report should provide a complete overview of all that happened within the various agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and GSOC.  I await that report.</p></speech>

The scoping inquiry may give options but in the broadest terms, where questions need to be answered, there have been tribunals and independent inquiries and other mechanisms used in the past.  Does Mr. Harris have a view on the most appropriate way to get answers when serious allegations of a failure to deliver on the part of garda&iacute; are made?</p></speech>

GSOC has a wide remit, not only in terms of discipline and crime investigations, but also the issuing of reports with recommendations to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

If the garda&iacute; concerned are able to assess that this does not form part of the Garda code and that their interactions with GSOC are not an integral part of their work, does Mr. Harris agree that there is scope for reform of GSOC to improve its ability to carry out investigations of this nature in a more timely and efficient manner?</p></speech>

Matters that are referred back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for superintendents to investigate are more minor matters and would invariably relate to discipline only.  I would not see such serious cases ever being referred back to us.  In fact, we would not be comfortable in taking such a case back.  It is only the more minor matters that come back to us.</p></speech>

Is that investigation now completed?</p> <p>  Is there an issue with staff retention?  It has been reported recently that members who are not at retirement age are resigning.  Is there an issue there that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified?  If so, what is being done to deal with it?  Some of the changes made to rosters during the Covid period were welcomed by members.  Are measures like that being considered which would be helpful or are there other reasons for the retention difficulties? </p> <p>  Finally, on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and its successor, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, a memorandum of understanding is to be signed relating to the deployment of garda&iacute; to the authority.  Is that up to a full complement at the moment?  Has the memorandum of understanding been signed?  A number of high-profile investigations within that organisation will require the involvement of garda&iacute;.  What is the position in that regard at the moment?</p></speech>

There are minor issues that need to be resolved around that.  Discussions are ongoing and I expect that it is only a matter of weeks before it is signed.  That aside, there is agreement between both parties around the recruitment of additional garda&iacute; into that space and the competition for those roles will be happening very shortly, within days.</p></speech>

Undoubtedly, one of the things we are seeing is individuals who join and are in the probation phase decide that police work and what is required of them in policing are not for them and they leave.  That is fair enough.  That is probably wise judgment on their part.  An issue of more concern is the steady trickle of people leaving the organisation to go to private employment, many of whom have particular skills, including analytical skills related to cybercrime or economic crime investigations.  We make a significant investment in individuals to bring them up to speed and it is regrettable when we lose their expertise.  At the same time, not all will stay away and people can apply to rejoin and we have seen that as well because we are a good employer.  We offer training, advancement and promotion into other areas of work.  Sometimes people find that their working conditions and overall job fulfilment were better with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not all a one-way street in that respect.</p></speech>

May I ask him a question on the resources that were provided in the year 2020?  There were a number of very high-profile interactions between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government and members of the European Commission.  Has the Commissioner adapted or changed procedures as a consequence of the leak of the PULSE details of a former member of Cabinet or as a consequence of what happened to the then EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan?  Has there been any review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's processes in respect of the use of section 41, the section used in the then EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan's case, and with regard to the leaking of PULSE files of Members of the Oireachtas?

There are a number of ongoing investigations.  Regrettably, we have identified instances in which we regard the leaking of information to not only have crossed the threshold for misconduct, but the criminal threshold.  Those investigations are ongoing and the results will be reported to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have made it very clear, as has Deputy Commissioner Coxon, that we have zero tolerance towards the leaking of official information to the public or to any other entity.  There are proper processes to be followed.  We regard such activities as very much a breach of trust and, therefore, as serious misconduct.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that this seems to be a recurring issue with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has happened in the past.  It happened as recently as 2020, the year we are examining today.  I have a degree of concern in that regard.  I ask the Commissioner to evaluate that and perhaps include a review on the matter among those being undertaken, of which there are many between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC at the moment.  Perhaps it might be prudent for that to happen.</p> <p>  I would like to clarify the response to a question I asked the Commissioner earlier on.

With regard to the development of policing, a couple of years ago, there was a lot of talk about changing the ethos.  The Commissioner has outlined some of the changes that have taken place.  With regard to policing, people still refer to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a "force".  The Commissioner attended a joint policing committee in County Laois.  That was helpful.  With regard to ethos and perception, does he believe it would be helpful if we could drop the term "force" and describe An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a service?</p></speech>

Internally, we refer to ourselves as a policing service.  The new Bill will also refer to us as Ireland's policing service.  We are anxious for that because we are moving more and more towards becoming an organisation that is human rights-compliant and victim-focused.  We want to use technology to its best advantage but we want to keep that ethos of community policing.  That is all part of providing a policing service as opposed to being a force of garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

They have to deal with very confrontational situations and so on but perception is very important for any organisation.  It would be helpful if members within the organisation were to start using the term "service" more often as opposed to "force".  I recognise the positive changes that have taken place in policing in recent years.  There are now further moves to strengthen joint policing committees and to change that model.  That will be positive.</p> <p>  I will briefly ask about the issue of the farm at Dromard.  It has come up at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, where it was dealt with extensively.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was renting these 100 or 120 acres of land near Templemore between 2009 and 2013.  The OPW then took over the lease and is now renting the land out for agricultural purposes.  Is there any update on the examination of that issue?</p></speech>

We have certainly been talking with the OPW, which has asked us to confirm whether we have a desire to retain the land to use it for tactical training.  We have made very limited usage, if any, of the land in recent times.  We are discussing the matter with the OPW.</p></speech>

I am not trying to be evasive but, in fairness, we have not undertaken an assessment of whether it is a valuable asset for the purposes of tactical training.  We have been using other facilities for such training and, as I have said, we have made limited use, if any, of the farm.  The OPW has asked us to confirm our intentions.  In fairness to the Commissioner, I have not spoken to him about this yet, but it is an issue we will be considering.</p></speech>

Are there sufficient resources within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with that type of activity?</p></speech>

We are also a security service as well as a policing service and, therefore, there have always been resources dedicated towards the overall security of the State, which includes dealing with the threat of espionage.  Those resources are in place.  I had to look to see what extra we need to be doing at this particularly difficult time, given the war in Ukraine.  That is ongoing.  As one can see from our accounts, we have been given additional resources over the past five or six years.  Part of that investment has been within the security service portion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

If I can ask, in terms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are there sufficient resources for ongoing monitoring of that type activity by various governments or agencies that may be involved in such - perhaps ones not as far away as Russia; perhaps ones that are closer?</p></speech>

If I feel that our resources are insufficient, I have an open channel to the Minister in terms of the resources, equipment or processes that we might need.  We also work very closely with our European allies.  Much of this is a collective effort.  We collectively pool our resources to protect, in effect, the EU.</p></speech>

I know it was reported that State agencies were often targeted.  In terms of State agencies, the political arena and various other sectors, would part of that involve the internal security in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well?

Agreed.  I would also like to acknowledge the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly over the past number of years and the successes that it had in respect of some major criminal gangs.  It is the fruit of that.  There was a feeling, perhaps two or three years ago, that the public felt vulnerable.  I am sure in the city many people felt vulnerable because of the situation where some people felt they were untouchable.  The successes in that regard are good and I just want to acknowledge that.

It is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Number three relates to InterTradeIreland, which is one of the North-South bodies, for 2020.  It is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Number four is Institute of Technology, Tralee, a dissolved body for which this is the final set of financial statements.  It relates to 2019 and 2020, an extended accounting period.  That gets a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Finally, Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board 2020 gets a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The InterTradeIreland account was signed off on 9 August so there appears to be a delay.

The Comptroller and Auditor General has explained this previously but how precisely does the audit process work when the body crosses two jurisdictions?  Is he satisfied that the process is sufficiently streamlined and that there can be maximum public confidence in it?</p> <p>  On the Royal Irish Academy and the deferred pension funding asset issue which, as he noted, is similar to the university sector, what are the implications of that?  Are there plans to address it or will this just be an opinion we receive on every audit he provides relating to this sector?</p></speech>

In the case of InterTradeIreland, the lead is the Northern Ireland Audit Office.  We co-ordinate on the plan and both offices review the findings of the audit but the work on the ground is carried out by the lead authority.  We discuss between ourselves the issues that might arise.  It is complicated and there can be further complications if explanations are required, particularly if a body has to go back to parent departments in two jurisdictions.  When the explanation comes through, there are processes of presentation of the financial statements on both sides of the Border that may contribute to the delay in submitting it to the Houses.</p><p> I refer to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.  Many third level institutions, particularly universities, have other sources of income apart from grants from the State.  They need to recognise that they have accrued pension liabilities but if they did not recognise a matching pension funding asset the picture on their balance sheets would be distorted and it would look like they were insolvent.  However, the expectation is that it might be 50 years before these liabilities are drawn down.  They are effectively assuming that the Exchequer will meet the pension liabilities as they arise.  Because they do not have a guarantee that the State will do that, I am drawing attention to it.  It is something we have been doing for many years.  If the committee takes the view that it understands that point I will consider whether it makes sense to continue to draw attention to it.  I have been reflecting on whether it is necessary.</p></speech>

Deputy Carthy had a question about the accrued leave that was paid for when the chief executive departed.  For the information of the committee, the Department of Finance circular No. 27 of 2003 provides for that kind of payment and it also sets out the framework for carrying forward leave from period to period.  It is possible to accrue leave of the amount in this example, which was 41 days.  I understand that in this particular case the chief executive expected to be leaving earlier in the year, which was 2020.  Due to the Covid restrictions it was not possible for the Department to go ahead with its recruitment competition so his departure got delayed.  That was all part of what resulted in that significant payment.</p></speech>

Can we agree and note the accounts and statements?  Agreed.  As usual, the accounts and statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  The next business is correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that are not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p> <p>  No. 1128B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE from 11 March.  This is information requested by the committee on additional nursing home charges.  We held this over from last week and it is proposed to note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It was flagged by Deputy Munster and I am not sure if she is present so I propose that we move on.  We will take that as dealt with and that correspondence is there if the Deputy wants to review it and comment on it in future.</p> <p>  No. 1137B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 March 2022, responding to the committee&rsquo;s request that Accounting Officers' remuneration be published as part of the appropriation accounts of Departments and offices.  This is beginning with the presentation of accounts for 2021.  Members will recall that we wrote to the Department proposing a number of changes to the format and content of the appropriation accounts.  The Secretary General agreed to examine the proposal for the 2022 accounts, and it was subsequently requested that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the remuneration of Accounting Officers should be included in the 2021 accounts.  It is welcome that this will be done and that will include a comparator for 2020.  The circular giving effect to this change was circulated to members yesterday.  I propose that the committee notes and publishes this item of correspondence; requests a progress update by the end of September this year on each of the changes to the appropriation accounts proposed by the committee and includes the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department of Expenditure and Reform on 19 May.</p> <p>  I will open this matter to the floor before seeking agreement on those proposals.  Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy have flagged this item.</p></speech>

The reference to this was a request coming late in the timeframe for preparation and sign off on the accounts.  This is information that is readily available within the Department and the letter and request from our committee was sent on 31 January so I do not accept that there would be difficulties in Departments providing this information.</p> <p>  The second query I would like to make in response to Mr. Moloney is on his reference to the timescale.  He stated: "...this disclosure will for 2021 be based on the remuneration associated with the grade."  That is not the information we have sought.  We have sought the net remuneration received by Accounting Officers.  We are aware of the situation in the Department of Health where a public statement was made that an Accounting Officer was waiving a portion of his or her salary.  This committee needs to be clear that it is seeking information on how much was paid to the Accounting Officer in each Department.  I see no reason that would not, and could not, be provided for 2021.  I ask that we request that in clear terms in our correspondence with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We should also inform each Department that we are seeking this information, either in the form of the accounts, or where that information cannot be provided due to the timescale and the preparation of the accounts, it should be provided in a note to the committee.</p></speech>

This is not information that is unknown; it is known.  The committee would not view this as an acceptable response.  There will be issues and they are linked to this.  For example, a precedent was set regarding the remuneration for the Secretary General at the Department of Health.  Would that pay scale carry if the person was reshuffled?  That is an example of a question that will crop up and we have not had a response yet to the report of the committee that was sent to the Department.  We have to keep an eye on that to make sure we get an adequate response.</p> <p>  Mr. Moloney states: "The Department had already agreed to consider a range of possible changes to the appropriation account framework for 2022."</p><p>The person who is probably best placed to know the impact of that is the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It would be useful to hear whether that has gone far enough.  In Mr. McCarthy's opinion, is it a meaningful difference?  Could the changes to the framework go further?</p></speech>

The Department pointed out it was already making changes in one area relating to legal costs.  One of the other areas was pay and staffing.  One of the things requested was remuneration details for the Accounting Officer.  It is well established as regards chief officers in other organisations that it is the actual payment in the year that is reported.  The Accounting Officer who replied regarding that on 6 January stated, in effect, the Department would consider the changes that were laid out but the circular had already issued for 2021.  In the context of changes for 2022, the Department is willing to engage in a dialogue and to look at how things might be measured and defined and so on.  The committee's subsequent letter was dated 31 January so there was not a major delay in responding to the committee's request that remuneration of the Accounting Officer could be included for 2021.  That was the sequence.</p> <p>  The big changes I see are in the other area, which relates to EU claims and funding.  There was a suggestion by the committee in November that things such as the gender pay gap would be included.  A little work will be involved in arriving at a set of definitions so that everybody is clear what it is we are trying to measure and report.</p></speech>

As a parent, I know what that meant when my children were growing up.  You would say "Oh, I'll think about it" or "I'll consider it" and you knew full well you were never going to agree to it.  We all did it.  The word "consider" comes across as very paternalistic to me.  Is there any good reason we should not know this information?  The message that is coming across to me is, in essence, paternalistic, hoping we will forget about it and that the Department will not have to do it.  I do not find that acceptable.</p></speech>

In one particular instance, the Accounting Officer in the Department of Health made a very public statement indicating he was waiving a portion of that salary.  I want, and what I hope this committee is seeking, the figure relating to the remuneration when that waiver was included in that or any other Department where it happened.  It is not necessarily the salary that is assigned for the position but the salary that is actually drawn down.</p> <p>  Of course, I do not intend to seek details of tax or any other deductions from source, but it is crucially important for public trust, and in respect of public statements that have been made, that the committee and the public have access to that information, which we have sought separately from the Department but has not been provided up until this point.  It is something we should agree to pursue.  Otherwise, it will erode public trust if people make statements of that nature and do not provide the full information. </p></speech>

We will seek that specific piece of information regarding gross remuneration.  The other two proposals are to request a progress report by the end of September 2022 on each of the changes to the appropriation accounts proposed by the committee and include the matter on the agenda for our meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1139B is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 21 March 2022, providing follow-up information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 10 February 2022.  It includes information on the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on external advisory services relating to the national broadband plan, which amounts to in excess of &euro;16 million since 2020, and a short note on what the Department is doing to decrease its reliance on such services.  We also address this in our report on the Department&rsquo;s 2019 and 2020 accounts, which we will publish next week.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy and I wanted to raise this matter.  In reading this correspondence before the meeting, I noted that Analysys Mason received &euro;6.852 million, Ernst and Young received &euro;8.251 million and William Fry received &euro;1.3 million.  The Department sets out 28,309 interactions in total with the National Broadband Ireland contact centre and outlines the level of work.  The note in the correspondence relating to efforts to try to move away from that does not tell us an awful lot.  I wonder whether more details can be given.</p> <p>  On the rent and fees paid to other companies by National Broadband Ireland, despite the fact it is year one, there is already a &euro;9.4 million outlay relating to the rental of poles and ducts.  That is one we need to keep an eye on in the years ahead as the roll-out of the plan accelerates.  It was at a very early stage last year and was only barely starting.  That figure will be substantial and the committee needs to keep a watching brief on it.  Deputy Murphy wanted to speak on this as well.</p></speech>

If it was to continue going as it is over its lifetime, it would make it way more expensive.</p><p>My understanding is that the Department deals with the administrative side, but the technical side is where we have the serious questions.  Providing these services in house may well end up being a better option than employing consultants if the consultants are there in perpetuity.  The letter states that since the contract was signed with Analysys Mason, payments of &euro;6.95 million have been made.  I think we should ask about the duration of the contracts in each of the three cases, namely, with Analysys Mason, EY and William Fry.</p><p> The letter goes on to state that since the contract was signed with William Fry in 2020, payments of &euro;1.32 million have been made in respect of legal advisory services.  Would it be possible for those legal advisory services to be got in house?  We should inquire about that.  This is all going to be within the same range of expertise.  It is not as if it will involve, first, buying a house and then opening a road.  It could end up being much better value for money if there were in-house expertise, and we should ask about that.</p><p> On the final page of the letter, there is a reference to arrangements being in place for effective knowledge transfer between advisers and the core team to mitigate their reliance on external advisers.  I would like some more detail on what the knowledge transfer is and whether that has yet been scoped out.  That is the kind of detail we will need.  The letter goes on to state the Department's core team has expanded over the past year, with seven posts having been filled in 2021 and a further 14 additional posts in the process of being filled to replace some of the external resources, and that more expertise will be brought in house, which is welcome.  It would be useful to get a breakdown by technical grade of the incoming staff in order that we will have some marker to see what changes are taking place.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, it has recruited an additional seven staff and is in the process of filling 14 additional posts.  We might ask to be briefed on the timeline for that.</p></speech>

The report remains subject to legal consideration but the president expects to provide a further update to the committee in the coming weeks.

No other items of correspondence have been flagged.</p> <p>  The next issue is the work programme.  On 7 April, we will continue our series of justice-related meetings with two engagements.  We will examine the financial statements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission that morning and those of the Policing Authority that afternoon.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to have separate speaking rotations for each engagement.  The speaking rota and work programme have been updated accordingly.</p> <p>  There are two non-sitting weeks over Easter.  Our next meeting thereafter will be with representatives of the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service on 28 April.  With regard to that latter engagement, I suggest that we request an update on the independent review of the voluntary mess committees in Irish prisons and seek clarity as to whether the report of that review can be available to the committee in advance of the engagement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Members might recall we highlighted that issue in our report.</p> <p>  Our engagements for May are as follows.  Representatives of the Department of Finance will be before the committee on 5 May.  Representatives of the University of Limerick will be before the committee on 12 May.  Representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be before the committee on 19 May.  Representatives of the Department of Health and the HSE will attend on 26 May.  That meeting will relate to a number of issues that are in the public domain.  For the meeting with representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May, it is open to us to include on the agenda Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances, Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  Do members wish to include all of the Votes on the agenda for 19 May or would they rather examine any one of those Votes as a separate engagement?  Members seem happy enough to address them all at the same time.  We examined the Office of Government Procurement separately last year.  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is a new Vote.  How do members wish to proceed?  Are they happy that we address all of those Votes at the one meeting?  I take it they are.</p> <p>  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also responsible for Vote 15 - secret service, which cannot be examined in any substantive way.  It is proposed to exclude that Vote from that agenda.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  That Vote has to do with State security.  As agreed earlier, we will also include the format and content of the appropriation accounts on the agenda for that meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  It was noted at last week's meeting that a response has not been received from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the committee's request for further information regarding the closure of the Benefacts database.  The Department provided a response yesterday and it will be circulated on Monday for consideration at next week's correspondence meeting.  It is also proposed to include the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department on 19 May.  We felt the Benefacts database was an important matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  As usual, if there is any specific area of interest to members and which they wish to raise, I ask them to notify the clerk so that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies can be prepared to engage on the issues.  Are there any other matters that members wish to raise for inclusion on the work programme?  There are not.  A list of subjects that members have mentioned is attached to the documents before committee members, if they want to review it and come back to future meetings with it.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.</p> <p>  The final item on the agenda is any other business.  Do any members wish to raise any other matters?  If not, we will go into private session before adjourning until 7 April, when we will examine the 2020 financial statements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the 2020 appropriation accounts of Vote 41 - the Policing Authority.</p></speech>
