The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 7 December and 14 December 2017.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is matters arising out of the minutes and I have two such matters to raise.  At the meeting of 7 December, the committee requested that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provide detailed information on eight points listed in the minutes.  Six weeks later, we have not received that information.  As regards the minutes of 14 December, the committee listed two points on which the Department of Finance was to provide information but, five weeks later, we have not received it.  I acknowledge that the intervening period included the Christmas break.  I propose that both Secretaries General will be listed to appear in person on this day two weeks to explain why they did not provide the information.  That is now being organised.  If the committee receives the information by next Thursday, they will not have to come in person but if it is not here for the meeting next Thursday, both Secretaries General will be here the following week.  I have checked the previous meeting at the end of November and we have received the reply from the Revenue Commissioners but we are not starting the year by allowing six, seven or eight weeks for a reply to be furnished.  When a witness is here in public session and is asked for information, we expect it back within a week, or perhaps ten days in some cases.  However, six weeks is not acceptable and those Secretaries General will be here on this day two weeks if we do not receive complete replies, which will be a signal to all Accounting Officers that we want a prompt response to requests for information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018011800002#B00800"><p>The Chair mentioned the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I put a series of questions in regard to JobPath to the Accounting Officer of that Department.  I find it incredible that the witnesses were able to give us a headline figure of how much was spent over an 18-month period but were unable to break down or even provide a headline figure for how much was spent on the two organisations that deliver JobPath.  It is amazing that the overall figure is known and in the public domain but the Department says it cannot give the breakdown because of commercial sensitivity.  If organisation A knows it got a certain amount, it then knows how much organisation B got because there are only two organisations involved.  There is, therefore, no reason that we cannot be given that information.</p> <p>  I have to leave for personal reasons and wish to address a separate matter that arises under correspondence.  Senator Conway-Walsh and Deputy Mitchell submitted a report on JobPath exposed.  Can that be held over for discussion next week?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the case of RT&Eacute; is a bit more complicated because it is a public service organisation but it is still a significant amount of money and the Accounting Officer was only able to tell us that a cheque for &euro;170 million is signed and that is about it.  That is not appropriate.  The same applies to the situation involving JobPath.  This was a significant percentage of the budget of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The money is given to those two organisations and we were unable to get any answers on how the fees are paid or how they work.  That is unacceptable.  We are not able to do our job.</p></speech>

That is the template we are setting out from this point forward.</p> <p>  A significant amount of correspondence has been received since the last meeting and we will go through it as efficiently as we can.  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and other items for publishing.  Correspondence item No. 963 is carried over from the last meeting and regards information on ETBs from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  We have received a considerable amount of information, which has been circulated.  We will come back to the third level sector.  Is it agreed to note it?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence item No. 973 was also held over.  It is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills and relates to the terms and conditions of employment of State employees, in particular teachers who are paid but not directly employed by the State.  Is it agreed to note it?  Agreed.  Members are free to use that information as they see fit now that it has been published.</p> <p> The next item is correspondence item No. 976, which we held over from the last day.  It is from Ms Angela Black, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board and is dated 8 December 2017.  It relates to information requested by the committee regarding the re-structuring of Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service.  We held that over because Deputy Aylward, who raised the issue, was not in attendance.  However, all members have received the letter in the past day or two.  There is a very final decision on that.  The letter is in the public arena and there has been political comment on it.  At this point, we will just note that correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item No. 986 from the HSE, which provides a substantial amount of information related to the Deloitte report on the cost of care incurred by the service provider in the Grace case.  I want to get one aspect of that out of the way.  A journalist has made a freedom of information request.  We have asked some similar questions of the HSE.  Obviously, the documentation being provided by the HSE is part of the freedom of information request.  There is a cross-over between what we have been requesting and our correspondence.  We want to get formal clearance because the HSE has asked if it can release our correspondence under a freedom of information request.  That is automatic but we have to agree to it.  There is a reference to a document on this topic, which I note is approximately 400 pages, which I have not examined.  We will be careful not to reopen the Grace case with a 400 page document.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018011800002#B01800"><p>On that matter, I welcome that we have finally got the documentation.  I had a quick look at it, as did a person in my office.  It is very difficult for members to be presented with 409 pages of documentation.  We could not possibly go through it for today's meeting.  One then loses track of why we asked the question in the first place.  To go back to the kernel of the question, an independent report was commissioned as a result of the most serious concerns by the service providers, and the whistleblowers in particular, that the provider had not been sufficiently funded.  They believed they had been punished or that they suffered.  However, I can certainly stand over the fact that they were saying they did not get enough money to provide care for Grace, which I understand to be the nub of the matter.  An independent report was commissioned to look into that.  When I look at the independent report I begin to worry.  That is absolutely no reflection on Deloitte, which was asked to do a job.  However, when the a report is commissioned and then they start to have all of this-----</p></speech>

I have to say that.</p><p>It would seem to me, as a member of this committee, from the documentation that I have seen since I have been here,<b></b>it is clear that not enough money was provided for the care of Grace.  That is the opinion that I have formed.  Separately, the High Court made a settlement and part of the settlement was to provide money for the care of Grace.  Looking at it in a reasonable manner, not enough funding was provided.  We then have a report in which the HSE is at pains, from what I have seen in the various emails, to point to other services it has funded and the moneys it has given out and to make comparisons.  Does that mean there are Grace cases in other institutions that are comparable?  It seems to me that this stands on its own because of the facts of the case.  The service provider had to take over the case and provide additional services to her.  It should be clear as to whether the HSE funded the service provider for that purpose.  Did it recognise that this was a very special case that required full attention on a 24 hours a day basis?  Was that recognised?  I do not see that it was.  I will be guided by the Chair as to where we go with all of this documentation.  I have no concerns about Deloitte.  However, I want to say on the record that I have serious concerns about the independence of a report that was commissioned by the HSE, which then appears to seek to determine the way the report is laid out. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018011800002#C00200"><p>I echo those points.  I have raised the issue of the independence of many of these reports several times from a process perspective.  I am deeply uncomfortable with it.  It chimes with an item of correspondence that deals with expenditure on consultants and legal firms by third level institutions.  We will talk about that, but the points are the same.  We have to stop and reflect on all of that and possibly have a stand-alone meeting on it at some point.  It irritates me that we come in here to do a job and - taking this case as an example - we have 400 pages of correspondence which we, with our limited staff, have to go through.  We have had the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Education and Skills and different universities in here.  We have seen wrongdoing.  We have had all sorts of reports, most of which have been external, so-called independent reports.  Nobody is ever held to account.  I am not aware of any individual in any of those organisations who has been held to account by any of them.  A good example is the HSE.  It commissioned a report, set the terms of reference and paid the authors.  If we look at the education example, the same organisations act as internal auditors and consultants and also produce the final reports.  They are the same people, and there is a lot of money involved.  I do not know whether they could be genuinely seen as independent if they are the same people doing the same jobs.  At the beginning they are the auditors, then they carry out the independent reports.  I cannot see how they can be considered independent.</p> <p>  We asked for all this correspondence, and I do not know whether the Comptroller and Auditor General's office does the same when it carries out special reports.  I am asking for guidance in terms of whether it is fair procedure.  An independent report is carried out and a draft report is carried out.  It is then sent back to the organisation for comment.  How much of the report is influenced by the organisation which pays for the report to be done?  Can that genuinely be seen as independent?  I have a problem with that process.  We saw it with the report that was carried out on the education and training boards, ETBs, as well, where there were question marks around the author of the report contacting some witnesses coming before the Committee of Public Accounts.  There are many question marks, for me, around the independence of independent reports that are looking into wrongdoing, systems failures or process failures.  At the end of it all we are left with a stack of so-called independent reports and nobody is held to account.  There is a need for us to stop and reflect on that and carry out an analysis of it.  </p></speech>

We will not discuss it any further while we are on this point, other than to say that we will come back to it.  The same organisations crop up, whether the legal advisers, professional advisers or financial advisers.  Sometimes a major company can provide different services to the same organisations.  We will not do it today, but we might consider writing to the professional bodies, whether the Law Society, Chartered Accountants Ireland or the other accountancy bodies, to ask what procedures are in place in their institutes and client companies to ensure there is independence when different members of the same firm carry out separate projects in which they might be asked to adjudicate on a report that a colleague on the floor above had carried out a few months before.</p></speech>

If we look at the third level report - I know that it is not what we are discussing now - the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is supposed to be the authority.  Much of the work could be done in-house.  Is the HEA outsourcing huge amounts of this consultancy work which can actually be done by staff in-house?  It is its function.</p></speech>

I propose to put this on the public record and read out the total from each of the companies.  This information would be publishable under freedom of information, FOI, if any journalist in Ireland made such a request.  With all due respect to what the HEA is saying, we will revisit this issue.  I have seen State Claims Agency-published lists of everybody it employs and the fees paid, and there is no reason why this cannot be the case here.</p><p>However, in deference to the request not to publish, we will hold over that decision until next week.  Personally, I believe that information is public information in the public arena and is publishable under FOI if that request is made.  That is my view on it but we will confirm that next week.  <br/><br/>No. 1008B is from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform providing a minute to the Committee of Public Accounts on the report on the examination of financial statements in the third level sector.  It is positive that the recommendations have almost all being accepted or noted with just a couple of cases with challenges or points.  We will be monitoring progress through future engagements with the sector.  However, there are two minutes regarding two of our special reports before us today, including this one, and I propose we hold this item over to study it because while it is fine for the Department to say it agrees with everything the committee has said, I am more interested in whether it will happen.  This document has 17 detailed pages relating to several of our recommendations.  I propose we hold that over for discussion.  We will just hold it over as I do not think members have read it.  We will make our views known.  It has been suggested that we might seek an update but as this document only came to us just before Christmas, it should be as up to date as is possible at present.  We will come back for a detailed discussion.  When we issue a special report, it goes to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who must respond to us.  We then consider his response so that is the full wheel going as to where the public accountability is.  It does not stop with the public meetings or with us following it up with correspondence.  It does not stop with us issuing our own report thereafter.  It goes to the Minister for what we will call a Government response and then comes back to us for us to consider whether we are satisfied with the response from the Government so it comes back to the Committee of Public Accounts so we will come back to that next week.  <br/><br/>No. 1014B from Ms Sin&eacute;ad Whooley in the National Shared Services Office dated 11 January 2018 stating it is now a separate statutory office and no longer within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that it has a separate Vote heading.  We will discuss it as part of the work programme.  <br/><br/>No. 1016B from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, providing follow-up information on the procurement of management services for the proposed escrow account relating to Apple and a note on the timeline for recoupment of &euro;13 billion and the impact of same on GDP.  We will note and publish this document.  The essence of the point so far is that Mr. Moran says that:</p><blockquote>Given the scale and bespoke nature of the establishment of the recovery process, at this stage it is not possible to provide a definitive date for the completion of the collection of all the alleged aid.  However, as set out above, identification of the Escrow Agent / Custodian by end [March] 2018 will then allow for payment into the escrow fund thereafter with payments continuing through the course of [April, May and June and up to the end of September] 2018.  </blockquote><p>We will put this in the public arena.  We asked about the impact of these funds being held in the escrow account on the State's balance sheets.  EUROSTAT has confirmed that because the funds are dispute until a final determination on that matter is made, they will not be included in EUROSTAT figures for our national debt or our income because the matter is contested.  That decision does not have to be determined until the matter is concluded.  We have all seen correspondence about Apple.  </p></speech>

Our sole role concerns mechanisms to get the &euro;13 billion lodged.  It appears that this will happen.  Because it covered a number of years, I think they are dealing with each year and there will probably be a separate lodgement.  It is not a question of one big lodgement for the entire period.  They will probably do it in stages.  It gives the impression that this will be completed by September.  That is all we know about the escrow account.</p> <p>With regard to the big issue, that is not a Committee of Public Accounts issue in fairness but it is a fair question to ask at the same time.  </p> <p>  No. 1019B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 11 January 2018 provides follow-up information, including notes on criminal convictions for tax and duty evasion, a breakdown of the number of companies claiming research and development credit, a note on timeline relating to Apple and alleged state aid and a note on double taxation agreements.  With regard to multinationals and employment by multinationals, members may wish to consider if and what further information needs to be provided as per Revenue's notes.  I acknowledge the letter received.  We will note and publish that.  There is information there.  However, there is one issue.  We asked for a note on the top 100 multinationals that differentiated between foreign and indigenous multinationals.  Revenue does not have this information readily to hand.  It is probably a very specific question.  It says it hopes to include it in its analysis for the 2016 corporation tax returns and 2017 payments.  It will include that information when it is producing the next publication but it is not available at this point in time.  At least, it will be included, which is a positive step.  </p> <p>  No. 1024B is the minute from the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to the Committee of Public Accounts report on the examination of matters relating to financial procedures at the Garda Training College, Templemore.  Module one is the detailed briefing note, which we have there.  Like the other briefing note relating to the Minister's response to our special report, we will hold that over until next week because we want to go through that line by line.  </p> <p>  The next items are correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Nos. 877 ,1017,1020, 1021, 1022 and 1023 involve a large number of items of correspondence received on various dates between 20 October 2017 and 3 December 2017.  They are from an employee of the Department of Employment and Social Protection.  In summary, five issues are covered dealing mainly with financial controls and corporate governance regarding the appointment to certain positions at the Department of Employment and Social Protection; whistleblower strategies; investigations by the Comptroller and Auditor General - matters pursued by the Comptroller and Auditor General with the Department and the Revenue Commissioners; social insurance where it was suggested revenue was lost because of classification of employment status; and legal matters related to the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  As members will recall, this individual has been in frequent contact with the committee.  We have given the matter considerable time previously and it has taken up considerable time for the secretariat.  We have also sought legal advice on the matter and following that, we wrote to the individual, most recently on 18 October.  We have recognised that there is some merit in an examination of employer PRSI classification and I note it is up for consideration under the Coillte correspondence today, not an un-connected letter, and there might be a judicial review so we will have watch that particular issue.  The individual has also raised questions relating to the operation of the whistleblowers legislation.  We all believe this legislation must be followed and implemented fully and if there is no adherence to the legislation, it must go through the Workplace Relations Commission.  I and other members of this committee have met the individual on separate occasions.  I asked him to put forward key points.  Having examined the key points, which are included in the five or six items of correspondence, we believe that our position as outlined after receiving legal advice in our letter of 18 October still stands.  I understand the sincerity of the individual.  However, because the outcome is not as he might wish it to be, it does not mean the committee will keep returning to the matter at committee level.  Individual members are, of course, free to pursue particular points through the Chamber or other relevant committees but I would suggest that at this stage, we state clearly that the Committee of Public Accounts will not pursue the matter.  I suggest we will not be initiating a special Committee of Public Accounts examination of the matter as requested.  I propose that any further documentation from the individual not be circulated and that it be returned to him as appropriate when we confirm this to him in writing.  Can we agree on this because this is ongoing?  We have already said that after legal advice.  The correspondence is still coming and we are saying we will not circulate it further.  Individual members of the committee can take it up individually but the items are not strictly for the Committee of Public Accounts.  A wide range of other committees could look at the different issues that are covered there but we propose that the Committee of Public Accounts will not circulate any further information.  We will write to the individual stating that.  </p> <p>  No. 988C from an individual dated 11 December 2017 relates to a grievance case brought to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</p><p>The matter relates to An Post, which is not an organisation under the remit of the committee.  I suggest that the committee does not involve itself in individual cases that have been decided by the Workplace Relations Commission.  I propose that the committee forwards the matter on to the Committee for Communications, Climate Action and Environment for its attention, and we will inform the individual accordingly that the matter is about An Post.</p><p> No. 989C, from the Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, provides a note on the committee's query on the alleged awarding of a contract by the Minister without a tendering process.  The Department has stated that there was no contract in place.  The committee will forward this reply to the individual who raised the query.</p><p> No. 991C is from David O'Hagan, solicitor to the Farrelly commission of investigation in the Grace case and is dated 13 December.  It is about documentation sent to it by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The documentation had not been acknowledged because of a technical error.  This is noted.</p><p> No. 993C is from the Coillte business and communication manager dated 15 December and No. 1029C is from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These relate to the PRSI classification of certain Coillte staff.  Coillte states that there is a High Court appeal and it will not comment on the committee's query until the case is concluded.  I propose we write to Coillte to ask for an update to the committee following the appeal and that we forward this item to the individual who raised the matter.  Agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> There is a very detailed note included with No. 1029C on matters that have been before the appeals commissioner around issues of whether people who have been in the public service are established or permanent public servants.  I have read the correspondence and it is quite an interesting issue.  I do not believe it will affect more than Coillte.  I cannot recall the phrase off-hand but it involves those who were working in different categories within State bodies, maybe in temporary positions, who then became permanent.  Is their PRSI contribution backdated to when they started?  The issue hinges on whether they were permanent or established.  There is judicial review ongoing regarding this matter.  We will all have an interest in this when it works through the system.  There were interesting points in that correspondence.  The committee will ask to be updated on this.</p><p> No. 994C is from an individual who had been in touch with the committee before about her position as radiographer in Naas General Hospital.  The matter goes back over 20 years.  The person is now retired.  The committee wrote to the individual on that occasion informing her that it would not be taking the matter further.  I propose we note the correspondence.</p><p> No. 996C was forwarded to me from an individual and received on 23 November 2017.  The individual raises questions about the HSE&rsquo;s adversarial approach in relation to legal challenges and the amount of money spent on legal services.  I propose that the committee writes to the HSE for a response.  Agreed?  Agreed.  We all know the bottom line is that every time &euro;1 million is awarded through the State Claims Agency, with regard to cases defended by the State, there is 50% on top of that due to legal and professional fees.  The correspondence raises a very valid point.  If the cases were contested differently or earlier, could that amount be reduced?  We will ask the HSE and the State Claims Agency for a response.  It is an ongoing issue and it is raised at this committee year in and year out.  </p></speech>

At what point does the different approach kick in?  This money is a valuable resource that could be used on services if we could get to a point that there is an acceptance rather than the very adversarial approach.

When, however, the management deny, deny, deny they get people's backs up who will then go to the ends of the earth.  These people may have accepted the truth up front if they had got the truth up front.  In my experience it is the denial of the truth early on in the situation that leads to both sides ratcheting up their arguments.  Tony O'Brien made a valid point on this issue when he was last before the committee.  I asked why in some of these cases the children are seven, eight, nine or ten years of age.  Mr. O'Brien said that in some cases it takes time to work out what the long-term effects are.  One cannot know this by the second birthday.  It was a valid point but just applies to some cases.  I say it just for the record and for fairness.  There are, however, far bigger issues than why they get contested in the first place.</p></speech>

It was clarified that there was a policy of open disclosure, which was supposed to change all of this.  The point is validly made; when did the policy come in and what have been the changes since then?  In my own experience, with serious issues of medical negligence people are most reluctant to go down the court route.  They are actually forced down it.  It is not that they want to go to the ends of the earth.  It is quite the opposite, they want to stay with their child and love their child.  They are forced into an adversarial system.  It is appalling and it soaks their energy.  The committee should have a report back on the policy of open disclosure.  It is about value for money so it comes directly under our remit, not to mention being about treating people with dignity.  I remind the committee of the famous Deloitte report, a simple report required on value for money, which took more than one year to complete.  We are now looking at some 400 items.  In fairness we asked for it and this is what they gave us.  If this is an indication of how a system functions then open disclosure will not make much of a difference unless there is a serious commitment given to recognising that we must change the system.  Theoretically we have it changed, so let us see the result of it.</p></speech>

Over the previous three years it had totalled some &euro;20 million.  The parents were only seeking education for their children.  Part of the reason people take cases is because they have no expectation that services will be there for their children.  I have never met a parent with a child who has special needs that does not have a huge file for their permanent lobbying.  There is a piece of the picture that is open disclosure but there are other pieces that we might identify around the investment in services.  This could be part of the same piece.</p></speech>

We will forward the transcript of this discussion relating to what we are asking for, and we will also ask about open disclosure, as the Deputies have requested.  I remember the HSE telling the committee some years ago that it had this new policy and that the State Claims Agency was monitoring every case as soon as it happened.  The cases were flagged up to the agency so it would know what was coming down the line so that it could learn more from the process, avoid future cases recurring and be a learning process.  It was not a legal process about paying our money it is a learning process for prevention into the future.  This is one aspect of the early disclosure and we would like to see how it is working out.  Does Mr. McCarthy have any observations on this?</p></speech>

I did a report some four years ago on the operation of the State Claims Agency.  There was a good discussion at this committee at the time.  One of the items that has not been taken from last year's annual report is matters in relation to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  If the committee was minded it could call upon that agency in the future, or when the committee looks at its programme, and maybe it would be timely to ask the State Claims Agency to give an update on developments since it was previously discussed here.</p></speech>

The concerns raised by the councillor were discussed by the committee before Christmas.  This documentation she submitted included several technical drawings and notes.  It is proposed that we forward this documentation, which relates to a health and safety issue in respect of the construction, to the Department because we are not qualified to adjudicate in that matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 999B is correspondence from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, updating the committee on the incorporation of NUI Galway and St. Angela's College, Sligo.  I propose that we note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Nos. 1001C and 1005C are correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the fact that Ms Oonagh McPhillips is replacing Mr. Noel Waters as Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The National Shared Services Office also has a new Accounting Officer, Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan, who is replacing Mr. Robert Watt.  We will note and publish that.</p><p> No. 1002C is correspondence from Ms Susan Gilvarry, solicitor to the Cooke commission in respect of NAMA's Project Eagle.  Ms Gilvarry requested specific committee documentation.  As was previously agreed, the secretariat have provided the documentation requested in this correspondence.  We are bringing this to the notice of committee members.</p></speech>

The matter appears to be with the Office of the Ombudsman.  I propose that we note the correspondence and allow the Ombudsman's' office to complete its work.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1009C is a letter from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, regarding the committee's correspondence on the timely presentation by public bodies of their annual financial statements.  I welcome Mr. Watt's support and commitment for the work the committee is doing.  We will note and publish this.  I wish to draw the attention of the public to the fact that the committee wrote to all identified public bodies.  Approximately 200 letters went out to organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General during the Christmas period to remind them of their obligations and our expectation that they meet the required deadlines for the presentation of their financial statements for audit.  We expect to see a major improvement in respect of that matter in the coming year.  We will revisit this in April to see how these bodies are getting on.  In fairness, based on the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is on a parallel track and issued a circular 25/17 stating that the requirement relating to the appropriation accounts for 2017 states that all Government Departments shall be required to include an annexe to the accounts in which will be provided a report on the presentation to the Oireachtas of the financial statements of bodies and funds under their aegis.  That is a welcome step.  It will probably take a year or two to get it up to date.  It is a very positive step and it puts the focus on parent Departments to ensure that the bodies for which they are responsible complete their financial accounts.</p> <p>  Interestingly, we have received a number of letters in response and the next step is when those involved tell us that they have their accounts ready for audit and how long it takes to get the audits done.  Some of the letters have indicated that when the audits are complete, they might have to revert to their own governing bodies or boards of directors in the following month to have them signed off.  They will then go to the Departments, which will prepare minutes for the Cabinet to approve the findings before they can be published.  That can take two or three months.  Yes, we want to get the first step right and ensure that the bodies produce their accounts for audit early.  There are other delays in the system that could be shortened.  We will look at that as the year goes on.</p></speech>

Some bodies make the other point.  One or two made the point that they have done their job and their information is with their parent Departments, so they should not be blamed if they are not published.  It is a valid point but we will look at it in the round.</p> <p>  No. 1010C relates to a report entitled JobPath Exposed.  Deputy Cullinane has asked that this report be held over until the next meeting.  We will hold it over.</p> <p>  No. 1012C is a copy of an email an individual sent to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The matter appears to relate to an environmental issue but it is not clear.  I propose that we note the correspondence.</p></speech>

The correspondence seems to suggest that the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is facing some difficulties in supporting the college in respect of this.  I propose that we write to the OGP for a response to this correspondence and that we note and publish it.  We will look forward to receiving a reply.</p> <p>  No. 1015C is correspondence from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, in response to our letter of October last year on the alleged misappropriation of public funding at a charity, the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  The secretariat had to remind the Department about the matter recently.  I am disappointed that the Department is now suggesting, in its letter of 9 January, that it will take the matter up with the charity directly.  I would have expected that this would have been done before now.  I suggest that we write to the Department stating that we want that followed up within the next ten days.  We will forward the correspondence received to date to the person who contacted us in the first instance.</p> <p>  That is the end of correspondence.

Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB has received a clear audited opinion.  Kerry ETB has received a clear audited opinion.  Attention is drawn to a material level of non-compliance with national procurement rules in respect of goods and services contracts that operated in 2016.  Longford and Westmeath ETB has received a clear audited opinion.  Attention is drawn to suspected fraud that was discovered in 2016 following an investigation.

In particular, the accounting records maintained were not sufficient to facilitate the preparation of financial statements in a timely manner and in the form required or to enable the financial statements to be readily and properly audited.  Attention is also drawn to the statements on internal controls, which disclose control weaknesses in respect of human resource systems, procurement and the documentation of procedures and recording of risks.  In addition, the audit committee did not meet in the 18 month period in 2013-14, a new committee was only appointed in May 2015, the finance committee only met once in each period, and there was no review by the board of the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the period.  We obviously have to write to the chairman of the board, given that-----</p></speech>

It provided much of the information and explanations in those previous letters, and the statement on internal financial control does, I think, fairly comprehensively address the problems it has had.  These financial statements, covering 2013-14, are the first of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB.  We also have the 2015 statement done and we are working on the 2016 statement, so progress is being made there.  It was a difficult situation, it is being rectified and I hope we will get back to a normal track.  The ETB has indicated that it expects to be able to produce its draft financial statements for 2017 on time.</p></speech>

When one sees it in more than one ETB, there is a role for the Department of Education and Skills here.  It is not just one ETB.  Perhaps we should suggest they do significant work on governance because I do not think the board members actually understand their responsibilities or what an audit committee is supposed to do.  There is no point in having these in theory.  These are supposed to be locally keeping a very close eye on things.  We are going to keep seeing problems unless this is put right.</p></speech>

I think the Department, certainly after the meetings that were held here, is seized of the importance of adequate oversight and concentration on the matter.  I think even the idea of the Department now having to produce in its appropriation account an explanation as to what has been done and what has been achieved will keep the pressure on the Department.  I certainly feel there is a lot of progress and a lot of learning in the sector.  If the committee recalls, all of the ETBs were represented here when a number of them were examined.  I think efforts are being made there, and we will keep pointing this out and keep a focus on the timeliness in the future until the matter settles down into an acceptable pattern.</p></speech>

I think it was a very useful exchange from everybody's point of view.  We had SOLAS here as well, whose representatives I commend.  They carried themselves very well that day.  Arising from what we have seen in the education sector and the special reports about the timeliness, that is the sole reason we decided to write individually to each of those 200 audited bodies that have their accounts in.  We were being more proactive on this issue.  I think our level of input in this area is unrivalled now so I think that-----</p></speech>

Attention is drawn to a material level - &euro;836,000 - of non-compliance with national procurement rules in respect of contracts that operated in 2016.  I think at this stage the Comptroller and Auditor General has done his work for 2016.  I think the ETBs have all got a clearer view of where the Committee of Public Accounts is coming from and that we are on their case.  The Department knows we are on the case as well, so I think at this stage we will be watching the 2017 figures very closely, and it is to be hoped we will not see a catalogue such as this for 2017.</p></speech>

The next one is City of Dublin ETB.  It received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to a material level of non-compliance with national procurement rules, and the late review of the effectiveness of internal controls.</p> <p>  Galway and Roscommon ETB received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to a material level - &euro;894,000 - of non-compliance with national procurement rules.  May I ask a question?  It is relevant as it came up separately.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General looks at non-compliance with national procurement rules, does he calculate just a sample or is it the full extent of the non-compliance?</p></speech>

It is a bit like, if the committee recalls, circular 40 of 2002, whereby Departments are required to keep logs of any situations where they do not use a competitive procurement route.

What we do in the case of the HSE is that each year we take, say, two systems and sample within two of the systems.  The difficulty is that we always find a significant level of non-competitive procurement in the HSE, or we have done in the past, but we cannot scale it up because it is not representative of the whole organisation.</p></speech>

It would be very helpful to us.  The figure for Kerry was &euro;1 million, we skipped over it.  We are down to Galway and Roscommon and here we have almost &euro;1 million.  How do we put this into context?</p> <p>  It is awfully important for trust.  Bringing it down to a practical level, it is important for local services and for businesses that there is trust in the procurement system.  As politicians, we have people coming to us and telling us that they could not get in on something or they were not able to give their service there and it brings the institution into disrepute.  That is what I am most concerned about, along with everyone being on an equal footing.  What are the practical problems?  I know that in the past, the HSE told us they were urgent applications and it could not go through the procurement, but that should be a tiny percentage.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Another thing is where someone is locked into a proprietary brand.  It could be a particular type of computer equipment or licences for computer services.  Often, especially in the health sector, people can be locked in to one supplier of a particular kind of machine or diagnostic kit, and drugs are another area.  It is often put forward that there is a sole supplier where only one potential supplier of something can be identified, but it has to be proven that there is only one supplier.  This is the dialogue we have with organisations.  If the Deputy recalls, I think it was the representatives from Dundalk Institute of Technology who spoke of how there was only one person and that they had been working with that person for 15 years.  Organisations can make a case but they must try to prove it to us or there are questions to be answered on that.</p></speech>

The HSE has one of the biggest budgets, after social welfare, in computers and so on, and from what I can see, as a non-expert, it seems that despite all this procurement, there is less and less competition regarding contracts of huge value.  It is urgent that we put it on the committee's work programme, that we get a report and that we examine it.</p></speech>

I think we are now four years into the operation of the Office of Government Procurement.  Many framework agreements are in place and it has done much analysis of what organisations are buying and the specific challenges.  It has a lot of expert people who are specialists in procuring medical or educational supplies and so on.  From a programming perspective, that would probably be the best way to get most value for the committee.  These are the examples of where the thing breaks down somewhat and the challenges that organisations have.</p></speech>

Value for money is the key issue.  I agree with the point made that there is a perception, at least, and it is quite destructive, that there may be preferred people who are fortunate in doing more business with a particular entity.  The procurement rules probably favour the larger countries too.</p> <p>  Is collective purchasing happening in sectors such as the ETBs?  They would mainly purchase the same kinds of thing, although it would have to be delivered at a local level.  Is there any indication that that happens in those types of sectors?  The HSE is one body but there are 16 ETBs.  If, for example, they were all buying biros, is there a way that they could collaborate and there would be one supplier to get better value for money?</p></speech>

On the one hand, competitiveness should be a driver for good value for money, but it is also a driver for equality of access to supply.  Small producers, in particular, have complained that too much concentration of the purchase will rule out small suppliers, especially small local suppliers.  The committee will recall from the last committee the case of the stationery and book suppliers and so on to the education sector were particularly struggling.  There is a balance to be struck between having an appropriate size of tender to achieve an economy of scale but not so big that local suppliers are ruled out of being able to supply the market.  A lot of procurement is around things such as electricity, gas, heating and cleaning supplies or security which are quite big contracts but many of which would be local.  There may be national suppliers who are supplying those kinds of services at a local level.  The most valuable thing that the committee could do would be to have an engagement, perhaps a special meeting, with the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

Deputy Connolly reminded me that I skipped over the Kerry ETB financial statement, which has a clear audit opinion.  Again, it has a material level &euro;1.1 million of non-compliance with national procurement rules in respect of goods and services.</p> <p>  The next item is the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  It has a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to the going concern note and the fact that the institute had incurred a deficit in each year for the past four years and had accumulated a deficit of &euro;1.8 million.  The institute has not provided for the cost of future pension benefits that have accrued to staff members, similar to other institutes, which we note.</p> <p>  The Institute of Technology Sligo has a clear audit opinion.</p><p>The note says that attention is drawn to the basis for recognition of a deferred pension funding.  That means it is an issue.</p><p> The next item is the 2014-2015 accounts for the National College of Art and Design.  The note states that there is a qualified audit opinion on the basis that the college did not keep adequate accounting records for the year.  Attention is drawn to failures in control and governance over a number of years, an operating surplus of &euro;223,000 in the year but an accumulated deficit of &euro;1.2 million, and the basis of recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.

Members are free to download the set of accounts and peruse them.  The next item is the Mental Health Commission.  The note says it has a clear audit opinion.  However, attention is drawn to the fact that the commission accounts for the costs of superannuation entitlements as they become payable.  That is standard in the health sector.  The next item is the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I thank God that the note says clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The note says clear audit opinion.  The final item is the Special EU Programmes Body.  The note says that it is a North-South body that administers EU-funded grant schemes and that it has a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  That completes No. 4 on the agenda today.  We had a substantial list because we have not met in approximately four weeks.  We will now discuss our work programme.  I will run through it quickly.  It is really an update.  Some people were unable to come here on the date suggested and we have added some more items to the agenda.  Perhaps next week, when more people are here, we can have a more detailed discussion.</p> <p>  Next Thursday, we will discuss the national property revaluation programme with the Valuation Office.  On 1 February, we will discuss shared services, specifically the management of salary overpayments, with the National Shared Services Office.  On 8 February, we have officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development in attendance to discuss the Dormant Account Fund.  On 15 February, we will meet to discuss corporation tax receipts and our engagement with multinationals and a consultant.  We will receive an update on the matter in private session.  On Thursday, 22 February, we will deal with the corporation tax issue.</p> <p>  On 1 March, we will discuss a chapter compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General on grant funding for the arthouse cinema in Galway.  We will have officials from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in attendance.  They were scheduled to come here earlier but the date did not suit all around so we re-scheduled.</p> <p>  On 8 March, officials from the Department of Finance will be in attendance to discuss the Exchequer financial outturn, Government debt, appropriation accounts etc.  Some of these details must be confirmed but I have outlined the plan as of today.  On 22 March, we will have officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in attendance to discuss public private partnerships, the Vote for the Department, and superannuation and retired allowances.</p> <p>  On 29 March, we will have officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to discuss central government funding of local authorities, the appropriation accounts for the Department and also a special report on motor taxation.</p><p> On 19 April, which is after Easter, we will have officials from the Department of Justice and Equality dealing with the ICT systems in the Department, which was a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  On Thursday, 26 April officials from the Tax Appeals Commission will appear before the committee.</p><p> There are issues as part of our work programme to which we will have to return.  We also want to deal with the Courts Service.  Other issues being suggested by members are the fair deal scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, and the ETBs.  We will have to look at the education sector, the Cork Institute of Technology and the review of spinout companies in third level.  There is also the Thorn report into the University of Limerick and the report into Kildare-Wicklow ETB, which will be ready quite soon.  Quite a few of those are in the education sector.  The issue of RT&Eacute; has been mentioned.  This morning, we mentioned that we would have officials from the Office of Government Procurement.  That is an indicative list.  Many of the items added on at the end are in the education sector as it happens.</p><p> On the draft work programme, I propose that we have a further discussion later today as we will deal with some items of our work programme in private session with the help of the secretariat.</p><p> One of the chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report deals with the control of Ireland's bilateral aid programme.  The following countries are the principal areas where a programme is in operation: Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Sierra Leone, and Vietnam.  Over the course of the last D&aacute;il, representatives of the committee travelled to Ethiopia, Mozambique and Vietnam to see at first hand how the bilateral programme is working in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The purpose of the visit is to increase understanding and review the controls that are in place to ensure that the public&rsquo;s money is used appropriately.  The visiting team would be expected to report back to the committee.</p><p> There has not been such a visit in this D&aacute;il and I think it might be appropriate to consider travelling to one of these countries, possibly one of the larger areas, such as Tanzania or Uganda.  I would like to get members views on this.  Would this be in consultation with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade or strictly the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

We will ask members to contact the secretariat with their views if they feel such a trip would be beneficial in looking at the overseas bilateral aid programme and if members have a particular interest.  We will not make a decision now.  We will circulate an information note to all members and will discuss it again next week.  This happened in the past.  There is no good reason or bad reason that it should happen in the future.  I am just highlighting that the previous Committee of Public Accounts did it and it is something we will discuss next week.</p></speech>

Local government is in receipt of funds across a number of areas.  The primary one relates to the redistribution of the LPT fund.  There is also the roads fund and there are different block grants.  Does it examine all aspects of that?</p></speech>

That is the aim of it.  It is actually a very complicated kind of track.  Some of the funds go in and out of a number of the accounts that we audit.  As the Deputy said, the local property tax goes into the local government fund and then back to the local authorities.  It is to give an overview of that and a sense of the level of central government funding of local authorities.</p></speech>

We effectively collect motor tax and we spend it on things like Irish Water.  We collect local property tax and we spend it on roads, which is a bit of a conundrum.  There are very significant issues.  I do not know if they will fall within our remit.  For example, there is the issue of how money is disbursed to local authorities.</p> <p>  A particular benchmark was done under the needs and resources model going back to 2000.  That benchmark was to factor in, for example, population changes.  My area along with the areas represented by Deputy Cassells and the Chairman are growing areas that are stuck in a place historically in that their needs were counted in 2000.  Are we looking at the audit?  Are we looking at the configuration?  Are we trying to disentangle?  What are we likely to do in that session?  It took me about six months going back and forth to various sectors to figure out how the benchmarks operate regarding the local property tax, for example.  They are deeply unfair.  Will we be looking at that or will it be done by another committee?</p></speech>

In the context of the chapter on funding to local authorities and particularly the distribution of the 20% of LPT and so on, those kinds of decisions are fairly mechanical decisions once the principles are set.  It would certainly be something that the committee might ask the Department to provide a note for it in advance of the meeting on how the allocations are done and how they ensure fairness because that would be the responsibility of the Department within policy parameters.</p></speech>

We were told the Comptroller and Auditor General had no control of that; it was outside his remit.  Is this a change?

The model that exists for the local property tax was premised on the old model of the block grant on the basis the Department stated no council would be any worse off than it was.  The problem is the model that was in existence was broken to begin with because assessment of towns and counties in terms of the allocation of block grant money did not keep pace with the population explosion that happened, particularly in the commuter counties of Meath and Kildare.  We had extremely large towns on the east coast getting less funding than some smaller towns in peripheral areas in the south of the country because the Department's model did not keep pace.  When there was a transition to the local property tax model, it did not reflect the change of the population structure of the country.  This is where the inherent unfairness existed in how the Department funded local authorities.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank them for attending the meeting today.  The format of the meeting is that each chief officer will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before beginning, I draw the witnesses' attention to privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members to turn off their mobile telephones or to switch them to flight mode as mobile telephones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  In addition, television coverage and web streaming would be adversely affected.</p> <p>  Any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I invite each of the chief officers to make their opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the chief officer for the community health care organisation, CHO, which covers the five counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan.  I have attached maps of the area highlighting the main towns and mental health service delivery locations in appendix 1 of my submission.  I am responsible for the overall management of community health services in CHO area 1.  I am joined by Mr. Padraig O&rsquo;Beirne, area director of mental health nursing services in the Cavan-Monaghan area and chairperson of the inter-agency steering group which developed the suicide prevention strategy, Connecting for Life, for that area.</p> <p>  The total population of CHO area 1 is 391,281.  It is a largely rural area with a low density population and is challenged by relatively high levels of deprivation, a higher percentage of the population with medical or general practitioner, GP, visit cards and limited transport provision compared to national norms.  The CHO was established in 2015 and merges Donegal with Sligo-Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan to form a singular area with four divisions, namely, primary care, social care - which encompasses disability and older people - mental health, and health and well-being.  Acute hospital services in CHO 1 are provided by two hospital groups, the RCSI hospitals group and Saolta University Health Care Group.</p> <p>  The organisation and delivery of mental health services in the area are underpinned by national policy, including A Vision for Change.  Mr. Leo Kinsella is the head of mental health services in CHO 1.  Each geographical area has an integrated area management team chaired by the executive clinical director and includes area directors of mental health nursing, allied health professionals and service user representation.  The main building blocks of the service are consultant led multi-disciplinary teams including inpatient, day services, day hospital and residential care; specialist child and adolescent teams; general adult psychiatry teams; psychiatry of old age teams; specialist teams such as community rehabilitation and psychiatry of intellectual disability; and mental health services encompassing primary care, including counselling in primary care, CIPC, suicide prevention supports, youth mental health, Jigsaw, bereavement support and so forth.</p> <p>  In terms of CHO 1 capacity and funding compared with the A Vision for Change recommendations, I have included in my submission the data already provided to the committee by the national director for mental health.  I draw the members' attention to the particular challenge regarding child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in the area.  For the CAMHS teams servicing the population, we have just over 51% of the clinical staff recommended in A Vision for Change.  Regarding the resources for mental health services, I have provided the key staffing data at December 2017.  In all, we have 940 whole-time equivalents working in mental health services across the five counties.</p><p>In the spreadsheet provided, I have divided the budget for CHO 1 into Sligo-Leitrim, &euro;24.651 million: Donegal, &euro;25.778 million; and Cavan-Monaghan, &euro;23.501 million.  Of the overall CHO 1 budget for community health care, 19% of the budget is apportioned to mental health services and within that, some 8.4% is for child and adolescent mental health services.</p><p> There are two major capital projects ongoing, one of which is in Blackwater House, St. Davnet&rsquo;s Campus, Monaghan.  This project consists of the redesign, refurbishment and extension of Oriel House to meet the needs of the Blackwater patients.  Planning permission has been granted and it is expected that this capital will be completed by the first quarter 2019.  There is also a new acute mental health unit to be developed in Sligo.  This project will consist of a new build unit on the site of Sligo University Hospital with a target completion date of the third quarter of 2019 with an estimated cost in the region of &euro;11.9 million.</p><p> I have included some additional information in the appendices around the keys facts of the demography, health infrastructure and some key developments of the posts and location of centres where mental health service are provided.</p></speech>

I shall briefly outline some of the general direction that we hope our services will take over the coming years.</p> <p>  CHO 2 covers a population of just over 453,000 based on the census from 2016.  As outlined by my colleague, the CHO 2 is an administrative structure within the HSE through which all social care, primary care, health and well-being and mental health services are delivered.  Essentially, this includes all health services in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon outside of the hospital services, which in our area are provided by the Saolta group.</p> <p>  CHO 2 is one of nine community health care organisations.  There is a direct line of governance between me as the chief officer and the national director for mental health services.  In this way, our mental health services in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon are integrated as part of a larger, national governance structure.  The total budget for CHO 2, incorporating all services, in 2017 was &euro;457 million and we employed approximately 4,500 staff across all services.</p> <p>  The mental health services are a very important element of the services that we provide.  In total, 1,296 staff were employed in our mental health services last year across a range of grades.  The breakdown of this information has been provided to the committee in table 1 of my written submission.</p> <p>  Last year, approximately 20% of all expenditure from CHO 2 related to mental health services, some &euro;99 million for the year.  The allocation to our mental health services has increased steadily over the past three years from &euro;92.5 million in 2015, to an increase in 2016 and the spend as I have just outlined for 2017.</p> <p>  Mental health services are provided across a range of settings including inpatient facilities located in all three counties with a total of 125 beds, community-based residences, day hospitals and day centres.  In addition to these services, we also have the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, inpatient facility located in Galway city which meets the needs of the population from Donegal and down through the western seaboard as far as North Tipperary.  This unit is located in Merlin Park in County Galway.  Details of the types and numbers of centres are provided in table 2 of my written submission.</p> <p>  Over the past ten years, in particular, 25 community-based teams have been established across CHO 2 delivering services in the areas of general adult psychiatry, child and adolescent mental health, psychiatry of later life and mental health intellectual disability, MHID.  As such the mental health services in CHO 2 can be said to be largely community based with the support of required inpatient facilities.  This reflects a change of approach over the past 30 years from one which was previously heavily reliant on inpatient care that focused on illness and centring around large institutions such as St. Mary&rsquo;s in Castlebar and St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Ballinasloe, to an approach now focused on community-based delivery and is steadily working towards a wellness model as provided for in A Vision for Change.  Table 3 in my written submission provides an outline of each of the community mental health teams we have across the four service areas.</p> <p>  There are opportunities arising for us.  In 2016, we completed the development of a primary care centre in Castlebar, which will become a base for one of our community mental health teams.  We will shortly complete a similar centre in Westport, County Mayo and we have planning permission to develop a community health team base in Tuam, County Galway.  We are also in the process of completing the development of a new 50 bed inpatient unit on the grounds of Galway University Hospital and minor capital works are taking place across a range of facilities in Castlebar and in Roscommon.  All of these investments are designed to create further opportunities for us to develop our community-based services that integrate well with other more general health services.  This is an important factor of the services we are trying to develop.</p> <p>  We are, however, facing challenges.  Recruitment of qualified nursing and medical staff continues to be a significant issue for CHO 2.  Subsequently, these difficulties lead to a reliance on services provided through agency staff and the cost and other issues associated with this approach to employment.</p> <p>  While great progress has been made in developing our services along the strategic direction outlined for us in A Vision for Change, there is still a lot of work to do in this regard.  We have a highly skilled and motivated workforce that is receptive to the process of continuous improvement, but there are cultural impediments within our services and the communities we serve that we need to overcome if we are to continue to modernise our mental health services.  In recent years, the mental health services have led the way in involving service users in the design and delivery of services.  I say this in the context of the health services generally.  We expect this to develop even further and are very optimistic about the outcomes this involvement will have for our services overall.  The importance of integrating our mental health services with other vital services such as primary care and social care cannot be over emphasised.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and the committee for their time today.</p></speech>

I am joined as a witness by Dr. John O&rsquo;Mahoney, executive clinical director for mental health services in HSE mid-west community health care organisation, CHO 3.  My colleague chief officers have introduced their witnesses and I can advise the committee that we did consult to ensure a mix of some different roles in the make-up of those attending the committee today.</p> <p>  I am the chief officer of HSE mid-west community health care, referenced in previous HSE national submissions to the committee as CHO 3.  I am responsible for the overall management of all health services, excluding acute hospital care, in the mid-west.  Specific to this committee, the mental health service of the mid-west is one of four service divisions which make-up community health care.  The service in the mid-west is part of a national system of nine CHO areas and with regard to mental health I refer the committee to the evidence already given by the national director for mental health and her team in recent months.</p> <p>  The HSE mid-west area covers Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary with a population of 384,998 according to the 2016 census, representing a 1.5% increase on 2011.  The mental health service in the mid-west operates as one service with single governance for the service.</p><p>The service has one head of service reporting to me as chief officer, one executive clinical director and one area director of nursing.  They are supported by an expanded management team in the disciplines of psychology, occupational therapy, social work and management, reflective of the multidisciplinary nature of modern-day mental health services.  While there are some county-based aspects for logistical reasons, all operational parts point to one mid-west system with some services shared.  The mental health service in the mid-west operates mainly across three specialist domains of general adult, psychiatry of later life, and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  It would perhaps assist the committee to summarise these services, and I have expanded the detailed metrics in the appendices provided.</p><p> There were 786 whole-time equivalents employed in mid-west mental health care at the end of November 2017.  The mental health service in the mid-west has a dedicated budget, and in 2018, this is set at &euro;66.988 million, having grown from &euro;58.923 million since January 2015.  The general profile divide is in the order of 80:20 pay and non-pay.  Thirteen community mental health teams form the core of service delivery for the majority of service users.  Working in a multidisciplinary approach, these teams receive referrals, mainly from primary care general practitioners, GPs.  The 13 teams are in 11 locations.  There are two teams in north Tipperary, four in Clare and seven in Limerick.  There are three psychiatry of later life teams, of which one is based in Clare, supporting also north Tipperary pending the further development of a fourth team specific to north Tipperary.  Two are based together in Limerick.  There are six CAMHS teams, of which one is based in north Tipperary, two in Clare and three in Limerick.  There are two rehabilitation teams, one of which is based in Limerick and one in Clare, increasingly providing a mid-west focus.  Small, discrete teams provide other supports, with one liaison team based at University Hospital Limerick, one forensic team and one mental health intellectual disability service.</p><p> The HSE mid-west hospital group has inpatient and residential supports for people according to their need and notes that the desired outcome is to have the least possible dependency on beds and the greatest possible support for people in their own communities.  The former large institutions of the old psychiatric hospital era are now out of use for residential services in the mid-west.  The mid-west has 81 acute beds with a plan for a further eight which are already built as high observation beds.  There are 49 beds for psychiatry of later life, providing some element of intermediate but predominantly long-stay care.  A further eight houses are staffed on a 24-hour basis.  These provide a high level of support to people with particular needs associated with enduring mental illness, while another 16 houses are not staffed on a 24-hour basis, consistent with the level of independence and self-sufficiency of the residents.</p><p> On specific initiatives, in 2017, the HSE mid-west mental health service led and produced a detailed action plan, Connecting For Life, which is inclusive of the three counties and involves 41 key stakeholder interests.  The service has developed the advancing recovery policy and secured a specific service reform fund to support and embed the approach across all teams.  Strong progress is being made in the area of service user engagement, particularly in the design of services, since the appointment of a full-time lead for engagement.</p><p> The HSE mid-west hospital group's mental health service, like other areas, has challenges, many of which arise from the transition of historical models of the institutional era to the modern-day best practice approaches.  The rapid expansion of multidisciplinary teams, coupled with economic factors, has presented a challenge in the areas of recruitment and retention, reflective of the wider international health service arena.  The demographic pressures in some instances add to the demand, either in volume or complexity, reflected in various ways, perhaps most recently commented on in respect of CAMHS.  These pressures lead in some cases to waiting times which would not be desirable.  The services are operating to a comprehensive operational plan each year which strives for incremental improvements in response to those challenges.</p><p> That concludes my statement and I have included information in the appendices.  I am grateful to the committee for its consideration of these matters.</p></speech>

I represent the constituency of Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan, so that is the area I will focus on.  I thank Mr. Hayes for his opening statement.  I have a number of questions to put to him.  Is he confident that that constituency area and indeed the whole CHO 1 region has been operating to the best of its capacity with regard to the levels of mental health care provision over the past four years?  The provision of CAMHS in the CHO 1 region is a major concern for me and has been highlighted on numerous occasions.  Would it be wrong to say that it has been operating in a state of crisis for the past while?  As of this month, 204 children await an initial meeting with a psychologist.  These children have eating disorders, are self-harming, have ADHD and many other issues.  Sixteen of these children have been waiting for more than a year to meet a psychologist and six have been waiting for longer than 15 months.  This is not acceptable.  Why are these shocking waiting times being allowed to happen and how can we stand over these delays?  Mr. Hayes, as chief officer for the CHO in this area, might explain what progress we are making and how we intend to overcome the statistics that I have in front of me.  Has he discussed staff recruitment?  I know that is an issue because some of his colleagues have been in before and spoke about funding and staff recruitment.  I welcome the recent appointment of a number of staff there in recent weeks.  The lack of funding affects the ability of CHO 1 to provide better mental health services to the public.  Mr. Hayes has rightly outlined that the area we represent is very vulnerable.  There are many issues in many rural areas.  Will Mr. Hayes comment on those questions?</p></speech>

The approved number of CAMHS consultants in the area was two and one person resigned at the end of 2016, then the second resigned in early 2017.  At that point, we initiated an action plan to address some of the immediate issues that arose for parents.  I have met some of the groups of parents and some of the young people.  We reviewed the options available with them.  Some immediate action was taken by employing a half-time consultant from Belfast, providing for access outside the area and commencing a process with general practitioners and other people in the area who provide support for mental health to young people.  The main focus of the work, however, was on recruitment.  We successfully recruited two consultants in June and, from that period to date, we have 2.5 consultant psychiatrists working in the CAMHS.</p> <p>  At the beginning of January 2017, there were 400 people on the CAMHS waiting list across CHO 1.  At the end of December, that number was down to 204.  In the Sligo area in particular, we have 36 young people on the CAMHS waiting list as of the end of December 2017, which is an 83% reduction from January 2017.  That was the lowest month.</p><p>At the moment, the Sligo east team has the shortest waiting list across CHO 1.  All 16 people on that waiting list have been on it for less than three months.  I suppose we want to acknowledge the difficulties.  We have worked with GPs as well.  If they are concerned about a young person, they can make direct contact with a CAMHS consultant four days a week to discuss the case.  If the CAMHS consultant cannot see that young person immediately, advice and support is directly provided to him or her.  We can show considerable progress in addressing the issue.  However, there is a fundamental issue with recruiting permanent CAMHS consultants.  I think that is reflected in CHO 1.  We are trying to address the issue.  We sent a team to a conference on child and adolescent mental health services in Geneva as part of our recruitment drive, particularly with a view to addressing the issues in Sligo and across CHO 1.  A number of consultants are interested and we will interview them in February 2018.</p></speech>

This is vital for the CHO 1 area.  How many people are we talking about?  Funding is a big issue.  This major issue has been debated at various meetings on numerous occasions.  I am concerned about the amount of funding required to have successful mental health services in the CHO 1 area.</p></speech>

CAMHS on the ground is operating at approximately 51% of the recommended level of clinical staff for the service.  A further 44 clinical staff would be required across the five counties to bring CHO 1 up to the targets for the CAMHS set out in A Vision for Change.  As the Sligo-Leitrim area is currently operating at a level between 51% and 53%, it is representative of what is happening across CHO 1.  Our immediate recruitment challenge does not necessarily involve funding <i>per se</i>.  It involves getting consultant psychiatrists, in particular.  We have less difficulty than the eastern area in recruiting psychiatric nurses.  Our main challenge is in recruiting consultant psychiatrists.  We are endeavouring to address that issue.  While we have had some success to date, until there are permanent people in full-time employment, there will always be a sense of vulnerability due to the possibility that they might leave and move on.</p></speech>

When Mr. Hayes spoke about the projects that are coming up, he said it is hoped that a new 26 bed unit will open next year.  How can that happen if there are such problems with recruitment?  When Mr. Hayes spoke about overall staffing levels, he said that the CHO 1 area has 941 whole-time equivalent staff.  Given that he can really only account for 156 staff for the general adult teams, 46 staff for the CAMHS teams and 35 staff for the psychiatry of later life teams, it seems that 702 staff are not accounted for.  When it is not possible to get staff, what happens to the money that is allocated for recruitment?  I have asked a few questions.  Mr. Hayes's answers might be of interest to Deputy McLoughlin.</p></speech>

That is the area I will focus on.  While I appreciate that the CHO 2 area covers all of counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, I will focus on my area when presenting my views on this issue.  Mr. Canavan has said there are 25 community teams.  How many additional community teams would be needed to have the full allocation?</p> <p>  Mr. Canavan also said that CAMHS beds have to service an area from Donegal all the way to Galway, Roscommon and Mayo.  Is that correct?  If so, does it include Sligo as well?  How many counties are the CAMHS beds in Galway for?  How many CAMHS beds do we have in Galway?  Are there plans to expand the number of CAMHS beds in Galway?  Are there plans to expand the number of CAMHS beds throughout all the other counties I have mentioned?</p> <p>  I do not see Youth Work Ireland Galway on the list of section 39 organisations that has been submitted to us.  Maybe Mr. Canavan can clarify for me whether it is on the list.  If not, will it be on it?</p> <p>  Will Mr. Canavan revisit the capital projects he named so that we can get a clear outline of what is planned and the time schedules involved?  I did not hear him mention Toghermore House.  What is the status of Toghermore House?</p> <p>  I have a specific question for Mr. Gogarty.  I have been looking through the accounts.  Will he explain the expenditure of &euro;7.9 million on dental?  What exactly does that cover?  The nursing bill came in at &euro;20.3 million.  I am trying to understand why &euro;7.9 million was spent on dental and &euro;20.3 million was spent on nursing.</p> <p>  I will come back in after Mr. Canavan and Mr. Gogarty have answered those questions.</p></speech>

We seem to have got on top of that demand over the past three years and manage it better.  That indicates there is a better balance between the need for inpatient beds and the number of beds available.  It is difficult to say definitively whether that is adequate.  At present, there is a good match between the demand for the beds and the number of beds available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#G03200"><p>When referring to CAMHS beds, we are effectively talking about a CAMHS bed for a child, for example, in Donegal.  To clarify, a CAMHS bed facilitates anybody under the age of 18.  Would it be better to provide CAMHS beds in the locality, in Sligo General Hospital or in places closer to home?  Would closer proximity not facilitate better recuperation?  Let us be mindful of the long distances that families must travel to get services.  For example, a family from Donegal must drive for three hours on poor roads to reach Galway to engage with staff in the CAMHS unit and, most importantly, their child.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Canavan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#G03300"><p>I will call on one of my clinical colleagues to answer after I reply.  First, it is not possible to provide beds in every single location.  Second, it is not the bed that is important but the quality of the staff and clinical team who provide care to the patient.  It is difficult to provide such a service in many locations.  The decision to centralise the service in a relatively small number of locations probably matches that view.</p> <p>  Like many of our services, there is a need for greater focus on the provision of care in the community, as pointed out by my colleagues, and in people's homes as opposed to providing inpatient care.  For example, it is possible that the vast majority of the CAMHS requirement for people in Donegal, if we deem the county to be one of the furthest away, are provided in Donegal.  It is better for the very small number of people who require inpatient care that it is provided in Galway.  I do not know if there is a more qualified answer to that.</p></speech>

I seem to straddle two or three different areas.  As my colleague, Deputy Tony McLoughlin, has adequately asked questions related to County Leitrim, I will raise issues related to County Roscommon.  I understand that the witnesses do a very difficult job.  It is an emotive and complex situation for the workers, the service provider and the service users.  Not everyone could equip themselves to work in the sector.</p> <p>  I am all for saving money.  Anybody who works in the public sector should be lauded for their work.  Sometimes when people in the public sector see a pot of money, they decide to spend it.  I like to see various Departments consider the funding that they have received and utilise it across the system.  The three-year rolling budget is more beneficial and definitely helps the witnesses to conduct their work in every department.  Unfortunately, the recent history of the mental health service in the county has led to a damning report being published last September.  The report showed that the HSE prioritised cost-cutting over meeting the needs of valuable service users.</p><p>The 44-page report was truly a damning indictment of how mental health services are run in the county and it was highly critical of the leadership at all levels within the HSE.  The report was carried out by three senior experts from the Northern Ireland health care sector.  Almost &euro;18 million in funding between 2012 to 2014 was returned by Roscommon-Galway HSE.  Was damage done?  I understand this is what makes headlines but are there any positive aspects?  Is there anything the witnesses feel the report did not cover?  Are there reasons for the return of this &euro;18 million in funding?  Was it returned to some other area where it was used to positive effect?   I seek an answer to that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Canavan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#H00200"><p>The report the Senator referred to was a review commissioned by the national director for mental health services.  It was commissioned in 2015 and published in September 2017.  The reason for the report was there were concerns about the quality and appropriateness of some of the services that were being provided in Roscommon at the time.  As the Senator correctly pointed out, a three-person team from outside the jurisdiction came in to look at it.  It is fair to say the team reported and called it as they saw it.  Unfortunately it did not make for very comfortable reading.  They were critical of many aspects of the services being provided in Roscommon at the time.  They were particularly critical of the way services were led.  It referred specifically to funding that was described as having been returned to central HSE.  Some confusion has arisen about the funding.  It is just over &euro;17 million for the three-year period from 2012 to 2014.  Most of that funding came out of County Galway.  Galway and Roscommon were at the time, and to some extent still are, a single administrative unit as far as the mental health services are concerned.  When that report referred to those moneys being returned, they were moneys from Galway and Roscommon.  It is reasonable to say that most of those moneys went out of the Galway budget.  It is also fair to say, because it is said in the report, there were opportunities lost.  When that funding was lost, there were opportunities lost to counties Roscommon and Galway to advance the process of implementing A Vision for Change and continuing to improve the services.  I agree with it; it is true.  It is also important to look at the funding position in the context of what was happening generally in the health services at the time when a lot of services were being curtailed and cut back for cost reasons and in the context of what has happened since.  In my opening statement I referred to the fact the funding base across CHO 2, which includes Roscommon, has increased year on year in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  We are hopeful it will continue to increase in 2018.  It is difficult to find something positive in that report.  It was a very critical report of the services overall.  I am optimistic about what can come out of it.  What can come out of it is we can change the way we deliver our services and the way we make decisions within the service on our priorities.  We have established an implementation group around that.  It has been working actively on it since September of this year since the document was published.  I am very optimistic we will make significant headway as a result of it.  This report will have been worth it if it shines a light on things that should not have happened or should not have been done in the way they were and if we take that on board and make the changes that are necessary going forward.</p></speech>

All of the other recommendations tend to be of an ongoing nature and we will be working on them throughout 2018 and probably throughout 2019 as well.

The VFC column shows the percentage of the team that is filled measured against what A Vision for Change indicated would be the optimal for the population at the time.</p><p>Members can see that they are quite variable.  That is consistent with CAMHS teams generally across the country because of recruitment challenges and so forth.  However, they are quite variable, running from 41% of the A Vision for Change recommendation up to above 81%.  That is a general overview of the teams.  The CAMHS across the mid-west have approximately 50 whole-time equivalent positions occupied out of a total workforce of 786 in the mental health service.  There has been quite an amount of focused attention on the service in the past couple of years.</p><p> With regard to managing age-related issues and pressures, I will let Dr. O'Mahoney comment on that momentarily.  However, a very significant concern for us at any point is when children are waiting, particularly for over 12 months.  On the balance side, I tend to emphasise to people that the mid-west area, since it had its first CAMHS, has moved to operating a 24-hour service through the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  There is a CAMHS consultant on call every night.  That mitigates the concern in what one might call the milder categories of referrals and shows that the focus is on the crisis and emergency.  Ideally, we would get to a much better position of early intervention that would avoid children having to go on a waiting list and waiting for 12 months to be seen.  That is probably the biggest concern we have, and we do not shy away from it being a factor for us.</p><p> The age-related factor is a particular issue.  People who are familiar with mental health legislation and policy will understand that there was a point in time when children were seen up to 16 years of age, after which they were seen in the adult service.  The trajectory now must be to ensure there is a CAMHS sub-speciality for people under 18 years of age.  Dr. O'Mahoney can comment on progress in achieving that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Mahoney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#J00200"><p>As my colleague said, we have a 24-hour emergency service.  The service is operated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in each area and after 5 p.m. it is located, as are most emergencies in the mid-west, in University Hospital Limerick, where a consultant, a NCHD and crisis nurses are available.</p> <p>  With regard to 16 to 18 year olds, only one of all our CAMHS teams is not in a position to manage all the 16 to 18 year olds.  It is in Nenagh.  All the rest of our teams manage the 16 to 18 year olds.  As Deputy Carey pointed out, we now have two CAMHS teams in Clare, which is within decimal points of the A Vision for Change requirement.  They account for 117,000 people.  We were lucky enough to be able to attract a consultant psychiatrist and, as a result, we have now attracted other allied health professionals.  The difficulty we have with recruitment is a difficulty that exists both nationally and internationally.  We are competing with other countries to recruit people.  I spent 19 years of my professional life working abroad and I have been back here for 12 years.  In fact, I ended up in my current position because I felt that I might be able to put whatever experience I had gained abroad to use in helping us to adapt to providing a service for a small nation with limited resources.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding Senator Feighan's comments about the public purse, there is no getting away from the fact that 6.6% of general health funding is less than half of the funding in all northern European countries and a third to a quarter of that of most of those countries.  As a result, we have difficulty filling our teams.  When I meet colleagues of mine who are working abroad and ask if they will come back they ask, "Will I have a full team?".  I tell them we are getting there, but they are the difficulties in recruitment and retention.  One of two colleagues I worked with in Limerick has been doing one of my former jobs in Canada for the past six years, probably better than I did it by all accounts.  These are the recruitment issues we face.  It is about morale and ensuring we have these teams.  While A Vision for Change is the benchmark, in some ways it may have been a little aspirational.  Nonetheless, if one compares the amount of funding and the number of staff we employ with their equivalents in the rest of northern Europe we are far behind.  That creates difficulties and there is no way around that.</p></speech>

The team of 40 stakeholder agencies that put "Connecting for Life" together has formed an implementation group for the strategy.  As there is a multi-agency or multi-stakeholder approach to "Connecting for Life" there is an oversight process whereby the agencies meet and each agency accounts for its stewardship of the actions it signed up to.  In the mid-west it is a three-year plan and in late 2018 there will be a full mid-plan review for the public to see.  I said at the time of the plan's publication that we would have to be held to account by it - we could not just produce a lovely report on the day and the process was over.  It was just the start.</p> <p>  On the question about the budget, the Deputy is quite right.  Certainly in my time as a health service manager there has been a reasonable increase in the budget over the last couple of years.  It has been very welcome.  In terms of what that has helped us to do, I can give the headlines.  I worked in the health service when there was one CAMHS consultant.  I now have six teams, albeit they are at various stages of development.  We have refurbished the acute unit for psychiatry in Limerick to a very high standard and we have been able to build eight high observation beds there.  I have approval and development funding for approximately 24 posts to open those but I am faced with an immense challenge both in the industrial relations arena in securing agreement and in the recruitment arena in securing the people.  I believe the mental health service is fundamentally different from what it was, although it has huge challenges.  One of the hallmarks of it for me was in 2016 when we closed the last bed in the last of our old psychiatric hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#J00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses, particularly Bernard Gloster and Dr. John O'Mahoney from CHO 3.  In fact, the mid-western hospital group, for want of a better term, and the CHO 3 coincide.  The mid-west is one of the few areas where the hospital group and the CHO coincide, which makes management perhaps a little easier.</p> <p>  Deputy Carey has spoken about the CAMHS.  There is a lack of key community care personnel in various areas.  It varies from a shortage of 30% to 11%.  In west Clare there is a shortage of psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.  There are many key areas where there is a gap in the service.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  In addition, will they comment on how that impinges on suicide prevention and services for drug and alcohol addiction, which is a huge problem?</p> <p>  I note that the total number of whole-time equivalents is 786.  Perhaps the witnesses will indicate how many whole-time equivalents are required.  There is a breakdown in the various areas in the submission.  With regard to acute beds, the acute psychiatric unit in Clare also covers north Tipperary.  That puts a huge amount of pressure on the acute beds for Clare and the mid-west.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on how that is working and on the shortage.  I believe they mentioned there is a shortage of eight.</p> <p>  With regard to cognitive behaviour therapy, which ties in with key personnel being absent, how is that being delivered?  Also, how does that tie in with over-medication?  As a practitioner I find there is a great deal of over-medication in psychiatry.</p><p>Perhaps that is a reflection of not having enough talk therapy and counsellors in the system.  Will Mr. Gloster comment on his connection with the voluntary bodies in the mid-west?  What connection is there between the statutory and the voluntary bodies?  With regard to dementia services, I know there is a challenge in respect of inpatient beds for dementia and separating dementia patients from patients who have very challenging behaviour.  Mixing the two together can impinge on patient care.  Does Mr. Gloster have unspent funds which must be returned because he is unable to employ personnel?  It seems to be a recurring theme that the Minister announces an extra &euro;35 million for mental health services every year, but &euro;15 million is returned because it has not been spent.  Is that a reflection on not being able to recruit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#K00200"><p>I thank Deputy Harty and certainly will attempt to capture all the questions he has asked.  On key personnel, I may take that as one question with the issue of vacancies in the current 786 whole-time equivalent positions.  I will start from there because that is the real profile on the ground.  Of the 786 whole-time equivalent positions that we had at the end of November, we had just under seven vacancies in the medical profile, 27 in nursing, 12 in what we call allied health professionals, which would include psychology and the therapies, and 16 in what we call general supports.  Dr. O'Mahoney might comment on the clinical impact of that at the end.  The impact is partly mitigated in various ways.  For example, out of a nursing profile of 366 there are 27 nursing vacancies.  We cover an average of 16 of those vacancies with agency staff, so we spend the money arising from those vacancies on agency replacement to mitigate the risk.  We also spend it on health care assistants when we cannot get nurses.  That is the profile of the 786 staff and the current vacancies.</p> <p>  Psychology is a particular pressure for us.  At the present time we have three basic grade psychology vacancies from our normal routine posts and two and a half senior psychologist vacancies.  So in total we have five and half vacancies in our regular posts in mental health.  We also have a number of vacancies in development posts which we have yet to fill.  In terms of what we have on the ground, we have five and a half vacancies.  The difficulty for us which I see on the profile is that a number of those in psychology posts will be taking maternity leave this year, which will result in very significant vacancies.  The reality is that the replacement rate for clinical psychologists just does not line up with the attrition or absence rate.  We have spent a considerable amount of money developing new training places on the doctoral programme in the University of Limerick and in the National University of Ireland, Galway.  I manage the funding of both of those programmes for the HSE.  We do everything to capture those recruits coming out, but invariably people make lifestyle choices - they travel and so on.  Psychology is a pressure, there is no disputing that.  Dr. O'Mahoney can talk about that in the context of other disciplines involved in the therapy.</p> <p>  On the acute beds, as I said there is a total of 89 beds.  I have eight beds built for high observation at present which we are hoping to open.  We now have the indicated and approved resource that we need to do that, which is 24 whole-time equivalents.  We are having some difficulty nationally as well as locally in coming to an agreement with the relevant representative organisations as to what they would consider acceptable.  That is presenting us with a challenge.  The second challenge will be recruiting the numbers.</p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right about the bed situation in north Tipperary.  Acute patients in north Tipperary now come predominantly to the acute unit in Ennis in Clare, and occasionally to Limerick.  They were previously served from south Tipperary, which is a different community health care organisation, CHO, area.  That is because of the old county-based mental health system when the big hospitals were in operation, a system which pre-dated even the health boards.  The unit in Clonmel closed and, in accordance with A Vision for Change, it moved its direction to Kilkenny while ours moved back to the mid-west.  Based on A Vision for Change, if everything was right and proper, 89 acute beds would be adequate for the population based on the measure.  However, with the demographic changes we are now experiencing, A Vision for Change would have to be revised and we would need more than 89.  We need more than 89.  In the general sense there is a pressure on them because not every other part of A Vision for Change has been implemented.  The other dependencies of A Vision for Change cause pressure.  The 89 beds in the mid-west are very busy.  The acute unit will be in Ennis.  There is no getting away from that.</p> <p>  On the voluntary sector, we have a number of partner organisations under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  We do not have a heavy dependence on them as service providers, but we have a huge reliance on them as support for what we do and as support for people who have been using our services for quite some time. There are some exceptions which would be considered to be direct service providers in supporting either suicide prevention or response to suicide.  The agencies we give the greatest amount of funding under section 39 of the Act are Limerick Youth Service, at just over &euro;100,000 a year for youth mental health, and the organisation GROW.  We spend just under &euro;1 million on section 39 funding across the profile.</p> <p>  On dementia, the Deputy is quite right that we are very challenged in respect of the demographic profile in that regard and the separation of the different categories within that.  He will be familiar with a particular unit in St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Ennis which has traditionally been managed by the elderly service as a dementia facility.  We are now just in the final stages of recalibrating that to be led by a consultant psychiatrist specialising in later life.  The Deputy will be familiar with him, Dr. Reynolds.  He will take over the management of those beds.  That will delineate their use differently and we will then be challenged in other parts of the older person sector to respond to the other types of dementia presentations.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the return of funds.  I do not return funds.  I tend to use them.  For the last three years particularly we have had a very important rule set in the HSE, which is that divisional money comes as divisional funding and is measured in that way.  My money for older persons, therefore, is measured on my spend for older persons.  My money for mental health is measured on my spend for mental health.  It is not the case that it can be moved around Billy to Jack.  I cannot decide tomorrow to spend mental health money on something like a new primary health care centre.  I do not have returned funds.  I was close to a break-even position last year in respect of mental health, but all of the money I have in the mental health budget is exclusive to mental health and is all spent in that profile.  That has increasingly been the position for all of us.</p></speech>

I will try to be brief and not go over what was already mentioned.  I thank the witnesses for the information they have brought in.  First of all, I have a couple of quick observations in respect of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, particularly in the Limerick area.  In A Vision for Change, the figure for staffing in Limerick west is 41.2% whereas for Limerick east it is 74.5%.  Will the witnesses give me a brief breakdown of the geography?  Where are the lines within the county?  Is Limerick east the city?  Is there a break between the city and the county?  Will they outline why there is such a challenge in west Limerick as opposed to east Limerick?  Positions were filled on the east Limerick side in September, if I am not mistaken.</p> <p>  Obviously the development posts are new positions for a new service.  From my calculations - and I hope the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong - 70% of those posts have been outstanding from 2014 onwards.  If they are not able to provide it today, can the witnesses send me a breakdown of vacant backfilled positions at a later date?</p><p>I want to try to get an overall view of posts outstanding, be it development posts and backfills of current vacancies.  </p><p> I would like the officials to elaborate on funding.  It was stated that this service is allocated 6.6% of general health funding.  Is the kernel of the argument that they are finding recruitment is constrained by national wage agreements and salaries?  I am hearing about the challenges around recruitment but I am not hearing any specific factors.  Do the difficulties arise from the location of the jobs, the position being offered or are other jurisdictions targeting consultant psychologists, nurses and so on?  I would like to get a breakdown of the recruitment challenges to see where we can try to close the gaps.  I agree that we face challenges in recruitment but I would appreciate if the witnesses could articulate specific issues that we could pinpoint.</p><p> On budgets, the witness said quite rightly that the budget does not go back to the fund but that it is spent on mental health.  When the senior management appeared before the joint committee on a previous occasion, I could not get an answer from them on what happened when money allocated for a new post was not spent because of the failure to fill it.  I was told that the money would go to spending on service improvement.  I was trying to push for information on whether this money was going into the IT system or where the service improvements were.  Would the witnesses give me a general overview of that service improvement, when it is outside recruitment, and also how one arrives at setting the priorities for the area where the service improvement should be made.  In 2016, when the money was allocated, it would not have been known how much would not be spent.  How does one arrive at the decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#L00200"><p>I thank Deputy Neville for his questions.  In respect of backfill recruitment, and I will provide the Deputy with a specific list of the actual posts subsequent to the meeting, in terms of the global figure of 786, we are running a recurring deficit in terms of filling jobs of 50 to 60 posts.  The breakdown is right across the spectrum, with probably the largest number of unfilled posts being in nursing.</p> <p>  On the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, teams, CAMHS east, CAMHS west, CAMHS central, the reason that one sees in the appendices a population of 47,000 between those three teams and a combined actual staffing of just under 25 personnel is the origin of the service.  The service started with one consultant in 90 O'Connell Street in the city centre and then it grew to two and so on.  While there has been expansion, they consolidate and share their focus.  They started out originally as the city team and many of the expanded teams have moved to a new base at Punches Cross in Limerick.  There is a lot of cross-sharing of the resource.  CAMHS west tends to refer to Newcastle West and that direction and CAMHS east is towards Kilmallock and Doon.</p> <p>  On utilising the money in our budget, traditionally money for development posts is given when the post has been filled.  In other words, the post would be filled and then the money would be drawn down.  In more recent times, however, the money has been front-loaded and has been given upfront, as our national colleagues told the committee.  Some of the money would be used on mitigating risk for vacancies.  For example, in 2017, we spent approximately &euro;4 million on agencies for mental health in the mid west.  The most significant element of expenditure was on doctors, followed by nursing.  We would use money to mitigate risk.  We would use money by agreement with the national division.  We might decide to target a particular initiative, but as a once-off cost, so that when we come to fill the post, we would still have the money to fill it and we would not end up with a recurring cost.  The once-off cost could be on anything from supporting additional training and development to doing a targeted waiting list initiative.  If an additional psychologist or consultant was identified as being available through an agency and we had some spare capacity in the run rate of our funding, I might say to Dr. O'Mahoney that if we could attract that person for three months through the agency, perhaps we could take them in to shave off what we are worried about on the waiting list.  That is an example of a service improvement.  Equally, we can do something on IT.  Our IT system is a very old system.  It has served us very well but we will have to make modifications to it.  I think IT has a patient administration system.</p> <p>  My colleague Dr. O'Mahoney may wish to add to what I have said on the CAHMS teams.</p></speech>

We have a new team set up in Clare and it will suit some of our people who have commuted from Clare to work in west Limerick to relocate.  We are constantly facing a retention battle within our services.  We are competing with other areas to attract people, but we also have to deal with urban drift.  It is more noticeable in Clare.  Deputy Harty will be familiar with this, whereby north Clare is essentially being partially depopulated and our services are located in Ennis.  The same will occur in Newcastle West, which is on the border with Kerry, and I am well aware that the Kerry CHO is having the same difficulty attracting people.  We will have transfers from our area to theirs because it suits people's personal lives and they know they can do it because they are a scarce resource.  Retention of staff within our areas is a problem, never mind retaining the overall numbers.</p> <p>  I cannot get away from the fact that we are competing with the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia for staff across the board, not just doctors but also nurses and psychologists.  Very often it is pointed out to me that it is about salaries, but it is not all about salaries but also about working conditions and working as part of a team.  I meet colleagues of mine who are working abroad.  I am almost schmoozing them trying to get them to come back to Ireland.</p></speech>

We heard from the CHO area 1 that the problem is in recruiting consultant psychiatrists and in CHO area 3 the problem is trying to recruit nurses.  There differences between the CHOs show that it is not just an international factor but also local.  Are there any studies on this?  It may not be Dr. O'Mahoney's remit and may be a step higher.

Most people who go into these professions are interested in caring for people and in doing a proper job.  They may be working in a team where they know what has to be done but they do not have the resources.  While I am on this point, I will respond to a question the Chairman raised.  We have a range of staff who offer talk therapy, such as nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists and doctors trained in CBT and other talk therapies.  The problem is that if there are only four people in a team, one has got to cut one's cloth to suit the measure and see the people who are most unwell or most deserving of care.</p><p>It becomes frustrating for people to not be able to do their job.  The best example is that a consultant psychiatrist in Britain will typically have half the catchment area size in terms of population compared with a consultant here.  That consultant would have a fully populated team.  I am not trying to beat the drum to death but these are the facts.  The members can speak to my colleagues about it.  At this stage we are almost net exporters of health care professionals.  When I worked abroad, I always had colleagues-----</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I thank them for their attendance today.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that each chief officer will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by questions and answers.  Before beginning I draw the witnesses' attention to privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I invite each of the chief officers to make their opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the chief officer of Cork-Kerry community healthcare, which is referenced in the documentation provided by the national division as CHO 4.  I am the principal responsible officer, responsible for all HSE-run or HSE-funded community-based services in the counties of Cork and Kerry.  I am joined Ms Sinead Glennon, who is the head of mental health services in Cork-Kerry community healthcare.  My colleague chief officers, Ms Colley and Ms Queally, will introduce those accompanying them.  As with our colleagues who addressed the committee earlier, we have tried to ensure a mix of different roles in the teams attending today across the CHOs.  All responsibility for mental health services in Cork and Kerry is under Ms Glennon as head of mental health services.  There are separate management teams in Cork and Kerry for historical reasons each of which includes an executive clinical director and area director of nursing along with an area director of nursing for child and adolescent mental health services in Cork.</p> <p>  Specialist mental health services are developed in collaboration with the national mental health team and delivered in line with national policies, frameworks and priorities.  As I am conscious of the committee's time, I do not propose to go through much detail on the make-up of services and the various teams.  Suffice it to say that Cork-Kerry, as with other CHOs, has a mix of adult and CAMHS teams, psychiatry of later life teams and a mix of acute units and other residential units.  They are set out in our statement and in the appendix.  Mental health services in Cork and Kerry have a strong focus on recovery and co-production whereby initiatives are developed jointly by service users and staff.  We have consistently sought to emphasise community-based services, including home treatment services, thereby reducing reliance on acute type services.</p> <p>  Referrals to specialist mental health services are usually through GPs.  Specialist mental health services work closely with many other health and social care services.  The introduction of community health care networks, as referenced in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, will support stronger integration between specialist mental health services and other health and social care services in each local area.</p> <p>  Cork-Kerry community healthcare mental health services employs 1,468 staff across a range of disciplines set out in table 4a in the appendix which we forwarded to the committee.  This represents an increase of 23% in overall staff numbers since 2012.  The increase in staffing shows the impact of the programme for Government investment in mental health from 2012 onwards, which has impacted on the staffing in adult mental health teams and in CAMHS teams; additional staffing to open new acute units at Cork University Hospital, CUH, and Deer Lodge residential unit in Killarney; and also the development of specialist services for psychiatry of later life, mental health services, people with intellectual disability, suicide and self-harm prevention, as well as services for homelessness, rehabilitation and forensics.</p> <p>  Like many of our colleagues in other parts of the country, we experience recruitment challenges, particularly in child and adolescent psychiatry, non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing and psychology.  We recently established a task force in our CHO comprising HR and medical personnel to focus on recruitment into child and adolescent mental health services.  We can expand on that later.  Notwithstanding these challenges, we recruited 170 new staff who started in Cork-Kerry mental health services in 2017.  At the end of December, there were 28 vacancies, excluding a number of development posts which we have yet to fill.  The budget for specialist mental health services in the area is &euro;118.3 million, representing an increase of just under 15% since 2015.</p> <p>  One of the committee's headings is primary care.  Obviously, the majority of mental illness is treated in primary care, in particular by GPs.  We support that through the counselling in primary care service, which provides counselling for people with medical cards referred by GPs.  We can give further details on the location and volume of that.  We have also been developing a psychology service in primary care through recruiting seven additional psychologists and 16 additional assistant psychologists.  Five of the seven psychologist posts have been filled, as have 13 of the assistant psychologist posts.</p> <p>  The next section outlines a number of achievements, and given time constraints I will not dwell on them.  They refer to a number of acute units, the Jigsaw service in Kerry, which also commenced in Cork in 2017, a number of initiatives in suicide prevention and also mental health engagement.</p> <p>  In 2018 we will develop a liaison psychiatry team in University Hospital Kerry, a CAMHS liaison service in CUH in 2018; an additional CAMHS consultant in Kerry with a special interest in liaison and the mental health needs of children with intellectual disability, complete the refurbishment of the acute adult mental health unit in University Hospital Kerry, establish a specialist forensic team working with Cork prison, establish a child and adolescent mental health services eating disorders team, establish a specialist perinatal service in Cork University Maternity Hospital, and introduce advanced nurse practitioners.</p> <p>  As with other areas, we face a number of challenges in addition to the recruitment challenge.  We experience waiting times for child and adolescent mental health services due primarily to recruitment issues and the absence of certain staffing levels.  We are working through a detailed comprehensive enhancement project led by a clinician in our area, with a number of short-term and long-term measures to improve that.  We are also prioritising that area for development funding which has been allocated to us at the end of 2017.  Access to the CAMHS inpatient unit can be a challenge depending on demand.  The unit has fluctuated between 14 and 18 beds depending on medical staffing.  We are also conscious that suicide rates in Cork and Kerry are high, although they have reduced in recent years.  They are a particular focus through our connecting-for-life plans.  As with other CHOs we are experiencing high-cost external placements where we need to refer individuals to external agencies for services.</p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement and I would be happy to answer any questions members have later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Colley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#N00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend the committee today and the opportunity to provide them with information on the mental health services in the south east.  I am the chief officer for CHO 5, and like my colleagues, I am responsible for the overall management of HSE services excluding the acute hospital services in the south east.  I am accompanied by Dr. Stephen Browne, who is the executive clinical director for mental health services, and Mr. Michael Morrow, who is the head of finance for CHO 5.</p> <p>  CHO 5 covers Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford, an area with a total population of 510,333, which has had a net increase of 2.6% since 2011.</p><p>The greatest increases were in the older age groups, particularly those aged 65 to 74 years, with the greatest decreases in the younger age groups, particularly those aged 25 to 34 years.  There is a further breakdown in the appendices.</p><p> In health service analysis and planning, we are cognisant of many factors, including the age groups, gender, social determinants of health, deprivation indices, housing and so on.  All these indicators have an impact on the demand for services in our area and a potential impact on expected outcomes for our population.</p><p> Nine CHOs are the delivery arm of the HSE national operation plan and the mental health plan, implementing care in alignment with key performance indicators, national policies, clinical standards and operating procedures.</p><p> Community health care organisation, CHO, 5 like the other CHOs are standardised as such in that we have a governance structure that devolves under four care groups, primary care, mental health, social care, and health and well-being.  There is an alignment in both the governance, that is, to and from the national office to the CHO and then in the local clinical service delivery across the four care pillars.  This is achieved by agreed key performance measures, across care group representation at senior management through to population alignment, where the clinical teams work in areas, averaging populations of 50,000 people.</p><p> The term mental health describes a health status that can range from positive mental health through to severe illness.  Hence the requirement to provide services from a stepped care model from population health such as information through to specialist mental health services.  The specialist mental health services are provided to a particular group in the population.  Like my colleagues in the south east, we have seven child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, providing secondary care, specialist services for young people up to 18 years who have severe and complex mental health disorders.  </p><p> We have 17 general adult mental health teams and five psychiatry of later life teams, servicing people in different settings, including outpatients, acute day services and in the individual's home.</p><p> The south east has six approved centres, including two acute adult units and four psychiatry of later life units.  Community mental health services are delivered by a range of multidisciplinary teams and that is within a sectorised population based approach.</p><p> As the statutory service provider, we work with our voluntary partners to ensure the meaningful engagement and involvement of the service users in its design and delivery.  Integration is achieved through collaborative working between and across primary care, acute services and mental health.  The integration is further enhanced through co-location as appropriate.</p><p> The mental health teams with a total staff of 1,187 staff are organised to provide inpatient, residential and community services in centres as set out in the table in my presentation and also in appendix 3.</p><p> In line with the stepped care model we have roles and teams that provide prevention, early intervention and other supports, such as suicide prevention.  The regional suicide resource office co-ordinates activities in suicide prevention, intervention and postvention in CHO 5.  One of the key responsibilities of the office is the development and implementation of Connecting for Life - Ireland National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020.  The latest launch was in Carlow on 7 December 2017.  </p><p> Under the national counselling services, the south east has three services: counselling in primary care, self-harm intervention programme and national counselling services south east.  There is a further breakdown in the appendices.</p><p> The development of a recovery focused model in CHO 5 has been an ongoing priority.  The recovery college in the south east was officially launched in 2017 and offers focused education which is designed to complement existing community mental health services by utilising an education approach which has a positive effect and impact on the mental health and well-being of people who utilise the services.  The introduction of an area lead and five peer support workers to represent the views of service users, family members and carers was a significant step also in 2017.</p><p> The budget and actual spend on mental health services in CHO 5 is summarised and one can see there has been a 14.6% increase between 2012 and 2017.  CHO 5 remains committed to the delivery of a high quality patient-focused service.  However, as my other colleagues acknowledge, there are challenges to achieving this objective.  There is an increasing demand for services for children and young people across the spectrum of promotion, prevention and early intervention right through to tertiary level inpatient care.  We will be continuing a strong focus on this area throughout 2018 and beyond.  Similar to all areas, recruitment and retention of staff, especially for medical and nursing staff remain a challenge.  We continually assess, analyse and monitor our operational plan, key performance indicators and the feedback we receive to target change and address our challenges through resource management and best practice.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  There is further information in the appendices.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.</p></speech>

I am the chief officer of HSE community health care east which is referenced in your documents as community health care organisation, CHO, 6.  Community health care east describes the same geographical area as that covered by CHO 6, incorporating the former local health offices of Dublin south east, Dublin south and Wicklow.  I am joined by Ms Antoinette Barry, the head of service for mental health in CHO 6.</p> <p>  I have submitted appendices to accompany this opening statement which provide detailed information in respect of the governance of mental health services, finance, human resource and service delivery.</p> <p>  As chief officer, I have overall responsibility for the management of HSE community services.  As well as mental health, this includes primary care, social care and health and well-being.  In line with the  community health care organisations report 2014, the area is divided into the eight community health networks, CHNs, shown in the appendices.  The community mental health services are delivered primarily by 11 community health mental health teams and work is under way to realign these 11 teams to our eight community health care networks.  This will include some realignment with our colleagues in CHO 7, who will address the committee in the near future.  This is a really important step in fully integrating our services in line with Sl&aacute;intecare 2017 and as outlined in the community health care organisation report.  This is an important step as to what Ms Colley described earlier in terms of stepped care.</p> <p>  The population of community health care east is 383,000.  However, the population covered by mental health services is more than 400,000 due to the aforementioned boundary issues.  In addition, we work with colleagues in CHO 5 to provide acute adult inpatient mental health beds at Newcastle Hospital to facilitate easier access for patients in the Gorey area.</p> <p>  In community health care east, mental health services are provided by a combination of direct provision by the HSE and under contract through a service arrangement with St. John of God in its clinics at Cluain Mhuire and Lucena.  The HSE provides adult mental health services in Dublin south east and Wicklow and St. John of God, Cluain Mhuire provides adult mental health services in the Dublin south area.  St. John of God, Lucena provides child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS across community health care east and to part of CHO 7.</p> <p>  There is a clear governance arrangement for mental health services in the area.  Ms Antoinette Barry is head of service for mental health and reports directly to me as chief officer.  The executive clinical director and the area director of nursing in turn report to Ms Barry.  There is one mental health executive management team for the overall area which includes senior clinicians and administrative managers and also includes senior manager from St. John of God.  All governance and management systems are in line with HSE policies, including quality and patient safety and national financial regulations and so on.  I have included a map and a detailed organisational structure in the appendices.  There are 560 whole-time equivalent staff employed in our mental health services at the end of November 2017.  </p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, a total of 50 additional posts have been approved since 2012.  Of these 17 are filled and the balance are in the process of recruitment.  A further breakdown of the information is provided by discipline and by team in the appendices.</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention of nursing staff has been a significant service challenge for our area.  The main reasons cited by staff in exit interviews are accommodation cost and commute times.  We have tried to address this challenge in a number of ways.  The introduction of the higher diploma in mental health nursing initiated by community health care east with UCD has been very successful with 38 nurses completing the programme in January 2018, 12 of whom are contracted to work in this area.  A further 38 nurses will commence in February 2018, 14 of whom will be contracted to this area.  We are continuing to work with UCD as our academic partner to increase the pool of candidates available to us through increasing the number undertaking undergraduate and postgraduate training.</p><p>There is a detailed finance breakdown in the appendices but the overall budget for 2017 was &euro;56.86 million<b>.</b>As outlined earlier, mental health services are provided through a number of specialist areas by multidisciplinary teams.  We have 11 general adult community mental health teams, two old-age psychiatry teams, nine CAMHS teams, one mental health intellectual disability team and one eating disorder team.  We also provide liaison psychiatry to St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital.  These are the three main acute hospitals and the maternity hospital in our area.<br/><br/>In 2018 we will extend the current seven out of seven out-of-hours response for general adult community mental health services, which exists in part of our area, and it will cover the Wicklow primary health care area.  We have received approval for four additional posts to cover that and it is a significant improvement.  We continue to prioritise co-location of our community mental health services with primary care centres.  Centres are planned for D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Stillorgan, Bray, Greystones and Arklow.  Mental health services are already co-located at Wicklow since 2015.  In 2018, a Dublin south-east team will co-locate with primary care services at Churchtown.<br/><br/>Community health care east has a total of 89 adult acute care beds, a breakdown of which is provided in the appendices.  In line with national policy, we are developing a plan that will address the number and location of acute beds to ensure all our beds are provided at the most appropriate location.  The plan will be costed and will require capital investment.  Child and adolescent patients access acute inpatient beds in the Linn Dara unit in Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot, and the St. Joseph's unit in Fairview.  In addition to acute care provision, a range of continuing care, rehabilitation, transitional care beds and community residential places are provided across community health care east.  A breakdown is given in the appendices.<br/><br/>We have a number of service improvement initiatives.  A mental health recovery committee established in 2017 and was awarded &euro;1.3 million by the service reform fund and &euro;30,000 by Advancing Recovery Ireland, based on a successful proposals to re-orientate services towards recovery.  In line with the national clinical programmes, we have established a programme at St. Vincent's University Hospital for the assessment and management of people presenting to the accident and emergency department following self-harm.  We are also progressing the implementation of the national clinical programmes for the specialist areas of eating disorders and perinatal mental health.  Two suicide resource officers have been appointed to support implementation of the local Connecting for Life action plan, launched in March 2017.  A local Connecting for Life oversight group has been established.  I am glad to say it has good stakeholder engagement at a cross-sectoral level, which is really important for successful implementation.<br/><br/>A mental health engagement lead was also appointed in February 2017 and he established the community health care east area forum for mental health engagement.  In line with the Healthy Ireland policy and the evidence of the need to promote general health and well-being of mental health service users, a significant target for us, we have a number of initiatives that support patient recovery.  I will not go into the detail of these but they include Woodlands for Health, which promotes physical activity in outdoor spaces; Kickstart to Recovery, which is a group engagement involving physical activity through football; The Mindful Melodics Choir; and Choices for Health, a lifestyle programme.  These are important intersectoral initiatives and require a solid partnership working at a cross-sectoral level.  They are focused on health and well-being, particularly in a holistic approach to health and mental health recovery of service users.  As a leadership team our emphasis is on continuing to place our service users at the centre of the development of our service, with particular emphasis on recovery and reorientation towards community services.</p></speech>

I will get straight to the questions as time is limited.  I want to get the maximum from the time allocated.  A Vision for Change indicates the recommended team size for adults is 23, for a child it is 13 and for the elderly it is 12.  The witnesses mentioned their teams so do they reflect those figures?  Assuming that is the case, the deficiency in the adult section is 25%, in the child section it is 46% and in the elderly section it is 40%.  The staff numbers are smaller than they should be in all three areas.  If we got the staffing numbers to the level prescribed by A Vision for Change, would we address, by and large, deficiencies that currently exist in our mental health services in CHO area 4?</p> <p>  The document refers to community and mental health staffing levels.  I note that in some areas it is greater than what is needed but in other areas it is less than what is required.  Killarney, for example, has 1.3 times the staff needed.  Why are these not rearranged so there is no surplus in any area and deficits could be reduced?  I would like an explanation as to why that is the case and what can be done to address it.  There is also the matter of recruitment.  Is the national recruitment service of the HSE responsible for all recruitment?  Is that how it operates?  I am speaking personally but I do not see how the recruitment process is visible.  Are we advertising at recruitment fairs, for example, or what way are we going about this?  Do we go to London and other international destinations to try to get people back here?  There were several attempts by the National Health Service in the UK to target people, offering our graduates extra training to get them over there.  We need to do something similar.  If we are doing it, I am not aware of it.  We would like to see more of it.</p> <p>  There is the matter of integration of primary care, specialist mental health services and the various organisations that work in this area.  Are the witnesses satisfied that such integration exists and if they are not, what do we need to do to improve it?  There are a number of organisations dealing with suicide prevention and mental health services in general.  I am not convinced the work they do is linked with specialist mental health services, nor am I convinced that specialist mental health services are linked with primary care.  As a committee, we must focus on this to help medical professionals achieve better results.</p> <p>  Somebody might present to me at the weekend if I get a phone call on a Saturday or Sunday night.  We are elected representatives and often people see us as the first point of call.  Is there an emergency number I can use to say I have a specific acute case that requires immediate assistance?  This is so I do not have to tell somebody to come back to me on Monday morning.  That could often be a crucial 24 or 48 hours.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was an incident in my home town last year, around September, which ended very tragically.  I would have liked to have had services whereby I could have asked the person to contact a certain person who might have been able to help him or her.  I did not, and that may be as much my fault as anyone else's.</p><p> Are the suicide crisis assessment nurses, or SCANs, as they are known, operational everywhere?  If so, what is the link between the SCAN and the primary care services, and how do we get the message out there that this person exists in the community and his or her services are available?  I am sure those services are much needed.</p><p> I refer to the issue of dual diagnosis, whereby people present not only with mental health difficulties, but also with addiction difficulties.  I have come across situations whereby people are told that if they have an addiction, until they are clean they will not be seen.  It does not work that way.  A person with addiction difficulties and who has mental health issues needs immediate care.  Trying to get him or her clean might be the very basic action needed and might set him or her on the road to recovery.  I would be interested in Mr. Reaney's comments on that matter.</p><p> I note the suicide rate in Kerry is now 17 per year.  Is this below or above the national average?  What is being done in Cork and Kerry to try to get that down to the national average?  I would prefer if there were no suicides at all, but they are a reality.</p><p> The last question I have concerns issues surrounding counsellors.  There are many counsellors, or people purporting to be counsellors, but what level of qualification do the community health care organisations look for?  Are jobs available for people with honours degrees in counselling services, a level 9 or level 8 qualification, particularly in hospital or community?  If so, how do I direct someone looking for employment and looking to offer their services to the system?</p></speech>

I probably should have said at the beginning that we are trying to contain contributions to seven minutes each.  I ask Mr. Reaney to answer the questions as quickly as he can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Reaney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#Q00500"><p>That is a very comprehensive range of questions.  I will do my best to be brief.<br/><br/>Regarding the targets in A Vision for Change and how our teams compare, I agree with the Deputy's analysis of CAMHS teams.  I think we are closer to the indicative figures for CAMHS in A Vision for Change than for adult services overall.  We are at just under 90%.  Approximately a third of our adult teams have the staffing they should have in terms of A Vision for Change.  I should say, though, that A Vision for Change specifies an indicative staffing for a population of 50,000.  Many of our teams have populations different from the 50,000 level.  What we have, therefore, is analysis that is mathematical and does not necessarily take into account the mix of roles within the teams or local factors, whether geography, deprivation or whatever else.  As for where some areas are over and some areas are under target, Killarney, which is the south Kerry team, is an area where the population is significantly dispersed and where significant travel is required to reach Cahirciveen and Waterville, whereas Tralee's is a more concentrated population.  The variation between the teams is probably justifiable.<br/><br/>To respond to the question about whether it would be sufficient if the numbers in A Vision for Change were in place, it would be significant progress.  It would be the realisation of a target that was set ten years ago at this stage.  That target was designed to build up community services and minimise the requirement for individuals to attend acute units.  Whether or not it would be sufficient would have to take into account factors to which my colleagues and I have referred regarding increasing evidence in modern society of pressures.  This would probably require a greater buildup of services in primary care, to which the Deputy also alluded, and I might come back to that.  Our initial target is to focus on achieving the targets in A Vision for Change, but I know that a review of A Vision for Change is under way and I suspect further development on those targets is required.  Our current priority is the child and adolescent mental health service, which is furthest away from those targets, and some of the specialist services, which we are building up in terms of old age, mental health, psychiatry and rehabilitation teams.<br/><br/>We do recruit to the NRS, and we recruit otherwise as well.  Our recruitment challenges are in particular areas of psychiatry, most non-consultant hospital doctors and psychologists and specialists nurses.  We have 12 nursing vacancies out of a total pool of close to 400 staff.  That is not a huge number at a given point in time but, regarding child and adolescent psychiatry, as my colleagues would have outlined to the committee in the morning session, we are working within both a national and an international shortage.  We advertise those posts in <i>The BMJ</i>.  More importantly, we follow up through individual contacts because the child and adolescent medical community is relatively small and, rather than do recruitment fairs, we feel this is probably at this stage a more effective process, and we are being successful.  Our difficulty in Cork and Kerry is that we had a number of retirements coming quite close together and we have also had a number of people who are not Irish nationals and who moved to other countries.  We have been quite successful.  We currently have 1.5 positions to fill.  We are confident of filling one of those positions and the other position will be advertised shortly.<br/><br/>Mental health services are one of the biggest users of psychology.  In Cork and Kerry we employ nearly 100 psychologists, including some assistant psychologists, and we have recognised and led the way, working with UCC, in addressing what is a shortfall in training.  Working with UCC and the HSE nationally, we have put in place a doctorate programme in psychology which will produce the first graduates in 2019, I think.  That is our future plan for that area.  In addition, our psychology department would be seen as being quite proactive and quite attractive to work in, but we are working within a pool which is not quite large enough.<br/><br/>I outlined the position regarding primary care earlier.  We will go through in a little more detail some of the services that are available at primary care level.  Key among these is the counselling primary care service, which is a national service.  We provide that across 30 locations in Cork and Kerry, so it is locally accessible and GP-referred.  It is fixed-term, usually six to eight sessions, and can be extended if necessary.  We have two SCANs who cover three of our mental health teams in Cork and we are employing one nurse in Kerry from 2018.  That service requires further development.  The service is well integrated with GPs.  Referral is made by GPs, and the nurse carries out an assessment, determines what form of service is required and provides feedback and information to the GP afterwards.<br/><br/>I have referred to our psychology service.  Our primary care psychology service in Cork and Kerry has been under-resourced for some time and we have been proactive in negotiating with the national primary care division funding to improve this.  I outlined the numbers earlier - seven psychology positions and 16 assistant psychology positions, the majority of which we have now offered to people.<br/><br/>The broader area of integration is a good one, and I feel there are opportunities for closer integration between mental health services and primary care services and between mental health services and other services.  Some of this concerns building up our staffing, having more counsellors available through our counselling and primary care service, having more SCANs available and building up our community mental health teams, but also the structures.  I referred earlier to community health care networks, with which members will be familiar from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  They provide a format for closely integrating primary care services with other services, including specialist mental health services.  I would be happy to elaborate on this should the committee require me to do so later on.<br/><br/>Regarding emergencies, no more than the Deputy, I have got the phone call late at night as well.  Our preference, depending on the emergency, is to talk to someone's GP.  The call that I took involved establishing whether the matter needed to be dealt with immediately or whether it could wait until the following day, and we established contact with the person's GP the following day.</p><p>If a service needs to be dealt with at night, we currently have over seven nursing service across most of the area and will have it across all of Cork and Kerry from April 2018 so that will be a port of call in an emergency.  If an emergency occurs at night, the service that is available is the local emergency department.  I appreciate that this is not the ideal service but we have built up liaison services, particularly in both of the major Cork hospitals, at medical and nursing level in recent years to ensure that this experience is as effective as possible.  </p><p> In respect of dual diagnosis, it is hard to comment on the individual case discussed by the Deputy but I would not believe that normally addiction should be the reason that somebody would not be able to engage with mental health services.  We have a strong addiction service in Cork and Kerry that is separate from our mental health services.  Traditionally, it would have been within the mental health services but it works very closely with mental health services.  We are seeking funding through our social inclusion budget nationally for a specialist consultant post involving a psychiatrist with an interest in addiction services.  There are strong links there are and I am happy to discuss any individual cases that undermine that with the Deputy later.  </p><p> The Deputy's next question related to suicide and the initiatives in place to address that.  Obviously, suicide is an issue that is broader than mental health services.  The health services have a role in providing a lead in the area but addressing suicide, be it in Cork, Kerry or across the country, requires society as a whole to work together.  Obviously, members will be well aware of the increased profile and freedom to talk about mental health issues and that the national HSE "Little Things" campaign through social media and traditional media is significant.  Locally, we have two plans, one for Cork and one for Kerry.  They have 72 actions and multi-agency plans agreed with the local authority, the Garda and ourselves.  We have suicide awareness officers who work on two fronts, one of which involves building community resilience working with communities and schools to raise awareness and building that community awareness and capacity to minimise the risk of suicide.  We have trained 12,000 people in the SafeTALK programme, which, again, builds that level of capacity.  The second focus for the suicide awareness officers is being there as a response when a suicide affects a family or particularly if there is more than one suicide in a community.  We work with our psychology department in putting in place a number of resources to avoid what can be seen as a cluster effect at times.  </p><p> The counselling we employ through mental health services is through the counselling and primary care services.  That is provided through a third party agency at the moment which employs those counsellors.  I cannot tell the Deputy the exact accreditations they use but there is an accreditation form.  I am well aware that national accreditation standard will be set with CORU for counselling shortly.  The Jigsaw service, which we fund, employs counselling psychologists but the counselling resource we employ directly would be psychologists and assistant psychologists.  I think that answers the majority of questions.</p></speech>

I thank him for his comprehensive answers.  I will probably talk offline because I do not want to take up so much time but one third having the staff means that two thirds do not have it so there is a big challenge there.  This committee should focus on setting a target for getting all the areas to full staff levels.  If we succeeded in doing that alone, we would have done a very good job.  I asked a question about the link with primary care and Mr. Reaney gave a very professional answer that there is work to be done there.  There is probably very good work but that is a huge area in which we really need to improve.  Sometimes it is the system.  It is not the fault of any one person.  In respect of improving it and the link between those services, if we did everything we could as a committee to work towards helping the CHOs achieve that, we would be doing a lot of good work.</p></speech>

I will try to be brief as possible as I have a lot to include in a couple of minutes.  Listening to the presentations today, the two things that really get to me, and I do not envy the witnesses' job, which is an extremely difficult and challenging one, are CAMHS and teams.  A soccer team has 11 players while a rugby team has 15.  It goes on and on.  We have listened to many presentations today and we have buckets that are half empty.  We have buckets with no assets but we all have buckets.  I have 11 or 15 buckets on my team.  Can we get the breakdown in each CHO of how many CAMHS teams are actually there, how many are fully staffed, how many are understaffed and, more importantly, how many are overstaffed?  There does not seem to be an over-emphasis on a common sense approach.  We listened to one presentation from witnesses from CHO 3 or CHO 2 which said that one team is 118%.  These are percentages.  We want to talk about people and staffing, that is, psychotherapists, psychologists, etc.  Why is there no common sense approach?  If there are three people on a team that is overstaffed and another team is understaffed by two while another is short one person in the same CHO area, why can we not move people around?  Is it down to contractual issues?  Why are we over staffing some areas while we are told we cannot fill other areas?</p> <p>  The second issue that leaves me feeling really aggrieved is retention.  We are talking about recruitment.  The HSE seems to be very good hiring agency staff to fill the deficit and can afford to pay the agency staff more money than its own staff to fill the gaps.  To me, this is criminal when it comes to wasting funds.  Why can we not sit down with the unions and hash this out?  I can understand on the consultancy side of it that it may be not a shortage internationally but probably the fact that we are so weak on recruitment because of the wages structure.  My next point, which I have flagged with the Minister, goes back to teams.  I will use Cork and Kerry as examples.  If we need nine teams in Kerry and ten in Cork, why can we not fully staff them and show that it works?  I know somebody has to lose out.  I am just using them as examples.  By fully staffing them, we will cut down on the stress within the system because everybody, even the nurses, are stressed.  I have spoken to nurses who have left work crying.  Surely we can harmonise the system where those who work in the system will stay in their jobs.  Everything in these areas seems to be either half empty or half full so there is no harmony in any of these areas.  They seem to be totally broken.  Many questions arise.  What is the level of decision-making in each area with regard to budgeting and even thinking outside the box?  Have they the power to do that?  Has anyone in any CHO area told the Minister "I'm short two to fill a full complement of a team and I think this will work"?  Can the witnesses do that?  These are hard questions.  This committee is here to drive this on and assist them.  Have any community mental health youth leaders been appointed in any CHO because there are major issues coming down the road with cyberbullying?  This is another thing that will come up over the next couple of years so let us nip it in the bud.</p><p> I am conscious of time.  How much longer do I have?</p></speech>

Can we go into the schools?  Perhaps that has been done.  Can we get packages, work with unions and say to people that when they qualify in five years, they will work in specific CHO areas and outline the opportunities they will have, along with wage structures, increments, information on where they can improve and so on?  I do not see any forward planning to retain staff or give them a chance to improve.  That is why we are losing a lot of very good staff from the country.  It is not always about money.  I spoke to a very good friend at Christmas two years ago and he cried because he wanted to work and pay his taxes here at home but he could not afford to live here.  He works in Australia now and he still hates it.  I have so much to say on this but I will stop there and send Mr. Reaney an email.</p></speech>

On the numbers per team, unfortunately I cannot answer the question about overstaffing versus understaffing because none of my CAMHS teams is overstaffed.  I gave an answer earlier about adult services.  They are indicative figures based on a population and they do not take into account a number of other factors.  However, we know that does not arise in respect of the CAMHS services.  We have prioritised this area this year for the development funding, which we negotiate with the national team.  We will add 7.5 posts to our CAMHS service across Cork and Kerry.</p> <p>  On the question of whether one fills a full team or goes partial, our sense is that we continue to try to address the most important deficits.  We have met with our teams as part of our CAMHS enhancement project, led by one of our psychologists, and identified within those teams what the profile is of people presenting, what are the key skills that would make the most difference to them and we prioritise the posts based on that, so that we can achieve the maximum effect.</p> <p>  On agencies, we use them for medical staffing when we cannot get staff in any other way.  It is very much used as a last resort.</p></speech>

We cannot pay the same as agencies but when those agencies hire staff, they charge the HSE more than what they are paying the agency staff.  It is a double standard.  There is triple the standard pay difference between agency staff that are well capable of working within the system and probably want real jobs.  It is not Mr. Reaney's fault but I want to make the point.  There is huge waste in this, even in recruitment and retention.  We will never fill this if we have a private sector that is 47% of nearly all the CHOs.  It is even the case with CAMHS, which seems to be filled by agency staff.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In most cases, that is for temporary positions so they may be covering vacancies for maternity or sick leave or they may be placed where we need additional staff for a short period due to particular needs of people in residential centres, for example.  Most of the positions that we are filling are not permanent positions.  We currently have 12 vacancies in our nursing area but we could have up to 40 positions filled through agency.  The rest would be temporary short-term positions.  There could be a vacancy in east Cork this week and next month it may be in west Cork.  It is difficult to fill those vacancies with regular staff, although we continue to explore ways in which we can reduce our agency staffing because of the premium cost that we have to pay on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the idea of putting in place teams that are fully staffed.  I mentioned that one of the initiatives in 2018 will be an eating disorder team.  Since we wrote our submission to the committee, we received confirmation that we will be a pilot for an early intervention team for adults.  Both of those teams will be fully put in place.  That provides an opportunity to test the Deputy's thesis.  These are coming on the back of clinical programmes.  To some extent, it also addresses how proactive we are or otherwise in addressing deficits.  For various reasons, including the fact that we have consultants working as part of the clinical programmes nationally, our area has been quite proactive in working with our national team and seeking to be a pilot site or initial developing site for both of these areas.  Both will be put in place, subject to recruitment, as full teams.</p> <p>  A question on the power of decision-making was also put to my colleagues earlier.  We start each year with the service we have.  While we have the capacity to move funding from adults to children or from residential to community in theory, that is based on the extent to which we can reduce the need and the service in one area to build it up in another.  It is not always that easy to take away a service that is needed in one area in order to fill a need - which may be greater - in another.  Where we do have decision-making authority entirely is in respect of new funding.  That decision-making is done in co-operation with our national teams.  Approval for 90% of the posts relating to development funding in recent years was based on local decisions.  Usually, a national framework is put in place in order that we might prioritise the CAMHS service this year or specialist services for older people another year, but we will prioritise where those staff go.  I assure the committee that the decision-making, in as far as it can be in an overall national framework, rests with myself and Ms Gleeson and her management team.</p> <p>  I understand that the youth health service lead will be advertised early this year, hopefully in the first quarter.  If we can get more details on that, we will provide them to the Deputy.</p> <p>  On workforce planning, I would like to get the contact details for the Deputy's friend in Australia before I leave this meeting.  We would be very happy to talk to that person about a position.  We are coming out of the period when there was a recruitment moratorium.  It is only about three years since that was in place.  Some of the overhang from that remains in the minds of certain staff.  We are working hard to create an atmosphere where people feel valued.  We have development programmes in all our staffing areas, including nursing.  Staff have the opportunity to study for postgraduate qualifications and specialise in areas in which they are interested.  We try to line that up with the service need.  That is good workforce planning but we have some way to go.  We have increased the number of nurse training places at Institute of Technology Tralee.  All of those who wanted to work in Kerry have been offered jobs there.  Similarly, those trained at UCC have been offered jobs in Cork.  We have a level of forward planning.  It is not perfect but it is something that we develop further year by year.</p></speech>

It is nice to meet Ms Gleeson.  The briefing was really clear - the main document and its appendices - so I thank the witnesses for that.  I also welcome the ethos around recovery and co-production which they have outlined.  It is important to have principles and values guiding decisions.</p> <p>  I live in CHO area 4.  I have worked in that area with Cork Simon Community, where were big issues with addition and dual diagnosis, in the Cope Foundation where there was a focus on disability but also a significant interface with people who had mental health issues, and then in Alzheimer's, which is another area that takes us into mental health issues.</p> <p>  I was informed by the hearings that Senator Freeman chaired on child mental health and some of the questions I ask will reflect that.  In preparation for this meeting, I have also made contact with teams on the ground.  Dr. Karen O'Connor gave a very good presentation on the home-based team.  This is an excellent service to prevent people being admitted and it also plays a role in respect of early discharge.  I am also due to meet people from Arbour House.  Some of my questions will reflect these things.</p> <p>  When I met Dr. O'Connor, she spoke of how access to counselling at primary care level would prevent over-medication and inappropriate referral to secondary care and that recruitment and retention of staff in other parts of the mental health service - including cover for maternity leave and sick leave - have a huge impact even on teams that are working well because they pick up the slack for problems in other parts of the system.  Dr. O'Connor also commented on the out-of-hours service or the lack thereof and the postcode lottery.</p><p>The home-base team is working well but it does not cover all areas.  The boundaries and silos were also an issue which came up all the time in the child and adolescent mental health hearings.  People are falling through the cracks.  I have some specific questions on these issues.  In their experience, do the witnesses believe that the CHOs have the right mix of skills?  We have spoken about vacancies but do the CHOs have the right kinds of people?  With regard to the waiting lists, as of October 2017 there are 748 children waiting with 222 of those children waiting for 12 months.  Where does Mr. Reaney expect to be this time next year in terms of those very unacceptable waiting lists?  Does CHO 4 have proposals around family therapy as a core part of the CAMHS teams?  This would seem to be something well worth considering.  What are the CHO 4 plans for this?  How is the CHO 4 helping to prevent people falling through the cracks?  For example, if a person in COPE has a disability as a primary diagnosis but also has mental health issues, which often happens with people who have Asperger's or autism, how do people on the ground work to look after this person?  It is the same with silos.  If a person with dementia is under the age of 65 where does he or she get access to psychiatry services?  How does CHO 4 make sure that people do not fall through the cracks of dual diagnosis?</p><p> With regard to the suicide rates of 14.7% in Cork city and 17.1% in Kerry, do the witnesses know the reasons the rates are so high in these areas and where does Mr. Reaney expect to be this time next year in this regard?  Obviously, he is not in control of all the factors around suicide but where would he see the efforts to reduce those rates in Cork and Kerry?</p></speech>

The Senator asked if we have the right people.  I believe we have the right people.  We need more of them, as we already outlined to Deputy Buckley.  The posts as identified in A Vision for Change are the priorities for us in order to build up those teams.  There are particular posts within those priorities that will bring their own value.  These are our priorities.  I will ask my colleague Ms Glennon to cover the query about the CAMHS waiting lists and the work we have under way.  I made reference to a CAMHS enhancement project.  This waiting list is certainly our number one priority at the moment.</p></speech>

There are factors around it.  In particular, we have had a number of consultant vacancies.  As we fill one vacancy another person retires.  This has had a significant impact along with the high number of referrals.  Ms Glennon will go through some of the steps we have in place for the short term, medium term and longer term, which we believe will address those waiting lists.  These will also address the family therapy issue.</p> <p>  The Senator made reference to people falling through the cracks and to the silos.  I will address these points separately.  The Senator spoke of her own background in the intellectual disability services.  This is an area for development for us.  We have appointed a relatively new intellectual disability team over the last two years to support the consultants who are already there.  We are also in the process of recruiting for a similar post in Kerry.  We are aware that there is work to do in the context of how that team works closer with the agencies to build on the existing relationships and to ensure there is a consultant and staff assigned to each geographic area.  We are currently working through that with our teams.</p> <p>  On the issue of needs of people over the age of 65 who have dementia and Alzheimer's, we have developed the psychiatry of old age team.  Cork and Kerry would traditionally have been quite strong on general adult community mental health teams, and not so strong on specialist teams, including mental health teams and psychiatry of old age teams.</p></speech>

We had a meeting recently with our head of social care and with Ms Glennon because many people with dementia are treated by geriatricians.  We are putting in place a process with our consultant colleagues in both the psychiatry of old age and with geriatricians, to ensure we have the correct pathways.  My experience is that people do get to the right place but at the moment it may take a little bit longer than is ideal.  With the growth in dementia, it is an area we cannot be complacent about.</p> <p>  I fully endorse Senator Kelleher's theme on silos.  We need to be constantly conscious of this area.  I refer back to the community health care networks as being the most comprehensive way to have a local structure for a population of 50,000, and where primary care is linked closely to all the other services, therefore facilitating those services in talking to each in a better way.  The current structures do not support that as well as they should.  My colleagues and I are very anxious that we can move on with the roll out of the community health care networks.  Ms Glennon will address the issues relating to CAMHS.</p></speech>

The November data that was supplied to the committee has 748 children in total on the waiting list, 222 of whom are waiting more than 12 months.  As Mr. Reaney said, we started a CAMHS service enhancement project.  We have nominated a dedicated lead to that project who has a clinical background as the principal psychology manager.  This lead person has been working very closely with the teams to develop their own plans as it is not a one-size-fits-all.  It depends on other local services and it depends on the geographic area.  We have made very strong improvements with some of the teams, especially with team C.  It peaked at 209 earlier this year.  These are the December figures because we do not yet have full figures for this year so far, but it is now down to 146 on the total waiting list.  Team B is another example.  It peaked at 100 in August 2017 and is now down to 66 on its list.  It is a very concerted piece of work with the team and developed by the team, to improve it ways of working to look at what is the best possible mix with the needs of the child and the family, and also with the team members available.  We acknowledge that in some of our teams there are just not enough staff on the ground, particularly when one factors in maternity leave and so on.  Seven and a half additional posts have just been signed off as part of the development funding of the national team and these posts have been targeted towards the teams with people waiting more than 12 months and they are specifically identified to disciplines that the teams have said would make the most difference.  We are confident that over the next 12 months there will be a considerable improvement in CAMHS.</p> <p>  The Senator spoke of the family therapists.  We have a number of these posts across the system but we would like to have a lot more.  The training piece is quite lengthy.  In some teams we have one person who is trained in family therapy.  If that person leaves the team we also lose that skill.  As part of the CAMHS enhancement project, we are trying to develop co-ordinated team-based training plans that we will collate up to one CHO-wide training plan to identify training needs over the next years, and to potentially bring the trainers into our area rather than having people travel elsewhere for training.</p> <p>  Our rates of suicide are above average.  It is an issue especially in Cork city versus Cork county.  Kerry also has rates that are higher than the national average.  Both counties peaked in 2012.  The Senator asked why this is.  The honest answer is that I do not know.  There is strong research linking unemployment and suicide figures.  Obviously, it is a multi-factorial piece.  We have strong structures in place following the publication of the Connecting for Life plans.  The Kerry plan was published at the end of May and the Cork plan was published in July.  There are dedicated project teams, a steering group and a number of work streams.  There is a lot of involvement from community and voluntary agencies.  The community helped us to write the plans and there was wide-spread consultation across the two counties.  The plans are very much focused on what can be done internally, be it social prescribing, better links with first responders, better ways to identify people who are potentially at risk and targeting services towards them.</p> <p>  We are very fortunate in Cork to have the National Suicide Research Foundation.  We work very closely with Professor Ella Arensman and her team there.  They have conducted a very in-depth observational piece of work over the last years where they interviewed families who were bereaved by suicide.  The team tried to gain better insight into the whole picture around the time that led up to the suicide or other various links.  Our work is usually informed by research and this brings a great strength to the area also.  Quite often the figures we have around suicide are a little bit behind; we must wait for coroners' reports, for example.  The National Suicide Research Foundation is working to implement a real-time data system, which would give us improved visibility over potential emerging trends and we would not be reliant on anecdotal evidence.  Often the media reporting is over inflated, it is not the true figures.</p></speech>

I refer, for example, to the community psychiatric nurses, CPNs, and psychiatrists based on Anderson's Quay.  I would like some reassurance on that issue because there is such a correlation between homelessness and mental ill health issues.</p></speech>

The only caveat in that regard that is the issue of consultant vacancies.    As I said, we have short, medium and more long-term measures to put in place a resilience such that even in the event of somebody retiring or being sick we would be able to minimise the impact on those waiting for a long time.  As regards homelessness, I earlier neglected to say that we are putting in place an additional homelessness consultant who will work in Kerry and Cork and provide an outreach service in Kerry.</p> <p>  The health funding provided to agencies such as the Simon Community has not kept pace with the increase in homelessness.  Although the Government has a significant programme in terms of housing, it is a challenge for all of us to keep the health aspect properly funded.  We are working with Cuan Mhuire on an initiative there which we shortly hope to bring to fruition.</p></speech>

According to the figures provided, there are 1,468 staff or people working for Mr. Reaney in CHO4.  We cannot account for 1,105 of them.  Are there many absent employees, are they working in other areas or hospitals or are some not working in mental health but still classed as Mr. Reaney's employees?</p></speech>

We have given a detailed breakdown of the staff in five teams and if that is not sufficient detail we can give more.  We have not given a breakdown of the remainder of the staff, who are in various acute units and residential units which, because they operate 24-7 365 days a year, tend to need more staff.

That must be addressed because mental health is becoming a more serious problem.  As I have said at previous meetings of this committee, awareness and working with the families of those with mental health difficulties are issues that are not being addressed.</p> <p>  To take the example of Carlow, which is my area, along with A Vision for Change there are child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the self harm intervention project, SHIP, which is a programme being run in the south east to address self harm by those aged between 16 and 25.  However, some younger teenagers need to access that service, which has a waiting list.  I have been in contact with the relevant CHO in that regard.  Some people who have come to me are on a waiting list and badly need to access that service.  It frightens me to think that we have such a service - which is on trial only in the south east, although it is hoped that it will be rolled out across the country - but some teenagers who want to access the service and address self harm issues are told they are on the list and will have to wait.  It is the same with CAMHS, which also has a backlog in that area that needs to be addressed.  </p> <p>  Those who live in Carlow are very lucky because they have Carlow regional youth service, which is an independent body that provides great services.  The CHOs seem to be using such organisations.  Last year, one of its services, Foll&aacute;ine, provided counselling for 140 young people.  It charged young people &euro;2 because there was such a need for the service.  The Carlow regional youth service has 14 other projects that provide services to the young people of Carlow.  It is an excellent project.  It has projects in disadvantaged area and works with liaison officers and the Garda.  Last year, it worked with over 5,000 children.  Some &euro;20,000 was recently allocated to the structure and providing help but that does not go far enough.  That organisation provides a very good service and is always looking for money.  It finds it very hard to get money but is dealing with areas in which children from the ages of 12 to 24 are crying out for help.  I read in Ms Colley's submission that there is increased demand for service for children and young people and I agree that there is.  We need to consider that area into the future.  It is a great service.  I appreciate that &euro;20,000 was allocated to it some weeks ago and the service was delighted with that but we need to look at putting far more money into such areas because everyone will have to work together with the HSE into the future.</p> <p>  The recruitment of staff is a massive issue.  Last week in Carlow I went to a meeting about A Vision for Change.  It was the first such meeting held and was part of the HSE local forum.  I am sure such meetings are being rolled out across the country.  I was very taken aback at that meeting.  I have learned that friends, carers and family members who support people are key to this issue.  However, only six other people turned up for the meeting.</p><p>There are issues here.  We went through the whole booklet, which was excellent, and great work can be done with it, but we realised that people are not aware of it.  People are not aware of what is available for them out there.  If families, users and their friends are not aware of a system's existence it cannot work.  That night one of the users present said that there was an occupational therapist, OT, he or she had been working with in St. Dympna's.  St. Dympna's wanted to keep this particular OT on, but it was told that this person could not be kept on because of a lack of funding.  Anne, who managed the health department, had told us that there was funding in place for the various areas.  I learned a great deal that night.  I do not know what kind of response the witness is getting, but this is a good programme that nobody was aware of.  I only heard by chance because someone I know was going, but otherwise I would not have known it was on.  This is something we all need to work on.  Every area needs to use this.  Perhaps the witness can comment on that.</p><p> Another issue that I am sure the witness is aware of is St. Luke's psychiatric unit, which has 44 beds but which had 52 patients last weekend.  It was on local radio in Kilkenny all last weekend.  Some of the patients had been left on the couches in the TV room.  That is a disaster.  People were very angry over this.  I have spoken to people and their families.  I want to know if extra units are going to be built.  We had St. Dympna's, which provided a great service.  Now the bulk of our services are in Kilkenny, which caters for south Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Carlow.  Our capacity is too small and we are not able to cater for it.  It is a massive issue.  Is there funding, going forward, to build new units?  We need them.  I can understand that everyone is doing their best.  We are here to highlight things in our own area.  Are there any plans to build more units to ensure that we never have a situation like this again?  </p></speech>

I want to ask about the day centre.  There are day centres in all areas, but I can only speak for Carlow.  We have Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; and the involvement services.  I am going up to meet a group next week.  Is a certain amount of funding allocated to these services every year?  I understand that every year they are looking for different things and they are told that the funding is not there.  I have a list which I did not bring, but I will provide it when we meet again.  The service is constantly looking for funding.  Is there a programme there for day services for funding or for works that need to be done, or indeed for the OT I mentioned, who St. Dympna's wanted to keep on and which it felt it needed?  It boils down to staffing, recruitment and funding.  I will come back and address some of these issues, but these are the queries I have for my own area that I would like some answers to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Colley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018011800002#V00400"><p>I will start with the forum.  It is a new matter in the 2018 plan.  In the opening statement we referred to the area lead, the six peer workers and the Recovery College.  That is linked into ensuring that the people who utilise our services, who we provide care and support to, have a voice in determining how our services are developed and how they would like to see them delivered.  I take the Senator's point that an awareness campaign is very important.  It is essential, because we want this engagement.  It was the first meeting of the year, and it is a brand new programme.  There was a meeting in Carlow, and then another in Kilkenny this week.  I am very happy to take the Senator's comments and suggestions back.  She will see the forum developing over the course of the year.  I note that it uses social media and radio, but we need to make sure that we are getting the contact points out and encouraging people to turn up and have that voice.  Sometimes that is about permission.  People have to feel that it is a safe environment to come to and add their voices to.  We received &euro;1.6 million in service reform funds, which will specifically look at supporting people under the headings of housing, employment and training, and that is linked to the Recovery College, which will also be linked to the forum.</p> <p>  In terms of the Senator's other questions, it is much the same as has already been said about Cork and Kerry.  Recruitment and retention is one of our priorities.  We have all of the data - we have provided it to the Senator - which we look through and ensure that we can allocate appropriately.  For example, 33% of the development posts we had were targeted towards child and youth mental health services.  There is a recognition that child and youth mental health services need to grow and must be supported.  In my opening statement I referred to a step-care model, which is really what we have been discussing today.  The importance of primary care, GPs and the voluntary organisations was alluded to, in terms of the regional youth service.  We have provided money for that.  We have also worked with Tusla and the local council to decide how that support can be given.  For us it is about trying to provide wrap-around services, making sure that people get the service at the level they require.  The Child and Adult Mental Health Services, CAMHS, is a specialised service.  It is trying to ensure that the people it is involved with get what they need as quickly as possible and that they can get it easily.  </p> <p>  The Senator asked about the self-harm intervention programme, SHIP.  There are three people on the list for SHIP in Carlow, and we take that very seriously, given the type of service that it is.  We have a director of counselling services that works closely with both primary care and the mental health team.  That team spans both services.  When a person comes through SHIP their care can be returned to the GP, or if multi-disciplinary care is needed, hand in hand with the specialist services, those referrals are made.  We are piloting that in the south-east.  An evaluation study is available, if the Senator would like to read it.  It has already been published.  We are now in the next round, and SHIP is now available in all counties in the south-east.</p> <p>  St. Luke's was mentioned.  The events of last weekend were very unfortunate, when there were 52 patients and only 44 beds.  We do have an emergency protocol which is used to bring a situation like that under control as quickly as possible.  Nobody wants people on extendable couches or chairs.  It is very difficult for the patient and their families but also the staff involved.  We recognise that.  I am happy to say that by 6 p.m. that evening there were 44 beds occupied, through emergency measures implemented throughout that day.  Since then we have had ongoing management plans and have sought to address that.  It is difficult to always keep the number to 44, because there will be times where it is under 44, times when we have exactly 44 and of course times when there are more than 44.  The Mental Health Commission is one of the regulatory bodies, and we are very conscious of that.  Most important, we work for the comfort and safety of the patients.  A management plan is in place there. </p> <p>  In terms of beds, 44 beds are available in both Kilkenny and Waterford.  We use some beds from CHO6 as well, which I believe was referenced in the statement.  Vision for Change is something of an indicator.  We must take cognisance of the fact that we have had a 2.6% growth in our population.  A Vision for Change was published ten years ago.  We must also look at the indices in terms of social determinants of health, etc, and what that means for our area.  Dr. Browne might speak on this as well.</p><p>However, our team takes it very seriously and it is looking at it analytically as well as from the care perspective, that is, in terms of clinical pathways of care, what is the most informed best practice, so that we can plan ahead.</p><p> At this point in time we do not have any commitment on the capital plan for new acute units in the south east.  We do have it for other things.  For example, in Waterford, we will have 20 beds as part of the rebuild of St. Patrick's and we will have beds coming into Clonmel but not for an acute department of psychiatry. </p><p> I will hand over to Dr. Browne.</p></speech>

Then there was a sharp decline and we are now well below the European average.  Most European countries spend between 10% and 12% of their health budget on mental health.  We have spent around 6% in the past number of years.  A Vision for Change, when costed in 2006, suggested that to staff to the norms recommended would require the allocation of 8.4% of the health budget to mental health.  A Vision for Change set a standard for acute bed provision of 16.7 per 100,000 population.  Most psychiatrists would say that is an unfortunate underestimate.  The current national average is 22 inpatient beds per 100,000 of the population.  In CHO5, the average is 18.3.  If one were to take 18.3 from 22 and multiply it by 5.1, the population of CHO5 being 511,000, we find CHO5, compared to the national average, has an underprovision of 18 beds.</p></speech>

When population increases, there will be an increased need.  I also draw the Deputy's attention to Planning for Health, a copy of which has been provided.  This shows that, due to pure demographic variables, it is estimated there will be an increased pressure on bed availability for mental health throughout the country over the next number of years of 0.9% per annum.</p></speech>

One of the problems with A Vision for Change is that it never took cognisance of the fact that there would be what are called new long-stay patients.  These are patients who, due to the severity of their illness, require an admission to a psychiatric hospital for a year or longer.  In 2004 it was postulated that by 2011 there would be no new long-stay patients, but that has not happened.  Since the first quarter of 2013, there have been 416 new long-stay patients nationally, of which, fortunately, only 29, or 6.3%, were in the CHO5 area.  In order to ease the pressure on acute inpatient units, it would be ideal to have a regional slow stream rehabilitation unit for these new long-stay patients who require ongoing inpatient care but not necessarily in an acute psychiatric unit.</p></speech>

At the moment there is already agreement for the forthcoming year and we are in conversations with our national colleagues.  However, at this point in time, we do not have a Jigsaw unit.  We have other providers that are similar to Jigsaw but would probably not have the same remit.  For example, Squashy Couch provides similar services in Waterford.</p></speech>

There are 17, but the list is shorter because, for example, in some bigger places they will be broken up into smaller subsets of teams.  There is an analysis there not just in percentages but in terms of the whole-time equivalent, WTE, gap.  Taking on board what was said earlier about CHO4, we have a good analysis.  In terms of our adult provision, we are at nearly 77% of what is in A Vision for Change.  We still have a gap of approximately 49 clinical staff to go for adults.</p><p>There is a variance between our counties and local populations of 50,000.  That is the comment that is really important.  We range in population groups of 50,000 but sometimes, given the way people work with GPs or on foot of where they live, some of our teams have population groups which are larger or smaller than that.  We need to reflect that.  The other reason it might appear in our area that there is overpopulation compared to the area of another team is that there are legacy issues where we had people employed in acute services or longer-term facilities which have been closed on foot of deinstitutionalisation.  In the context of development posts, we analyse that and prioritise the counties which need to come up to an effective level by having a complete team for the area.</p></speech>

For example, we know that in CHO 2, between CAMHS, adult and old-age services, mental health and intellectual disability, there are meant to be 25 teams in total but only four of those are fully populated.

I come back briefly to the emergency overcrowding protocol.  We are taking risks when we look at who to put on leave, who to give extended leave and, in particular, who to discharge.  I acknowledge that it is an emergency protocol, but it is risky for clinical staff.</p> <p>  I am known for my brevity and will not go on too long.  The moratorium was damaging to staff but the insulting graduate nurse contract offered several years ago has created a damaging legacy in the context of trying to recruit staff.  Issues with the recruitment of nursing staff in the east seem to be much more prevalent than elsewhere nationally, which is saying something.  It is a problem for every CHO area, but in particular for the east.  What contracts are being offered to staff?  What is in them?  Are they flexible?  We spoke about agency staff and their cost.  Some agency staff do not necessarily wish to become full-time employees or to sign a contract.  Are we flexible enough?  At one stage we were saying that if someone could offer four or more hours, that person should contact us.  I do not know if it is less than that now.  What flexibility, educational opportunities and opportunities for advancement are there, in particular in nursing where one has CNSs and ANPs and where we could run a nurse-led health service at a much reduced cost?</p> <p>  Of the budget, perhaps 80% goes to payroll with 20% going to different services and infrastructure.  What is the breakdown between front-line clinical staff and the back-up support staff who are so important but who are providing administration services?  I tie that in because I want to know if we have plans, and if so, how advanced they are in the context of the paucity of IT and its use, which has been startling to the committee.  IT is a low priority but if we train enough people, we will need fewer in the long term.  We would have a lot more continuity and care would be easier to access, as would records.  The gap in whole-time equivalents in CHO 6 is verging on 50% in some instances.  I do not know if I am reading the statistics right and stand to be corrected.</p> <p>  Linn Dara has been a bugbear of mine as the Chairman will know.  It is open.  How many beds are operational there?  I have harassed two Ministers at least over the last several months and eventually the facility has opened.  What are the waiting lists like, including Fairview and the CHO 6 area?</p> <p>  Is the budget based on population or the historical location of asylums?  Has that changed and has the position been modernised to refer to what is needed according to the population?  What is the budget for section 39 bodies, including Jigsaw and those which offer services on the ground, including CAMHS in particular?  Are there contingency plans for the proposed strikes on Valentine's Day?  What is the breakdown of the budget for section 39 services?  The spirit of A Vision for Change must include value for money.  What do the section 39 services provide in that context and how much value do we have in terms of outcomes?  Can we measure outcomes or do we just allow the services off to provide what they believe they need?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, exit interviews with nurses demonstrate that it is most acute among nursing staff.  Exit interviews show that the cost of living in south Dublin is high, including the cost of renting and housing.  That is definitely a problem, not only in terms of recruiting new candidates for our workforce but also in terms of retaining staff who want to purchase homes, start families and all that good stuff.  We have had a number of initiatives as we have not been successful through national recruitment for our area.  We have established a specific project under the area director of nursing.  It is a special project group to look at local recruitment.</p> <p>  I was asked about the postgraduate and undergraduate programmes.  There have been undergraduate nurses all of the time, but we never had a particular undergraduate programme in our acute units and community services with UCD.  We have now established that with UCD.  We will attempt to grow our workforce, which is very important.  The postgraduate programme has been very successful.  A lot of the general nurses who do agency work have gone on to that postgraduate programme, which has been really worthwhile.  People in mental health nursing retire quite young and we are fortunate that some come back to do agency work, which has kept services safe.  Some of the people doing agency work are very experienced.  However, we are too reliant on them.</p><p>I am glad to say that because they are so experienced we know we have a safe service.  This is a very important message for the public because mental health services can be high risk areas so providing a safe service is very important.</p><p> With regard to the contract, to be honest local recruitment has been based on temporary contracts and this has been a disadvantage.  Our work with HBS under this project will allow us to recruit people to permanent posts.  We hope this will improve our situation.</p><p> We are developing expertise in our advanced nurse practice and clinical nurse specialist teams, and encouraging people not only to enter our service but to develop a career with us is really our aim.  Under Mr. Walsh, the area director of nursing stewardship, we are looking at advanced nurse practice programmes in CAMHS and old age psychiatry in a number of other areas, and we hope to develop these shortly.  We did not get any in 2017 but we hope to be on the advanced nurse practice programme in 2018.  We have a number of clinical nurse specialists.  The CAMHS waiting list is high in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and we are looking at nurse prescribing and advanced nurse practice to free up medical time so we can improve the waiting list.  This is very important also.</p><p> We have a focus on service improvement in existing nursing posts and how our current staff is deployed to best effect.  That is in answer to the question on A Vision for Change being value for money.  It is difficult to pinpoint outcomes, but through our focus on the recovery of patients in mental health services we will be looking at, hopefully, shorter length of stay, fewer admissions, people remaining in the workforce and being in close contact and fully functioning in their own communities.  This is very important in terms of our ethos and our focus on how our services are developed and run.</p><p> In terms of the breakdown of pay and non-pay, our non-pay is slightly higher than it is in the rest of the country.  This is because of the number of contracted services we have.  It is close enough to 70:20 but it is slightly different.  It is not quite 80:20 but it is close enough.</p><p> With regard to the gaps in our teams, I gave an outline of the A Vision for Change gap.  It is correct to state none of our teams is at the level of A Vision for Change.  Our adult teams run at approximately 47.5%, and our child and adolescent humans at approximately 60%, of what A Vision for Change states.  This is a position we want to change.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Derville Rowland, director general, financial conduct; Mr. Ed Sibley, deputy governor, prudential regulation; and Ms Helena Mitchell, head of consumer protection supervision division.  </p> <p>  For most people a mortgage is their most significant financial commitment and they have a right to expect their lender to treat them fairly and honour contractual commitments.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s role is to ensure the best interests of consumers are protected in their dealings with financial firms.  That is why, after pursuing tracker mortgage issues with a number of individual lenders through extensive supervisory and enforcement work prior to 2015, the Central Bank launched the industry-wide tracker mortgage examination.  We did so because the more we learned in our pursuit of individual issues and the more concerns were voiced by customers, consumer advocates and public representatives such as the members of the committee, the more certain we became that an investigation across every lender was required.  As the largest, most complex and most significant consumer protection review undertaken by the Central Bank to date, the examination has exposed unacceptable failings by lenders on an industry-wide basis and the lack of a consumer-centred culture in lenders.  These failings have had a detrimental and, in some cases, devastating impact on many tracker mortgage customers, up to and including the loss of homes and investment properties.  It is clear that lenders did not sufficiently recognise or address the scale of these failings until intervention by the Central Bank.  We are using all appropriate powers to force banks to undo the harm caused by their unacceptable failings.  </p> <p>  I will give an update on progress to date.  Unusually for live supervisory work, we have published regular updates on the examination since its launch in 2015.  When we appeared before the committee last October, we reported that at that point the examination had ensured that approximately 13,000 customers would receive redress and compensation as a result of lender failings.  This was in addition to the 7,100 cases which had already been resolved through our prior work in advance of the examination.  We also made it clear in our report at the time that more cases would follow as we challenged lenders to include all customers who had been harmed by the mishandling of tracker mortgages.  Last month we published a progress report which had been provided for the Minister for Finance.  Today we will provide a further update for the committee based on the end-of-December information.  </p> <p>  The most recent data show that lenders have been forced to pay &euro;316 million in redress and compensation.  More will follow, as the remainder of the 33,700 customers who were denied tracker mortgage products or charged the wrong rates receive redress and compensation and also as claims submitted to the independent appeals processes are adjudicated on.  </p> <p>  When we last appeared before the committee, we outlined the phased structure of the examination and that lenders had submitted their phase two reports.  We made it clear at that point that we regarded certain reports to be deficient.  In particular, we said certain lenders had left out groups of customers who, in our view, had been harmed by their failures and were, therefore, entitled to redress and compensation.  We emphasised that we would robustly challenge any such deficiency as we moved through our assurance work.  In that work we have scrutinised reports by lenders, undertaken on-site inspections, hauled in lenders&rsquo; senior management and impressed on them the need to take a consumer-focused approach in complying with the examination.  The outcome of this intensive engagement is that the issues surrounding the inclusion of disputed groups of customers have been resolved to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.  As a result of our challenge, there has been a large increase in the number of customers who will receive redress and compensation, a further 13,600 customers compared to the number for October.  In short, the examination is delivering for consumers.  </p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the committee and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in shining the public spotlight on the lenders involved in the examination which has added to the sustained pressure we have exerted on the lenders since the outset.  Like any regulator, the Central Bank is limited by law in the amount of information it can publicly disclose on any regulated financial institution.  Much of the pressure we exert on lenders to protect consumers must necessarily be exerted in private until outcomes are final and announced.  Of the initial group of 13,000 customers accepted by lenders up to the end of last September, 74% have received redress and compensation.  The majority of the remainder of that group  will receive theirs between now and the end of March, with the final balance receiving theirs by the end of June.  A total of &euro;181 million has been paid to date to these customers, with more to follow.  Of the additional 13,600 customers which the banks have accepted since October, 29% have received redress and compensation of &euro;87.9 million.  For these customers, it is an ongoing process which we believe is going to conclude between now and end of June.  </p> <p>  Lenders are counting the cost of this scandal.  In addition to the redress and compensation we require them to pay, they must also bear the administrative costs of running the examination in line with our requirements.  We can see this in their provisioning statements and staffing levels.  If we look at their combined provisions, they add up to &euro;900 million.  That sum can be broken down into figures of &euro;600 million for redress and compensation - what they have already paid out and what they are projecting they will need to pay out in the coming weeks - and &euro;300 million in costs.  The &euro;300 million is the bottom line cost for the lenders.  In terms of scale, one lender has disclosed that up to 500 people are working on the scheme.  In addition to the monetary consequences of the failure, the institutions must also repair damaged reputations, not only as a result of the original mishandling of tracker mortgages but also the partial and delayed engagement by some lenders with the requirements of the examination.  </p> <p>  While the Central Bank&rsquo;s view is that the vast majority of customers have now been identified and accepted by the lenders for redress and compensation, our work continues.  We will continue to review, challenge and verify the work undertaken by the lenders and complete our intrusive on-site inspection programme.  The Central Bank is probing lender compliance with all aspects of the examination framework and also gathering evidence to support its enforcement activity.  I acknowledge that this work has taken time to complete.  I am also conscious of the devastating impact the failures by lenders has had on customers, up to and including the loss of their homes and investment properties.  It is essential to acknowledge that no amount of money will ever fully compensate a person or a family for the trauma involved in losing their home or other adverse consequences arising from having to overpay for a mortgage. </p> <p>  The Central Bank has heard many distressing personal testimonies from customers who have contacted it.  Our awareness of the harm caused to so many families has underpinned our drive to ensure all affected customers will receive the appropriate financial redress and compensation and that we will leave no stone unturned in seeking evidence to support enforcement actions.  The scale, range and complexity of the examination, in addition to the material deficiencies in the responses given by certain lenders, have required robust and sustained Central Bank intervention which has resulted in many more customers being included and lenders significantly improving both their redress and compensation proposals and their independent appeals processes to the benefit of those affected.</p><p>While this has meant that the examination has taken longer than expected, the results are evident in terms of the numbers identified as having been affected and the scale of redress and compensation being paid.</p><p> In tandem with our supervisory work, enforcement work is ongoing.  Four enforcement investigations are under way and we expect all of the main lenders to face enforcement investigations.  Such investigations are detailed and forensic and routinely involve the scrutiny of thousands of documents and the conduct of interviews as part of the investigative process to establish the exact circumstances surrounding matters under investigation.  In the investigations the Central Bank will consider all possible angles, including potential individual culpability.</p><p> While we are investigating, it is important to remember that board members and the senior personnel of lenders have significant legal obligations to report potential regulatory breaches to the Central Bank and certain potential criminal offences to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  In that context, we are writing to board members and the senior personnel of the banks and require signed confirmation from each individual that he or she is aware of his or her legal obligations. </p><p> I will turn to the culture within lenders.  Our consumer protection code requires lenders to act in the best interests of their customers.  While many lenders publicly subscribe to this principle, evidence from the examination firmly suggests otherwise.  The examination has exposed the manner in which certain lenders have treated their customers and the degree of regulatory force required to make them rectify such behaviour.  It is clear that there are still significant behavioural and cultural issues and challenges in some of the lenders and that customer interests have not been sufficiently protected or prioritised.  The Minister for Finance has mandated the Central Bank to report later this year on the issue of behaviour and culture within lenders.  We are completing our scoping work and the next step is to commence on-site assessments which will include engagement in each of the lenders at senior management, middle management and staff level to probe behaviour and cultural issues.</p><p> It is important to note that culture is about more than behaviour.  A partial list includes prioritising the best interests of customers, offering responsible products, reviewing board effectiveness, committing to diversity and inclusion and having robust internal audit and risk management procedures.  A defining cultural test is how a firm deals with adverse situations.  Does it make sure the best interests of customers are protected, even if this damages short-term profitability?</p><p> The culture review will be underpinned by our enhanced consumer protection risk assessment model which facilitates us in determining how financial firms identify and manage consumer risks, including the risk that a firm's culture does not promote and support the protection of consumers.  The behaviour we witnessed in the examination has very much informed the development of the new model.  We are working with the Dutch Central Bank, DNB, a recognised leader in the supervision of behaviour and culture which will participate with us in on-site inspections at the lenders.</p><p> The culture of a firm is its responsibility.  In particular, the members of its board should constantly be asking questions of themselves and their firm such as what counts for promotions and whether it is high sales figures or high quality interactions with customers; whether the right products are being sold to the right people; how staff incentives and rewards influence product sales and consumer outcomes; whether the interests of customers are taken into account when decisions are being made in the boardroom; and whether the tone from the top signals the right values to staff.  These are critical issues which lenders must prioritise and get right if they are to truly reflect a consumer-focused culture.</p><p> The Central Bank is using effectively the full range of its powers to deliver for affected customers in the tracker mortgage examination.  We keep under constant review the question of whether additional powers would enable us to deliver more effectively on our mission to safeguard stability and protect consumers.  In that context, our report on behaviour and culture in lenders will help to identify regulatory enhancements required and whether additional legislative changes are needed.  Another example of how we keep our powers under constant review is our response this month to the Law Reform Commission's issues paper on regulatory enforcement and corporate offences.</p><p> I will turn to the issue of redress and compensation payments.  I stress an important message for customers affected.  The key to the examination framework is that it has been designed to ensure affected customers will have extra options if they believe the redress and compensation offered by their lender are insufficient.  They can accept the redress and compensation offered and still make an appeal.  They can cash the cheque safe in the knowledge that what they have, they will hold.  Redress and compensation offers cannot be reduced in the event that a customer makes an appeal.</p><p> Lenders have been required to establish independent appeals panels, specifically to deal with customers who are not satisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation offers they have received from lenders.  Together with redress and compensation, affected customers will receive a separate payment which they can use to pay for independent advice on the adequacy of their lender's offer.  In line with the State's overall consumer protection framework, all other recourse options remain open to customers such as the Financial Services Ombudsman who will deal independently with their concerns or the courts.</p><p> The tracker mortgage scandal is unprecedented in its scale and, naturally, has required an unprecedented regulatory response.  Our pursuit of lenders continues to ensure they will include all affected customers and discharge their responsibilities under the framework.  This will continue to involve intrusive supervisory scrutiny, which means that we will continue to review, challenge and verify the work undertaken by lenders and complete our own multi-faceted inspection programme.  In parallel, our enforcement investigations will continue.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge there has been progress in the examination, which is to be welcomed.  The role of the Central Bank in that regard should be acknowledged and I am happy to do so.  </p> <p>  There are some new numbers in Professor Lane's presentation.  I have been trying to work my way through them and perhaps he might help me to summarise them.  In the update issued in December, if we exclude the 7,100 customers in the pre-examination period, the Central Bank had identified a total of 26,600 customers who were included in the examination.  At that stage 12,900 had received redress and compensation.  By my calculation, that figure has increased by 600 to 13,500 customers.  Is that correct?  Is it broadly correct to state approximately 13,000 of the 26,600 customers remain to be paid redress and compensation?</p></speech>

What we have said is that there are really two groups.  There is the group of approximately 13,000 customers whom we identified before October.  With one exception, their cases will conclude by the end of March.  Every week the number is moving closer towards zero.  With regard to the extra 13,000 customers between October and December, some cases are moving along quite quickly, while in others we think a lot will be done in these couple of months but it will all be done by June.  Essentially, there are two groups.</p></speech>

They include approximately one quarter of the initial group, or approximately 3,400 of the first 13,000 customers.</p><p>They are still awaiting redress and compensation, even though many of them were identified quite some time ago, over the course of 2016 and 2017.  They are still waiting to get their money back. </p></speech>

We know that some lenders have systems issues and so on.  In the grand scheme of things we do not find that acceptable but it is the short-term reality.</p> <p>  As I say, with the exception of one lender, the balance of that initial 13,000 cases will be concluded by the end of March.  I am aware that every day counts here.  It would be great if everyone could move more quickly but we are keeping a very close eye on this.  It is essential that these payments are made as quickly as possible.  Many lenders have nearly completed the programme.  In other cases, we know where they are going with the matter. </p></speech>

We have now concluded that all of the groups of customers who we believe should be in the scheme have been brought in.  It remains for the Central Bank to follow up in respect of implementation and check that each case that should be in is in.  We are keeping a very close eye and carrying out active, intrusive inspections to make sure that the follow-up occurs.  In respect of the pinpointing, all of the groups we think should be in are in.

Many people who are watching and who have observed this scandal in recent months want to know if there ultimately will be any individual accountability.  If I had to put my hand on my heart and answer that question, I would have to say I do not think so.</p> <p>  Previously, the Central Bank concluded an enforcement investigation in respect of Springboard Mortgages Limited.  Under its enforcement powers, the Central Bank issued that company with the largest fine in the history of the State, a sum of &euro;4.5 million.  A relatively small cohort of people were affected, with 222 people overcharged an average of &euro;19,000.  The quantum ranged between &euro;100 and &euro;68,000.  Springboard ended up repaying slightly less than &euro;6 million to those customers. </p> <p>  Springboard Mortgages Limited was the first institution that had come all the way through the process.  Apart from the issuance of a fine, what happened at the level of individual accountability?</p></speech>

As director general for financial conduct, the pursuit of enforcement actions falls under her direction.  Individual accountability has been a recurring theme both in our previous appearance before the committee and in its interactions with others.  We operate within the existing legal framework whereby the threshold for establishing individual accountability is different than that for institutional accountability.  I will be crystal clear in saying that our forensic examiners have an open mind.  We look at everything and we do not rule anything out.  Deputy McGrath has stated a prediction of what he thinks is going to happen.</p></speech>

I do not want to predict what will happen.  We keep an open mind.  We know what is possible in regard to individual accountability.  Ms Rowland can elaborate on how we go about the evaluation of individual accountability.  I remind the committee that while we have said we have a lead role in this, it is also the responsibility of the senior management of the banks.  They have individual responsibility to report to us and to the Garda if they see direct evidence of violations of the regulatory code or the criminal law.  There is a reporting burden on individuals in the banks.  We have just issued letters to remind them of this.  They have been instructed to write back to us, confirming they are aware that this is their responsibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#F01900"><p>On the question of outcomes in the enforcement case in Springboard Mortgages Limited, I will volunteer that I was the director of enforcement at the time that we brought and concluded that case.  The case was brought under the administrative sanction powers the Central Bank has, whereby we are enabled to bring a case against a person concerned in the management of the regulated entity, where there is evidence to demonstrate that he or she participated in the breach.  The Central Bank of Ireland takes the view that it is right to bring individual responsibility and culpability cases as part of the enforcement procedure.  However, it can only do so when it has sufficient evidence in a case to sustain that line.  Where it does not have sufficient evidence it cannot conclude that.</p> <p>  The Central Bank also takes the view, I think quite rightly, that it is not desirable to go after juniors in a case.  There is often a lot of paperwork which is evidence as to who executed a mere task, if I can put it that way.  However, that might not be the senior responsible directing mind.  I make this as a general observation based on my experience in enforcement cases.  I have worked not just in the Central Bank, but in criminal prosecution work in the United Kingdom and in regulatory agencies.  It is often easy to find evidence against someone proximate to the issue but that does not get to the directing mind.  It does not get to the senior people who are actually responsible and culpable.  One needs evidence to link them to the actions of which one is complaining.</p><p>The evidential link is more obvious and easier to make when it is in respect to the entity because it is obviously on the watch of the entity that the breach occurred.  In the particular case that Deputy Michael McGrath speaks of, no individual was held culpable because there was not sufficient evidence to do so.  The Central Bank has four enforcement cases open.  The Deputy may have heard the representatives of the Central Bank during our previous updates and he definitely heard there were two cases open, but now there are four cases open.  Part of the investigations is to look at the roles at corporate level and then at the responsibility levels of individuals from two perspectives.  One is the administrative sanctions procedure, which is persons in management participating in the breach under scrutiny and of course from a fitness and probity perspective.  The other part of the regulatory framework is that senior officeholders in regulated entities - we call them pre-approval control functions - must have permission to take up those offices from the Central Bank of Ireland.  They must be capable, competent and have the requisite integrity to discharge their function.  It was in reference to that the Governor referred to the letters being written to the senior responsible role holders in the lenders reminding them that in those roles, they have reporting obligations.  In cases where they suspect breaches, it is very important that they are held to account with respect to that.  All of that behaviour will be scrutinised in a forensic way with respect to the individual evidence available in each and every case.  Where there is demonstrable evidence that senior responsible role holders were responsible and participated in either breaches of the regulatory requirements or were in dereliction of their duty and the requirements with respect to fitness and probity, those matters will be pursued on an evidence basis.  We are firmly committed to the ideology that it is right to hold individuals to account.  The work in taking the Irish Nationwide Building Society cases through the courts and through the inquiries demonstrates that we are committed to that.  </p></speech>

I refer to the overall cost in this regard.  The Governor stated the combined provisions made by the lenders runs to &euro;900 million, whereby some &euro;600 million is the amount of money being paid in redress and compensation and the associated costs are running at &euro;300 million.

Let me reassure the Deputy that all the costs will be paid by the banking system.

The banks will be paying the costs of the operations.</p></speech>

My understanding is that this is a cohort of customers who were never on a tracker rate but were on a fixed rate of interest for a period and under their mortgage contract, at the end of the fixed rate period they were entitled to go on to a tracker rate at the prevailing rate, which is the term that was used in the mortgage contract.  When they came off the fixed rate, however, they were not offered such a tracker rate because the trackers no longer existed or were not being offered by the bank at that time.  Nonetheless their mortgage contract entitled them to a tracker rate at the prevailing rate.  A tracker, as we all know here, is the ECB rate plus a margin.  The margin remains fixed.  The ECB varies in line with the ECB base rate.  Will Professor Lane talk us through that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#G01100"><p>I think it is important to be clear about this.  Those contracts specified that when one rolled off the fixed rate, the mortgage holder was entitled to a tracker loan at the prevailing rate.  They were not offered a tracker mortgage.  That is why they are receiving this flat rate compensation because the option of the tracker was not offered.  This is why they are included and they are receiving a payment because they should have received the offer of a tracker and they did not.  The second point is - and we have looked at the issue very closely because we appreciate there are many people who are very concerned about this and we are aware of different interpretations of what "prevailing" might mean to different people.  Ms Rowland might wish to add to my remarks, having been to the front of concluding an agreement with the banks.  There are all sorts of tracker contracts out there.  Deputy McGrath mentioned the fact there is a fixed margin.  That is not the case for all tracker mortgages.  The margin in some of the tracker mortgages could be linked to the cost of funding to the banks.  The trackers were not offered, when they should have been offered and then the question is, at what rate would the bank have offered a tracker under these contracts at that time, if they had made the offer?  This is where the calculation the Deputy is seeing is that they are being offered trackers at more than 3% because that reflected the cost of funds to the banks after they shot up after the crisis.  By the autumn of 2008, if the bank were to offer tracker mortgages at the prevailing rates, they would have offered trackers at significantly higher rates.  The point is that these were not trackers that promised a fixed margin over ECB.  We went through this in great detail because we were always looking to make sure that from a consumer's perspective we had checked every angle, looked under every corner of this.  When we looked through this with our experts, the conclusion was that was what would have happened if they had been offered a tracker.  It would have been an expensive tracker.  These were not fixed margin over ECB.  These were trackers where the margin could vary.  This is why we have ended up in this situation.  I will make one more point and then I am sure Ms Rowland can add to this.  The fact that they are in the examination, are being contacted by the banks and are receiving this offer means that the independent appeals mechanism is open to them.  If they believe that this is not adequate, they have the full access to the independent appeals mechanism to challenge it if they believe this is not sufficient or appropriate.  As with all mortgage holders, the ombudsman and the courts remain open.  It is essential that we put them into the examination because they are receiving this payment because they should have been offered a tracker and they were not.  In addition, if they believe this is not appropriate to their individual case, they can bring forward an appeal.  Ms. Rowland led this work and maybe she will elaborate.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath asked in particular about the AIB case.  AIB will be in a better position to tell the Deputy more than I can from its point of view, but there was contractual right to have a tracker offered and that did not in fact happen.  We call that a breach of contract.  The compensatory payment is for that.  Then a second question arises, which is the actual tracker rate.  It may be said that some contracts are watertight on these issues because they actually have in print in the contract what that rate is to be and then it is beyond discussion or dispute.  They are often called a price promise tracker, where one has a number in the contract document and there is very little argument about those types of contracts.  When one has a phrase such as "the then prevailing rate" in a contract, there is a question of interpretation from different points of view.  Whether one agrees or not, there is a question of interpretation about what that means.  In this instance, not all contracts are as watertight as other contracts but it is very important for customers who are included in the scheme.  By being included in the scheme, it means that all the benefits of the framework are available to be used in the scheme.</p><p>There may be individual circumstances or information people have had in their own sales experience that may not exactly be systemic or it may be peculiar to their own experience when they are entering into the contract that they can bring forward to the appeals mechanism.  In fact, the framework was designed precisely to deal with issues where people may have particular information that they can bring forward.  That certainly is the case here.  These are inside the benefit of the framework and they can bring forward any information that they wish to about that prevailing rate issue if they have extra information.</p></speech>

From our work, these are now receiving a payment for contract violation and they are in the examination so they have the right to bring forward appeals.  I refer to someone in a situation with a prevailing rate tracker.  From a systemic point of view, we have looked at it and said that these prevailing rate trackers did not have the fixed margin promise.  If a hypothetical tracker was calculated based on market funding and so on, they would have been expensive trackers if they had been offered in autumn 2008.  However, by virtue of being inside the examination, it depends on what an individual was told by his or her bank manager and it depends on what documentation he or she may have received.  I am not going to rule out that an individual with a prevailing rate tracker may be able to show to the independent appeals mechanism that in his or her case he or she might have been assured that this meant a cheap tracker or something else.  This is the balance that is being struck.  In general, this type of tracker did not promise it was going to be at some low fixed margin.  Some trackers are expensive.  However, because they are in the examination, the individual's circumstances, and his or her individual understanding, can be explored within the appeals mechanism.</p></speech>

I want to clarify a couple of housekeeping issues.  Where precisely do we stand at the moment?  I refer to the Central Bank's report that came in at the end of the year, where 26,600 customers were identified, on top of the 7,100 who were separate.  That is a total of 33,700.  Of those 26,600 customers, 13,000 of those were identified up to October.  That figure virtually doubled within two months.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

We knew that these groups existed.  We knew the order of the numbers of people who had not been included in October.  That was why we signalled back in October that there were groups of customers that we thought should be included but were not.  Essentially, the expansion in the number is the banks ultimately accepting our position that these extra 13,000 people should be in and they were brought in.  We have heard from people such as Padraic Kissane and others.  It is very much in line with the ballpark figure.  Where we are now is in line with where we expected to get to and where other experts on trackers-----</p></speech>

All people in such a category should be receiving redress and compensation.  We need to check if the banks have counted correctly.  Have they forgotten a few files and so on?

We have had a long-standing concern.  People like Padraic Kissane, and others, and many people here, would be aware that these have been well-known cases for a long time.

Perhaps Ms Helena Mitchell will confirm that.  Ulster Bank is following the timeline that has been agreed.  It is not the case that they have not paid out anyone.  They had a target for what to do in 2017.  There is a target for how quickly to complete that.  The reality is - it is something we find quite disconcerting - the ability of Ulster Bank in terms of its systems, files and how it operates, is more constrained by the other institutions.</p></speech>

I wish it was different.  Everybody is deadlined to the maximum of their ability to deliver.  I cannot make them deliver faster than they or their systems are capable of.  What I can do is make sure everybody is timelined.  They are on weekly reporting and I have to be happy with their compliance.  We have made our presence felt with the lenders.  Ulster Bank's published reporting was that 1,000 customers were to be redressed and compensated before Christmas.  That was in its public statement that it published in October.  It did it in three tranche commitments.  The second one is either 1,000 in quarter one and then maybe 1,500 by June.  I might have those numbers reversed.  It is in three tranches.  There is no part of me or the team that has behaved in a way that allows people to pay late when they can pay much faster and much earlier.</p></speech>

Every lender has been pressed to get the money paid over to the customers.  If I could explain with respect to the original 13,000, I was really conscious that those people, when we came before the committee in October, had been identified as affected and they had not received their money.  That has gone on long enough.  It is bad enough and it is not acceptable.  One can see the fruits of the labour.  It is not good enough but we have put huge effort into ensuring payment gets made over to the people that should receive this money as quickly as possible.  Some of the schemes are near finalisation but others are laggards.  That is a feature of their own inability to pay faster but everybody has a deadline.  The vast majority of those originally identified 13,000 group should be in receipt of their money by March.  Week by week, one will see the cash amounts going up.  Even since we reported in mid-December, the figures we have given the committee today are as of the end of December and nearly &euro;20 million more has gone out.  It is going out.</p></speech>

The Governor and Ms Rowland have informed us there are 13,036 customers still to be redressed and compensated.  In the interest of transparency, I find it difficult to see what the issue is with the Central Bank not disclosing and making people aware of which institutions have yet to redress and compensate.  This came out of a vacuum of secrecy from the banks.  The banks are in no position to retain secrecy on this issue.  I find it difficult to understand the basis of the logic the Central Bank is using for not disclosing which institutions have yet to compensate and how many people they have yet to compensate.</p></speech>

As an institution, in the world of central banking and regulators, we are internationally recognised for our commitment to be as transparent as is feasible in terms of what we can do.  In terms of transparency, we say it is quite unusual that in the middle of an investigation we are trying to put out real time updates every few months.  It is a commitment to transparency.  More generally, in terms of how we work we try to put out as much as we can.  We disclose as much as we can.  We hit a fundamental limit, which is the laws under which we operate.  The legal system here has that law and it is a global principle.  The basis for obtaining a lot of confidential information from banks remains with us.  This is why it is very important that we have an Oireachtas committee that is committed to actively engaging with individual banks.</p></speech>

I know there has been a lot of concern about the amount of compensation.  From the word "Go" we have made sure that the banks' schemes had some core principles, one of which is that the amount of compensation increases for the more costly and more damaging cases.  At the extreme end, in loss-of-home situations, the compensation will be greatest.  We talk about 15% in the aggregate because we have a universal approach.  The examination also includes minor cases where customers may have lost &euro;100 through some calculation error, for example.  The fraction of compensation for smaller cases is obviously smaller than 15% but in more severe cases, it is larger.</p> <p>  I must heavily emphasise that the appeals mechanism is operational now and there will be a lot more appeals.  The appeals mechanism is there for people whose individual circumstances were particularly difficult.  Members know from hearings at this committee and from private engagements with constituents that there are many difficult cases where the initial offer will not be the final payment.  It is only through the independent appeals mechanism that the details of each individual family's situation can be factored into the final appropriate amount of compensation.  It is important to emphasise that the 15% aggregate number does not mean that this figure applies to all cases.  There is a lot of variation because we have insisted that compensation levels go up in line with the scale of the harm.  The fraction of compensation is going to be a lot bigger in serious cases.  Another way of saying this is that for a minor issue, the law says that we can only insist on redress.  The principle of the law on redress essentially is that there has been some financial cost but that is it.  Compensation is there to reflect all of the other emotional and family costs that have been borne.  We have set it up so that the amount of compensation goes up in line with the degree of harm.  The independent appeals mechanism is the way to make sure that the full circumstances of each individual case where there was serious harm can be reflected in the final payment.</p></speech>

There are extensive requirements in the consumer protection code that are already in place about suitability and knowing the client.  There is also lot of good work being done on disclosure of information to customers so that they can make an informed choice based on the information available to them.</p> <p>  Recently we have been doing work on switching and on transparency for mortgages so that all of the relevant information to help customers to make a good choice is provided.  That is all very well and good as long as it is actually happening in fact and that is our clear expectation.  My trust has been somewhat tested in the tracker mortgage debacle because I am firmly in the space of that post-crisis regulatory mindset of assertive, risk-based supervision which is "trust but verify".  We have got to make sure that is translating into the customer experience and in the main, it is.  While I cannot absolutely guarantee that the system is delivering perfectly I certainly know that there are really strong framework protections in place that should make it so.  There are really good requirements developed around lenders assessing products as being suitable and affordable and being transparent about that information so that customers can make a good choice.</p></speech>

In any individual situation with a bank official or a bank, there may be particular problems which the ombudsman can handle.  Our job as the systemic regulator is to work on the framework and to make sure that banks show us their documentation and show us the process by which they interact with customers.  Our regulations kick in at the level of process, documentation and systems.  If any individual is in the unfortunate situation of having been mishandled by an individual lender, that is an issue for the ombudsman.</p> <p>  I would also like to heavily emphasise that post-crisis, the consumer protection framework also includes a consumer information role for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  I would bet that not a lot of people know that the CCPC has a very good mortgage calculator on its website.  A public institution, namely, the CCPC, is there to help people to work out the pros and cons of different types of mortgages.  The information function used to be done by the Central Bank but now the CCPC does it.  The material on its website is very nice.  In the same vein, the HIA has a nice comparison tool for health insurance.</p></speech>

That represents a degree of consumer choice and is a sign of a healthy system or, at least, a healthier one.  Certainly, a couple of years ago one would have seen less choice in the system from a mortgage perspective.  That element has improved.  There are a number of different products out there, some of which add complexity to the consumer decision that is being made.  We are very much pushing the lenders to make sure that there is very clear transparency around the costs associated with those products so that they can be understood but we have a little bit further to go on that.</p></speech>

Competition was pretty intense in the mortgage market in the mid-2000s.  There is a lot of volatility in this area.  A bank might offer a product for a while and might then become overexposed in respect of a certain type of loan and pull back, at which point other lenders come in.  Those are the market dynamics of the credit market.  One cannot say, therefore, that all lenders can have a fixed set of products that they offer at all times.</p></speech>

This trend would have been prevalent in the system before the crisis.  What we are seeing - Ms Rowland can add to this - is that there was a lack of transparency.  There was ambiguity in the contracts that were being used at the time.  That has led to many of these issues.  We have pushed, through consumer protection work since 2008, to ensure better transparency and less contract ambiguity in order that what is being taken on by the consumer is clearer.</p></speech>

We are examining the handling of those who had a tracker mortgage or the right to one, not the wider group.  It is an interesting question to think about.  One must consider how regulators' work evolves.  What we are saying now is that while we are all the time trying to reinforce the code in terms of transparency and so on, we now have what is called a consumer risk-assessment model whereby, essentially to cover what the Senator is talking about, our plan is to be much more pre-emptive and in the moment in terms of what is going on.  It is a matter of determining whether any new product makes sense and the hidden problems in any new product that might be offered.  The goal is to be a lot more pre-emptive and catch problems before they materialise.  Perhaps Ms Rowland can reinforce that.</p></speech>

The examination is confined to the 2 million accounts.  That is where the starting point was.  I refer to where the customer might have started on a tracker product or had an interest rate applied to it at any stage, or had an entitlement, or may have had an expectation of an entitlement, through the process they engaged in.  It does not go as far as to cover what the Senator referred to.  I do not believe it could.  I do not know whether Mr. Sibley wants to add to that.</p></speech>

Who knows what the circumstances will be in three to four years?  Interest rates might go up, in which case it will benefit the person who has chosen the fixed rate as opposed to the person with the variable rate.  Alternatively, interest rates might go down.  There is a degree of choice in that regard.  As long as it is informed and transparent, it is not an issue.</p></speech>

The biggest problem was that ECB interest rates fluctuated.  When the ECB rate went up in 2006 or 2007, people with tracker mortgages were tempted to move to a fixed rate.  The problem was that they did so in the belief that they would go back to the tracker mortgage or-----</p></speech>

Let me refer to the Page <i>v.</i>PTSB case in Roscommon a few months ago.  Are our guests aware of it?  The customer was not offered the choice of the tracker when the fixed rate finished.  The fixed rate had been 5.99%.  PTSB settled out of court.  In this regard, consider the cases of the 4,000 AIB customers who were given a fixed amount of compensation.  The amount that was offered first by PTSB was much less than what the court ruled.  I believe it was the first court case on this.  I expect there to be others.  Does Professor Lane expect many of those who were just offered the fixed amount of compensation to take cases in the courts?</p></speech>

Of course, a court case can fully consider the entire nature of the interaction between the customer and the bank.  The customer might have been told something verbally.  There will be a range of documents to be considered.  At systemic level, the issue of prevailing rates arises.  On the basis of our work and the advice we received, we concluded the prevailing rate, at a systemic level, is the rate applying when a customer goes off the tracker.  The conundrum concerned what should have been offered when tracker mortgages were no longer being offered.  We are saying the customers in question should have been offered a tracker mortgage.  That is why there is compensation.  I am referring to cases where the contract did not refer to a fixed-margin tracker but to whatever the bank decided was the tracker at that time.  In terms of the calculation of what the tracker amount would have been in autumn 2008, when bank funding was through the roof, it would have been an expensive tracker.</p> <p>  Let me return to the core of how we are doing this.  Nothing we do here and no offer of compensation or redress inhibits any individual in any way .  First of all, we are saying that, in the examination, the customers have the option to test the appeals mechanism.  Second, of course, everyone has the right to go to court if he or she feels the contract was violated.</p></speech>

To comment on the case, an individual can go to court if he or she chooses.  The tracker mortgage examination offered extra choice, no more than that.  It is not compulsory.  If people go through the appeals mechanism for the serious cases, it might be interesting to see what kinds of awards are granted and whether they are better or worse than those of the court.  That remains to be seen.</p><p>If it did work it would be less stressful and quicker for people to go that route.  As a lawyer, I know, and I am sure committee members will believe this to be true, that people will go to court to test the boundary of anything when its new to see where the parameters are.  That is a normal feature of every system.  I am not saying that is good or bad but it is a truth.  I listened in to the committee's discussion yesterday on class actions.  It is a national level issue.  I can see how it could afford benefits to people to club together.  I say that not strictly speaking as part of my role but based on my having spent a decade building up supervision in the aftermath of the crisis, doing a lot of the work with my legal colleagues in terms of handing over disclosures to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for prosecutions etc., and having done a lot of unedifying but important work to try to support the infrastructure of our State in the public interest.  Options are always good for people in general terms.  One could not be against that.  It is for others to consider the policy implications of that in greater detail than us, I would suggest.</p></speech>

These have been structured in a particular way.  The scale of the job that we are doing is very unusual.  It is of a vast scale and there is a particular approach that needs to be taken to get this type of work done and done accurately.  This involves pressing into service other people's resources.  I referred earlier to a core part of supervision being trust but one also needs to verify.  Everything must be checked by authorised officers going on site, acquiring files, checking each page, and verifying them.  They then also check the accounts the banks say were not affected to ensure that is the case.  One tests the perimeter of all decisions.  We have only done announced, on-notice, on-site inspections.  I recall us having this conversation at a previous meeting.  I will try to clarify why we do announced inspections.  It is obvious to us as regulators and to any other regulatory agency that there is a clear and useful role for unannounced inspections.  These are typically carried out when it is feared there will be flight, destruction of documents, obstruction and so on.  We would be as cognisant of this as any other regulatory agency.  However, there are times when one cannot get access to files unless all of the work is lined up.  If I want to examine 100 particular files and I need to get my work done in a scheduled way, I need the right people made available to me to ask questions and take notes and I have to inform the entity of the proposed inspection to ensure that the access permissions I need to particular areas and the paperwork ordered are made available to me.  I have to ensure the people of whom I need to ask questions are made available to me so that I can be effective on site.</p> <p>  We do a combination of on-site, off-site and desktop inspections.  If we needed to do unannounced inspections, we would do those too.  We always take cognisance of the situation in which we find ourselves.  Some people answer questions better than others and one might think some people are being deliberately unhelpful, obtuse and so on, but that is different from fear of destruction of documents.  A feature of our work is on notice and it is appropriately done.  If that was not appropriate, we would do something else.</p></speech>

This may happen because the files are not available or cannot be found.  If we have concerns that there was deliberate obstruction or obfuscation of documents in a malicious way, we take that very seriously.  Such action would be obstructing the regulator in the execution of its duty.  This is one of the actions we would reserve for criminal prosecution.  It would be so serious it would need the opprobrium of the full regulatory system to come down on top of it.  That would not be acceptable.  We are not in that space at the moment.  For example, the enforcement team is very structured in its approach.  It takes a robust approach to document acquisition.  If those issues arose, the team would be very adept and adroit at dealing with them, but that has not arisen.</p></speech>

I also welcome the work done by the bank over recent months.  The witnesses will be well aware that I have been very critical of the Central Bank's role in this issue, not only during Professor Lane's tenure but dating back to 2010.  I do not intend to rehash all of that now but I do think it is important to acknowledge the robustness of the Central Bank's challenges of the banks in recent times.  As pointed out by Deputy Michael McGrath, the language used in the statement is also helpful.  The current communications strategy is welcome because it restores faith in the Central Bank for the people affected, many of whom for a long time felt there was nobody on their side.</p> <p>  Am I correct that there is no cohort of individuals now that are in dispute between the Central Bank and the institutions?</p></speech>

I reiterate, this issue will present again and again until such times as individual bankers are held accountable for their actions.  This point was made by a predecessor of Professor Lane on leaving his role in the Central Bank, and I agree with it.</p><p>They nearly got away with this.  The figure is &euro;900 million at the minute but if they got away with, it could have been more than &euro;1.5 billion because of the duration they would have been overcharging these customers.  With regard to the sanctions that can be imposed, the law was amended in 2013 to provide for increased sanctions from &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million for institutions, and from &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million for individuals, as well as 10% of turnover.  The fine for Springboard Mortgages was &euro;4.5 million.  The Central Bank has to deal with an issue regarding when the tracker mortgage breaches took place.  Were they pre-2013 or were some of them post-2013?  Large banks such as Bank of Ireland and AIB had significantly more cases compared with Springboard.  Is the maximum fine they could be subject to &euro;10 million?  What are the difficulties in this regard?  How is the sanction of 10% of turnover applied?</p></speech>

However, the scale of the harm, of course, is so high and this maps into where the calculation is.  Let me turn to Ms Rowland.  We have worked out a way we calculate the fine in respect of the list of reasons we bring into it, but Ms Rowland is best placed to go into it.</p></speech>

Post-2013 and pre-2013 would be bifurcated according to the sanctions in place in law at the time, but it also depends on the breaches being pursued in a particular case.  We will look at the scenario in bank X and extract the relevant facts that match the breaches.  The breaches are not all the same in each case.  We will consider a suite of relevant breaches and then we will look at the facts and match those two together.  The duration of the breaches will vary in each case.  They might have broad similarity.  An answer cannot be given without cutting the breaches according to the evidence in the case.  The Deputy will appreciate that breaches may have stopped before 2013 or they may not.  There will be a series of cut-offs for different breaches depending on the facts that we can evidence.  I do not know, therefore, what sanctions will be capable of applying until I know what the breaches are and their duration, but if they predate 2013, the more limited set of sanctions will apply, and if they post-date it, then it is at large to the higher sanction levels, which is the &euro;10 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is higher.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question related to the policy considerations that would inform the 10% of turnover application, and I do not have a definitive answer for him.  That would be a matter of careful sentencing law consideration, which would inform the application of that.  It is certainly something in terms of our membership of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and as part of our prudential regulatory considerations, we work on these matters because that is not a matter that would be taken lightly.  Careful, legal sentencing policy considerations would go into the application of that.</p></speech>

The banks will appear before us again and they have given us answers to prewritten answers.  Ulster Bank is an outlier.  The progress is absolutely appalling in comparison with PTSB and so on.  It is just not acceptable.  When we questioned the Minister as to why Ulster Bank is being given until the end of June to make sure all its customers have been paid back and compensated, he said it was the result of the systems the bank operates.  Is the Central Bank of the view that the bank does not have the capacity to increase the level of compensation and redress beyond what it has identified because of the systems it operates?</p></speech>

We have pushed this as hard as we think we can to maximise the pace at which Ulster Bank. and all other lenders for that matter, pay out.  This is where we are.  There is a phased approach for Ulster Bank because it seems the way its internal files and computer files are such that they create this mechanical, operational constraint.  We wish it was different.  We have pushed them to what we think is a feasible pace.  When Ulster Bank is before the committee, this can be pursued because it does read odd.  It is something to ask about.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank had the systems error that prevented its customers for accessing their accounts and now we are hearing that its systems are incapable of paying back money that the bank wrongly took from its customers.  It is concerning that one of our larger banks does not have appropriate systems months later that can pay back its customers.  It can debit its customer accounts if it wants to but it cannot pay back the money in an appropriate timeframe.  It is not acceptable and we will pursue that with the bank.</p> <p>  I am disappointed by what Professor Lane has said about the prevailing rate issue.  It will be a huge disappointment for hundreds, if not thousands, of customers who are arguing that the bank has put them back on the wrong rate.  Other members and I have asked the Central Bank to examine this and Professor Lane has informed the committee that he is satisfied that the prevailing rate the banks are putting their customers are on is correct.</p></speech>

Throughout our attitude has been, and we have said previously, that, number one, we want to make sure all customers that have been harmed are redressed and compensated and, number two, we want to take an expansive definition so that it is not just an issue of a narrow contractual interpretation.  We want to ensure a broad range of documentation, a reasonable interpretation and so on.  Even with that lens, we put a great deal of effort and expertise into this, but the conclusion was that these contracts are, indeed, different from the fixed margin tracker products and our analysis of them was that, at a systemic level, they would be priced by the banks at the prevailing funding conditions when the fixed rates expired.  What happened at the end of 2008 is they just withdrew trackers.  We do not think that was appropriate and that is why there is this conversation saying that even if they were going to offer a customer an expensive tracker, they should have offered it.  However, the prevailing rate trackers, given the conditions at the time, would have been expensively priced.  That is what we think.</p></speech>

It is crucial that people know what the rate is or what the Central Bank and the bank believe.</p> <p>  I will give an example and I will ask the Governor to answer that question.  I want to pick up on something Mr. Sibley said.  He talked about the ambiguity in the contracts.  There is no doubt that there is ambiguity in the contracts and they should never have been allowed to be authorised.  The Central Bank at that time should not have allowed this.  I will give an example of a contract and a letter of offer with a particular bank.  The letter of offer states clearly that it is a tracker rate of the ECB interest rate plus a maximum of 1.1 percentage points.  It continues to offer a three-year fixed-term contract.  The individual took out the tracker mortgage which was on the letter of offer at 1.1 percentage points above the ECB interest rate and fixed it for three years.  However, the contract contained the following terminology, "a tracker mortgage loan and the rate applicable will be the rate appropriate to the balance outstanding at the time of expiry of the fixed-rate period".  According to the bank that means what was stated in the letter of offer has no standing whatsoever and that it will apply whatever it wants after the expiry of the fixed-rate period.</p> <p>  I am making a point about ambiguity in contract.  Is there not an issue in contract law?  If there is ambiguity in a contract, it has to come down in favour of the customer in this case.  If somebody has a letter of offer which stated at the top a tracker mortgage of the ECB interest rate plus 1.1 percentage points and allowing them to fix it for three years and then finds this terminology in the terms and conditions of the contract that they signed, it is hard for anybody to understand what that really means.  Should the Central Bank not come out and state that that interpretation is not right and that the letter of offer should stand in these cases?  This is one of the issues under examination.  This is one of the issues the Central Bank has dealt with.  I am sure this customer would be disappointed at today's comments from the Central Bank that it believes that what the bank is doing on the interest rate is correct.</p></speech>

These different types of legal arguments have been factored in, which in the case of ambiguity is deferring to what is in the consumer interest and so on.  If the individual in her interaction with a bank, broker or whatever was guided differently and if there was not sufficient explanation, then that remains an individual case which can be tested through the appeals mechanism or the ombudsman or the courts.  However, at a systemic level the fact that these contracts indicated that at conclusion they would revert to the tracker rate being offered by the banks at that time, that we do see as different from ones where the fixed-----</p></speech>

Basically the banks would have a model showing how they would have priced it given funding costs and so on.  We have checked that model.  It is the banks' model but we have checked it.  I ask Mr. Sibley to expand on that.</p></speech>

They have provided us with details as to how they would have calculated in that period.  We have run our own separate independent assessment to check reasonableness.  It is not saying we are coming up with a precise number that this should have been the prevailing rate at that time, but it is to check that the banks' model has come up with a reasonable number.  Does Ms Rowland want to come in?</p></speech>

I do not want any view that we have taken a decision in support of the banks and against customers on prevailing rates.  It is not to be weighted to the benefit of the banks.  It is that we did not find enough for us to tip us into systemic action, but that is not a black mark against a consumer who has been put inside the redress and compensation scheme being able to bring their own case forward to say, "This is my prevailing rate.  I don't agree with that for my personal reasons and I want you to hear what I have to say."  We did not feel able to tip into action to change the scenario, but that is from a systemic perspective, which does not interfere with breach of contract or anything else that a customer would quite rightly want to say on their own part, for example, what he or she believed from his or her customer experience when he or she purchased the product from the bank.  We would be a stranger to that and we would not have anything to say, nor could we.</p> <p>  People have every right to bring forward their own information about their view of the correct prevailing rate from their perspective, which may not have a systemic consideration for us, but because they are inside the redress and compensation scheme, they are entitled to do that, and where they feel it is right to do so, they should do that.  However, it is from our perspective.  We looked at this from systemic action and we did not feel able to tip the balance into interfering with that decision.  However, it is not against the consumer, nor is it for the lenders.</p></speech>

I want to ask one question before I go.  We have been informed by the Central Bank that a number of whistleblowers have come forward making protected disclosures.  Some of them relate to the tracker mortgage issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#O01100"><p>Sorry, I have to be really clear.  In fact, we did not identify any whistleblower in respect of the tracker mortgage issue.  We were very careful not to do so.  It would be wrong if we did.  There has been trouble in the UK with that kind of thing.  Protected disclosures mean that the anonymity of the whistleblowers is very important so that people feel able to come forward.</p> <p>  What we did was to give information that generally we are seeing an increase in protected disclosures, which is to be welcomed in the Central Bank.  They have gone up from 50 in the previous year to 93 in 2017.  What we identified was that broadly in the sectors where the lenders operate across a whole range of issues - we did not identify any issue - we had 28 protected disclosures.  However, they have not been specifically linked to any particular job such as tracker mortgages or otherwise because from our consideration, that might inhibit staff or others from making protected disclosures if they were at all concerned that we would bring forward information that may tend to identify them.</p></speech>

Maybe my recollection was not as sharp on a document I have read.  Regardless of that, I have previously appealed for whistleblowers to come forward.  I again appeal publicly for whistleblowers to come forward to the Central Bank with information.</p> <p>  Would it be appropriate to consider a whistleblower reward programme such as exists in the United States where whistleblowers can, upon conviction or prosecution of individuals or institutions, receive up to 10% or up to 30% of the fine or moneys recouped?  Would something like that support the work of the Central Bank in being able to deal with some of the financial institutions that may be breaching regulations?  It is very difficult for the Central Bank to be over everything that is happening within the institutions.</p></speech>

They would need to be very carefully considered in the context of the legal framework within a specific jurisdiction.  The concerns might be taint or a perception that the wrong motivation for payment would undermine the credibility of any witness's evidence.  That is just something that has to be considered carefully in the context of the legal jurisdiction within which one operates and how evidence is viewed in court in that context.  It is not something that should be looked at in isolation.  It is because of how it would be treated and it should only be put in place if it will actually improve the system.  That is the single biggest policy consideration that would need to be researched and looked at.</p></speech>

I compliment the Central Bank of Ireland on its work on this issue in recent months.  I also compliment the committee and the Chairman because both have played a hugely important role in keeping this issue to the fore.  The way ordinary members of the public have been treated by the banks during the years is disgraceful.</p> <p>  I wish to continue on the topic of prevailing tracker mortgage rates.  The delegates have provided answers on most of the issues.  Are we to understand people may have been paid &euro;1,000, &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000, as well as some legal costs, but having received that sum they can still appeal?  There are significant differences in various tracker mortgage rates.  I have received a letter from a man who was being charged an interest rate of 5.1% when the European Central Bank, ECB, rate was 0.2%.  At another point, when the ECB rate was at 0%, the tracker mortgage interest rate was 3.67%.  Is there a preferred rate the Central Bank believes should be charged?  Does it believe there is an ideal rate for the banks to charge?  However, a person can make an appeal, regardless of whether he or she has received compensation.</p></speech>

That is a very important message which bears repeating as often as possible.  We hear about people who receive an offer and fear that somehow cashing the cheque inhibits them in taking other action.  The very clever design of the scheme does not in any way inhibit them in taking further action simply because they have cashed the cheque.</p> <p>  If the scenario outlined by the Deputy falls within the definition of a tracker mortgage, it illustrates that the tracker mortgage universe includes price promise tracker mortgages, in respect of which there will always be a fixed margin above the ECB rate.  The rates can also vary over time in line with the bank's funding conditions.  The latter departs from what we colloquially understand is meant by the term "tracker".  In that case we would have to examine the individual contract.  In general, however, if someone believes his or her arrangement is not satisfactory compared to what he or she was promised and he or she can recount how his or her bank dealt with him or her, that provides material for an appeal.  The person concerned absolutely can cash whatever has been offered and still pursue the appeals mechanism.  The ombudsman and the courts are also available.</p></speech>

There are many types of contract and it is very difficult for the Central Bank to evaluate every one.</p></speech>

They vary depending on the bank involved and the time the contract was issued because the types of tracker mortgage offered changed over time.  All of this is included in the examination.  Tracker mortgages have been grouped into different categories, but we have worked through all of them to determine the appropriate treatment to provide.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that not all of them were able to pay out as quickly as others.  However, they are all working to timelines.  We prepared timelines for 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.

It is not a substitute for regulatory action and will not affect how we approach it.  I am sure it will not affect members' view from a legislative perspective.  However, it is to be welcomed.  It is, at least, a recognition of the need for the banks to do something.  I have had a number of interactions with the UK Banking Standards Board on which it is based.  That body is having a positive impact in the United Kingdom, but it is not a substitute for anything else.  There is a lot of work the banks need to do on culture.  There is a lot of work we have been doing for a little while and will continue to do.  Part of the work to be done in the next six months and beyond will address the topic of diversity at board and senior management level in banks.  An absence of diversity is a leading indicator and cause of some of the foremost cultural issues.  It is welcome that the banks at least recognise that there is work to be done, but it is not a substitute for regulatory or legislative action.</p></speech>

What we have said is it is a welcome development because of their recognition that they need to do something to improve the culture in their organisations.  The experience in the United Kingdom, on which it is modelled, is that it has had a positive impact.  It has focused not only on what is happening at board and senior management level but also on the culture within an organisation and how staff are incentivised to behave.  In that respect, it is a welcome development, but it changes nothing in our determination to ensure the culture within the institutions improves significantly and that this type of issue will not recur.</p></speech>

Any organisation should always look at itself and ask how it can improve.  We will report publicly on this issue.</p><p>We are going to report to the Minister at the end of March about the continued progress on this.  We have been mandated to undertake the culture review of the banks, which will result in a thematic report.  As part of that, we will look at the culture and behaviour of the banks and as a consequence, part of that report will be a public articulation of the risks that this presents to customers.  Another layer of that report will be to look at any recommendations for action arising out of that so that we can minimise or ensure that we address those risks.  If at that stage, we also need assistance by way of legislative improvement or reform, that is another layer of that report.  Separately, it was always envisaged by the Central Bank.  We keep saying it but it is true.  It is a seminal piece of supervisory work with respect to consumer protection and it is right that separate to this, we produce a public report at the conclusion of this drawing all of this together into one place.  We have produced a lot of public information on this matter at intervals but it was always our intention to draw it together at the conclusion of this and produce a public report.  We will do that as well at the conclusion and that will be after the culture report - perhaps at the end of the summer.  As long as we do not hit any road bumps, one would expect that to happen so there is a significant amount of reporting that we will undertake on this issue.</p></speech>

In addition to the annual report we produce on the overall activities of the Central Bank, we have added a review of our regulatory work.  That will be coming out each year so it is routine.  It is by legislation.  It has been specified that we must report on our regulatory work so we will provide the Oireachtas with public reports on this work.</p></speech>

There is a summary in the annex to my opening statement today.  A lot of action was taken between 2008 and 2015.  What is true is, to use an American phrase, "whack-a-mole" where one sees a problem here and hits it on the head and sees a problem there and hits it on the head.  What we did in 2015 was rather than do it problem by problem, we flipped it to a universal approach.  There is a continuous thread of action going back to autumn 2008 when this problem arose.  We immediately issued a public warning to the banks that if people were rolling off fixed rates, the banks had better handle that correctly.  The fact that our code and warnings that this had to be handled in a pro-consumer and transparent way were so explicit to the banks now allows us to hold them to account because they were warned and they did not do it.</p> <p>  From autumn 2008 onwards, which is when this problem arose in its most acute form, the Central Banks has continuously intervened in the tracker issue.  Of course, we can always look back and say "if only we had gone faster, if we had known more", but the Senator should be very mindful that, from 2008, the Central Bank was very acutely aware and tried to do what it could with regard to the tracker problem.  Eventually, we moved from treating it on a case-by-case basis to using a universal approach.  It is important to make clear that throughout this period, the Central Bank's consumer protection team has been working on this issue.</p></speech>

Did the Central Bank take action on the first complaint it received or the 100th or 200th?  Was it this committee that brought it to its attention?  Who brought it to its attention?  This is information the public deserves to receive.</p></speech>

We have been reporting all the time about what we are up to.  In addition, what I am saying to the Senator is that as this comes to a conclusion, we will carry out a look back.  There are different types of look back, some of which, honestly speaking, will be in the nature of internal audit, which is more typically a private report, in order for some issues that might involve private information within a bank to be dealt with.  Just as we have been reporting to the committee throughout, we will report to it at the end.  We will provide as much information as we can in the public way.</p></speech>

The Governor said that the Central Bank had been active on this since autumn 2008.  The reason I want to pick up on this is because the committee sent the Central Bank the correspondence from Deputy Jim Daly.  If the Governor read that correspondence, and I take it that he has, it is clear that the Deputy was raising the tracker mortgage issue.  He may not have understood at the time how deep the issue ran within the banks but he certainly was trying to uncover what he saw as an issue.  The banks ducked and dived their way through that correspondence.  That is absolutely clear so that means that the banks with which the Central Bank was dealing were hoodwinking it.  They were presenting information, and they knew what the Deputy was after.  He was discussing tracker mortgages.  He may have been talking about tracker mortgages in arrears but the banks were not prepared to divulge the information they knew about at the time, which, essentially, is the issue we are confronting today.</p> <p>  That leads me to Senator Burke's question about culture because the issue of culture lies within that reply from the Central Bank regarding Deputy Jim Daly's query and dating back to the autumn of 2008.  When the Central Bank investigates the banks relative to their culture, I hope it has a big mirror into which it will look because the language in the Governor's opening remarks is different.  It is stronger.  Deputy McGrath rightly underlines the phrase "you haul them in" - the Central Bank will hold individuals accountable.  It is about time the Central Bank said it.  I do not want it to get into a comfort zone here where it is pl&aacute;m&aacute;sed by Deputies McGrath or Doherty and told it is doing well.  I will not judge the Central Bank on its language.  I will judge it on the action it is prepared to take on behalf of the customers who have been robbed by the banks and whose lives have been devastated.  The Central Bank is coming some of the way and regardless of whether it was this committee or someone else who dragged it to this point, it is not there yet as a regulator in my opinion.  Let us see how it all works out.  The culture within the banks must change.  From my experience of the banks to date, I must say that this culture is as embedded as ever.  What we are seeing is not a culture change.</p><p>It is a combined effort on the part of the banks to provide the appropriate smoke-screen until they can get beyond this.  I am sorry for going on but I want to explain this to Professor Lane.  The reason I am saying this is because the Central Bank is concentrating on the tracker mortgage issue.  It is now looking at the culture.  While it is doing so, the next generation of bankers is being educated by the vulture fund managers, such as Capita and others, on how to deal with customers.  My experience, and the experience of Members of these Houses who have come to me, indicates that those fund managers or agents are enhancing that culture which makes the customer pay.  When Professor Lane refers to them improving and doing things better, they are improving at doing the customer.  That is to say, they are robbing them better.</p><p> Capita is the leader in this regard in terms of its aggressive approach, in terms of making the customer jump every time it asks and in terms of disimproving the mental health and well-being of people.  It refuses to give information and has often asked Members of these Houses to leave its offices.  I attended Capita meetings.  I have said this here before but I want to make it absolutely clear.  Capita is a regulated entity and has refused to come before this committee.  It has said directly to me or to customers in front of me that they should get the money they owe from their mothers, fathers, neighbours, friends or the credit union, as long as they give it the money.  It just wants the money.  Its attitude is shocking to such a degree that no country, parliament or society should accept it.  Professor Lane's organisation regulates Capita.</p><p> This has to do with trackers because it is all mixed up - the SMEs, the trackers and everything else.  Arising from what Senator Paddy Burke said, I want to tell Mr. Lane that culture is alive and well and Capita and others continue to educate people in it so that its life will continue beyond the smoke and mirrors which the banks are presenting.  What will Professor Lane do to ensure that Capita and others come before the Houses of the people to be held accountable?  We represent the people.  What can he do to ensure that the vulture funds adhere to the original conditions of the lender?  They are blackguarding people up and down this country.</p></speech>

I assure him that we are very aware of some of the following facts.  The nature of what happened here and in other countries post-crisis means that there is a much wider range of firms now involved in dealing with customers.  Banks have sold loans on to funds that in turn have these credit servicing funds which try to manage payments and so on.  Partly because the Oireachtas passed the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, we as the regulator have a very broad perspective.  The traditional banks are no longer the only game in town.  There is a situation where these specialist firms which specialise in debt recovery are in place.  The requirements of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears apply to the credit servicing firms.  More generally, our conduct requirements are general and they apply.  We have the framework and the awareness and we have engagement.</p> <p>  I will come back to a couple of points.  As always, if the Chairman, other representatives or other people have individual experiences and information such as that just recounted it should be sent on to us.  The more information we receive from every quarter, the more it helps us in holding these firms to account.  I am emphatic in saying that, because of the way in which this tracker mortgage examination is set up, no matter who is now the owner of the mortgage, the originator is responsible.  My understanding is that is working.  No matter who people owe money to now, the redress and compensation is flowing from the originator of that loan.  That is working.  We have checked it.</p> <p>  To come back to the issue of culture, these culture reports for the banks give a general perspective.  No matter who the regulated firms are that are interacting with the customers whom we are dedicated to protecting, our scope is general.  Regardless of whether it is banks, insurance companies or these specialist firms, we have a general perspective on the issue and a commitment to deliver.</p> <p>  I will just make two more points.  One is about our work and our communication.  I fully agree with the Chairman that what matters ultimately is whether we get the job done in terms of protecting consumers.  I have said in other ways that it has traditionally been our belief that we should be judged on our actions.  Our tradition is to use bureaucratic language.  There is a way in which central banks and regulators have communicated.  We have always been very precise and careful, but perhaps the core meaning of what we are doing gets lost because people do not understand what we are saying.  That may also be reflected in the discussion at our own commission.  We have put more effort into this.  It is reasonable to expect that we should cut through the bureaucratic language and say what is really going on.  The way we have written this report tries to cut through such language.  The message is the same.  The underlying work is the same.  This work has been continuous and has followed the same strategy, but we encountered this problem of our message being lost.  We are trying and interaction with the committee is helping to force us to be clearer in how we communicate what we are doing.  We are committed to that.</p></speech>

I take the point that the Chairman and Senator Paddy Burke have made.</p><p>We have already commented that we only got a link to Professor Lane's opening statement at 8.43 a.m. so we did not have much time before the meeting to study it.  However, we have certainly had time to do so since the meeting commenced.  The tone of the statement is quite self-congratulatory and phrases such as "lenders have been forced to pay", "hauled in lenders" and "the examination is delivering for consumers" are used.  Realistically, however, most people - or at least everyone affected by this, as well as those who are not personally involved but who are watching these proceedings - will ask why it ever happened.  It should never have happened.  The Financial Regular was part of the Central Bank at the time and has been reunified with it following a period of separation.  How did the regulator ever allow this to happen?  In any report that comes out in the future, we must get to the bottom of how every bank managed separately, so we are told, to make the same mistakes with the same customers in the same way.  We want to get to the bottom of who is getting their money and when, but has an analysis been carried out in the context of that to which I refer?  I accept the argument that when the kitchen is on fire, one puts out the fire before working out what caused it.  However, what happened should never have happened.  The supervisory mechanisms and processes should have been in place.</p><p> This kind of behaviour has almost certainly affected far more than 30,000 households.  It will probably have been found to have affected closer to 40,000 before we are finished examining the matter.  That number can be multiplied by the large number of people in the families affected.  Huge numbers of the Irish population were affected by this.  I am sure their extended families ended up having to help out if money was short.  The customers in question were paying out huge amounts of their own cash - wrongly, because it was demanded of them - to banks that were not entitled to that money.  Professor Lane said the banks have been "forced to pay &euro;316 million in redress".  Banks have been forced to give people back their own money.  Has there been any analysis as to how every bank did the same thing in the same way in such a slipshod manner?  It was clearly not in the interests of their customers, although it may have been in the interests of the banks' profitability in the short term.  Obviously, they hoped they would never be found out, even if their profitability in the long term would be damaged by their actions.  Has there been any analysis as to how they all managed to make the same mistakes in the same way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.742" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#S00200"><p>I think there are different perspectives on this.  We can have a discussion describing what happened and say "Here's the different types of violations of what should have happened, happened."  We can talk about the fact that our regulatory framework was clear.  It was stated on page 1 of our consumer protection code that the best interests of consumers needed to be put first.  One can ask where errors occurred - actual errors.  For example, one could ask how could their be coders who could not the correct interest rates into IT systems?  The lenders might have had lawyers telling them that a certain contract was okay and that they could proceed.  However, why did they not have ethical frameworks, cultural frameworks, stating that, technically, they might have got away with these actions in a court, but that it was not in the best interests of consumers and so they should have been making more generous decisions in favour of the consumers?  Why was that culture lacking in these organisations?  As the Senator says, short-term profitability was prioritised.</p> <p>  There is a long list here.  I think the culture reports will help.  These banks should also be doing reports on their own histories of this.  I think they can do that.  There are many lessons to be learned for everyone here.  As I said, and I think we have all said this, the priority for us has been to get the redress and compensation.  However, there are aftermath issues to sort out regarding the culture that I mentioned and the narrative of how it happened.  Simultaneously, it must also be recognised that much of what we did at that time has now proven helpful in enabling us to go beyond just the contracts and to tell the lenders that they violated our code, that they were not transparent and that we told them not to do this.  The fact they were given these warnings in 2008 and so on is now helping us to enforce redress and compensation.  What we are trying to say in this report is that this should never have happened.  However, we must try to make clear that the Central Bank has acted throughout on behalf of the customers.  We take our consumer protection mandate very seriously, and throughout we have been working to try to fix this.  That is an important part of the way in which regulation works: when problems emerge, they are fixed.  The guidance is given through the codes and regulations.  We will try to do more and more about pre-empting problems before they emerge, but when a problem does emerge we try to fix it.  That is what has been happening.</p></speech>

In no way do I want the Senator to take the view that we have been self-congratulatory in our statement today or any other day.  I am really sorry this happened and I am sorry money has not been returned sooner to the people affected.  However, it is a core driver that responsibility is firmly placed on the listed plcs and the lenders, which are huge in terms of staff, resourcing and responsibilities, and not on the regulator.  Front and centre, the responsibility to treat the customer fairly does not, as a first line, rest with the Financial Regulator, which has oversight.  I fully accept that the Senator expects to see a competent, strong, intrusive, alert regulator that pre-empts difficulties or, where difficulties arise, addresses them definitively.  That is what we expect ourselves to be.  However, I say, without any hesitation, that the tracker mortgage scandal was created by those lenders that did not do right by their customers and that full-square responsibility rests with them and the senior people who direct the minds and the conduct of the organisations they run.  This is their opportunity.  If they were not there in the first place as part of the group of people who took the decisions that caused the problem, they are there now, and what they can demonstrate to us, through their changed behaviour, is that they are different to those who went before them.  This is not about being self-congratulatory, but we have a strong expectation that they do the right thing by their customers.  I am glad to see movement in this direction - it is no more than that - but it should not have happened in the first instance.  The lenders in question are entirely responsible, and no one else, and we should hold their feet to the fire on that.  I think the work of the regulator together with the public spotlight has actually done that.  It is a pity it has come to that but it is absolutely necessary that we align to ensure we get further change, and I want to see that change continue.</p></speech>

It is there to supervise and regulate.  Just as internal auditors in banks should have been watching and people should have been fearful of the internal auditors and their external auditors, they should equally have been fearful - to a greater extent than they were, clearly - of the regulator.  The witnesses represent the Central Bank.  Every advertisement on radio and television states - or used to state - "governed by the regulator", and everyone thinks, "That is great.  There must be proper oversight."</p> <p>  I have many other questions to ask.  This is important, and I acknowledge Ms Rowland's comment that the opening statement was not as self-congratulatory as I felt it appeared.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#S00700"><p>I will make a few points.  It is interesting that the Senator brought up the radio advertisements, which do convey that message.  A very important principle of all of this is that, because our code is quite directional and states how we expect lenders to behave, if they do not behave in that way, we get them.  This is what is happening now.  Hundreds of millions have been paid and will be paid to these 33,000 people, mostly not because the lenders violated the law but because they violated our regulatory codes.  On foot of the fact that we have a very proactive framework and are quite directional and precise in stating how lenders need to deal with customers, when they do not deal with them that way, they will pay.  We think this tracker examination is a watershed because, if lenders had any doubt previously that we would follow up on their actions and, in Ms Rowland's phrase, hold their feet to the fire, this is proof we did not let go.  We have proven that we persisted and ensured all those who we think should have been included were included.  Never again can any lender make a calculation that if it delays, the matter will go away.</p><p>This has not gone away.  As we said, the banks have calculated it will cost them &euro;900 million, so our action will have a costly impact.  I share that there was regret.  Could we have gone faster or done more?  However, that we have these codes and issued warnings in 2008 is now coming home to roost in terms of our ability to ensure redress and compensation for those affected.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#T00300"><p>So far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#T00400"><p>Therefore, it is not costing them an awful lot.  If a taxpayer does not pay the Revenue, typically interest and penalties are more than 100% of the amount the person was trying to not pay in the first place.  The penalty here is approximately 15%, plus the staff costs.  I accept there are staff costs, whatever they are, and we have acknowledged that some banks have hundreds of people involved at this stage.  However, of the &euro;900 million that they are giving back, 100% of the 115% is that &euro;600 million, is the people's own money which they should never have lost in the first place.  Therefore, it is not really costing them money.  It is costing them money they should never have taken.  The narrative is that it is costing them a lot of money but they are paying back money they should never have had, plus the administrative burden for doing it.  However, on the compensation payments, as I said about Revenue, if a taxpayer does not do something right, he or she will be hit with interest and penalties of more than the amount that was not paid.  I accept that it is an average and the figure will be higher for some people but the banks are being asked to pay 15%, which is not that expensive.</p></speech>

That the &euro;600 million should never have disappeared from people's accounts in the first place is a reasonable perspective and a fair point.  Another perspective is that, compared to a situation where we had not taken action, at the very least it is going to go back to those people.  If they believed that we were never going to pursue them, at that level it is &euro;600 million.  We have not yet come to the enforcement stage.  Let us see what happens in terms of fines and so on.</p> <p>  The other point is about compensation.  The figure of 15% is what we have seen so far.  The example about Revenue where it can be harsh-----</p></speech>

If the banks think the compensation to be paid will be 15%, why would they not take a chance?</p></speech>

I also think the reputational damage has been severe.  Let me come back to the issue of compensation.  It is important to note that the appeals mechanism is ongoing.  What one might expect to see is a much higher fraction of compensation for those who suffered the most severe harm, that is, loss of home and that kind of thing.  In terms of more severe cases that go through the appeals process, let us see where it lands.  It will be interesting to see where compensation ends up.  The 15% figure is an aggregate for now.  It is not the case that it is the final indicator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#T00800"><p>To develop that point, has the Central Bank got a breakdown of the range of compensation and redress payments by amount?  Professor Lane spoke about people who might have been overcharged by &euro;100.  I tried to get it out of one of the banks if anyone was overcharged by more than &euro;100,000 and they said not really.  The following day at 8.30 a.m. I got a phone call completely out of the blue from someone saying that individual's amount will absolutely be more than &euro;200,000.  Does the Central Bank have a breakdown, by band, of the amount of compensation paid to the 74% of the first 13,000, to the 29% of the second 13,600, and to the 7,100 in the initial tranche?  I am not talking about individuals.  Some people were overcharged by less than &euro;1,000, others by less than &euro;10,000, and others again by in excess of &euro;30,000.  Some were overcharged by more than &euro;500,000.  Do we have those figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#T00900"><p>The design of each of the schemes is intended to ramp up the importance of compensation depending on the severity.  If a person has been overcharged by &euro;100, the amount of compensation will be a small fraction, whereas the design for loss of home is much bigger.  I will ask Ms Rowland to explain it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#T01000"><p>I have some information to assist the committee understand where this has landed.  At the entry level, if I may call it that, are some of the marginal cases or cases for a short duration.  It may have been an error for a number of weeks and one might end up with small sums.  It could be a few hundred euro.  That is at the entry level.</p> <p>  The committee has also heard about advice payments.  However, everything scales up the more severe the detriment.  Then we move into the category where I think most people affected will fall.  The range of compensation is between 10% and 15%, depending on what the lender arrived at.  Some put floors in the system.  For example, there would be a minimum payout of &euro;1,000.  Others did not.  The minimum ranges might be between &euro;125 to, say, &euro;1,500, but they are in a scale of percentages.</p> <p>  Then we move up to the next level where, at the highest point, we have the loss of one's home.  We had to do a huge amount of fighting with the lenders to improve the schemes.  We had that conversation in October.  My colleagues had in excess of 200 turns of documents to try to keep improving the offers where there was desire not to have any compensation at all, which was utterly unacceptable.  It was to push them to minimum levels.  By and large, we pushed for a minimum cash payment of approximately &euro;50,000 for everyone who suffered the appalling circumstance of losing his or her home, which should not have happened. </p></speech>

Then there are payments for the increase in the property value, if that has occurred since, and any residual debt write-off because people may have been in difficulties.  This is where the banks caused the loss of the home ownership, that is, but for the behaviour of the bank they would have been able to pay their mortgage at a lower and correct rate.  This is where causation has been accepted by the lenders.  It is important to say that we are going to test the banks hard on that.  It is very important that they take full responsibility for all of the homes lost as a result of their conduct.  That is another feature of our intensive intrusive supervisory stage that we are now entering.  We are going to inspect the ones that they do not take responsibility for - not the ones that they do - to be assured about the numbers.  Therefore, we might see the number in that category quite rightly increase.  If caused by the lenders, they will be forced to take responsibility for it.  It is important to say that the scale of legal payments and advisory payments also should quite rightly increase the more the detriment suffered.  There is also provision in the schemes for vouched expenses where it goes beyond the caps.  This is important because these things can be complex.</p></speech>

If the customer should have not lost the home, he or she should be entitled to any uplift in the value of the property.  Further, people were left with residual debt with the lenders after this happened and we did not think that was right either.  Therefore, we also pushed that it should be written off so that people do not have to deal with the overhang.  To try to assist somewhat with the wrong circumstances people find themselves in, we pushed the lenders to accept that they should make a cash payment of &euro;50,000 to families who need it.</p><p>This is with respect to home loss caused by the lender's conduct.</p></speech>

There is a mix between having upfront payment to pay lawyers or some upfront payment plus the covering of reasonable expenses such that as the individual submits lawyers' bills, the bank will pay them.  There is a range there.</p> <p>  Of course the most acute cases involve the loss of home.  The schemes are designed to provide reassurance to those who have been affected that they will have redress, not only in respect of the consequences of losing the home but will also be compensated. </p></speech>

They will ensure that in a case where a client lost a house that was worth &euro;400,000 when he or she lost it but which would cost &euro;700,000 now, were the client to try to buy it back, that client would receive &euro;700,000.

It is the causation.  Considering the harm caused to a family by the conduct of the lender where the home was lost to them as a result of that, as well as the consequences that flow from that, it is absolutely right that the banks should stand full square and shoulder that and that a family should be put into the position in which they should have been, had this not occurred to them.</p></speech>

There is all the damage, the emotional and family distress that occurred, which is very important.  What is also very important is that the banks treat these families sensitively and prioritise them and progress these claims in order that people are not further distressed by delay.  That is something that we are very mindful of and I have been very clear in my communication with the leaders of the banks that we expect that to happen and that families be assisted and dealt with proactively and sensitively.</p></speech>

I was not aware that the system was as has been outlined today, and I am glad to hear that it is, but we still need to acknowledge the mental trauma and anguish, regardless of whatever monetary compensation is put in place, as it should be.  We have discussed previously how people have committed suicide and lost family members and how many families have experienced breakdowns.  They will never be able to be compensated for what should never have happened and what was not their fault.  They were duped by the institutions they trusted to give them a financial product that they were going to repay over a period and were put under such pressure.  Regardless of whatever monetary compensation is paid and should be paid - I note much of it is their own money, although I accept that compensation for increased property values is a cost to the bank - it should never have happened in the first place.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the process and thank the witnesses for outlining it but I still wonder if the Central Bank has figures which show the ranges of payments.  There are 33,000 clients, of which some 13,000 are unresolved cases and payment has not been made, and then there are around 20,000, including the first 7,100 to whom payments have been made.  Does the Central Bank have figures showing, for instance, that so many people were paid below &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000, &euro;30,000 and all the way up?  What is the top payment made to anyone as a result of this scandal?  Do we know that figure?</p></speech>

As the banks come before the committee and through any questionnaires the committee gives them, it may explore not only the aggregate figures but how they have dealt with the full range of cases.</p></speech>

We all know that averages can hide as much as they show up.  If one divides the &euro;47 million first tranche of compensation by the 7,100 clients, it works out at around &euro;6,000 each.  Then it increases to about &euro;18,000 each and the last batch seems to be about &euro;22,000 each, but within that there are people who received &euro;100 and there could be people who received &euro;200,000.  Professor Lane is saying that the Central Bank does not have those figures.  Is it the case that the banks have not told the Central Bank those figures or that the Central Bank cannot provide them to the committee?</p></speech>

I would like to revisit the issue of the prevailing rate, about which a number of members, including me, asked questions.  I gave Ms Rowland an extract from a contract during the break, which I do not expect her to have read yet.  I have some questions on how the Central Bank approaches this issue.  The contracts I have seen, including the one I shared with Ms Rowland, do not appear to feature a definition of the prevailing rate.  Is it generally the case that the prevailing rate is not defined in mortgage contracts?</p></speech>

I keep making the distinction that the prevailing rate is generally interpreted as the rate the bank would offer at the conclusion of the fixed rate period.  To repeat, in any individual case there may be additional documentation and evidence that any individual could bring forward to state it had been conveyed to him or her that prevailing rate meant something different.  In general, the interpretation is the rate prevailing at the end of the period of the fixed rate.  However, that does not rule out how an individual case might be heard under appeal or to the ombudsman.</p></speech>

This is why it has left so much confusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-18a.801" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018011800002#DD00600"><p>That is, therefore, the case.  I will take, by way of example, the contract I shared with the witnesses before the meeting resumed.  The extract I provided is from an Allied Irish Banks mortgage contract with one of the 4,000 customers in the category identified by AIB as being within scope.  I understand the customer in question will receive the compensation offer of &euro;1,000.</p><p>I just want to give my interpretation of it.  When I read clause 3.2 in the contract which deals with what happens after the fixed rate period has expired, it states that at the end of any fixed interest rate period the customer may choose between (a), (b) and (c), where (a) is a further fixed interest rate period, (b) is conversion to a variable interest rate mortgage loan and (c) is conversion to a tracker interest rate mortgage loan.  Relating to all of them, it states it is at the bank's then prevailing rates appropriate to the mortgage loan.  If the customer does not exercise this choice, the mortgage loan will automatically convert to a variable interest rate mortgage loan.  There is no definition of what the prevailing rate is.  Professor Lane has given us in broad terms the Central Bank's interpretation of it, which is supportive of the bank's interpretation.  I put it to him that that completely ignores clause 3.6 which provides a very explicit definition of what a tracker interest rate mortgage loan is.  If one takes clause 3.6.(i), the tracker interest rate is made up of two parts, the ECB's main refinancing operations minimum bid rate which is variable and the tracker margin as stated in Part 1 of the particulars of offer of mortgage loan subject to clause 3.6.(iii).  Professor Lane does not have Part 1, but in this case, Part 1 states a margin of 1.1%.  Clause 3.6.(ii) states a tracker interest rate applicable at any time will change within five working days of a change in the ECB rate, while clause 3.6.(iii) states the bank may adjust the tracker margin upwards if the valuation report values the property at less than the property price estimated value shown in the particulars of offer of mortgage loan.  That is not the issue in dispute as that does not apply, but we have very clear definition on what a tracker mortgage is.  In the context of this mortgage contract, the tracker interest rate is the ECB rate plus the tracker margin which is stated elsewhere in the mortgage offer and which in this case was 1.1%.</p><p> If we go back to clause 3.2, it is very clear what the options are for the customer at the end of the fixed-rate period, namely, a further fixed rate period, conversion to a variable interest rate mortgage loan or conversion to a tracker interest rate mortgage loan.  It goes on to state "at the bank's then prevailing rates appropriate to the mortgage loan".  There is no definition of what the prevailing rates are, what they mean or what can be interpreted from it, but there is a very clear definition in clause 3.6 of what a tracker interest rate mortgage loan is.  I put it to Professor Lane that the interpretation the bank - AIB in this case - has put on the contract - this is replicated across a large number of the 4,000 customers - which the Central Bank seems to support has no regard to clause 3.6 which defines explicitly what a tracker interest rate mortgage loan is.</p></speech>

If we make an alternative decision, our regulatory decisions can be challenged on appeal.  In other words, if we make a regulatory decision in the belief it will be successfully appealed by the regulated firm, of course if we do not think we can stand over it based on the evidence and advice we have received, that means there is that interpretation.  I recognise the confounding nature, but the Deputy can be assured that throughout we have always had a consumer focus.  We push as far as we can in favour of the consumer, but it remains the case that it must be within the bounds of what is permitted by regulation.  I will hand over to Ms Rowland who led the work.</p></speech>

We made the decision on a particular set of facts with the particular benefit of the document and all of the surrounding material.  I have a document in my hand, but I do not have the benefit of Part 1.  When we look at something, we look at all of the information available to us in making the decision.  As I do not have the benefit of seeing all of the information, I cannot say if it is identical to the other contracts and pieces of information at which I have looked, together with many others.  I note what Deputy Michael McGrath said about what Part 1 states and the way at which he would look at it.  I do not wish to gainsay him.  I accept his point of view, but for me to express a view on it, I would need to see all of the material, as I am sure he understands.</p></speech>

It is the contract that I suspect governs a large number of the 4,000 cases AIB has now stated are included in the scoping exercise and in which it is offering &euro;1,000 in compensation.</p></speech>

In other words, compared to a situation where any bank stated this type of contract was out, because there is no loss, we have included them, but the fact is they did not receive their contractual rights to be offered the tracker rate, whether it was more or less expensive.  Because they are included they can use the appeals mechanism which is independent to test what they are saying that in their circumstances they interpreted the clause to which Deputy Michael McGrath is referring as the total guidance in this case.  In other words, we have left the door open in order that this debate can continue through the independent appeals mechanism.  As a matter of generality, the systemic issue is the definition of the then prevailing rate.</p> <p>  Our expert advice was that this would have led to an expensive tracker rate being charged from late 2008 onwards, but it remains the case that they are included in the examination.  If they do not accept this offer or interpretation, the independent appeals mechanism is available to challenge it.  On top of that, the ombudsman remains in place, as does the courts option.  That is the answer we received and it provides the option to continue to pursue the matter.  As regulator, we felt that at a systemic level, that was going to be in line with the regulation, but that does not prevent further action and we deliberately designed it in that way.  Because they are included they can use the independent appeals mechanism if they want to test the interpretation.  The people who are running the independent appeals mechanism may come to the conclusion to which Deputy Michael McGrath has come, that, essentially, in the individual case we have the evidence of what they understood the interpretation of the then prevailing rate to be; therefore, it remains a live issue for those who believe they were misled or that the full nature of the documentation they had was misinterpreted.</p> <p>  We are in the position where the initial offer recognised that they should have received an offer of a tracker rate, which they did not.  In this case it is being stated the tracker rate the bank should have offered would have been expensive.  It remains the case that the independent appeals mechanism, the ombudsman and the courts remain open to any of those concerned to challenge that interpretation.  That is the built-in assurance mechanism that there are additional ways to test it.  We felt that within the bounds of the regulation the dominant interpretation was that it was permissible to reset the price of the tracker mortgages in line with the prevailing conditions at the time following the roll-off from the contracts.</p> <p>  Our mandate is to protect consumers.  That is the only criterion - whether we can protect consumers within the realm of the regulations.</p><p>That pushes it as far as we think we can go, subject to the regulatory framework.  It is not about siding with the banks but about making an objective decision, with the advice of our staff and external legal advisers.</p></speech>

That is my honest view.  When I read through the documentation, I believe it is clear and that he is on very thin ice.  He has selectively relied on one clause in the mortgage contract which refers to the prevailing rate.  He is shaking his head.  Will he, please, hear me out?  There is no definition whatsoever of the "prevailing rate".  The clause is very clear that the customer is entitled to a tracker interest rate mortgage loan.  It goes on to mention the bank's prevailing rate which is undefined, but Professor Lane seems to have no regard to the corresponding clause that defines what a tracker interest rate mortgage loan is.  The only variable element is the ECB rate, plus the tracker margin which is stated elsewhere in the mortgage documentation.  This is common to the other mortgages caught up in this cohort.  Professor Lane should let me finish.  Kicking this down the line to the appeals mechanism, the ombudsman and perhaps the courts is a cop-out.  The best chance customers have at this stage of having this issue dealt with is through the regulator.  In AIB's case 4,000 instances have been identified.  The delegates have said, perhaps ten times between all of them, that while this is at a systemic level, the individual cases will go through and that the individuals concerned will have recourse to all of the further steps.  If the matter is not dealt with now, the chances of the ombudsman overturning it are quite slim because Professor Lane has given the Central Bank's endorsement in broad terms to the approach of the institutions to this issue.  It has been signed off on.</p></speech>

We take the perspective of the consumer entirely, subject to the limits of the regulation.  All of the terms and conditions included in the contracts were studied by us and our advisers.  It is not a question of discounting or ignoring.  They were studied intensely and a large amount of work went into the decision.  We disagree with the Deputy.  Our role as regulator is focused on solving the systemic element, but that does not rule out the fact that in an individual case there may be extra pieces of information.  An individual may have additional correspondence with a bank or a broker.  He or she may have recorded conversations or a record of interactions with members of staff.  I know from other sources that many people might be unhappy with this outcome, but we have taken it as far as we think we can go, subject to the regulatory framework, and have left the door open, through the appeals mechanism, for those who want to bring forward additional information.  I respect the fact that there are differences of view.  It is clear that is the case, but we have pushed it as far as we can.</p></speech>

This will leave a sting in the tail in the handling of the tracker mortgage issue.  Professor Lane has placed a greater priority on a reference to the prevailing rate, which is undefined.  Greater priority has been placed on one interpretation of an undefined element of the contract than on a very explicit definition of the tracker mortgage rate.</p></speech>

I do not have the complete information.  This was given to me a few moments ago.  The Deputy will understand why I believe this does not present me with an opportunity to give a full articulation or presentation.  With this document, it appears to me that something important is not here, namely, clause 3.6.i in Part B.  As it is not in front of me, I cannot say what it is or what it is not, let alone make a just comparison with the many long hours of work we put in in considering substantively the tracker margin issue.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has not to date found any evidence that there is a corresponding problem in the case of commercial loans.  I corresponded with Ms Rowland who responded.  I will send on the additional information requested on an individual case.  More broadly, the Central Bank has not found any issue with tracker rate commercial loans.  Will the delegates be clear on that issue?  I am referring to Euribor-linked loans and similar practices engaged in by banks.</p></speech>

For the avoidance of doubt, the SME owners who have mortgages fall within the scope of the tracker mortgage examination.  That is not the Deputy's question, but I want to be very clear on that issue.  Since the crisis we have carried out numerous inspections in the banks looking at SME loans, led primarily by the banking supervision mechanism, and how they were being dealt with.  We have seen no evidence of problems in that regard.  We also note that the protections in place for SME borrowers are somewhat different from those in place for retail borrowers, but at this stage we have seen no evidence of problems.  There is one particular issue in the public domain about the treatment of distressed SME debt in one particular bank, but I do not believe it is relevant to the precise question being asked.</p></speech>

We are in supervisory engagement on the matter.  In broad historical terms, it is not a practice that is predominant in this jurisdiction.  The methodology used for calculation of arrears is a different approach.  This was a more UK-based approach.  In a UK court case, the judge, in effect, stated that one cannot have one's cake and eat it by capitalising arrears, on the one hand, and then claiming there are arrears, on the other.  There was no double charging, if I call it that, but there was an overstatement of arrears.  The judge stated the arrears must extinguished if they are capitalised.  It was an approach.  What subsequently occurred was that the UK regulator did not introduce a rule banning it, but stated, effectively, that people's repayment amounts might be increased on a monthly basis and if, for example, they were increased by more than &pound;50, it would make it very difficult to pay and so it guided against that.  We were aware of this and took the view that it was not a practice we wanted to see here.  I am glad to say that it was not a practice widely held in any event in this jurisdiction, but it did arise with entities that had their origins in the UK.  We guided very strongly that it was to stop and that is what we expect to see.  We are aware of what happened and we are taking regulatory action.</p></speech>

The monthly repayment was larger because the arrears were capitalised, but the arrears were overstated.  This could be a risk if the two systems did not talk to each other, if the Deputy understands.  It was very distressing for people to perceive or believe arrears were presented as being larger than they should have been because the amounts were also being capitalised.  It was an information presentational problem.  The arrears could be overstated, as well as being dealt with separately through an approach where they would be capitalised, and that could result in a larger monthly repayment request being made.</p></speech>

AIB has in excess of 100 companies and it has two banking licences.  It would seem, from reading the name of the bank that holds the licence, the only difference in the context of the visual, is in the titles "AIB plc" and "AIB, plc".</p></speech>

This is a real issue in finance.  If we take the global firms, they have thousands of legal entities within them, if we think about diving into a big global bank.  We regulate many international banks.  We get a global map of how one entity relates to another.  Absolutely, this is all driven by corporate lawyers setting up legal entities to suit particular transactions for all sorts of reasons.  It is the case that life would be a lot easier for everyone, for us for visibility and for the committee and the general public, if, for example, it was obvious in every case what is the parent firm and what is the ultimate controlling firm.  I agree that the law is such that firms can set up all sorts of subsidiaries and vehicles that may be interconnected and the position is not always obvious.  In the examples the Chairman has given at least the same name is showing up somewhere, but we know many global firms have all sorts of bizarrely named entities below them.</p><p>It is a job of work for us as regulators to keep clear about the interconnections between firms.  It makes it hard for everyone else to keep track of what is going on.  I agree with that.</p></speech>

When a person goes to a court and begins to explain publicly that his or her loan was with AIB, plc, the courts can often believe that the person is tricking around with the title but in fact it is quite a significant and fundamental difference.  Will the Central Bank please check this?  Is this the only difference?  I have already asked AIB and will ask again.  The public needs to know and we need to state clearly the difference - if there is one - between the two companies with this type of title.</p></speech>

The unit in Ulster Bank came into focus first.  Some loans that were sold on were performing loans.  It has been found that the loans are now mixed up under the name of one particular fund.  There may be a number of portfolios in that fund that actually represent competitors.  There may be two or three portfolios, let us say they are hotels for example.  They all represent hotels but they are three different portfolios.  The management of the fund relative to the loans is such that the performing loan is put under pressure because the vulture fund wants to get a different outcome.  Let me finish painting this scenario for the witnesses.  In other words, it may very well want to amalgamate all the portfolios and sell it as one but it has a performing loan that makes it difficult to sell.  The fund management is using its muscle and this is anti-competitive.  It is forcing the performing loan in a particular direction.  I refer to a scenario in which the entity responsible for the loan, or which owes the loan, takes an action such as going to the Central Bank.  As the Central Bank does not deal with individual cases - which I understand - that entity would be referred to the financial services ombudsman.  Because the turnover of that entity is greater than &euro;3 million, it has nowhere to turn but to the courts.  To take a case to court against one of the vulture funds, which may be owned by Goldman Sachs or whoever, is simply not possible for an SME of that size.  In the context of the Government asking the Central Bank if more legislation is needed, would Professor Lane perhaps consider that issues such as this require a different view regarding legislation?  In Europe, an SME is defined as having a turnover of &euro;50 million.  In Ireland it is &euro;3 million.  When the Central Bank is asked by the Minister or by this committee if it needs stronger legislation, would Professor Lane consider recommending a change in legislation or regulation around that area of SMEs?  Does the Central Bank want to go that far in its recommendations or not?</p></speech>

Given the asymmetry between a SME worth &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million compared with a gigantic global firm, the Chairman is saying that an ombudsman framework would be better than a court process.  Because that is to do with handling individual cases, however, I believe it is a matter for the Oireachtas to make that decision.  It is not a direct regulatory decision or issue of the ombudsman or the courts.  In other words it is in the judicial realm rather than our realm, which is about the systemic handling of debt, loans and other financial services.  We have protections for households and for SMEs as currently defined.  The Chairman has asked whether our consumer protection framework should be expanded to include SMEs of a higher value.</p></speech>

It is one of the actions being taken by the banks in recognising they have an issue in trying to address standards overall.  As we said earlier, I believe it is a welcome development and it is at least a recognition that the banks need to do something.  It does not, however, change anything we are doing from a regulatory perspective and nor would I expect it to change anything from a legislative perspective.</p></speech>

In designing this framework and holding the firms to account in executing it, it is vitally important that the membership have a majority of independents and others, including those with a strong consumer voice.

We were very prescriptive in terms of the framework and how it should operate and that there be independent appeals with people suitably qualified with consumer-focused membership.  A key requirement is to have a chairperson who is a qualified barrister or solicitor with at least 15 years post-qualification experience and has professional experience in assessing compensatory awards.  We have prescribed the quality and types of people who should sit and make those decisions, such as those with competent finance backgrounds - qualified accountants, actuaries with at least 15 years post-qualification experience - and also a person with a consumer voice who has competent, credible experience.  The more serious cases must be heard by a fully independent board and the cases with lesser impacts - I do not mean to denigrate them in any way - must be heard by a board with a majority of independent members.  We wanted to ensure the quality of the independent element in those frameworks.</p></speech>

If a person has gone to the ombudsman and there has been a ruling on a disagreement, for example, between the Central Bank and the bank, can that person then return to the ombudsman?  Once the ombudsman has ruled, can a person return to it?  For example, if the Central Bank and the bank do not agree on a matter and it goes to the ombudsman, who rules on it or has ruled on it in the past, can it then go back again to the ombudsman?</p></speech>

The ombudsman hears complaints from members of the public who are not satisfied with an event or occurrence with regard to their financial service product, approach or process.  The first step of the expected procedure is for a person who is dissatisfied to make a complaint to and seek resolution from the lender that provided the service.  If the lender, such as a bank, for example, does not resolve it to the satisfaction of the customer, the customer is then within his or her rights to make a complaint to the ombudsman, who will determine the matter.  That determination would be between the customer and his or her lender on whatever is the issue.  My understanding is that such decisions of the ombudsman are binding.</p> <p>  However, if the Senator is asking this in the context of the tracker mortgage examination, we were very clear and set out on a number of occasions that lenders were to ignore those decisions, start again with the tracker mortgage examination, take into account all relevant considerations and not be blinded by the decision of the ombudsman.  The ombudsman supported that message.  That is how we expected matters to be conducted in the examination.  It is not particularly a question for me to answer but more for the ombudsman.  The ombudsman is bound by his decision but if there is new information or a different aspect on things, my understanding is that it can open it up again from a different point of view.</p></speech>

The witnesses can see how it is confusing for people.  People are interested in the banks that bunched up their loans and sold them off to what we would term "vulture funds".  In many cases, people do not know who owns their loans and are in a very vulnerable position.</p></speech>

We have a fair amount of reach compared to many jurisdictions where there is no such law.  The fact that we came up with this structure whereby we have reach over the credit servicing firms means that even if a global investor owns the loan, and the global trade in loans is getting bigger all the time, there is a good degree of protection.  This is quite an effective way to deal with the global issue of how one regulates and supervises loans at a national level that have a global ownership.  This is an effective framework.  We now have sight of these firms through authorisation and supervision and, therefore, have a mechanism to ensure they are subject to our various codes.  That is an effective step this country has taken in this case.</p></speech>

The Central Bank needs to remind these credit servicing agents of their obligations and responsibilities to the Oireachtas.  The formal complaint that I have made to the Central Bank through the committee indicates that these companies are using strong-arm tactics with individuals and Members of the Oireachtas have complained to me about them.

If in doubt, they must put a gate on the procedure.  I am sorry it has been going on for so long but it is a job of an enormous scale.  Lenders have been reminded of the seriousness with which we expect them to take this matter.  We have been on-site with each of the main lenders and it has been part of the on-site supervisory work we have been doing.  We have checked exactly what they are doing in respect of this issue.  It is a collaborative piece of work between the conduct supervisors and the banking supervisors, because the latter are very familiar with the layout and structure of lenders.  We take this very seriously.</p></speech>

If the harm was caused when the ownership was with a firm which later sold the mortgage on, it is the entity which caused the harm which is held responsible.  If the loan was sold on and new harm was generated by the ongoing loan being mishandled, the new owner is responsible.  It is about matching the harm to the lender.</p></speech>

We look at when an issue arose and try to match it with culpable persons in senior positions at the time.  We examine the actions taken by the directing minds of the time and there is a challenge for current board members in the context of their obligation to put the customer first and to quickly and adequately compensate the people and families affected.  There are those who took decisions in the past and those who take decisions now in the context of the examination.  I look to the current senior managers for a competent, responsible response, but the directing minds in place at the time are also accountable and responsible.</p></speech>

They will be familiar with the geography of Mayo, where there is often a 50-mile round trip to nearest bank, but I was alarmed to hear of a story over Christmas of someone who went to their own bank to take money out, only to be told they could not do so and would have to come back another day between certain times.  That does not suggest a change of culture or banks that are consumer-led.  Does it worry the witnesses that "customers" is almost a dirty word for banks now?  The banks do not want customers in rural areas going to their tellers.</p></speech>

The issue of the approach banks are taking to their branch networks is not specific to Ireland but can be seen across Europe and globally.  Branch networks are retreating and this is problematic from the perspective of financial inclusion.  Some banks have chosen to withdraw altogether and there are branch closures in certain areas, leaving those areas underbanked.  Others are taking cash out of branches and the branches serve more as sales vehicles than traditional bank branches.  One can understand the cost drivers associated with these moves but the Senator is right to ask how this works alongside a bank's customer-centric approach.  We think of this in the context of the credit union sector and the importance of that sector from the perspective of financial inclusion outside the large conurbations.  The situation is a cause of concern.</p></speech>

As is the case with the question of rural broadband, the question of populations receiving adequate financial services is one for public policy solutions.  One option may be to impose conditions on commercial banks but there are other options.  One has to manage the conflict between what is commercially sensible and what is socially desirable.  Ultimately, that is for the political system to decide as it may require subsidies or other such things.</p></speech>

I have looked at the work of the committee on credit unions and have studied the report carefully.  We see some degree of overlap with the work of the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, implementation group, of which we are a part.  It is a very important area and probably warrants a separate discussion.  Certainly, I will be happy to return to the committee with the registrar to have a discussion of our view of the credit union sector, the issues we see in that sector and how it needs to move forward.  We are doing a great deal of work on business model development.  We issued a paper last year providing guidance on longer-term lending and we are looking at the rates relating to longer-term lending.  We have also done work on the investment guidelines.

With regard to the Sparkassen, I met representatives of Irish Rural Link and the Sparkassen in the past couple of weeks.  They are very clear about the approach they wish to take, which is a full banking licence and a full banking model.  We have a clear authorisation process and we are happy to work through that.  As I understand it, the issue is not about the authorisation process or the work of the Central Bank but funding the capital for whatever they wish to do.  Sparkassen are operating as consultants but in order to operate a bank here, they must fund it.  The costs associated with building infrastructure must be found.  In terms of any engagement or progress that must be made in that regard, there is a process we are going through repeatedly with Brexit at present in respect of the authorisation process.  We are happy to engage on it, but it would be as part of a banking licence application.  That obviously requires the funding and the capital to do that, which is not a matter for us.</p></speech>

We are making good progress and we have our sights on the issues.  I believe we will have many of these matters tidied up and addressed, or certainly closed out everybody's thinking, before the end of March.  However, there is a caveat.

I have another quick question.  An issue has arisen regarding how to define the group impacted by trackers.  We are dealing with many people who have contacted us.  How did the Central Bank break down the 33,700?  Did it break the figure down into cohorts of people who were originally on a tracker mortgage and came off that mortgage and were put on fixed rate mortgage, groups that came off the tracker mortgage and were put on a variable rate mortgage and groups that went to the bank assuming they were going on a tracker mortgage but were put directly on a variable rate mortgage?  Did the Central Bank examine it in that depth?  How did it define the groups that fell within the scope of the investigation?</p></speech>

First, it was if one originally had a tracker interest rate.  The second was if in the underlying mortgage agreement, the tracker interest rate was an option in that agreement.  The third is if one ever had the option to go onto a tracker interest rate.  It is a universal approach.  The reason it is so complex is that many different problems have arisen - there are all sorts behind the basic idea of a tracker examination.  For most people on trackers, there has been no problem.  They got their tracker, held onto it and it has moved along.  The problems are where people were moving from trackers to fixed rates and what happened next, where it was not properly explained to people what was implied by giving up a tracker and so forth.  It is 33,000, which is a large number of people, but it remains contained to where problems have arisen.</p></speech>

The person received an agreement that did not mention it was a tracker agreement.  Does <i>caveat emptor</i>or buyer beware apply there?  If there is no mention of a tracker in the agreement even though the person might have been under the impression when meeting the bank that the person would be put on a tracker rate, does that fall within the scope?</p></speech>

We had a variation of that question this morning.  It so annoying.  We are aware of the standard variable rate - we had another discussion about that.  A tracker is a type of variable rate.  The fact is that there is no precision.  There was not enough deep thinking at the time to be super clear as to whether it was a tracker with a fixed margin.  With some of these trackers, the difference between them and other types of variables is hard to understand and explain.</p></speech>

An issue that has become a feature, particularly in the past six months, is the level of concentration of property within the control of vulture funds or whatever one wants to call them.  I can only speak from my experience in Limerick.  If property comes up for sale in a large block of apartments or the like, in most cases it will be under the control of what people out there would call a vulture fund.  I have heard anecdotally that if this is happening in Limerick, which we regard as the real capital of Ireland in rugby terms, it is probably even more pervasive in Dublin.</p> <p>  In terms of the stability of the market, does Professor Lane, as Governor of the Central Bank, have concerns about such a large concentration of control of property being within the ambit of the vulture funds?  I do not know whether the Chairman has encountered this, but dealing with people who are in rental properties under the control of the funds has become a recurring feature of our work.  There are serious concerns in this regard.  I felt that I had to raise this issue today.  What is the Governor's view?</p></speech>

There could be distributional issues.  For example, does it affect some types of households more than others?  The Senator mentioned renters.  A list of issues arise in terms of the protections offered to tenants and so on by housing policy.  From the point of view of keeping an eye on the stability of the financial system, however, there is not a strong platform to infer too much from this.</p></speech>

Even though the vulture funds controlled the property, the property was at a relatively depressed price.  In the meantime, many of the loans have been sold on by NAMA and are controlled by vulture funds.  In some cases, receivers are being appointed, which means that the properties in question will be sold to realise the assets' value.  If something happens once, one takes note.  If it happens two or three times in quick succession, one has to question it.  That is my role as a public representative.  What I have described is becoming a feature.</p> <p>  When Mr. Sibley attended previously, I probably questioned him on the regulation of the funds that dictate policy as distinct from the agents that act on their behalf within the Irish State and are regulated directly by the Central Bank.  It is a broader question that is probably going to become more of a feature as the property market continues its recovery and funds seek to realise value.  Has the Central Bank examined this matter in any depth empirically?  Many of the relevant cases that I have encountered involve young couples who got caught in the property crisis and could not purchase a home.  They entered the rental market in 2004 or 2005 and rented for seven or eight years in the same place.  Suddenly, they find that receivers have been appointed.  They are worried.  They are not dealing with a bank down the road, but with someone who, to them at least, is faceless.  This falls within the Central Bank's remit in terms of prudential regulation and the financial stability of the banking system and the State itself.  This is a broad request for Professor Lane's observations, connected with regulation and the financial system.</p></speech>

These firms are global and are not just in Ireland.  Some of the risks that we consider at a European and international level include the possibility of these firms collectively pursuing similar strategies, deciding to sell at the same time or the funding underlying them changing.  At that macro systemic level, we are examining this matter as part of a wider international effort.  At the level of the consequences for individual tenants, though, that is a social policy issue.</p></speech>

For example, the consumer protection code in the Central Bank of Ireland came into being in 2006.  Therefore, one could not have a breach that pre-dates the code.  To determine whether anything is in breach of the code one must consider when the rules were in place.  Depending on the rules and the frameworks that one is considering, and when the events arose, there is no limitation period on us to go back in time.  If we find something from quite some time ago, and there was a rule in place which was breached, we can pursue that.</p></speech>

Let us say, for example, an individual customer of a bank applies for funding from it but the bank refuses without giving a stand-up reason, an appeal is lodged with the appeals office which agrees the person was entitled to the loan because his or her figures were correct and when the person returns to the bank, it refuses.  In that case, the appeals section declared that the original application complied with the guidelines and the figures were correct but for some reason the main bank in Ireland says "No."  I am concerned about the way the fund is managed and that it is getting lost in the general activities of a bank.  I ask the witnesses to come back to me on this matter.</p> <p>  The committee has received correspondence on trackers.  For example, KBC has acknowledged, after a long argument that the person concerned is impacted on one mortgage for two buy-to-lets or something.  The person gets word on the one mortgage but no word on the other matters.  Everything is left in abeyance and no information is forthcoming.  It is a similar situation with AIB.  One gets the same spiel from it in terms of one's position within the analysis and whether it has been impacted.  The Central Bank has direct contact with banks.  I presume such contact makes banks move as fast as they possibly can to resolve all of these issues.</p></speech>

We think that a lot has been done.  Especially in those cases which were only accepted by the banks at the tail end of last year, it is running into these few months and into the first half of the year.  They are all timelined to go as quickly as possible.  They are set up on an account-by-account basis rather than an individual-by-individual.  That means one might get a letter about one account and then another letter when the bank has dealt with the different accounts at a different point in time.</p></speech>

Is the Governor satisfied that the banks, not only relative to the tracker issue but generally, properly report their losses, if any?</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of judgment within the framework and the accounting rules.  They are changing to try to address some of the issues that were evident from the crisis but the interaction is ongoing.  We do credit inspections to ensure that loan books are adequately provided for.  We carry out ongoing analytical reviews.  We are never absolutely satisfied that they have 100% the right number because there is a lot of judgment involved.  On a broad basis, we are satisfied that the banks are adequately recognising where they have problem loans and, broadly speaking, they have sufficient provisions to cover those loans.</p> <p>  It continues to be one of our key priorities where there may be an incentive for the banks perhaps to be less prudent because it impacts on their profitability.  We are continually pushing to make sure that provision levels are prudent and appropriate.  We do that every year.  As long as non-performing loans remain high in the system it will be a continuing activity for us in the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

My concern is the timeframe between Mr. Sugarman's complaint of 2007 and the inspection in October 2007.  I hope there is a greater urgency of response to complaints and issues raised about breaches reported to the Central Bank now.</p></speech>

I know the Chairman has raised concerns about this instance and that he raised them again in passing on Tuesday.  I would like to spend a couple of minutes dealing with this issue.</p> <p>  Since the financial crisis, and certainly since the appointment of Matthew Elderfield as Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, the credible threat of enforcement has been central to our overall supervisory approach and the evidence of that which we referred to earlier is more than 100 successful public enforcement cases and millions of euros worth of fines imposed, including in respect of the entity where Mr. Sugarman worked.  I note that my predecessor and his predecessor considered this issue specifically.  There have been third-party reviews of the issue and the broader control framework in place.  We have also conducted our own investigations on this matter.  I am satisfied that the action taken on this case was appropriate and that includes considering the further meeting held by the Chairman of the committee, Mr. Sugarman, the Governor, members of my team and of Ms Rowland's team.  The type of business we are talking about in this case is noteworthy.  It is a subsidiary of a parent organisation and many of its transactions, its core business, are associated with the parent, as a funding vehicle for the parent company.  It certainly was at that period.  Typically that involved relatively large transactions.  Any comparison with Northern Rock or the domestic banking system here are not well founded.  In respect of the specific breach that Mr. Sugarman refers to in August 2007 the liquidity regime in Ireland changed in July 2007.  That is a backdrop to the incident but in more general terms, where there are large transactions, the regime in place at the time was focused on matching maturities and liabilities associated with different time bands.  Where there are significant and sizeable transactions, however, it is possible and plausible that through placing or completing a transaction overnight potentially under a new regime, human error could result in some breach that would not necessarily indicate a fundamental problem with liquidity or a fundamental breakdown of systems and controls, or a wider systemic issue.  The amount of time being spent on this case demonstrates the seriousness with which we take information that is brought to us.  It is thoroughly investigated.  That is what we have done in this case.  I appreciate that the Chairman will respond to us by letter but I thought it important to get those points across as clearly as I could.</p></speech>

On the issue of reporting, Mr. Sugarman reported a breach that was 20 times over the limit and when that was assessed independently it was found to be 40 times over the limit.  It was not just a single breach.  It went beyond that.</p> <p>  In his letter, Mr. Sibley says that the Central Bank is satisfied it has taken appropriate action in regard to all information received in respect of the matter.  That is so in respect of the report the Central Bank received and the action taken but it has not confirmed whether it fined the bank, or whether there was an administrative sanction relative to that complaint and it is something Mr. Sibley keeps saying he cannot comment on.</p></speech>

There is a range which remains private - any regulator in the world will have private actions - and then a range where there is a public disclosure of the administrative sanction.</p><p>I agree that those who want to learn more and so on do hit a wall, a limit of information here.  We do not indicate publicly actions that are within the realm of private regulatory actions.  The fact that we have not spoken publicly about the regulatory response in terms of any sanction creates this asymmetry of information in that we are precluded from disclosing any more.  This provides a source of frustration, I am sure, for the committee and for Mr. Sugarman but what we are saying is that we are satisfied.  We have no reason not to maintain the highest regulatory standards.  It is essential that we are a first-class regulator for these wholesale banks and for all other entities.  We have given our assurance, subject to the limitations of confidentiality under which we operate, that we are satisfied that we dealt with this in a way that is entirely in keeping with being a first-class, robust and intrusive regulator.</p></speech>

When the crash came, on the night of the guarantee and so on, the figures that were given to the Minister of the time and that were talked about afterwards obviously were wrong.  The banks misled everyone.  The companies that represented the banks in terms of audit and so on were the ones that conducted the audit.  There must have been serious ongoing breaches during those years that were not dealt with.  If they were dealt with or known as breaches, we might have been aware of what was going to happen a lot sooner.</p></speech>

One of the flaws leading up to the crisis was the regime itself.</p></speech>

An institution could look fine from a liquidity reporting perspective because it did not go beyond 30 days, but have a big cliff of maturities beyond the 30 days.  The regime itself was too short-dated in terms of making sure liquidity and funding of banks, not just in Ireland, was on a robust footing.  There have been very significant changes to the liquidity regime to which banks now operate as a result of the failings of the pre-crisis regime not just in Ireland but globally.  That is a very different matter from the matter in hand here, which is very specific.  It is not around being 20 times past what was required.  This type of thing is associated with having a maturity or liability in one of the time buckets when it should be in a different one.  It does not indicate a fundamental problem with liquidity in the firm at the time.</p> <p>  If I may close by repeating myself, the evidence that we are willing to take enforcement action is the more than 100 cases that have been taken.  We take a proportionate approach to using our enforcement powers and have taken more than 100 cases in the intervening period, where there have been serious breaches that warranted an enforcement action.  There would be no reason for us not to take enforcement action in this case if it was warranted.  We have evidence that we do take that action where it is warranted.</p></speech>

The first one was Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent as it was then - R.I.P., I guess - where we did have liquidity breaches that deserved enforcement cases.  There is consistent evidence to demonstrate enforcement cases back at that time.  One facet of enforcement is the total commitment to public outcomes of those cases from the administrative sanctions procedure, and therefore all of the outcomes of those publicly available cases have been published.  That is a very important thing.  However, private enforcement such as cautions cannot be disclosed publicly.  They are disclosed in aggregate form in an annual report to demonstrate that they exist in aggregate numbers but, on a case-by-case basis, they cannot be used.  They are suitable for the more limited kind of severity of a breach where there is really no substance in terms of fundamental harms.  I thought I would add that because I was probably in fact setting up the policies and procedures and taking these enforcement cases at the time in the broader set-up of the framework.</p></speech>

He said he was told not to report those breaches.  I am sure Mr. Lane can recall that part of the meeting, when I expressed my shock that this would be said.  It goes to the heart of the issue, certainly in his case.  I do not know whether there are any other cases with other banks.  As a risk manager, he was told not to report the other breaches at that time.  That is the reason he resigned.  He had reported breaches properly in accordance with the law and what broke him, in terms of the decision he had to make to stay or not to stay in the bank, was the fact that he was being told not to report the breaches.  That bank is still in business in this country, regardless of what type of banking it does.  Regulation is regulation, regardless of the bank.</p></speech>

I understand the reasons that Mr. Sugarman has given.  That has been factored in to how we have investigated and viewed this event.  Again, it is a frustration that we cannot disclose any more information.  However, the ultimate point here is that we are committed to being an intrusive regulator, to actively using our enforcement powers and we do.  There are certain categories of outcomes, however, which remain private and only in certain cases do we go public.  We understand the account that Mr. Sugarman has given and that I think was fully factored into how this case was handled.  We have tried to go as far as we can, subject to the confidentiality restrictions, in trying to explain what we did.  Ultimately, what we are saying is that we have no reason to be anything but the most effective regulator we can be and we are satisfied that we handled this appropriately.</p></speech>
