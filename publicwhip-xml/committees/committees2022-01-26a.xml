We do not seem to get the recognition we would like from State bodies, that is, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Finance regarding proposals we put forward to them.  We look forward to members' questions after our presentation.  I will pass over to Mr. Moroney now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moroney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it this evening.  I will give a summary of our opening statement.</p><p>First, what is a land-based contractor?  The Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI, land-based farm and forestry contractors are professional sole traders and companies working on behalf of third-party farmers to provide services for arable crops, livestock, forestry and local authority green spaces.  They provide agricultural, forestry and landscape mechanisation services employing skilled operators, using the state-of-the-art and modern equipment in a sustainable way for financial reward.  Their machinery investment delivers economies of scale for farming, providing practical and sustainable efficiencies to support farmers and the Irish food industry as a world leading, competitive quality food producer.</p><p> Farm and forestry contractors provide the bulk of mechanisation services to the Irish farming, accounting for a contracting sector turnover of more than &euro;700 million.  Our members play an important role in providing cost-effective and efficient services to Irish farmers and forest owners and support Ireland&rsquo;s position as a world leader in the production and marketing of low-carbon, high-quality, sustainable and traceable food and wood products in a clean environment.</p><p> In practical and measurable terms, the 1,000 farm and forestry contractors now listed on our database each work across an average of three farms per day.  This amounts to about 18,000 interactions each week of the working season.  Given a working season of about 30 weeks, that equates to about half a million interactions between farmers and their contractors in Ireland each year.  That, in a sense, explains just how connected our FCI members are to Irish agriculture.  Policymakers need to be aware that without the essential input of farm and forestry contractors, the Irish agrifood and forest production systems would simply not exist.</p><p> Farm and forestry contractors employ more than 10,000 people in Ireland in rural areas, operating high-technology and agricultural-specific machines.  These machines consume more than 350 million l of agricultural diesel annually, which is about 62% of all agricultural diesel consumed in Ireland.  They do that across a fleet of about 25,000 tractors and an additional 5,000 power machines.</p><p> Just to put it into context, contractor machines harvest over 90% of the national grass and maize silage crops and manage the handling and spreading of over 50% of animal manures produced on livestock farms.  In forestry, their machines prepare lands for planting, construct the forest roads and harvest the nation's entire timber crop.  Farm contractors are the dominant providers of slurry spreading machinery systems and their equipment applies the bulk of the 40 million tonnes of animal manures produced annually on Irish farms.</p><p> Since the low-emission slurry spreading, LESS, grants were made available, more than 8,000 machine grant applications have been paid out, which equates to more than &euro;55 million paid to farmers for 20% of the potential work output, while contractors, doing most of this work, have been specifically excluded from the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grants.  Despite this, Teagasc research has shown in 2020 that only 3% of slurry is spread through LESS systems.  We accept that this has increased significantly since then.</p><p> We are aware from the capital-intensive investments now being made by our FCI members in new tractors and equipment systems that digitalisation is creating unprecedented amounts of data.  Our members believe that technological innovation and precision agriculture have the potential to improve the productivity, quality, traceability and sustainability of the Irish agrifood system.  Our members are already using machines fitted with such technology, including big data and machine learning systems that can bring about fundamental shifts to dramatically alter how we produce food products on Irish farms and how we manage organic waste in a sustainable way.  This now provides opportunities for the further development of shared data-driven decision-making on Irish farms and in Irish forests that can only be commercially viable and sustainable through collaboration and the economies of scale provided by farm and forestry contractors.  With supported investment in new technology, training and data exchange systems for FCI registered contractors, these technologies can advance circular agriculture through a cost-effective and fairer agriculture transition to a low-carbon farm economy.  Farm and forestry contractors must be supported to purchase this appropriate equipment, as proposed in the nitrates action programme, NAP, first stage consultation.  </p><p> From a climate action perspective, it is clearly more environmentally efficient for several farmers to utilise the services and equipment of a single farm contractor, rather than each individual farmer owning and utilising their own equipment.  By purchasing a new tractor or machine grant-aided, supported by the TAMS scheme, overnight a farmer can become a farm contractor, with no registration or affiliation requirement.  In doing so, they undermine the cost structure of existing farm contractors who are providing local skilled employment with proper insurance cover.  A farm contractor cannot easily become a farmer.</p><p> Support for farm contractors to invest at a more rapid pace in newer machinery systems that can guarantee greater accuracy of application of animal and chemical fertilisers, as well as more traceability of the animal food production process and enhanced forest management needs to be examined to demonstrate to customers of Irish food and timber products the seriousness with which we as a nation take on the lower carbon and water quality challenges and as we pursue the transition to a more sustainable and fairer food and timber production system.</p><p> The FCI believes that the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Agriculture, Food and the Marine should use the NAP and TAMS, respectively, while working with farm and forestry contractors as the dominant on-farm service providers, to improve environmental outcomes on Irish farms and in forests in line with Ireland&rsquo;s national environmental objectives.  Farm and forestry contractors want to take a lead part by providing solutions. This contractor input needs, first of all, to be acknowledged, and then supported.  FCI members have always been early adopters and facilitators in the delivery of scientific research and the best farm practices at farm level.  Farm and forestry contractors have a track record of working in partnership with generations of Irish farmer clients and advisers.  Together we all now strive to achieve new national climate and water quality goals.  It is therefore essential that the viability and well-being of farm and forestry contractors are addressed in all future farming and forest strategy programmes.</p><p> This is why we must repeat the message that without the essential input of farm and forestry contractors, sustainable Irish agrifood and forest production systems simply cannot exist.  The farm and forestry contractor input needs to be acknowledged again and supported.</p><p> I will deal with some of the key points in terms of in terms of some of the schemes.  In the slurry management area, the association is aware that the nitrates action programme contains the mandatory measures required of all EU member states by the nitrates directive, including closed periods that prohibit the spreading of fertilisers, limits on the amount of livestock manures that may be land-spread, conditions during which fertilisers may not be spread and livestock manure storage capacity requirements.  While these are fundamental elements of the directive, at the FCI, we believe that there is scope to introduce measures that provide benefits for water quality and biodiversity.  The fundamental issue is that the current nitrates directive calendar farming system of closed periods is simply not working.  Extending this system will not ensure that it can function any more satisfactorily. This current system is too simplistic and it is non-scientific.  It has been proven not to be practical at farm level and it is now clearly not sustainable.  This has been confirmed by the deterioration in water quality as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, despite the attempts at the closed period policing, involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local authorities.  It is also despite the costly misdirected investment in LESS machinery systems funded by Government grant supports directly to farmers, rather than to farm contractors.  This, again, is clearly acknowledged in the nitrates action programme, where it makes the point that contractors must be supported to purchase appropriate equipment.</p><p> What is lacking for us is a clear independent and technology-based, decision-making process to identify the best land spreading options based on measured information about air and soil temperatures, soil moisture levels, grass growing conditions, soil type information, predicted rainfall, slurry constituents, slurry volumes being spread and field mapping locations linked to machine tracking.  Each of these individual indices is currently available but are they are not co-ordinated to ensure good decision-making.  We currently have a simplistic calendar-based programme of work restriction that is not based on either science or technology.  It has resulted in a behaviour on farms that is not consistent with the water quality objectives.  Overall, the evidence from the agricultural catchments programme, ACP, indicates that supporting farmers to make better decisions regarding how and when they manage nutrient applications is likely to be the single area with the greatest potential to improve outcomes for water quality on Irish farms.  That is a really important point.</p><p> On slurry storage, one of the reasons for the lack of slurry storage capacity on many farms is a lack of understanding among advisers and policymakers of the process of slurry management.  FCI members are front-line providers of the slurry management services on farms.  They understand the challenges and have rolled up their sleeves in attempting to develop management strategies that are sympathetic to our natural environment.  </p><p> Slurry management in Ireland is significantly different to that in other European countries, meaning that the single application policies cannot function or be sustained.  Some 80% of all silage now made is baled silage and during feeding, a large proportion of the silage ends up in slurry pits.  There is a requirement to revise upwards, by at least 50%, the slurry storage requirements to take account of the long and high dry matter silage when mixed with the slurry and the resultant dilution needs when agitating this type of slurry product.</p><p> FCI believes that tillage farmers should also be grant-aided to invest in slurry storage facilities on their farms to store large volumes of liquid slurry exported from expanded and future expanding dairy, pig and beef farms that have limited land resources and face slurry storage challenges.  This nutrient resource should be transferred to these tillage farms during the closed period of spreading, alleviating slurry storage challenges on highly stocked dairy and beef farms.  Using modern precision farming systems it is possible to incorporate real-time traceability systems on slurry transfer machines of FCI registered contractors, linking that to a national database of slurry nutrients and movement managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This proposed system will ensure more timely slurry use at its most efficient site of application on tillage farms, reducing the need for artificial fertilisers.  This will provide longer seasonal work opportunities for skilled machinery operators within the contractor sector and retain rural-based machine operation expertise while boosting organic matter levels on Irish tillage farms, enhancing soil structures and supporting biodiversity. </p><p> On soiled water issues, our members provide soiled water management services on thousands of farms and they understand why the control and management of soiled water from farmyards needs greater emphasis across all delivery mechanisms under the nitrates action programme.  The addition of soiled water to slurry tanks is causing many of the issues related to storage capacity.  FCI supports the use of soiled water as a dilutant for the purposes of slurry agitation prior to spreading, reducing the need to import large volumes of clean water on the farm by means of proper management and engineering design.</p><p> On chemical fertiliser controls, while it is being proposed that the nitrogen allowances will be reduced by 10% nationally and potentially up to 15% in some areas based on the EPA catchment assessment report, these areas will be determined by the nitrates expert group based on input from the EPA, and any reductions in specific catchments will be undertaken on a phased basis.  Changing the dates for work will not guarantee the delivery of the optimum spreading and utilisation strategies.  What is required once again is a clear independent and technology-based, decision-making process on spreading times, etc.</p><p> Sewage sludges and the use of sludge is managed by Irish Water through its national wastewater sludge management plan.  The application of sewage sludge to agricultural land is controlled by local authorities through the maintenance of sludge registers and inspection and enforcement programmes.  Much of the land spreading work for this product is carried out by FCI farm contractors.  The nitrates expert group aims to work with various stakeholders to address any risks from this nutrient source.  FCI believes the association must be included with discussions as a stakeholder as our members provide the machines and operators that carry out this work.</p><p> The management, maintenance and submission of organic farm records is becoming a more important element of demonstrating compliance with current water quality regulations.  At present all farmers are required to maintain up-to-date paper records of livestock manure and slurry.  Failure to produce these records during an inspection can lead to significant payment penalties for farmers.  By transferring this responsibility for the management of livestock manure and slurry recording to FCI registered contractors as part of their spreading licence application and to provide precision farming systems, a more streamlined process can be provided to ensure that contractors are able to manage the liquid slurry and manure records of their farmer clients.  This will also free up additional time for farm advisers, whose time is often taken up with such record-keeping on behalf of farmers.  The fact that poor slurry application decision-making on farms has been measured strongly suggests that there should be serious consideration given to licensing of slurry spreading and the slurry transfer process to registered contractors.  These contractors can be licensed and their licence linked to a national database of slurry nutrients and slurry movement using precision farming technology managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with a national FCI contractor register created and maintained by the association in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> FCI believes that farm and forestry contractors must be supported to invest in new low-emissions slurry spreading technology in the same way that farmers are currently supported.  It has been proposed in the nitrates action programme that this should be the case.  If no such supportive action is taken to improve the uptake of precision farming technology on farms below 100 ha, and the average farm size in Ireland 32.4 ha, it will become increasingly difficult for these farms to compete.  These farms will also struggle to comply with the EU and national environmental and water quality goals.  FCI members have not invested significantly in higher technology slurry management machinery to the same extent as their European counterparts due to the presence of the farmer-focused machinery grant aid system which is making investment in more accurate and more efficient spreading systems that incorporate precision farming systems with high levels of traceability and transparency, totally uncompetitive.  How can any farm contractor compete with one of their client farmers who receives a grant aid of 60% for the purchase of low-emission system machine?  FCI believes that the current green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, grant aid scheme should be extended to all farmers to use low emission slurry spreading, LESS, systems operated by an FCI registered contractor.  If all LESS slurry spreading was grant-aided based on FCI contractor invoices, not just to existing GLAS farmers, the cost to the Government would be significantly less than the current cost of machinery grants which have run to more than &euro;55 million.  Many of the LESS machines purchased by farmers under the current TAMS II programme were purchased to take the advantage of the grant aid and for taxation benefits, rather than being needed to do the slurry spreading work.  There is significant evidence that many of these machines are not being worked and will not be worked.  This is a significant loss to the Government, the Irish water environment and Irish taxpayers who have supported investment in machines that will not be or are rarely used.  </p><p> In regard to water quality in forestry, the risk of diffuse water pollution in Irish forestry is increased by poor site planning, poor management, and poor monitoring of machine work activities.  There is often a lack of clear understanding of the forestry contractor&rsquo;s challenges and responsibilities on site as work conditions often include a combination of high rainfall, heavy machinery, and steep ground.  FCI believes forestry contractors and operators should receive funding for training in how to understand fully the forest operational plans, and have an input into their production.  There must also be more investment in education for farmers on slurry management rather than investment for the purchase of slurry spreading machinery.  Advisory programmes to inform farmers about optimum management of the slurry in their livestock sheds needs to be a priority.  Good slurry management strategies save farm contractors significant time during the spreading operation and this will always convert into a financially more cost-effective contractor service for farmer clients.</p><p> FCI supports the establishment of a livestock manure and grass-based biodigester sector in Ireland.  This approach to producing methane from grass, our best producing and lowest cost crop, will fulfil a significant number of requirements, including management of livestock manures to enhance water quality in an environmentally sensitive way while also contributing to lowering greenhouse gas emissions within the State.  FCI believes that grass, as Ireland&rsquo;s most productive crop, when used in conjunction with excess animal manure, will also mean additional rural-based employment as grass harvesting cannot be outsourced to another country.</p></speech>

I acknowledge this discussion is long overdue.  I accept that the role of farm and forestry contractors is under-recognised in regard to strategies and policies that are set in place for our agriculture and food sectors.  The importance of contractors to our rural economy and the farming community, particularly to smaller farm families, is going to intensify over the coming years.  Therefore, I agree with the opening remark that it is imperative that the voices and expertise of contractors are brought to bear when policy decisions are being made.  I have a few questions.  Will the questions be taken by Mr. Moroney?</p></speech>

For clarification purposes, Mr. Moroney mentioned there are now 1,000 farm and forestry contractors, employing some 10,000 people.  Am I correct in saying there are 11,000 people working directly for the farm contractor sector?  Are there regions with a greater prevalence or where the size of contractors is greater?</p></speech>

Forestry contractors work throughout the country and do not tend to be county- or region-based.  We have contractors in the forestry sector who operate throughout Ireland.  Generally, the largest areas are probably Cork and Tipperary, two of the largest farming counties in the country but within each other county, there are significant numbers of contractors.</p></speech>

Is there any geographical distinction in terms of where one might find larger contractors that would cover more farms or more land than others?</p></speech>

In some of the larger-farm areas, individual contractors would have a higher throughput of work on individual farms but they may not be dealing with as many farmers as contractors working in a smaller-farm area would be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#D00400"><p>Quite a number of times in his opening remarks, Mr. Moroney referred to the LESS equipment and the failure of the Government to allow contractors to fit into the grant scheme for that equipment.  I absolutely agree that LESS equipment and technology has been proven to be environmentally beneficial.  It can have a positive impact on water quality in particular but also on emissions levels.  It is laughable that somebody living beside a DART station, with a bus passing by every day of the week and a cycle lane nearby can get a grant towards a new electric car but somebody who is purchasing this type of equipment, regardless of his or her status, is not able to draw down Government support, despite the fact that the benefits would be multiples of those arising from the use of an electric car.  This must be addressed and there are two issues at play.  The first is the future of TAMS.  The compellability of this type of technology will mean, ironically, that it will not qualify for grant aid at all, potentially.  There is also the issue that Mr. Moroney raised and I want to delve into that a little more.  Going back to the 1,000 members, how many of them are farmers as well as being contractors?</p></speech>

Many of them have a very small farm but have some farming input.</p></speech>

That is all I have ever done for my whole life.  My brother and I inherited the business from our late father.  I farm a 20 ha farm or in old money, 50 acres.  I have applied for grant aid through TAMS but because my holding is so small, I am not eligible and because of my age - I will be 61 on my next birthday - my score is not high enough for the scheme.  These are the two negatives that forced me out.  As a farmer I am eligible and I get through the first door but I am not able to pass beyond the next door because in terms of the criteria, I do not tick the boxes.  The question that should be asked of those who are applying for a grant for a machine is what amount of work they are going to do with said machine.  For instance, I have two strip-till drills that are out working.  I have 22 separate clients for a strip-till drill to whom I can bring value over the course of the season.  That stops 22 people from going out to buy their own drill.  It would not make economic sense for most of them to do so anyway.  My smallest client for that job last year had 1 ha and the largest had 88 acres or 35-odd ha.  Despite the value I can bring to those 22 people I do not get any State support through TAMS for my strip-till drills.  They are eligible for grant aid but the scheme criteria do not allow me to venture any further than the fact that I am a farmer.  My farm is a hobby farm.  I use it for experimentation using the strip-till drill, to promote it.  It is one of the primary development areas for nitrates, for locking up carbon in the soil, organic matter and so forth.  That is my experience of it.  I am a farmer but I am also a professional contractor and my farm is a hobby, basically.</p></speech>

I am just trying to figure out how the Government could provide grant aid if TAMS is not an option in the future.  There was one comment in Mr. Moroney's statement that we would be challenged on were we to bring it to the Department.  He said that there is significant evidence that many of the machines that are being grant-aided currently through TAMS are not working and will not be worked.  Essentially, he is saying that there is significant evidence that farmers are drawing down grant aid for machines that they are then leaving in the shed.  Where is that significant evidence?</p></speech>

I do not have a survey as such but we have very significant evidence from our membership who have been in contact with us about this on a regular basis.  My colleague here and the former chairman, Mr. Richard White, is contracting in an area of Tipperary and he would support that contention.  His phone is on mute at the moment, unfortunately, but the evidence is widespread, not just in that area but throughout the country.  Many of our members have been in touch with us to tell us that farmers have made such requests.</p></speech>

They have purchased the equipment off their own bat, exclusive of grant aid mainly because contractors will drive technology on.  They are very quick to move on with new technology and new systems and they identified that LESS is what their customers need.  It is important to make the point that when grant aid becomes applicable to machines like LESS machines, typically the cost of the machine rises in accordance with the level of grant aid.  What we are finding is that FCI members who purchased machines without a grant aid facility have had to pay extra for those machines simply because they are eligible for grant aid so the price rose accordingly.  There was a double penalty.  Some of them lost the opportunity to get a grant but when they invested in their own equipment, they have had to pay more as a consequence of the machines being grant aided.  That is an unfortunate reality but that is what has happened.</p></speech>

We have not had any response on a review.  We would have expected that there would be some consultation as part of a review process.  We have not had that consultation.  It probably does not make us totally satisfied that it will take place.

The tax strategy group produced its report in September and it also recommended that.  On that basis, we also suggested that in the Form 11 tax return form applicable to everybody who is self-employed etc. at the end of each tax year where people check the box to say they were farming, they should be required to show a figure for diesel consumption.  That would indicate if it was consistent with, for example, a 60-cow or 100-cow herd or if significantly more diesel was consumed.  We felt it would be important to establish the use levels.  We are looking forward to further interaction with the Department of Finance officials and we hope that they will not just listen - we believe they have listened to us - but we hope they will take action.</p></speech>

Mr. Moroney set out in detail his criticism of the closed period for slurry spreading and even the proposed tightening of this.  To summarise, he has called for an independent and technology-based decision-making process using the data available.  I ask him to outline what that system would look like.  Who would be responsible for it?  How would it be overseen?</p></speech>

It develops that guidance based on indices from various sources incorporating weather, growth etc.  We are suggesting that something similar would be done for slurry application, which is a bigger process with more people involved and more widespread interaction with people throughout the country.  The numbers of people involved in potato growing is quite small, but a far bigger group of people are using slurry systems.  Therefore, we believe it is far more urgent and important to have that independent data-driven decision-making process.</p></speech>

The opening statement was quite complex but exceptionally good.  The piece that jumped out at me was:</p> <blockquote> 	A farm contractor cannot easily become a farmer...<br /><br />By purchasing a new tractor or machine grant-aided, supported by the TAMS scheme, overnight a farmer can become a farm contractor. </blockquote> <p>That encapsulates the challenges and difficulties.  The statement indicated that farmers receive 60% grant aid for the low-emission slurry spreading scheme, commonly known as LESS.  How can a contractor compete with that?  A major investment in equipment is involved requiring loans etc.  We talk about the issue of the environment and the serious issues with emissions etc.  We know that farming is inextricably linked to climate change, which makes perfect sense.</p><p>Who administers the FCI contract register?  How does a contractor get on that register?  Is that register linked to the Department in any way?  Mr. Moroney made some reference to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  I ask him to outline the relationship between the register and the Department.</p><p>The FCI submission states, &quot;If all LESS slurry spreading was grant-aided based on FCI contractor invoices, not just to existing GLAS farmers, the cost to the Government would be significantly less than the current cost of machinery grants which have run to more than &euro;55 million.&quot;  I ask Mr. Moroney to tease out that argument and explain it further.</p><p>Water quality issues in Irish forestry are very important and we have considered them in detail.  Indeed, we have considered forestry in detail at this committee.  Mr. Moroney mentioned the risk of diffused water pollution.  We are all familiar with that regarding the pollution and how it relates to the Irish forestry.  He mentioned poor management and monitoring of machinery.  He said, &quot;There is often a lack of clear understanding of the forestry contractor&rsquo;s challenges and responsibilities&quot;.  I fully support the FCI's belief that forestry contractors and their operators should receive funding for training on operations, plans, identifying risks to water and training on the use of machinery.  That is very valid and I would like Mr. Moroney to explore that more with the committee.  I again thank him.  It is high time that representatives of the FCI appeared before the committee.  We recognise the enormous role the FCI plays in the agriculture industry.</p><p>Deputy Carthy asked about the membership.  Am I right in saying that 60% of the professional contractors are also farmers?  That does not necessarily mean they all qualify for TAMS.  Mr. Hughes outlined from his direct experience that it is possible to open one door and get in so far but can go no further.  I have been frequently told about that.  Holdings below a certain threshold do not qualify.  There are major challenges for farmers without a herd number who cannot qualify for TAMS.  This is a common problem.</p><p>I am delighted the FCI has come before the committee.  I ask him to tease out those important issues.</p></speech>

I hope I have all the points in the correct order.</p><p>We have proposed a register to the Department and it has responded that we should create a register ourselves.  We have almost completed the process of doing this.  We will have several key points on the register.  The contractors will be VAT registered and registered as an employer.  They will possess contractor insurance policies so there will be proper insurance cover.  They will have an audited annual safety statement to protect themselves, their employees and customers.  They will also have a record of staff training for manual handling and the necessary safety training programmes.  These are our five criteria.  We suggested this to the Department which, in a sense, batted it back to us and asked us to come up with a suggested programme.  We are at this at present.  We are in the process of compiling it and we hope to have it in place before the end of May 2022.  These are the requirements at this stage.</p><p> If farmers involved in some of the environmental schemes tick the GLAS box they have to identify a number of programmes in which they will take part.  One of these is low-emission slurry spreading.  They will get a grant based on the contractor invoices and the number of cubic meters of slurry spread.  Quite a few of our members fulfil these requirements.  They complete the invoices for their farmer clients, so they can satisfy the requirements of the GLAS scheme.  We suggest this should not be restricted to GLAS but that all farmers should have access to it.  If they have a registered contractor who provides them with a low-emission slurry spreading system they should be able to apply successfully for similar grant aid.  This would encourage better use of equipment on farms.</p><p> Water quality issues with regard to forestry has been an issue.  I note the committee has been very involved in forestry issues as have we on the forestry policy working group.  It is important for us that the role of the contractor is recognised in this.  It is important that when the forestry service in the Department identifies the new machinery systems or planting systems that it also includes input from the contractors.  Ultimately, they are the people who will have to use the machines to carry out the work.  It is not satisfactory for the Department's forestry service to come up with a programme of mechanisation or a forestry strategy without consulting the forestry contractors.  Some of the proposals that have been made are virtually impractical.  With input from contractors, who are the people doing the work, this could be far more valuable and useful and get far better results for the whole sector.</p></speech>

It is very progressive and we certainly did not have a sense of the detail that Mr. Moroney has given us now.  This is the benefit of meeting people face to face and teasing out some questions.  It is a really progressive measure.  It addresses issues of VAT registration, insurance policies and training and professional development.  These are things we need to hear about.  This is the way of the world now, whether we like it or not.  It is very positive and I ask Mr. Moroney to send in more information on it, if he would not mind, including on the timeline and the ambition for it.  It is key.</p> <p>  However, I also know contractors who I can nearly hear telling me that they will not get into it and that it would not be worth getting into.  I can understand this.  Will Mr. Moroney tell us how it is progressing?  I also ask him to keep the committee informed.  Will he also keep us informed on the timelines of the FCI's engagement with the Department on it?  Most importantly, does Mr. Moroney get a sense from the membership about what they think?  Will he briefly tell the committee how this is floating with FCI members?  It is very positive.  It is really good and something that will help the cause and case of the FCI.  It is something that is to be welcomed.  Will Mr. Moroney share with us his interaction and the support he has from FCI members for the register?</p></speech>

It means the client can expect a minimum standard from an FCI registered member, as we outlined in the criteria.  It gives a sense of responsibility to the contractors as they have to achieve a certain standard.  This is the aim behind it.  It is the first step on the ladder.  It is a small step but nonetheless it is a step.  We can keep stepping up with personal development and business acumen accreditation.</p> <p>  The industry will have a better view of itself from within and be better viewed from outside.  People will see it is a professional association run by professionals for professionals and not just a bunch of fellows standing on corners smoking Woodbines thinking they are great.  It is far from it.  We want to bring ourselves to a level that our European counterparts achieved a long number of years ago.  We have been slow to get out the blocks but we are on the road and we intend to achieve the targets we have aimed for.  It is a long road but nonetheless we aim to get there.</p></speech>

I am a contractor.  As the lads would say, I am not a very big operator but when we are in politics some smart Alec will make a dig.  I am a contractor and I do slurry and bailing.  I might do 8,000 bales.  I have just done a tally that if 50% of FCI members are not eligible for grant aid then between 30,000 to 40,000 farmers throughout the country would not have the offer of a contractor under the low-emission slurry spreading system unless they buy it themselves.  At present in most places, unless there is a derogation, slurry can be spread with a splash plate.  New gear can be bought and put on the back of the tankers but it is awkward enough with some of them.  What is coming more and more into play is the pipe system with the reel and the pump.  Given how the prices of 2,500 gallon or 3,000 gallon tankers have increased people are looking at an investment of the guts of &euro;50,000 and another &euro;8,000 for an agitator.  People are probably looking at spending &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 for 700 m or 800 m of piping, a dribble bar, a compressor and a pump.  I predict that with the new regulations to be introduced in 2025, if contractors cannot avail of a grant system, they will not be on the road in 2025.  Do the witnesses agree?</p></speech>

As an interesting aside, Northern Ireland has a similar grant system.  It has put in place a size limit of 2,500 gallons on the tankers for which it is prepared to provide grant aid.  We will provide grant aid for far larger tankers on farms rather than in contractor fleets.  This is something we feel is important.  There should be a ceiling on the size of the tank on a farm that will be given grant aid if contractors continue to be excluded.</p></speech>

It will not buy a big tank if people have to buy the tank and an agitator.  Is this fair to say?</p></speech>

My understanding is that one or two countries have facilitated contractors in the system because they understand farmers will not be doing it.  To be honest, there is not much point in putting a 2,000 gallon tank behind a Massey Ferguson 135 even if a grant is given for it.</p><p>I mean no disrespect to the Massey Ferguson 135.  There seem to be different rules for different countries and our Department is always saying that this is not allowed for contractors.  Where in Europe has the association examined?</p></speech>

We have also sought some information from Europe.  We understand that, under the previous TAMS grant, contractors were eligible under the agricultural and rural development fund support provisions under Regulation (EU) No. 1305/2013.  That provided a business start-up support for activities such as farm contractor.  However, we also understand that it was the choice of Irish Government authorities not to include support under Article 19 in the Irish rural development programme.  I will quote from the reply by the European Commission to Petition 0284/2017 to the European Parliament that was delivered in 2017.  It listed contractors as being eligible under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  It reads:</p> <blockquote> 	However, it has been the choice of the Irish authorities not to include support under Article 19 into the Irish Rural Development Programmes (RDP).  The Irish farm investment scheme referred to in the petition is based on Article 17(1)(a) of the Regulation (EC) No 1305/2013, which allows support only to farmers or groups of farmers. </blockquote></speech>

We are discussing climate change and low-emission slurry spreading.  There is a report from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on anaerobic digestion.  Once the digestate goes through an anaerobic digester at temperature, it is classed as an organic fertiliser, which will be helpful this year.  A report done by Teagasc, NUIG, UCD and the Department recommended spreading it via splash plate or low-emission slurry spreading, which we would call the dribble bar.  However, there seems to be confusion in some parts of the country around digestates and a belief that it has to be put into the ground using the disc injector system.  Has the association encountered this problem in the interpretation by councils of how slurry is to be spread?  Is it a worrying development?  If we start down the road of slitting slurry in using a disc injector, we will be looking at a tractor of nearly twice the horsepower.  A general contractor's tractor might be 180 or 200 horsepower, but if the ground is tight, nearly twice that amount would be needed.  According to the report, if there are shallow soils, there would also be a danger of the slurry going down through the ground more quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.60" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moroney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#G00400"><p>We have encountered it and it is something on which we would like some clarity.  It appears that there are diverse views among local authorities as to what the digestate product is.  That is not satisfactory from the contractor's perspective nor the perspective of the digester's owner.</p> <p>  Regarding the application of slurry, there is a relatively small number of disc systems in the country.  A significant issue is that all of our soils in Ireland are derived from glacial product, meaning there is a great deal of stone in the soil.  In many areas where slurry could be applied or is intended to be applied using injector systems, for example, discs, it will give rise to stone damage or to stones being brought to the surface.  Farmers would not want to have slurry spread in those conditions.  This situation is not widespread, but it is an issue in some cases.  It would also add to the cost because the process of injecting is slower than using a splash plate or trailing shoe.  That is an additional problem that people would have to address.</p> <p>  We have encountered this issue and are aware of it.  We are trying to get clarity on whether the Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or whoever will be able to identify the digestate product, which is a fertiliser and has the opportunity to displace artificial fertilisers, which have become very expensive.  This is an opportunity and we do not want it wasted.</p></speech>

I have been listening to contractors from my area.  With the way the price of diesel is increasing and a carbon tax due to apply to it in May, many contractors now appear to be considering where they are heading.  We have to be fairly honest, in that many contractors rely on the AIB for most of the year.  They put out slurry at the middle or end of January when the season opens, they do another bit, they go baling silage, building silage pits or whatever, and work during the rest of the year.  That is not sustainable at the moment.</p> <p>  Banks are not lending to contractors.  Many people would have taken out a working capital loan every year but I have heard that, for whatever reason, one of our main banks is putting them through hell on earth to get loans this year.  I will tell the witnesses what I have heard &ndash; many contractors are looking to see whether they would be better off going into building because they cannot sustain what is happening.  I put it to Mr. Moroney that, due to the increasing price of diesel and machinery, contractors being left out of low-emission schemes and so on and how tough the banks are being, contractors will grow scarcer over the next five to eight years and farmers will start booking them, even though they think at the moment that that will not happen.  What is the association's view on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moroney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#G00600"><p>Our view would be very similar to the Deputy's.  He is close to the ground in his understanding.  Prior to the pandemic when we had regional meetings and face-to-face meetings, we were always concerned by the number of grey heads in the room.  That is a significant point.  Contractors are planning their work for 2022.  They are looking at diesel costs and the lack of labour availability, which is a major problem in rural areas.  Some of them are contemplating whether it is time to give it up.  One of the problems that many contractors have is that their assets are machines, which depreciate over time by their nature, so it is not always easy to convert those assets into something if a contractor decides to retire.</p> <p>  There is considerable concern, not just in Ireland, but across Europe among our CEETTAR partners but it is more significant here because our costs seem to be higher.  The Deputy is right, in that we have heard quotes today from our members of up to 94 cent per litre for diesel.  There is a frightening prospect that diesel could increase to &euro;1.50 per litre if there are issues at an international level over which we have no control.  In that scenario, it would not be sustainable to run a contracting business and provide a service for farmers.  Farm incomes will not justify dealing with the realistic charges that will need to be put in place if the price of diesel goes to those levels.</p> <p>  I will pass the committee over to our chairman, who might add further comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#G00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  It is a fact that the grey-haired brigade took over the rooms when we used to have face-to-face meetings.  Diesel is just one element among a number of issues with TAMS, GLAS and so on that have finally come to a point and are now being recognised.  They are piled up against the agricultural contractor, possibly because we did not make enough noises ourselves as an industry.</p><p>Hopefully, now we will get more recognition.  That would be a help.</p><p> The carbon tax, on its own, for example, is a tax on food production.  The farmer, as we mentioned earlier, can get the carbon tax rebate on that section of the fuel but we, as professionals, cannot.  It is a shame that we cannot but, hopefully, we will rectify that in the near future.</p><p> I suppose you could say it is death by a thousand cuts.  We are running into the nine hundreds at present.  It is not too far off where we will get to the thousand and there will not be a continuation of this industry.</p><p> My business is celebrating its 74th year but there is no next generation coming on behind me to take over the business.  They do not want it because there are alternatives that are cleaner, nicer and pay better.  Why would you want to?  We need to build an industry that people would want to get involved in.</p><p> We need a training structure for people to come into it in order that they can see that there is development going forward in the industry.  That is why we welcome the initiative of Teagasc and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to do with careers in apprenticeship.  To be honest, it is a decade too late.  I suppose better late than never.  As for whether it will be too late, it possibly will.  We need to get the speed up on that and deliver sooner rather than later.  I am aware they are talking about putting in the training for tractor and machinery equipment later in the year but it, too, is another stumbling block because it is late.  Everything is late.  Late is no good.  If you are late getting the cow to the bull, you will not have a crop.  You are late getting the corn in, you will not have a crop.  If you are late with the apprenticeship, there will not be any industry.</p></speech>

I note the clock has gone to zero.  If there was one message the contractors want us to send to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, what would their top message be?  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

Our one message is we need a register of contractors.  We need the sector organised and structured in order that we can develop it, as Mr. Hughes said, so that we can put together programmes to allow employees and people to develop the sector.</p> <p>  At present, we are the hidden asset of Irish agriculture.  Nobody wants to talk to us.  Nobody wants to consider the role of the contractor.  They talk about farming and most people who are even on the fringes of the sector do not consider the role of the contractor at all.  It is as if we are invisible in the room.  We are not.  We are doing the work.  Agriculture cannot and will not survive without the role of farm and forestry contractors.</p></speech>

It is an important topic.</p> <p>  First of all, I apologise I missed part of their opening statement.  I was delayed at another meeting.</p> <p>  There are significant challenges there for the industry, whether it is labour, access to grants, carbon tax and the price of plastic.  The price of parts and of new machinery, particularly in the past six or eight months, has been a real issue that many contractors have come across in my part of the world.</p> <p>  That last comment is important.  They are, more than ever, an important part of the wheel.  It does not work without them in so many ways.</p> <p>  We had a discussion earlier on the trailing shoe and about low-emission spreading of slurry.  The truth must be told.  The majority of farmers in Ireland do not have tractors to pull this machinery.  That is why we are all using low-emission spreading slurry tanks with a contractor.  We all are aware of the benefits, both in economic and environmental terms.  It is important that the agricultural community does what it can to make sure the contractors can avail of grants to make sure that we can have more low-emission slurry tanks, even though you would be probably waiting 18 months to get one at this stage.</p> <p>  It is an important part.  If you look at the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in particular, where we are going environmentally, whether it is how we will manage the spreading of fertiliser or whatever, in talking to my farming community, that is a topic that they are saying could be done by contractors.  Given the price of a new fertiliser spreader with the new GPS heading up to &euro;28,000 or &euro;30,000, a normal farmer would not be availing of that.  You would be looking to get a contractor to come in every ten days to do it in rotation because you would believe that would be the appropriate way to do business.  We need to make sure that there is availability of grants so that we can get our contractors to spend the money to buy the machinery so that we can increase our environmental standing and also qualify for these new proposals in CAP.</p> <p>  We are intertwined.  If the farming contractor is not on board, the entire venture goes off line.  That is a real issue.  Now more than ever, the contractors are such an important part of it.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Moroney to comment on a few issues, in particular, the labour issue.  From speaking to contractors a while ago, labour and access to competent and capable pilots who will be involved seems to be a significant issue for contractors at present.  How is Mr. Moroney proposing to deal with that labour issue?  I agree it is a significant issue on farms but I often say you would prefer to drive a tractor than milk cows.  If the contractors are finding it hard to get labour, where will the industry go?  What needs to be done to get people into the industry making sure there are competent people driving the machines?</p> <p>  Many members spoke on the grants issue.  Access to TAMS, is such an obvious requirement, in particular, with the new environment.  The majority of farmers are so busy that they will be moving to contract out more work, whether it is the zero-grazing, the slurry, the spreading of fertiliser or bringing in the first cut in the bales.  These all will be part of the contractors' role but we need to have an industry that is lined up for it.</p> <p>  The carbon tax issue was touched on by Mr. Moroney, but I will go back to the price of machinery and parts, and the price of plastic to a lesser degree.  The latter was an issue last year and probably will be an issue this year.  The price of parts, particularly in the past number of months, has been an extraordinary issue.  From talking to people in Cork, we have had parts inflation of anything up to 30% to 40% in the past few months.  Mr. Moroney might share his thoughts on where that will affect the industry.  Is it Brexit, is it shortages or where are the blockages regarding that issue?</p> <p>  Of course, then there is the price of new machinery.  I was talking to a contractor a while ago and you would nearly buy a farm for what they are telling me they are buying tractors for now.  It is so significant.  That is why, if you have a 2,800 gallon tanker coming in with a trailing shoe, there is no normal dairy farmer or beef farmer who will have machinery to pull that.  I refer to the expense that they are going to in order to get this work done.  Mr. Moroney might share his thoughts on the cost of machinery and how sustainable it will be to have a fleet of five or six tractors of 200 horse power each in the yard.  It is an amazing layout of capital.  Is this sustainable?  How can we make sure that they can survive if that is the projection of the way the industry is going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moroney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#H00600"><p>I thank Senator Lombard for his comments.</p> <p>  The issues of sustainability are significant issues within the sector.  To add to the Senator's comments about parts prices, tractor tyre prices have gone up by 50% in the past 18 months as well.  Two of our members quoted for a set of tyres for a modern contractor tractor in October 2020 at &euro;8,500 and the same set of tyres on the same tractor were purchased in October 2021 at a cost of &euro;13,000.  The costs are spiralling almost out of control at this stage and that affects the sustainability of the business.</p> <p>  Machinery costs are significant.  Year-on-year machinery costs have been rising by between 5% and 10%.  Some of them have been accounted for by new low-emission systems on tractors and the requirements for the manufacturers to adhere to the emission regulations as proposed by the EU.  That has driven some of the cost increases, as has changes in the EU tractor directive whereby there was a requirement to change some of the design of issues, such as steps.  All have added to additional tractor costs.</p> <p>  Significantly, in the Senator's area, in Cork, where there is a large number of contractors providing an excellent service to farmers, the investment that many of them have in equipment is now running into millions of euro.  It probably brings into context the need for us to send a message as to why understanding costing is important.</p><p>That would probably lead us to think, if we are to be realistic about it, that there may be some changes and consolidation in the future.  That is happening in other countries.  We talked in particular to our colleagues in Denmark and Holland, where there is come consolidation whereby a number of contractors can come together in order to allow one of them to have an exit strategy.  We would like to work with our membership in order to help them chart a way to that, if that is their desire.  We will, realistically, see fewer people in the business because financially, as the cost structures stand in 2022, it is not sustainable at the rates that many of the contractors are charging.  They are giving an excellent service to farms and they have given excellent value.  They have given a service that is unique in terms of a customer relationship.</p><p> Mr. Hughes, our chairman, has mentioned that he has been in business for 74 years.  The Hughes family has worked with generations of farmers over decades.  They have developed a service that cannot be matched in any other sector.  However, we are now at a point where the costs are beginning to be insurmountable.  That is going to force some people to leave the business or consider consolidation and mergers because the only way they can bear the costs is by increasing the output from the same machines.  That will necessitate significant change.</p></speech>

I apologise but I was speaking in the D&aacute;il so I missed some of the meeting.  Perhaps some of the points I will raise have already been covered.  Am I to take it that our guests are taking issue with the closed period during which spreading is prohibited?  Are they saying the system is too simplistic and not practical at farm level?  They have also pointed out that our watercourses are polluted, which means there is a failure in the system as it stands.  Do our guests' system for analysing ground conditions for particular areas, combined with weather forecasting and taking into account a particular pasture base and machine-type information, suggest that the closed period should be substantially changed?  If so, what changes do our guests foresee?  Have they engaged with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on their views?</p></speech>

We are making decisions about when is the best time to spread slurry based on a calendar, not based on the conditions at the time.  The Teagasc PastureBase survey programme shows there is more grass growth in November in most years than in January but we are still applying slurry in January and not in November.  In some Novembers, the conditions are not suitable for spreading slurry but we are not using a scientific approach to the management of the issue.  We are using a simplistic calendar-based approach.  We are picking a date on the calendar, irrespective of the weather.</p> <p>  Some of the Deputy's D&aacute;il colleagues have mentioned climate change, the impact it is having on the environment and the changes we are living through.  None of that is being taken into account in deciding the best time for slurry application in this country.  That is important.  We are saying that needs to change as a matter of urgency.  The evidence that the current approach is not working is that our water quality has deteriorated.  What more evidence is needed?  The only effect that extending the closed period into October will have is that more slurry will be spread from 15 January.  It will not mean anything else.  It will mean a higher concentration of slurry spreading on 15 January or on whatever date it opens in the respective regions.  It will not mean that people will behave differently.  It will mean that the floodgates will open at a certain point.  The decision to spread in January will, unfortunately, be made irrespective of weather conditions and the end result is that a lot of the slurry will end up in the wrong place.  It will not end up at the growing point of the plant.  On our analyses of everything else, including the pandemic, we are using scientific data but we are not doing so to deal with this important issue on Irish farms.</p></speech>

The conditions on 40% of Irish farms are not suitable for spreading slurry using the dribble bar and trailing shoe system.  Could it reduce blockages and save money?</p></speech>

A certain number of our members have made a considerable effort in terms of their farmer clients and worked with them almost hand in hand to persuade them to develop new strategies.  They adopted an advisory role to make the contractor's life easier, have fewer blockages and to ensure, in having fewer blockages, easier agitation.  The end result was the charges to the farmer were lower because the process of agitating and spreading was easier.  There are significant benefits to be had.  We believe the message around how slurry is managed should be delivered as a priority and funding should be put into prioritising that message rather than funding equipment.</p></speech>

I understand our guests have not been in touch with the EPA.  Have they had discussions with other agencies, such as Teagasc, and the Department?  I understand they have been in touch with the Department about suggestions.  It seems to me that the proposal is for a centralised way of providing farm services, with the additional benefit of addressing environmental concerns through the use of expertise, data forecasting and local knowledge.  Have our guests run their proposals by the farmers who have used the services of their contractors?</p></speech>

For example, John Deere has a unit called a HarvestLab, which can be fit onto a machine to measure nutrients, volumes, dry matter, etc.  However, very few people have invested in them because the cost is significant.  We are talking about in excess of &euro;20,000 just for the unit to be able to measure that.  If contractors are to make that investment, they need to be sure they will get some return on it.  Quite a small number of people have made such an investment.  They are working it with their client farmers.  Teagasc and the Department have not come on board to understand the value of that technology, which is now widely available and widely used by our counterparts across Europe.  We have not been able to go to events for the past two years, but when we went to exhibitions across Europe and met our counterparts prior to that, we found out that most of the contractors who are dealing with liquid slurries are successfully using that type of technology.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moroney think there is a reluctance on the part of some of the advisers?</p></speech>

In doing that, sometimes there is a requirement, naturally, to provide advice as to how best those machinery services can be used.  In any world where there is advice given, the advice may not always totally concur.  If we take it that quite a lot of the technical development that has taken place in Irish farming, we would arguably say that the role of the contractor has been as significant, if not more significant, than many of the other bodies who are involved in farming because, let us not forget, that the role of the contractor is hugely dependent on the success of the farm business.  If the farm business is not financially successful then the contractor is out of business.  If the farm is not successful then other bodies that provide advice, though not intrinsically linked with the performance of the farm, then that does not affect their income, etc.  That is why our linkage to farmer clients is so important and that connection is extremely strong.  It is a connection in terms of advice but it is also a connection in terms of the financial viability of both sides of that equation.</p></speech>

He also mentioned the maintenance of machinery and knowing what actions to take in case of a pollution incident in a forest.  Can he indicate on what basis that starts on?  Can he tell us whether the Department has a responsibility to advise and monitor this aspect?</p></speech>

The Deputy will probably have heard the following message from the forest policy group, and that is to have the right trees in the right places but with the right management.  We all appreciate such an approach but forestry now has a different input in terms of society.  All society wants ownership of the forest sector and not just the people who grow the trees.  We are seeing that increasingly in terms of the output from the forest policy group.  There will be a number of public consultations around that area and around that mission statement of the right trees in the right place but with the right management.  They are very significant parts of what is happening.  It is important that when contractors work in a forest that their work function is more visible than many other people because they do the most significant work.  They are either digging and mounding, building roads or harvesting trees so one cannot hide a machine when doing such work.  One is very transparent and very obvious so that puts huge responsibility on forestry contractors to perform at the best level possible because how they perform impacts on how other people see forestry.  We want everyone to see forestry both in terms of being an amenity but also an industry because forestry is hugely important to this country.  Our percentage at 11% of the total land area is still too small but we will not get people involved in the sector unless we can all take ownership of what forestry is but do so on the basis that we develop the best standards.  When the forestry division within the Department is developing the management strategies they need to involve contractors in terms of what is and is not possible, and how that work can be done.  That is hugely important.</p></speech>

He spoke about the increase in the price of tyres and all of that.  Over the last couple of weeks we have discussed the price of fuel and energy costs.  I imagine that the increase in the price of fuel has had a massive effect on contractors.  Have they seen an impact on the farmers for whom they work?  Will the energy price increases hamper the ability of the members of the association and that of the farmers to manage their use of manure and slurry effectively?  I do not know which witness said that some contractors are talking about packing it all up.  If a large number of contractors decide to pack up due the increase in the price of fuel, etc., will the sector face a problem?</p></speech>

If the industry is sustainable then people will remain but right now the straws are piling up on the camel and there is not much space left for more.  There has been a constant stream of small incremental increases in terms of tyres, diesel and fuel.  Plus, trying to manage labour has been a huge issue.  Sometimes, when one wakes up on a Monday morning, one asks oneself why do I bother.  There is a little voice in the back of one's head that says keep going yet another voice says that one is mad so it is a matter of time.  One must liaise with clients and emphasise that if one does not get a price increase then one must find alternative work or retire early.  One must be open and transparent with clients and, hopefully, they will realise that they need local contractors because without local contractors farms will not be viable.  There is a symbiotic relationship between everybody.  Just like with the environment it is all symbiotic.  We, as contractors, are at the forefront of the relationship with farmer clients.  As Mr. Moroney mentioned earlier, we go back generations with farms.  We worked with farmers' grandparents years ago and now we are working with their grandchildren.  We have made a long-term investment in terms of time and careers with our partners who are farmers.</p></speech>

For the record, any opportunity that I have had at any of these meetings, whether it was with the Department or whoever else, I agree wholeheartedly that it is not possible to farm by calendar and we need to avail of scientific technologies.  Local knowledge is a big part of this too.  I come from a fairly northern part of the country and the further north one goes there is at least a month of a difference in climate and growth conditions between west Cork to the top of County Donegal.  Therefore, drawing a circle around a date on a map in Brussels does not work, should not work and should not even be relied on.  Anyone can see from the record that I have been consistent on this issue any time that we have had any of those meetings.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to the statement that the Department batted the formation of the FCI contractor register back to the organisation.  Before then had there been much consultation?  The FCI brought its register to the Department in May.  Did the Department indicate then what recognition it would give the register or what role it would view it as having?  Did the Department just treat the issue like it was a can to kick down the road?  Will the Department recognise the register when the association puts it together?</p> <p>  It has been stated in the submission that the FCI would like to see farm contractors have a greater role in the recording of the spreading of slurry and farmyard or organic manure when it comes to the record of the farmer?  I think that would be a massively beneficial move.  Has the Department indicated that it would facilitate the association having a role in such work if and when the Department recognises the register? </p> <p>  Most of my questions on NAP and TAMS have been asked so I will not repeat them.  I know that the brief today concerned NAP and TAMS but I have two questions on other issues.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the current labour situation and how the members of the association are managing.  We have heard that every sector has a scarcity or shortage of labour and that it is getting harder to secure good and appropriately qualified labour or employees.</p> <p>  My next issue relates to the many meetings that we have had on forestry and, again, this issue is outside of NAP and TAMS.  We get a dashboard every month so on paper there is an improvement in the number of licensing applications and the ones that are being turned around.  Have the forestry members of the association seen an improvement in terms of extra demand for afforestation, felling or roads?  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Have FCI members said the licensing situation has improved a small bit or is it just on paper?</p></speech>

We have continued to make representations to the Department on this point over the last four years and will continue to do so.  It is an important objective for us and it is important that we raise standards and have an identifiable way of doing so.  We will continue to work on that until we have something successful in place.  That should not be too far away as we have a good deal of work done on that.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Hughes, our chairman, to answer on labour.  He is quite close to dealing with that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#L00200"><p>Yes, labour is an issue.  It has been an issue for the last decade, probably, but it has come to the point where the pot has almost boiled dry and there is no water left in it.  What are we going to do?  I do not know.  Are we to rely on minors, and I use the word advisedly, those under 18 years, to drive very expensive tractors at what are sometimes dangerous speeds on the road?  They have not got proper training.  Training for tractor drivers is an issue for everybody.  They think they are God almighty and they are Michael Schumacher on the road.  Maybe nature takes over but that is the way it is.  We try to deal with the issue we have.  When people are stuck they have to find somebody to drive the tractor.  Otherwise they have to tell their clients that they have no one to drive the tractor and they will cut the silage whenever they can get to it.  At the moment, there are many farmers ringing up contractors with their TAMS-granted tankers sitting in the yard and they have no one to drive their own tractor in their own yard to pump their own slurry and bring it out in the fields.  They are contacting the contractors to do it.  Those contractors already have existing clients in the books who they booked in weeks ago and they are over-loaded with work.  They just cannot get it done.  It goes back to a point raised earlier.  Labour is an issue and will continue to be an issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moroney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022012600002#L00300"><p>To add to that, back in 2019 labour was becoming an issue.  We identified it as an issue that we would have to deal with and which would become more important in our sector.  We did apply to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to get a seasonal visa particularly for tractor operators.  We suggested that because we know from a lot of experience that at this time of year, during the winter period, that quite large numbers of young people from Ireland go to New Zealand to operate silage equipment in particular.  Many of contractors' sons or people who are contracting during their formative years, went to New Zealand and operated machinery.  We cannot provide them with a reciprocal agreement here which is very unfortunate.  We did apply to get specialist visas from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa because the seasonal workload would suit.  Many of the same machines are being used.  Many Irish-built machines are being used both in the southern hemisphere and here at home.  The seasonal nature would have allowed New Zealand drivers to come here for our summer, which is their winter, and for us to have our drivers go to New Zealand for their harvesting period.  That made a lot of sense.  The pandemic and so on came along and that affected it and there were some constraints around Irish people going to New Zealand because it became a very closed economy because of Covid.  However, longer term, we have applied for visas to allow operators in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in particular where the equipment is equivalent, the people are English speaking and have an agricultural economy quite similar to ours.  Therefore, the transition from driving in New Zealand or Australia would not be that difficult so as to come here.  Some of our counterparts in Europe, particularly Germany, Holland and Belgium, have engaged with operators from further eastern Europe, with countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, but they have had significant problems with regard to understanding of machines.  The level of technology was not present for them there and there was also a language problem going onto farms.  None of those problems would arise if we had drivers on a seasonal visa.  If a driver comes to us from New Zealand for one season they cannot come back on a visa for a second season.  We believe that is a ridiculous situation.  There is a real opportunity because of the seasonality of much of our work and in the southern hemisphere.  It makes so much sense.  Irish farm machinery companies are testing machines with Irish people in New Zealand to have them available for the world market.  We should use the same logic and strategy.  We have applied to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this.  For us to get a visa, the process is highly complicated and is simply not affordable in the current circumstances.  We would love to have some support from the committee to move that on further.</p></speech>

Generally, they are improving.  There is one significant thing evident from dashboard which we get a copy of each week.  There has been an increase in the level of harvesting but there has not been a proportionate increase in the level of afforestation.  That is a concern because if we do not plant trees we cannot harvest them.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair.  I welcome Mr. Moroney and his colleagues representing the farm and forestry contractors.  I can identify with everything that has been said here.  I have been a contractor and have been a farmer, and I am still, and have been all my life.  I started out with a Ferguson 135, cutting hay with a finger bar mower all around the parish, then going on to get a wonderful machine - a rotary mower - and so forth.  I made forestry roads.  They were endless roads.  I know what it is all about, what is required and the tough work that it is.  There has been a lot of talk about costs of repairs and replacing parts.  I understand that.  The availability of parts is an awful problem for everyone at the moment, especially since Brexit.  Brexit has created an increased difficulty in sourcing parts for everyone in the plant hire business, whether they are farmers or contractors.  There is also the cost of diesel and the increased cost of tyres, hydraulic oil and plastic.  All those things have gone up.  We have to ensure that the farmer can keep going because if they cannot the contractors will not be on the road either.  Myself and others have made representations on the cost of fertiliser today.  It is a very serious matter because if it is not addressed it will affect everyone on the road and everyone who has a wheel, whether it is a tractor, lorry or whatever other kind of equipment.</p> <p>  I support the call that they would be able to access TAMS grants but I do not concur with the idea that farmers should not be getting the grants.  There was a lot of talk about tractors being parked in yards and no one to drive them.  We all know how hard it is to get a contractor to do the work on the day that you want to do it.  For that reason, I have kept a certain amount of equipment so that I can cut my silage on the day that I want to cut it.  In Kerry, it is very hard to get contractors.  They will not all come on the day it is dry and you may finish up when it is pouring rain, which is of no use, as the witnesses know.</p><p>I would not like farmers to be deprived of the right to get a TAMS grant as well as contractors.  I support contractors getting the grant.  The difficulty, however, which I know the Chairman understands, is that the cost of machinery has gone greatly recently but the TAMS grants have not followed in kind.  We need to address that issue.  The Government and the Department need to address it to ensure the grants go up in line with the cost of machinery.  This was pointed out to me by a farmer the other day.  He bought a slurry spreader and trailing shoe or whatever it was about a year and a half ago for &euro;30,000.  The same machine now costs &euro;42,000 in the cheapest place he could get it.  The grant needs to go up accordingly because costs have gone up.</p><p> I welcome the attendance of our guests.  I understand what they go through and every nut and bolt they have to deal with, as well as all the problems they have.  If we do not keep replacing and repairing machinery, all we will finish up with is a heap of it inside in the yard and the only thing it will be good for is to send to Hammond Lane.  I know the trouble contractors have keeping their equipment up to date.  I was glad to hear our guests talking about modern equipment for monitoring the spreading of fertiliser and all that.  I wish them well.  I support their request to be included in the TAMS grant but the way I was brought up is that you should not try to put other people down while putting yourself up.  I am asking them again to desist from suggesting that farmers should not get grants for their equipment and everything will be fine after that.</p></speech>

There is no question of only contractors getting grants.  There must be parity and fairness.  If farmers can get grant aid for machines, then contractors should be able to get it too.  We are not about excluding anybody.  We are talking about a level playing field.</p></speech>

It was a worthwhile presentation.  I may not agree 100% with everything they said today but what I agree with fundamentally is that the farming sector cannot survive without contractors.  We need a viable contract service.  It is more important now than it ever was.  I fully support that.  The committee will keep in correspondence with the FCI.  If it has points it wishes to make, this forum is open to it.  We have had a very good exchange of views.  Our guests made a very good presentation that outlined the problems facing their sector, which are very difficult, it must be admitted.  Although rising costs are affecting farmers, they will also have a serious impact on contractors.  There are labour shortages.  I refer to the need to embrace modern technology and the benefit of such technology in the reduction of emissions, which is a target to which the industry has to face up to.  There is a need to use all that modern technology to that end.  I accept there are significant benefits to be had from embracing it.  Members have made the point that some of the machinery that is needed cannot just be on an individual farm basis.  It may be that a contractor can afford such machinery and could work for a cohort of farmers.  I thank our guests for their presentation.  That concludes our proceedings for today.  Does Mr. Hughes wish to comment?</p></speech>

We look forward to a future invitation to provide any additional information they may require.  After all, we are at the coalface of the industry, as are farmers.  We can and will respond as and when required, provided we get the support to keep us in tractors in fields doing the work to get Ireland into a position where we can be proud of our agricultural industry, environment and environmental targets.</p></speech>

It is our first meeting of this year.  I welcome members to this committee meeting, in line with the current exceptional measures that we are taking in relation to public health which, fortunately, we are phasing out.  Some members will participate remotely, while others will be here in the committee room.  If members wish to participate remotely in the meeting, it must be from within the Leinster House complex, as they are aware.  We have received apologies from Senator Paul Gavan.</p> <p>  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene.  They will notice that certain seating has been removed in order to facilitate social distancing.  Hopefully, we will remove that measure shortly.  Members should maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for everyone's co-operation in this.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is to discuss with IDA Ireland its strategy, targets, achievements and projected future progress.  Since the joint committee last met IDA Ireland, the inward investment, promotion and development agency announced results for its activities in 2021.  The year was characterised by significant, high levels of foreign direct investment compared with 2020, with strong gains recorded in both growth and net employment.  I am pleased that, today, we have an opportunity to consider this matter.  I welcome from IDA Ireland, Mr. Martin Shanahan, chief executive officer, Ms Mary Buckley, executive director, Mr. Denis Curran, divisional manager, and Ms Breda O'Sullivan.</p> <p>  Before we start, I advise witnesses about parliamentary privilege.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses with regard to reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it is appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, I will direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statement of IDA Ireland has been circulated to all members.  To commence consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. Shanahan to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by Mary Buckley, executive director of IDA Ireland, Denis Curran, divisional manager with responsibility for regions, property and enterprise development, and Breda O&rsquo;Sullivan, manager of corporate strategy and planning.</p> <p>  The last two years have been extraordinarily challenging for the country and its citizens as the Covid-19 pandemic claimed lives and livelihoods.  Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.  We acknowledge those who have been on the front line of the public health response and those who have provided essential services to keep the country functioning and in motion, including those involved in the manufacture of critical goods and services.  We welcome the recent removal of restrictions as the country emerges from the pandemic.</p> <p>  During this period of dual health and economic crises, IDA Ireland has strived to support the country and our client companies.  In reacting rapidly to the impacts of Covid-19 in early 2020, IDA Ireland's priorities were to provide continuity of service to client companies, while ensuring the safety and well-being of the IDA Ireland team in Ireland and across the globe.  The agency successfully moved to a virtual working environment in March 2020 and proved resilient and flexible in continuing to deliver on our mission as we adopted a virtual first approach to client engagement, similar to the response of many of our client companies.</p> <p>  These efforts have helped us to achieve excellent results over the course of the pandemic, despite an immensely challenging and volatile international environment.  The year 2021 was a record-breaking year for foreign direct investment employment with strong gains recorded in both gross and net employment.  Total employment in IDA Ireland client companies in Ireland now stands at a record high of more than 275,000, an increase of nearly 17,000 compared with 2020.  Employment growth was particularly strong with over 29,000 jobs created across all sectors.  The growth was strongest in life sciences and technology companies as demand for healthcare products remained robust and demand for the technologies and services that enable remote working and the digital economy increased.  Job losses remained at a relatively modest level relative to the size of the overall portfolio, resulting in extremely strong net employment growth this year.  There are now close to 1,700 multinational operations supported by IDA Ireland, accounting directly for 11% of the workforce.  Analysis undertaken, using a modest multiplier, indicates that it amounted to total direct and indirect employment of over 495,000 in 2021.</p> <p>  In 2021, there were 249 investments compared with 246 investments in the same period in the previous year.  Some 104 of those investments were from new name investors coming to Ireland for the first time.  The high level of new name investments represents a vote of confidence in Ireland and a level of future proofing of foreign direct investment.</p> <p>  Growth in regions was particularly buoyant in 2021 with 53%, which is 133 of the 249 investments won going to regional locations and employment growth recorded in every region of the country.  Direct employment by IDA clients in the regions reached 151,676 people in 2021, 55% of total IDA client employment.  The strong regional results in 2021 are building on the record levels of regional investment we secured over the course of the last strategy, supported by IDA Ireland&rsquo;s property programme.</p> <p>  The strength of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign direct investment base is a core national asset that has a sizeable impact on the Irish economy and on society more broadly.  In each region of the country, companies supported by IDA Ireland provide good jobs, support other jobs indirectly, enable labour mobility, purchase Irish goods and services, and promote innovation.  The benefit of their presence here to Ireland is obvious in the context of their contribution to employment but it goes far beyond their direct and indirect employment contribution.  Their impact nationally and regionally on public finances, regional development, global value chain integration, spin-off indigenous enterprise, innovation and more can be clearly seen in their expenditure in the Irish economy.  We now know from the forthcoming annual business survey of economic impact that expenditure within the economy by foreign direct investment companies increased by 8.8% during 2020 to close to &euro;28 billion.  Within that, payroll spend was &euro;16.9 billion, an increase of 11%, and the spend on materials and services increased by 6% to &euro;11 billion.  Exports were valued at &euro;290.7 billion, an increase of 9.2% compared with 2019.  IDA Ireland client exports accounted for 72% of total national exports in 2020.</p> <p>  Capital investment amounted to &euro;7.5 billion, an increase of 3.7% compared with 2019, with the largest spend once again coming from the life sciences and technology sectors.  This resilience and growth from foreign direct investment has shored up our economy and the national finances.  Their contribution to Ireland is tangible, substantive and something IDA Ireland does not take for granted.</p> <p>  Foreign direct investment in Ireland has experienced staircase growth in employment for over ten years, linked to successful foreign direct investment strategies.  Despite the challenges faced by individual companies, foreign direct investment in Ireland has come through the pandemic relatively well.</p><p>This is largely down to the sectors that IDA Ireland has targeted over the past decade, namely, technology, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, international financial services, business services, engineering and food.</p><p> This year&rsquo;s results represent a strong start to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024 strategy, which seeks to further enhance FDI&rsquo;s place at the centre of a strong Irish economy.  We launched this strategy in January 2021.  In a changed world, our strategy seeks to consolidate, build on and position the impact of FDI as Ireland pursues a jobs-led recovery, that seizes on the opportunities of the green and technological transformations.  IDA Ireland will partner with client companies, as we have in the past, to create jobs, locate them in the regions, and invest in research and development, while enhancing our focus on investment in training and upskilling and environmental sustainability. </p><p> The ambition of the strategy is framed around five interlinked pillars which include the following key targets: the growth pillar, within which we will target 800 total investments to support the creation of 50,000 jobs; the transformation pillar, under which we will partner with clients for future growth through 170 research, development and innovation, RDI, projects and 130 training investments; the regional development pillar, under which we will target 400 investments to advance regional development; the sustainability pillar, under which we will target 60 sustainability investments; and the impact pillar, under which we will target a 20% increase in client expenditure in Ireland to maximise the impact of FDI.  </p><p> Delivery of the strategy is being supported by a several initiatives, including: IDA Ireland&rsquo;s regional property programme to provide property and strategic site solutions to address market failures in regional locations; the completion of the national advanced manufacturing centre, NAMC, in Limerick to provide a space for companies to trial, adopt, deploy and scale digital technologies; the scaling of the national institute for bioprocessing research and training, NIRBT, to build capacity in cell, gene and vaccine therapies, CGVT; and the implementation of a digital transformation programme to make IDA Ireland the most digitally-enabled investment promotion agency, IPA, in the world.  </p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s performance in attracting FDI to achieve these record results is testament to the work of the agency&rsquo;s teams in Ireland and around the world, to the success of the client companies we partner with daily, to the support of Government and those in the public and private sectors that support the work of IDA Ireland.  However, we cannot rest on our laurels.  Ireland must remain attractive in an extremely competitive global environment for FDI.  IDA Ireland's clients are embracing a green and digital recovery, and we must continue to focus on making Ireland an attractive place for talent and to provide the necessary infrastructure and utilities that companies need to make it easy to set up and build their businesses in Ireland. </p><p> IDA Ireland is also cognisant of international issues, including: the spread of Covid-19 variants of concern; the varying level of vaccination rates across countries; the future trajectory of monetary and fiscal policies, should current inflationary pressures last longer than expected over the course of 2022, and indeed beyond; supply chain challenges; climate change; and geopolitical developments that will potentially impact on investors&rsquo; decision-making. </p><p> This is a high-level overview of some of the factors relating to FDI, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s performance and our strategic focus.  I have also provided a slide deck for members&rsquo; information.  I do not plan to go through the details of that, but I am happy to take questions on it.</p></speech>

There is merit to the France 2030 plan.  It is a plan, though, that suits France, I suppose.  Investment in the economy is welcome, and especially investment in infrastructure that will make it easier for businesses, domestic and FDI, to operate in the economy.  Ireland's industrial policy is, essentially, centred around three strands: attracting FDI; growing indigenous enterprises and helping them to scale; and investing in research, development and innovation to help the other two strands.  Those three strands are complementary, as I see it, because once we attract FDI, then there are significant spill-over effects into the indigenous economy.  Part of our current strategy is to help solidify and to grow those impacts.  Those impacts grow in many ways, including through the spending of FDI companies on Irish materials and services and through the transfer of people and know-how.</p> <p>  It is a hugely competitive international environment.  All countries, not just France, are investing heavily in their infrastructure and in other aspects of their industrial policies to continue to ensure they are fit for purpose to allow them to compete in the international market.  I see it at first hand every day as we are out with investors.  There is merit in looking at whatever is being done to see if there are lessons we can learn.</p></speech>

There is merit in looking at that aspect.  It should be examined seriously and in the way that France appears to be doing it.  I must confess that I am basing this on news reports.  There is significant merit in examining how that can be done and how we can learn from that approach.  I accept fully that it is being done.</p> <p>  Turning to Intel's planned expansion and additional investment, it increasingly looks like the State will miss out on it.  Some of the reasons put forward to explain why we will not be winning this investment include issues with housing, the cost of energy, transport and education.  I refer to the cost of energy in the context of sustainability.  I believe, and I think this view is shared by others, that this development is something of a tip of the iceberg regarding such difficulties.  We had a session with the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, NCPC, recently, and those witnesses referred specifically to problems concerning housing, transport and the other issues mentioned.  They said that: "The attractiveness of a location cannot be focused solely on it as a place to work, but also on it as a place to live".  Does Mr. Shanahan share the view that for us to remain an attractive location for investment that the crisis we have in housing, as well as the one looming in energy and those not far behind in education and transport, must be addressed?  If we do not do that, does he believe that this situation will be a significant drag, as it is proving to be in the case of Intel?  I say that knowing the final decision has not been made, but the indications are that we will lose out on that investment.  There are crippling pressures in this regard.  That is certainly the case when we meet with major investors, but also with representatives from industry.  They cite housing specifically, but I must be honest and say the other issues are not too far behind.  Housing, education and transport come together to contribute to perhaps this not being a great place to live for everybody.  Is this context going to hinder our competitiveness and capacity to attract investment in future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#B00600"><p>As the Deputy mentioned, no decision has been communicated by Intel regarding what its plan is to build its super-fabrication plant in Europe.</p><p>Intel is one of the largest investors in the country.  It is currently building in Leixlip two of the most advanced semiconductor fabrication plants on the planet.  Its investment in Ireland is immense and will continue to be very significant for many years to come.  It has decided that its foundry business will commence in Leixlip.  We will continue to work with Intel on all its future plans.</p><p> I am a member of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, so I have contributed to some of those findings that it shared with the Deputy.  It is clear that we must continue to improve on all aspects of our offering in order to remain competitive.  I do not think there will ever be a day when a CEO of IDA Ireland will appear before the committee and say that all is well and that we are as competitive as we can be.  It is clear that we have to continue to improve.  The Deputy mentioned certain areas, as has IDA Ireland, in which improvement is required in order for us to remain competitive.  Those areas include housing and the availability of utilities, such as energy and water in particular, and others.</p><p> Ireland is clearly competitive on many fronts.  That is why we had the ability to win the number of investments we won in recent years, particularly in the past year.  Employment is increasing in the FDI sector because multinationals have confidence in Ireland.  We should not take that confidence for granted.  We have to do the things we need to do to remain competitive in all the areas the Deputy mentioned.  We have to improve in many of those areas because all our competitors are doing so.  Our competitors, however, are not without difficulties.  I speak to my peers and investors every day and the locations against which we are competing also have difficulties, many of them in similar areas.  We have to do more and continue to do more.  These are issues.  In many cases, they are not unique to Ireland.  Obviously, we have many strengths that allow us to attract investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#C00200"><p>I do not dispute that our competitors have issues too, but there is nobody competing with us in terms of rising house prices and, indeed, other prices.  It is not for nothing that this issue is raised with me very regularly.  I appreciate the response of Mr. Shanahan and I thank him for it.</p><p>I refer to remarks made previously by Mr. Shanahan.  He stated: </p> <blockquote> 	It is great to see Ireland continuing to attract investment and playing such an important part in the future plans of this global company.  Amazon&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to Ireland is most welcome, </blockquote> <p>Obviously, in my role I speak to small and medium-sized enterprises, microbusinesses and family businesses.  They are probably on the small end of the scale compared with what our guests are dealing with but they are the backbone of many towns and villages nonetheless.  They were quite shocked by those comments.  Amazon's business model undermines small and local enterprises in many instances.  The evidence of that is all around it.  We know its record in respect of workers' rights, especially its use of bogus self-employment and other mechanisms.  All of those have been well ventilated and reported, specifically in respect of delivery drivers.  I raise this issue because I wish to ask whether it is the strategy of IDA Ireland to pursue quality as much as it is to pursue quantity.  There are companies that will deliver on quantity - the stack them high, sell them cheap sort of level - but they may not deliver on the quality end.  I ask Mr. Shanahan to enlighten us.  I refer to the record of this company in particular.  I have spoken to colleagues working within the global trade union movement, such as within the International Labour Organization and other organisations, and I know what they would tell Mr. Shanahan in this regard.  They do not need to tell him as I am sure he knows anyway.  It is that issue of whether it is quality over quantity or <i>vice versa</i>.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  First, Amazon, and Amazon Web Services, AWS, in particular, are huge investors in Ireland and provide significant employment.  Second, we have to be somewhat realistic in respect of where the world is going and the business models that will be deployed.  One of those business models is the ability to operate, purchase and sell online.  If ever there was evidence needed that that is the direction of travel, we have probably observed it over the past two years.  Whether we like it or not, it is going to be a fact of life going forward.  The large players, including Amazon, will be key players in this.  If there are specific issues relating to a company, there are apparatus of the State to deal with those specific issues.</p> <p>  As regards the Deputy's question regarding our strategy of quantity over quality, it is clear we are attracting high-quality jobs.  The evidence for that is probably in the fact that the wage levels in multinational companies, on average, are approximately one and a half times the annual industrial wage.  Our strategy has been to target the sectors that underpin the modern economy - technology, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, international financial services, engineering and food - and to attract the leading-edge activity within those companies, that is, research and development, innovation and high-value manufacturing.  That is our strategy.  Obviously, that is not to say that every job in multinational companies is at that level.  That would be unrealistic.  There are sectors that we are likely to transition out of because that activity may not happen in Ireland in the future.  All of these companies bring with them jobs at all levels, particularly in the context of support jobs.  To be clear, our strategy is to attract high-value and well-paid employment with good terms and conditions.  There should be no doubt about that.</p></speech>

Does IDA Ireland encompass issues such as bogus self-employment within its strategy?  The company might be paying a good wage to the people who issue the contracts to the poor unfortunates who are doing the delivery.  The chief executive might be paid very well and that will always drag up the average but, at the business end of things, there might be workers who are at one remove from the company.  I am curious to know what level of discussion there is between IDA Ireland and these companies in advance of investment.  I am conscious, as is the Chairman, I am sure, that my time is almost up, but I am sure he will indulge me by allowing Mr. Shanahan to respond.</p></speech>

As regards the level of discussions, when IDA Ireland looks at investments, we seek from client companies the breakdown of employment they will create in Ireland - this is where it is supported by IDA Ireland - and what level of pay those jobs will attract.  I do not have the detail in respect of a specific company.  We have more than 1,700 companies so I do not have that information to hand, and neither would it be appropriate to discuss the pay structures within an individual company.</p></speech>

I offer them a sincere "Well done" on their recent accomplishments.  To have the highest employment creation figures ever in a single year would be a noteworthy accomplishment at any time, but it is all the more so given that it happened in the midst of a global pandemic.</p> <p>  On the issue of future aims and in the context of job creation, what impact do our guests expect the global minimum tax rate to have?  Obviously, there is a host of factors companies consider when deciding in which country they will set up.</p><p>Ireland has many other very strong selling points, including, thankfully, a highly educated population, as we are all aware.  Notwithstanding that, I presume that the tax changes will reduce Ireland's attractiveness to some extent.  In what way does Mr. Shanahan envisage dealing with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#D00200"><p>Yes, I think the increase to 15% under the OECD agreement is likely to have some effect in that it decreases our attractiveness on that front marginally, but the Senator pointed out in his questioning that it is but one factor in Ireland's overall offering.  I do not believe that Ireland's entering into the global tax agreement and the new rate of 15% will have a significant impact on the flows of FDI into Ireland.  That is partly because we are doing this in unison with the rest of the world.  The new global minimum will be 15%.  Many countries' rates will remain above 15%.  The stability and certainty that our involvement in the global agreement will bring will, I think, offset the marginal increase to 15% that we will experience.  I therefore do not see it as a significant impact as we go forward.  Many of the investments that have been made over the course of the past year, particularly those from March on, were probably made in the knowledge that it was highly likely that this global agreement would come into being and that it was likely that Ireland would participate in it if the circumstances were right.  Investors have therefore demonstrated already that they have continued confidence in Ireland in the context of this global agreement.</p></speech>

In what way does Mr. Shanahan envisage we will change?  The figures this year have been excellent and those in the previous 12 to 18 months have been brilliant, but does Mr. Shanahan believe we will face other challenges in trying to get new companies to locate here?</p></speech>

My colleagues and I go out every day to compete for investments that every other developed country in the world would like to locate in their countries.  We are therefore competing against not only other European countries but also, in many cases, other countries globally.  We therefore need to continually improve our entire offering, as I mentioned to Deputy O'Reilly earlier.  All the factors that make up our proposition, whether housing, the ability to do one's business quickly in Ireland, the availability of utilities, roads and broadband, or the tax offering and other pro-enterprise policies, will be hugely important, as will talent.  The availability of talent and our ability to attract it to and to retain it in Ireland will be really attractive.  That means that Ireland has to be an attractive place in which to live and work.  Those are the things companies are concerned about and the things that will determine whether or not we will be able to win investment.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Shanahan advise as to whether our current planning system is causing concerns for any companies he speaks to when they are making decisions to set up base here?</p></speech>

That was connected to the elongated time it took to receive planning permission.  From an IDA perspective and from our clients' perspective, it is important to say that we all understand that there need to be appropriate checks and balances within the system.  There is no question about that.  What client companies seek is certainty on timelines, that is, a timeline within which they get the decision.  That is not certainty of outcome.  The outcome is whatever it is, and we should go through the normal processes with the normal checks and balances.  The timelines, however, are elongated in Ireland, and anything that shortens those timelines would be helpful.  That is the main issue.  I would separate the planning process from the ensuing judicial process that happens in respect of many large projects.  It is often the judicial stage that takes a long time and that projects are held up in.</p></speech>

I refer to the IDA site in Oranmore, Galway.  I am conscious that the witnesses can give us only limited information this morning.  Mr. Shanahan highlighted earlier the value and the enormity of the Intel operation in this country.  Will IDA Ireland maximise the site in Oranmore in the coming months?  At what stage will a decision be made on the Oranmore site?  As Mr. Shanahan will be aware, it is a hugely significant site, is very well located and has been idle for quite a while.</p></speech>

We are marking it hard and will continue to do so over the coming weeks, months and years.  That is not connected to just an individual project.  It is an attractive site and we hope we will be successful in attracting investment to it in due course.  When that will be I cannot say for certain.</p></speech>

I wish to say how much we congratulate and appreciate the team's work throughout the world.  The achievement of 129,000 extra jobs in the past decade, going from 146,000 to 275,000 employed in IDA companies, is truly remarkable.  Also remarkable is the fact that the IDA has increased the number of projects per year by 100.  It has achieved a regional spread far better than was the case at the start of the decade.  The average pay of employees in IDA companies, at &euro;61,500, is significantly higher than in the rest of the economy.  We owe a significant debt of gratitude to Mr. Shanahan and his team.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a few questions as we look ahead.  If this economy continues to sustain full employment, will IDA Ireland's focus change to more spin-out, higher value-added activities, with the creation of more enterprise hubs within these large companies such that one might see growth that would be closer to indigenous growth?  Goods and services purchased, at &euro;11 billion, account for less than 4% of the exports IDA Ireland reports.  The figure is low.  I think there were trade missions within Ireland on which Enterprise Ireland companies sought to increase their purchases from those companies.  How is that going, and can we drive it further?  Allied to that, can we see greater integration of multinational companies in areas such as apprenticeships?  It is a very significant objective of the Government to increase the number of new paths for people rather than relying solely on the higher education path.  I do not think there is high involvement of multinationals in that sector.</p> <p>  The issue of power and data centres has been a subject of controversy, and there is a difference of view between the IDA and EirGrid, though I know work is ongoing to reconcile that.  Just how significant will that be in the context of the development of the IDA's portfolio of companies?</p> <p>  Finally, regarding climate change, many of these international companies will want to be seen to be moving to net zero.</p><p>Is IDA Ireland cultivating that approach?  We have set the second most ambitious climate targets in the world for the next decade.  How is that being integrated into IDA Ireland's strategy?  No doubt we will see border controls applied by Europe to countries that do not apply the same high standards in climate adaptation.  Will it have significant bearing on the approach that IDA Ireland takes in the coming years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#E00200"><p>It is clear that in an economy that is likely to be working close to capacity given the very significant recovery in employment, talent availability will continue to be an issue.  Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to target high-value activity, particularly around research, development and innovation but also corporate functions and high-value manufacturing.  That is where we are pitching so that we are maximising the available talent within the economy.  Related to the Deputy's last point, multinationals have a role to play in investing in talent and do a lot of that within their own sites.  That is where we are going.  Within sectors, we have targeted specific activities.  For instance, Ireland was very successful at advanced pharmaceutical ingredients and at bioprocessing.  We believe the next front in that sector will be selegiline therapy and advanced therapeutic medicinal products.  We are working on those types of activities to ensure that we are continuing to capture the high-value activity.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned the programme initiative that is connecting multinationals to indigenous companies and trying to increase the amount that is purchased in the Irish economy of both services and Irish companies' products.  I think that has been successful.  It is reflected in the figures of the year-on-year increase in services and materials being supplied to multinational companies.  However, I agree that there is room for more integration.  Often these companies are making decisions about entering global supply chains.  It is not just for the Irish operation to purchase here but that the whole organisation is able to purchase within Ireland.  Our view, and one shared by Enterprise Ireland, is that clusters have a role to play here.  It is about setting up clusters where we deepen the integration between indigenous companies and multinational companies at every level, not only in the straightforward procurement channel but how products are developed in the first place, sharing of know-how and about greater integration.  We have set up a number of clusters as a pilot in order to do that.<br/><br/>I certainly believe that companies in the IDA Ireland portfolio have a role, or an increased role, to play in apprenticeships.  It is something on which we are heavily engaged with all the relevant parties here in terms of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research and Innovation, SOLAS and the local training boards, to look at opportunities for how multinationals can support their efforts and <i>vice versa</i>.  Within IDA Ireland we have set up a talent transformation and innovation department to engage with those stakeholders to ensure that talent lens is brought to what we are doing.<br/><br/>On power and data centres, I think that EirGrid and IDA Ireland's ambitions are aligned on the need for available power for large energy users.  We are seeking a reinforced grid and enough generation for large energy users.  That is not unique to data centres.  It is clear that we are now constrained in Dublin and on the east coast.  Where investors seeking significant amounts of energy, regardless of the sector, there is a challenge to supply that.  There is an EirGrid plan, &quot;Shaping our Electricity Future&quot;, which we support and we would like to see executed as quickly as practicable.  </p></speech>

I join with Deputy Bruton in congratulating them on the work they have been doing for the last while.  It is hugely impressive.</p> <p>  This morning Bank of Ireland announced five remote working hubs or spaces in addition to their existing six.  Is there a conversation in the client companies of IDA Ireland and in the authority itself to encourage and support remote working spaces and hubs?  Thankfully, many thousands of people are in employment with IDA Ireland companies but many travel long distances where they could actually work in their own towns or areas and rejuvenate them.  I am thinking of the town of Youghal in my own area where many people travel every day and spend a lot of time in their cars.  It would improve the quality of life enormously if they could be encouraged and supported to work in their own communities in remote working spaces.  Is that conversation happening?  Is any of the companies looking at that?</p> <p>  I noticed that there have not been many announcements in the Cork area recently.  I spoke with Construction Industry Federation recently where it spoke of the lack of serviced sites in the Cork area with respect to the IDA Ireland land bank.  Will Mr. Shanahan comment on that? </p> <p>  Between Carrigtwohill and Midleton in my own constituency there is a very large site of around 54 ha, which Amgen was interested in about ten or 12 years ago.  That did not happen.  That site has been just sitting there.  It is fully serviced and extremely valuable but nothing is happening on it.  It has been said that the constraints posed by infrastructure, the N25, is making the site less attractive.  Most recently Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has decided not to go ahead with a planned upgrade of that site.  Is Mr. Shanahan aware of that?  Is he concerned about it?  Will he comment on the issue?</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton mentioned data centres and Mr. Shanahan covered that.  Is the EirGrid ban, which I understand is in place, a constraint in attracting large companies to the east coast in particular?  </p> <p>  On diversity and client companies looking after people from marginalised backgrounds, refugees and people from disadvantage, I note that many IDA Ireland companies have signed up to the Open Doors initiative which was established about three years ago.  I want to say well done to the companies that have joined it.  They are looking at diversity and supporting people from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain employment, training, support and mentoring.  I am not sure if Mr. Shanahan is aware of it but it is a very exciting initiative.  </p></speech>

I would probably beg to differ.  During 2021, there were announcements from Convergint, Alter Domas, Boston Scientific, Zazzle, Eli Lilly, Qorvo, Accenture, which announced 500 jobs, Varonis, Tigera, Innowatts, Microchip, Huawei, Logitech, Mediallia, SGS and CH Robinson.  That is not all of them, just those I have to hand.</p><p>There were a significant number of announcements.  There was also a 3% increase in employment in the Cork region during the past year.  Cork, as our second city, is probably very well served by FDI.  </p><p>Regarding the site at Ballyadam, the Deputy's question related to the attractiveness of the site and the road infrastructure leading to it.  IDA Ireland markets that site on a regular basis.  We believe it is an attractive site.  There are developments to the N25.  Anything that increases access to strategic sties is extremely important from our perspective and very welcome from the perspective of the companies with which we engage.  We are doing some work on access to that site with respect to a slip road that is currently under planning.  The application is being considered and once that work is done I hope it will increase the attractiveness of the site.  The development of the overall N25 should increase the attractiveness of that site.  We will continue to market that site.</p><p> On the Deputy's question on attracting large companies to the east coast, as I mentioned, it is clear and has been heavily reported, that Dublin and the east region is constrained from a supply of electricity perspective and that poses a challenge for large energy users that wish to invest in Dublin or the east coast.  IDA Ireland will work with client companies with existing operations in that region on their expansions.  We are heavily engaged with EirGrid on a regular basis on both individual projects and the overall availability of energy supply.  We will also work with investors to target regional locations outside Dublin and the east coast where the energy grid supports both investment in infrastructure and the ability to scale and expand.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the Open Doors initiative.  I am familiar with it.  IDA Ireland and a number of our client companies are members of it.  I agree with the Deputy that it is an excellent initiative.   </p><p> Returning to the issue of remote working hubs and remote working in general, the FDI base has proved to be very flexible and resilient during the past 24 months.  Obviously, many employees such as those working in manufacturing companies, have to go into work.  However, many companies pivoted to a completely virtual environment during the period where employees had to work remotely but primarily from home.  That has worked very well.  It has worked well for individuals and for the companies involved.  My expectation is that in a post-Covid environment, and we hope it is post-Covid, with employees, in some instances, potentially returning to the office, many employers will offer flexibility.  Some of that will relate to the ability to work remotely at home or in remote working hubs.  There are a significant number of remote working hubs across the country.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Curran, to comment on this area.</p></speech>

I want to explore the issue of data centres and what can be described as the leading role of the IDA Ireland in attracting data centres to Ireland.  There is a number of items on the IDA Ireland website about data centres, including one which features a quote from Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, quite prominently, where he talks about the number of data centres in Ireland and says they have helped to &ldquo;turn Ireland from a small island into a data superpower&rdquo;.  Does Mr. Shanahan think Ireland is a data superpower and what does that mean?</p></speech>

The IT services sector, of which data centres are a part, account for &euro;52 billion, or 16%, of the gross value added in the economy.  The number employed in the sector is approximately 140,000.  Those are very significant and high-value jobs.  Ireland has moved from a situation where we did not have that kind of technology sector to having that kind of technology sector.</p></speech>

I will return to my question.  I am not talking about the technology sector in general; I am talking about data centres.

How many people are employed in permanent jobs in data centres in Ireland?</p></speech>

Data centres are part of an overall technology sector.  I cannot speak for what Brad Smith meant by a technology superpower.  The Deputy will have to ask him that.  The large FDI technology companies that have significant data centres in Ireland employ approximately 20,000 people.</p></speech>

The talk of Ireland being a big data superpower is about buttering us up.  Ireland is simply a dumping ground for data.  It brings very few positives in terms of long-term jobs, with which Mr. Shanahan agrees, even if the number employed in them in the thousands, which is a small number of jobs, and more likely the number is the hundreds.  Already 17% of our electricity usage goes on data centres and their water consumption is very high.  That is incompatible with meeting our climate target.   It points to it being in a completely opposite direction.  There is a reason other European countries may have decided not to become the dumping ground for the data of big tech, would Mr. Shanahan agree?</p></speech>

First, as I understand it, data centres account for 11% of energy usage, not 17%.  As I pointed out to the Deputy, data centres are a component of the technology sector and we have benefited greatly from that sector.  I have given him some of the employment figures but the spend in the economy is extraordinarily significant, not to mention the very significant tax take from those companies.  To focus solely on the jobs within the data centre is not the correct lens to use.  I would also point out that many Irish companies are sub-supplying into data centres and are involved in building data centres across the globe as a result of us having these data centres in Ireland.   Data is going to be at the centre of just about everything we will need to do from an enterprise perspective into the future.  On the Deputy's characterisation of dumping data, from my perspective, data is likely to be a very valuable asset as we move forward in terms of where it is held, how it is processed and what companies do with data into the future.</p></speech>

Data centres will be key to underpinning that.  Where companies need data-centre solutions, we will engage in that regard.  I have already told other Deputies that the centres are unlikely to be located in Dublin and along the east coast; they are likely to be located beyond those regions.</p></speech>

On working with data centres specifically, it is agnostic.  I am referring to anywhere we can achieve improvements through climate action, decarbonisation, reduced energy usage and increased biodiversity.  We are agnostic in relation to the sector; we will work with all companies that are trying to contribute to the Government's overall decarbonisation plan.</p></speech>

The problem is that while the figure of 11% was correct, it is up to 17% at this stage.  It keeps rising because we keep adding more data centres to the grid.  That is a problem because attempting to move to renewable energy is very difficult if the amount of energy used is being increased.  If we continue to use more and more power in data centres, it will make it extremely difficult to achieve our climate targets.  Does IDA Ireland not see that?  Is it not operating in line with our climate targets?</p></speech>

A key pillar of our strategy is sustainability.  A part of our long-term energy plan is to develop offshore wind.  Offshore wind should become a reality.  My prediction is that it will be.  There are significant amounts of wind energy required.  Stable demand will be required, and data centres provide that stable demand.  Data will be key.  Without data centres and the ability of data centres to process data, this meeting would not be happening virtually.</p></speech>

They were very informative.  I thank Martin Shanahan and all the team for their outstanding work.  Theirs is a stellar performance and a stunning endorsement of our country as a place to do business.</p> <p>  I want to hone in on a couple of things.  They say all politics is local, so I will keep very local and focus on the real capital, which any Cork members still online should note is Longford.  I am aware that the key part of IDA Ireland's future growth involves the advance business solutions.  There is one earmarked for Longford.  I am anxious to have an update from some on the team on the current position.  Maybe they could firm up on the timelines.  I raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il before Christmas.  I have to admit there has been huge growth in foreign direct investment, FDI, in Longford, thanks to IDA Ireland.  We now have very close to 2,000 FDI-supported jobs in Longford town through Abbott, Technimark, and Avery Dennison.  The easy solution is probably to build the advance building solution on land adjacent to one of those companies and let one of them grow.  However, there is a huge opportunity for the county and IDA Ireland to acquire a significant land bank and bring in a new FDI company.  I hope one of the three aforementioned companies will advance in time.  I want to give the witnesses sufficient time to answer that question.</p> <p>  Second, we have benefited greatly from American investment in Ireland.  Where does IDA Ireland envisage opportunities regarding emerging economies and FDI investment in Ireland?  Those are my two questions.  The one on Longford is the priority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#G00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the increase in FDI in Longford.  I believe employment in FDI companies in Longford increased by 16% last year.  We hope that increase will continue.  As the Deputy has pointed out, it is our plan to build an advance building solution in Longford, along with two others in the midlands, during the lifetime of the strategy, which is in the next three years.  We have yet to identify the appropriate site for it.  We are engaging with Longford County Council at present to advance the project.  My hope is that we can identify a site in the near future that meets everybody's needs, but we have not yet done so.</p> <p>  From our perspective, we want to see happening both of the things that the Deputy mentioned.  First, we want to see the existing companies expand.  Second, we want to try to attract a new-name investor to Longford.  That is what I hope the advance building solution will do.  Work is ongoing to identify the site.  When that is done, the project will go through the normal planning process and everything else.</p> <p>  Let me address the question on the mix of business and where it comes from.  Approximately 70% of investment comes from the United States, about 20% comes from Europe, and about 10% comes from what we term "growth markets", which include the Asia&ndash;Pacific region and South America.  Within the portfolio, the United States continues to be extraordinarily strong for us.  It was very strong during the pandemic, for the past two years, partly to do with US companies' familiarity with Ireland.  Ireland was regarded as a very stable investment opportunity during the pandemic, when there may not have been opportunities to do as much due diligence work on the ground.  We see a lot of growth from what we term growth markets.  The Asia&ndash;Pacific region is the main part of that.  Within that, China, Japan and India are the main sources.  We continue to grow our network of offices in those locations to attract investment.</p></speech>

I want to ask about the role IDA Ireland played in the purchase of ventilators by a company known as Roqu Media, a festival management company.  I am sure the witnesses are familiar with it.  I am not exactly certain what its expertise in ventilators and ventilation is, but perhaps the witnesses can enlighten us on that.  The company has no history of trading on these shores.  Several red flags were raised during the due diligence process, one of which I understand concerned the fact that the chief executive of Roqu was not dealing directly with the wholesalers but via a third party, which dealt primarily in the products in question.  We know what the issues were with the ventilators.  My questions are fairly simple.  After the red flag was raised, did IDA Ireland break off contact with the chief executive, with whom, I am sure, the witnesses are familiar?</p><p>When did it break off contact?  Perhaps Mr. Shanahan will give us an insight into what IDA Ireland's role was during this process.  I will qualify my questions by saying that I understand that, at the start of the pandemic, there was panic, but some of that panic would have subsided over time.  What was IDA Ireland's role in facilitating the purchase of these ventilators that did not work and at what point, if ever, did it feel it was necessary to break off contact?</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Shanahan.</p><p>My next question is on a not-dissimilar theme.  We all read the stories, particularly in the <i>Business Post</i>but also elsewhere, regarding the Minister of State, Deputy Troy's meeting, and granting of confidentiality to big tech companies in advance of the meeting, to discuss the European Commission's Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act.  The <i>Business Post</i>reported that the request for this confidentiality came from IDA Ireland.  That it would have been sought by big tech companies would not have surprised me.  That it would be granted by a Minister of State in this Government might not surprise me either, although it does concern me.  Does the IDA make such requests often?  How often does it do so?  When requests are made, as one appears to have been in this instance - Mr. Shanahan is free to contradict that if he wishes - are they received positively by the Government?  I am not referring specifically to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, but I cannot imagine that this was the only time such a request was made.  What reception does the IDA usually get when it asks a Minister for confidentiality regarding these meetings?</p></speech>

That is to say, the client had asked would there be detailed minutes of the meeting and would they be made public.  That was in order that the client could judge what level of detail it was willing to share in respect of its activities.

The IDA does not seek confidentiality for its clients in its engagement with Ministers.  We did not on this occasion.  As I understand it, we sought clarification for the client as to at what level the meeting would be reported.</p> <p>  Regarding the IDA's own engagements with clients and information we host, we are covered by statute to ensure that the information we have is kept confidential because confidential information is shared with IDA Ireland and it is our responsibility to keep it confidential.</p></speech>

In this case, assurances were given that the meeting would be confidential and minutes would not be taken.  To be straight with Mr. Shanahan, that worries me.  He says that seeking confidentiality is not something the IDA does, which is fair enough.  This is something that happened, though.  Does the IDA have companies that would turn down or refuse meetings with Ministers?  Has a company ever refused to meet a Minister on the basis that the minutes would be public or that they would not be confidential?  Alternatively, is it Mr. Shanahan's experience that these companies are happy to meet Ministers regardless of whether minutes are taken and published?</p></speech>

Typically, it is the company that is asking for the meeting on a specific issue.

I thank him and his staff for the work they have done during what have been difficult times over the past number of years.  In light of the results - all extremely positive and successful - they have presented today, one would swear there was no pandemic at all.</p> <p>  I have a question relating to a serviced site in Clonmel, in my county of Tipperary but I might come to it second if I have time at the end.  I wish to touch on a matter that Mr. Shanahan did not get to respond to fully when my colleague, Deputy Stanton, spoke about it, that being, remote working.  I am from an area in Tipperary where many people travel to Cork, Limerick or even Waterford to work.  Before the pandemic, there would be queues of cars parked up on roads just before motorways as people drove together to work.  That has not happened during the past two years.  There is an opportunity for the IDA and the Government to support the option of living in rural towns and working from remote hubs in Tipperary where a company might be based in Cork, Limerick or Waterford.</p><p>Can I have Mr. Shanahan's views on that point and what the IDA might be able to do from its perspective?</p><p> There was an announcement this morning where the Central Bank was talking about an expected growth in the economy over the next three years and where some newspapers are talking about it being back to the boom, which is a worrying statement.  What is the IDA&rsquo; s perspective on its own growth over the next three years if we are looking at the economy improving from all of the predictions being made?  Where does that leave the IDA in respect of its selling points for investors coming in to Ireland?  Obviously, corporation tax, and I note that the response Mr. Shanahan has given is that it is a level base across the whole world now which is true, was one of of our selling points.  When Mr. Shanahan goes to companies to attract them into Ireland, what are the main selling points?  I will come back to the more local question after his response to this point, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#J00200"><p>I thank the Senator very much for his questions.  On remote working and what the Senator has observed during the course of the pandemic, it is the case that the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector and the economy as a whole has performed extraordinarily well.  The FDI sector continued to operate during the period while many people worked from home.  That had been a proof point for the companies involved so there have been many learnings for companies during this period as to what and how well things could be done during that period.  My expectation is that that will not be lost post pandemic, perhaps, because the main issue for most companies that we are engaged with is access to talent.  These companies will try to source current talent from wherever it is available which includes regional and indeed rural locations, in some cases within Ireland, but also within other countries and we have to compete for this.</p> <p>  This opens up opportunities and our clients see those opportunities.  Many of them are giving very serious thought to how they are going to structure themselves, what type of working model they are going to use, whether fully remote or hybrid and in some cases there is a demand to come back to the office for very specific reasons.  This presents opportunities for regional and rural Ireland and specifically for Tipperary and we will certainly be trying to ensure that we work with clients to advise them of those opportunities.</p> <p>  On the projections around the economy, clearly there has been a very robust recovery from the pandemic.  FDI was, obviously, very resilient throughout the pandemic but we are now seeing a recovery in the domestically trading part of the economy which is largely down to consumer spend.  That will lead to some challenges within the economy as to the availability of resources and the carrying capacity of the economy.  The IDA is targeting 50,000 jobs between 2021 and 2024.  I see that as realistic and that there is a very high possibility that we will be able to deliver on that but nothing is obviously certain.  Again, we operate in a competitive environment.</p> <p>  On a broad level, the issues are around inflation, supply chains, geopolitical issues and if we need a reminder as to how they can arise we can see what is happening now on the eastern border of Europe.  Domestically then, the issues are going to be around talent availability, as I mentioned in earlier answers, and supply of utilities such as water electricity, housing and border infrastructure.</p></speech>

On the question of Tipperary, we had positive news back in June, of an extra 200 jobs from Pfizer in Nenagh which was very welcome.  The company is now sponsoring the Tipperary GAA team for 2022 which is greatly welcomed.</p> <p>  On Clonmel, there is a serviced site there that the IDA owns along with Tipperary County Council at Ballingarrane.  There is a building there already called Questum Acceleration Centre which is full and is very successful.  There are companies there that are doing wonderful work, are looking to expand and to remain in Clonmel.  This is a serviced site, as I say, that is jointly owned by Tipperary County Council and the IDA and is about 300 acres in size.  There is great potential because Clonmel has proven over the past 30 to 40 years that it is a town that can manage and retain multinationals and jobs for a long period of time with good employment.  Does the IDA see the Ballingarrane site having the same opportunities and commitment that the local enterprise office and Tipperary County Council, and indeed the Minister who has also been briefed on that site, does?  It Is a very significant site for the town of Clonmel.  Does the IDA support Ballingarrane going forward in the potential it brings to the region and town of Clonmel?</p></speech>

There are about 50 acres remaining for marketing at Ballingarrane and we will continue to do that.  We are also engaged with Tipperary County Council in respect of considering advanced planning permission on a site in Clonmel and that work is progressing at the moment.  We know that the more work we do in order to make these sites attractive, the more likely it is that we will have success.  The short answer is that we share that commitment to Clonmel.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#J00700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I welcome Ms Buckley, Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan, Mr. Curran and Mr. Shanahan to our committee here this morning.  I also thank the IDA for the recent engagement I had with it and the confirmation that an advanced business solution is planned for Waterford which is very welcome news.  We also had some very good IDA announcements at the end of last year which were also most welcome.  I acknowledge what IDA has said about the Clonmel area which all bodes well for the south east.</p> <p>  I have three questions prepared here from Mr. Shanahan and I ask that he might come back to me on them, please.  I congratulate him on his 2015-2019 strategy which I believe was entitled Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019, which, it seems, the IDA has done.  </p> <p>  On the authority&rsquo;s regional goals, I welcome Mr. Shanahan&rsquo;s reflection on the appropriateness of these goals, particularly in respect of regional not meaning just Dublin.  It appears that the outlying areas of the Border region, the north-west midlands and the south east were relatively weak and if one strips out Cork, Limerick and Galway, I would suggest that the regional accomplishments would not look so stellar in area 1.</p> <p>  I would welcome more granular data on the value and income of IDA by region and sector.  A recent report headline I saw showed on average salaries of &euro;66,000 per annum which I presume catches a great deal of variation.</p> <p>  Third, we spoke about this briefly, I again raised the issue of technological universities, TUs.  TUs will hopefully strengthen the IDA offering outside of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I highlighted that in Waterford there are three technology gateways, the South Eastern Applied Materials Research Centre, SEAM, gateway, the Pharmaceutical &amp;amp; Molecular Biotechnology Research Centre, PMBRC gateway and the Walton Institute, which are all performing at a very high level.  I also raised the matter of where we could have more intersection with the IDA and TUs.  What additional resources and features do Mr. Shanahan and the IDA feel it needs to make this new TU branding meaningful?  We may need some specifics here particularly in terms of the Border, midland and, most important to me, the south-east region?  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#J00800"><p>I thank Deputy Shanahan very much for his questions.  On regions and targets, first, on a headline level, the IDA is targeting half of all investments into regions with this strategy.  Half of everything that will come into the country will go outside of Dublin.  By any stretch that is a very significant target and objective and will be very challenging, particularly given where we have come from.</p><p>The reality is, internationally, that investments are flowing increasingly towards larger urban areas and cities rather than to regional locations.  We are fighting an uphill battle.  Ireland has one city of scale, which is Dublin.  It is a plus for the country that we have that because by attracting investment, there is a chance to move investment outside that area and familiarise investors with it.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned a couple of locations.  Employment in the south east increased by 8% last year in FDI-supported companies, in the Border region by 3%, in the mid-west by 5%, in the west by 6%, in the south west by 3%, but that includes Cork, and in the midlands by 10%.  The increases have been widely distributed but we are not starting from the same base.  I think that is the point the Deputy is making and I agree.  That is the reality of what we have to work with and what various regions have to offer, in terms of population and population distribution.  We market regions for a good reason.  It is because we need bulk and size in order to compete internationally.</p><p>On the breakdown of employment by region, salary levels and sector, I think we can provide that information but I do not have it to hand.  My colleagues, Mr. Curran and Ms O'Sullivan, can come back to the Deputy directly on that.  I do not have that level of detail with me.</p><p> On technological universities, specifically the one for the south east, we see this as a hugely important development.  The ability of IDA to engage with clients and point to the fact there is a university in a region is a significant plus.  More important than pointing to the moniker it has is that the substance underneath is of a standard.  The process all of these technological universities have recently been through to show they are of that standard is welcome.</p><p> As I mentioned in response to Deputy Bruton, we have established a unit in the IDA focused on talent, transformation and innovation, which is to help engage with the training, education and research systems to ensure we continue to develop an offering which is attractive to investors and, more crucially, that we have an offering where investors can invest in research and development and innovation in those companies that are already here.  There is significant engagement at a local level with the third level institutions led by the regional manager and supported by Mr. Curran to understand the areas where universities can develop capability and where they have capability through IDA.  The Deputy mentioned some of that capability.  We will continue to engage with clients and universities to matchmake, to some extent.  The Deputy can be assured that in our marketing efforts, the technological university will be key in attracting investors going forward.</p></speech>

It concerns the issue of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, funding into the third level sector.  The majority of it goes into the national universities.  I have been in touch with SFI and it has highlighted the international dimension of its review panels.  All of that is well but we need some realignment of that funding into the technological university, TU, sector because it will be hard for research potential to be generated if we are not getting the funding.  At present, the majority of large-scale SFI funding goes into national university centres.  That is back to Mr. Shanahan's point about doing more for the large urban centres than for the regions.</p></speech>

It is a good job he has resilience.  It is interesting.  I read the entire 18 pages for my sins.</p> <p>  As Green Party spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment and for rural development, I will focus on supply chain issues.  Larger companies in the private sector are doing really well at reducing their energy and carbon emissions and struggling to find smaller businesses that have done the same because they feed into their carbon footprint.  It has been highlighted to me and I would like to hear if Mr. Shanahan has looked at that.  How does he support the supply chain also being green?  Bigger companies can afford to hire an expert.  I have worked with SAP and other companies through a social enterprise I had about greening business, so I have experience in this.  Some of them have done amazing work but small businesses do not really have the time or money.</p> <p>  I got a commitment from the T&aacute;naiste of &euro;22 million for helping the small-to-medium enterprise sector decarbonise but I spoke to him on the fact the supply chain was struggling and bigger companies were struggling to find small Irish businesses that could give them carbon figures.  I would like to hear about that, if the IDA has any information, or we could talk about it again.</p> <p>  I see the IDA's five pillars and 60 sustainability investments.  I would like to hear what exactly that means.</p> <p>  It is time to differentiate between greenwashing and really green businesses.  We have seen both.  We have seen greenwashing for years and now it is becoming trendy so there is a lot more of it.  There is also a lot of genuine greening in industry.  It is not just the environmental NGOs that are green.  I see deep work and concerns in the private sector in big business.  They are not all baddies, as people like to think.  As Larry Fink said, "Climate risk is investment risk."  It is no longer a little green thing.  It is serious business now, economically as well as climate-wise.  It should be a central pillar for all business at this stage.  I would like to hear more about that from the IDA.</p> <p>  My final point is a local thing and brings up Deputy Paul Murphy's favourite hobby of talking about data centres and how evil they are.  Data centres are needed because, as Mr. Shanahan pointed out, we would not be able to have this meeting without them.  They help us.  It is suggested best practice to have them near green energy sources.  Considering the offshore wind coming into County Clare, I wondered if the IDA had engaged with the ESB or whoever is on the east coast dealing with offshore wind on the probability that that is the best location for a data centre.  We need them and they can be beneficial in storing energy.  I will not go into that as we have had enough about data centres today.  The IDA should be looking at data centres and businesses coming to west Clare as part of just transition and with a view to having access to clean, green energy on their doorstep and hydrogen, long term, as well. </p> <p>  Given that Moneypoint is closing down, we need to show west Clare that we have not forgotten it.  West Clare should become a hub for businesses because of the offshore wind and there should be a huge focus by the IDA on bringing businesses who want green, care about their carbon footprint and will happily locate to that place.  Kilrush and Kilkee are fabulous places with all the amenities people need and will have green offshore wind as well.  Is the IDA focusing on that geographic area?  I see in the map where it has focused and it is mainly cities and big towns but now we have to focus on putting them near good sustainable energy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#K00500"><p>I thank the Senator for her comments.  I will take them in the order she outlined them.  Her positioning is right in that large businesses typically have the wherewithal and the motivation to engage on green issues and decarbonisation.  Many of them have to do so, frankly, because their clients demand it, whether that is the end user or another business they are selling to.</p><p>A large proportion of the client companies with which we engage have very well developed and sophisticated plans at a corporate level.  Increasingly, we see that at the Irish level.  Part of our role is to help those client companies to engage in climate action and support the Government's endeavours.  The Senator is right.  For many of them, when they are procuring goods and services, they are seeking to ensure they come from green sources and are not adding to their carbon footprint.  </p><p> We support smaller companies within the IDA Ireland portfolio and help them develop their climate action plans.  I am aware that our sister agency, Enterprise Ireland, which is responsible for indigenous companies, also does this.  Perhaps there is something for us to do together.  We are happy to look into that to see if there is something that connects the dots between those two.  We have learned a lot from our colleagues in Enterprise Ireland regarding this area and some of the supports it had in place.  This is why I am confident it has them.  </p><p> Regarding data centres and co-locating with green energy sources, I agree with the Senator that this makes sense.  Many data centre operators in Ireland are seeking green energy and, in some cases, have secured options or provided the development funding to build wind energy farms and secure the output from those.  This increases the renewable energy supply in general and specifically for those companies.  Other companies are heavily engaged in this area.  Members may have seen Eli Lilly in Cork launching its solar farm, which is a very significant investment.  All of these large users are trying very hard to ensure that they are secure green energy.  That is what is demanded of them in corporate; therefore, it is what is demanded of them in Ireland.  </p><p> We are very familiar with Clare and the opportunity relating to offshore wind, to which I alluded earlier.  Again, data centres are a consistent demand there should we be able to develop that offshore wind.  We will definitely take the Senator's comments on board regarding Clare and west Clare.</p></speech>

I welcome the 9% increase in employment growth in the west.  It is very welcome.  I acknowledge the significant work that Catherina Blewitt and her team are doing in the west.  I know the lady in a professional capacity.  She has done Trojan work in our city and beyond.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the Oranmore site has been idle for a time.  If Mr. Shanahan could come back to me when he has more information, I would appreciate it.  It is fantastic that the site is in the final ten regarding Intel and the challenges therein.

I want to follow up on the remote working spaces.  I am interested in what Mr. Shanahan said about how circumstances have evolved and developed during the pandemic.  There are a lot of remote working hubs but many of them are more hot desks.  I am looking for us to be a bit more ambitious.  I know lots of companies would be very concerned about their security of information and may want their space.  Will IDA Ireland have a look at developing remote working spaces so that companies could avail of them if they wished?  Bearing in mind the competition for labour and talent, if somebody could work in his or her own town, it could help.  Working from home is not always the best option for people.  They are on their own at the kitchen table or in the box room.  It may not work long term.  Having a working space in a regional space such as Youghal, which I mentioned earlier, would mean that people would not have to travel long distances and their quality of life would improve.  People might think about going back to work because they are offered that kind of flexibility and, therefore, maybe it is something IDA Ireland might explore with its companies or do something on a pilot basis to see how it would work.  Mr. Shanahan is correct.  Circumstances have changed dramatically.  People may not want to work from their house but may want to work from their town.  It would also rejuvenate local towns, many of which have suffered hugely in the recent past.</p> <p>  I return to the N25 because I want to be clear about what is happening there.  How much has IDA Ireland invested in the Ballyadam site over the years?  I understand that it is fully serviced.  I think IDA Ireland purchased the site at one stage.  This site has been sitting virtually idle for 12 years.  One of the reasons put to me was that access to the site has been very difficult.  The N25 is outside the gate but when you come out of there, you must go east to go west.  Mr. Shanahan is familiar with this.  Most recently, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, decided to abandon fairly advanced plans to upgrade the N25, which would have led to very good access to that site.  I am not sure if he is aware of that.  If he is, could he tell me whether IDA Ireland has made any comment to TII or the Department of Transport about the decision to abandon the upgrade?  TII had spent &euro;1.3 million on plans to upgrade the N25 but decided in December to abandon the whole thing so we do not  know where it is.  It leaves that site in limbo.  I am aware of IDA Ireland's planning application.  It has caused a lot of angst locally because it will increase local traffic through Carrigtwohill, which is already chock-a-block.</p> <p>  Has IDA Ireland any involvement in the development of new technology relating to offshore wind and green hydrogen in particular?  Is it engaged with supporting companies that may be interested in getting involved with that?  </p></speech>

He may also have a figure regarding the amount we have spent on the Ballyadam site.  If we do not have the figure, we can come back to the Deputy with it.  Regarding the N25 and access to the Ballyadam site, IDA Ireland has been clear that investment in road infrastructure that allows access to these sites and improves connectivity obviously helps us in marketing Ireland.</p><p>We engage with TII and others regularly on these issues.  The slip road for which we have submitted a planning application is a stop-gap solution.  The overall work on the N25 has not progressed at the speed required for us to be able to market the site.  We engage with local stakeholders wherever we are undertaking development like this.  We would be happy to hear from any parties on the proposed development to try to give assurances and put in place anything we can to meet the needs.  The Deputy will understand that this is an effort to try to win investment for that site.</p><p> On green hydrogen, we are familiar with the technology.  We are engaged with some companies that are working on green hydrogen, which represents an opportunity.  There is more work to be done on the technology to make it a viable opportunity for widespread promulgation but we are aware of it.  I will pass to Mr. Curran to answer the other two parts of the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Curran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#M00200"><p>On positioning regions for investment, we do so across multiple different criteria.  One is the promotion of remote working where we have client companies interested in the infrastructure for remote working.  They are interested in that when they are looking at growing the talent pool on which they can draw, as Mr. Shanahan mentioned, to populate open roles they may have.  We also see it as a strong benefit for people who are living in regional locations that where there are open roles and remote working roles, they are able to access them on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  We are involved in multiple initiatives.  Some are at a national Government policy level and others at local level.  At at national Government policy level, we are working with our parent Department on an inter-agency and interdepartmental group on the implementation of the remote working strategy and on best practice, training, education and all operational aspects of remote working, either from home or from a remote working hub.  We are also working with the Department of Rural and Community Development on the national hub infrastructure.  That working group comprises multiple agencies, including the Western Development Commission, Enterprise Ireland and our Department.</p> <p>  The current position is that the connected hubs platform was launched last year.  It brings together the locations of all the connected hubs across every county and region.  We are populating that website on an ongoing basis.  There is a one-stop shop with regard to the visibility of all the remote working hubs in Cork and any other county.  To date, 177 hubs have registered on the connected hubs website.  Based on our desk research, there are over 400 hubs in existence across the country.  Obviously, they are of varying degrees of quality and scale but as they migrate to the connected hubs website, employers will be able to see in real time the infrastructure across all the regions and how they can tap into that to grow their talent pool regardless of where the talent resides.  There are multiple working hubs in east Cork and across the county, including in Skibbereen, Woodgate, Macroom and Blackrock, and these will be part of the connected hubs platform.</p> <p>  Ballyadam is a fantastic site, as Mr. Shanahan said.  We are actively marketing the site to potential investors at the moment.  As it is the subject of a live planning application, the Deputy will understand if I do not go into too much detail on it.  On the conclusion of the planning process, when we are in a position to share the funding requirement for any infrastructure upgrades that may be approved, we will be happy to do so with the Deputy.  As Mr. Shanahan said, with any development that we undertake, whether our own business and technology parks speed and infrastructure upgrade or a building programme that might impact on any neighbouring enterprises or community, we have an outreach programme with our neighbours.  We will adopt the same practice for any potential development in relation to Ballyadam.</p></speech>

That is a false portrayal of the contribution multinational companies are making to our development.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Shanahan give us an idea of the stickability of multinational investment in Ireland?  I see that 58% of IDA Ireland projects last year were from its existing companies and that the rate of job loss was under 4%.  Am I correct in viewing that as an indication of very strong commitment to Ireland by these companies?  On the corporate tax contribution from multinational companies, what is IDA Ireland's current estimate of these companies to the Irish Exchequer?</p> <p>  On remote working, Mr. Curran spoke about standards being established in the various connected hubs and employers being able to know what they offer.  In IDA Ireland's experience, are there significant obstacles to large multinational companies using these smaller hubs or are they close to what would be required by a multinational?  As a corollary of that, will there be a time when Irish multinational companies have their employee workforce based outside of Ireland?  How does that factor into IDA Ireland's thinking on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#M00400"><p>On the longevity and stickability of these companies, we deal with companies in the IDA Ireland portfolio which have had more than 60 years' commitment to Ireland as well as the new-name companies that arrived in the last year.  From an IDA Ireland perspective, we want to see both.  We want to see the companies that are already here reinvesting because that is the best proof.  The companies that are here understand the environment and see everything that we all see and they still have confidence in Ireland.  The point around reinvestment and the amount of reinvestment from existing companies is probably the strongest endorsement of Ireland as a competitive location for attracting investment.</p> <p>  The point about the low level of job losses within the portfolio is important.  There will always be churn and job losses but job losses as a percentage of the overall portfolio, which has continued to grow, have continued to fall.  Those companies that we have here are maintaining their employments here and their commitment.</p> <p>  My opening statement alluded to the very substantial impact on the Irish economy from multinationals in terms of expenditure of close to &euro;28 billion, of which &euro;17 billion is payroll and &euro;11 billion services and materials.  The average capital investment last year was around &euro;7 billion, having oscillated between &euro;5 billion and &euro;7 billion.   That is before we get to the corporate tax take.</p><p>While this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners primarily, my understanding is that approximately 80% of all tax takes come from multinationals.  Approximately 66% of that, or two thirds of it, comes from multinationals that are exporting, for example, multinationals that are supported by the IDA.  This does not include all multinationals, some of which service the domestic economy.  A huge proportion of the increasing corporate tax take comes from multinationals, which allows the State to pay for all the other things we need.  These include investments into infrastructure, schools and our health system. </p><p> In relation to hubs, as the Deputy pointed out and as Mr. Curran alluded to earlier, we now have many examples of hubs operating around the country.  They have developed somewhat organically.  Some of them are private sector-owned and some of them are public sector developments by local authorities.  Some of them have input from State agencies, such as from the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Many of them are at the level whereby multinational companies would be happy to engage with them, although maybe not all of them.</p><p> We have yet to see - and this probably will only play out over the coming months and next year or two as we come out of the Covid-19 pandemic - whether those who elect to work remotely are more happy working remotely at home or whether they are more likely to work in remote hubs.  I am not sure if that will be primarily driven by the companies themselves.  While they will have a role to play in that, it will be about what individuals want to do.  Do they want remote work at home, or do they want to remote work in hubs?  In some instances, a hub may be a requirement, for instance, where individuals do not have an office environment at home, the availability of space or a sufficient Wi-Fi connection.  Therefore, a hub might be more attractive.  We are engaging with our client companies on this to try to understand what their models will be around the workplace of the future, as well as the extent to which they will be office-based versus completely remote.  </p><p> Earlier, I said to Deputy Stanton and, I think, to Senator Garvey that this now increases the opportunity for rural and regional prospective employees to access these multinationals.  It also means that these companies can now recruit anywhere in the world.  The idea that there is a centre around which one coalesces has been somewhat broken by the pandemic.  Now companies, given the huge demand for talent, are looking at other models.  They can potentially access that talent anywhere.  That creates a challenge for IDA Ireland, because it means there are now countries, regions within countries and locations in other countries that are competitors for investment but which had not been previously.  It has made it all the more competitive for us going out there to look for investment.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#N00300"><p>I would like to follow on from some of my colleagues today in saying that multinational companies have many positive things.  I do not think that many people - there are certainly very few in Clonmel - who would speak negatively about the role that multinationals play in security of employment, as well as what they give back to the community.  At the moment, we have a development with which the IDA might be familiar close to Ballingarrane of a new sports hub.  It is being built with support from the Government, as well as by significant financial support from multinationals such as Boston Scientific and Abbot.  They also do a lot of work in supporting charity organisations in Clonmel in yearly funding.  The employees lead on this on behalf of the companies.</p> <p>  That touches on one point on which I wanted to focus, which is about companies that are already based here and that are looking to expand.  I would be interested in getting the IDA&rsquo;s perspective on this.  There seems to be a higher demand from employees going into a workforce.  If company like Abbott or Boston Scientific is looking to increase its workforce in Clonmel by 50 or 100 people, the person who is going for employment will not only ask about his or her salary, pay and conditions, he or she will also ask about the town, the region and how that area can support that person and his or her family.  That is one of the reasons that a number of the companies are supporting the sports hub in the area, which has an international athletics track and sports facility.  Is it the IDA&rsquo;s view that there seems to be a change in what employees are looking for?  Have companies had to change their tack?  The salaries are obviously very good.  The average salary of &euro;61,000 for those working in an FDI company is good.  However, it seems that employees are looking for much more than that nowadays.  Where does the IDA see that going into future?</p> <p>  I will go back to Ballingarrane site by noting the general region where I am from, like others, has the road infrastructure of the N24 from Limerick to Waterford.  There is a redevelopment and design process under way at the moment of that road project.  One of its sections has been taken off.  While it was on the national development plan, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, decided before Christmas that one of its sections, namely, the Cahir to Waterford piece, is not to be continued in 2022.  In the view of the IDA, does it strengthen its argument in respect of the Ballingarrane site or anywhere in the south-east region if there is a proper, improved road network between the two major cities of Limerick and Waterford?  This connects Shannon Airport to Rosslare.  It seems obvious to me that from a strategic point of view for the IDA, as well as for any business coming into the region, having a good infrastructure network between two major cities is a key selling point to bring them to the region.  Is it the IDA&rsquo;s view that it would be easier to bring companies to the south-east region, in particular to Clonmel and County Tipperary, were this road infrastructure to be continued? </p></speech>

We refer to this as place-making.  Place-making is about everything that happens in a location.  It is not just about what happens in an industrial park or a business and technology park from Monday to Friday.  It is also about what is available downtown on a Saturday night or on a Sunday.  It is the entire offering of a region.  It is one of the reasons that we work with local authorities to try to ensure that the overall development plan is supportive of foreign direct investment.  Largely, what will be positive from a foreign direct investment&rsquo;s perspective will also be important from an indigenous company&rsquo;s investment perspective.</p> <p>  The Senator is also correct in his point that it is about more than just salary for employees.  It is about many other things, including a company&rsquo;s values and their corporate social responsibility, CSR, commitments.  Many of the companies with which we are involved with have significant CSR programmes, in addition to the other things that they do.  Therefore, all those things will be important.  Flexibility from companies going forward will also be important and employees will be looking to that.  Having all the resources within the region working to make it an attractive place for people to live is the first objective.  This is because if people will live there and are happy to move there, it means there will be much more chance of us getting an investment.</p> <p>  On the road infrastructure question, I will again point out that the IDA is not responsible for road infrastructure.</p><p>We are not responsible for the policy, nor are we the agency responsible for individual execution on it.  That is Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  In relation to the Senator's question, it is clear that if we can shrink the size of the country and of regions through good connectivity, including both road and public transport, it absolutely makes it easier for us to win investment.  Anything that improves access to strategic sites and business technology sites, anything that shortens commuting distances, opens up access to larger urban areas and connects them is clearly positive from an investment perspective.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Shanahan, Mr. Curran and I touched on this when we last spoke but it is important we get regional connectivity between the south east and the south west-midlands.  That can be achieved with upgrades to both of those roads, which are badly needed.  The IDA may be able to apply some pressure there.</p> <p>  I have a couple of other points.  Green hydrogen was spoken about briefly.  Is the IDA liaising with any companies about looking at biomethane development in the country in terms of FDI players?  It is an area that has not been exploited and we have very large food manufacturers here, as the authority knows.</p> <p>  My other point is that people may not be aware the original reason Bausch + Lomb invested in Waterford was a private trade mission where Waterford business people who had connections with Rochester went over and met people there.  That was the initial genesis of what is now the largest employer, or one of them anyway, in the south east.  Would the IDA support future private trade missions from areas like, say, the south east?  It is something I have mentioned before but it would be good to see if that is something the authority would approve of.</p> <p>  I think we also touched on this before but what of procurement opportunities for the SME sector through engagement with FDI companies?  This was tried as an initiative in Waterford a number of years ago.  Unfortunately, it failed.  If a small company tries to ring a pharma company it cannot even get someone to answer the call.  If a direct line is needed there is nobody to take the call.  It is really difficult for an SME to engage in order to try to market itself or its service.  Can anything be done to help with a procurement platform?</p> <p>  As a final point, will Mr. Shanahan or Mr. Curran outline their commitment to the refurbishment of facilities in Waterford they previously mentioned to me?  I again extend an invitation to the team to come down for the refurbishment of the authority's office in Waterford.  When it is done we would like to host them there with business people in Waterford.</p></speech>

I note his comments on the N24 and N25.  I have probably already dealt with those.</p> <p>  I am sure we are engaged with client companies in relation to biomethane.  I am not specifically aware of that but I can look into it and come back to him on it directly.</p> <p>  On private trade missions, my strong preference is that trade missions from any region are done in concert, that is, both public and private.  Then we are bringing the best proposition we possibly can to potential investors.  We will work with any private sector companies, or local authorities, that feel they want to undertake some marketing for whatever reason.  I should say at this point we are supported by many other bodies, agencies, local authorities and professional services companies, both in Ireland and across the globe, who help us in marketing Ireland.  It is very much a team effort in that regard.  If there are proposals we are anxious to hear them.</p> <p>  On SMEs and access to procurement pipelines, we have a system in place with Enterprise Ireland, EI, where we ask any new company coming into Ireland what its procurement requirements are.  We then ask if we can share that information with EI, which can in turn share it with companies it feels may have a possibility of servicing the new company.  That is one aspect of it and captures companies on the way in.  We then have, as Deputy Bruton alluded to earlier, the trade mission to Ireland whereby we bring together in several regional locations throughout Ireland on an annual basis, multinational companies that have procurement requirements and SMEs, typically, that are trying to access global supply chains.  EI has a programme of work in place where it supports the companies to make those pitches and develop them to the point where they can access those supply chains.  We obviously engage with EI around that as well in terms of any specific opportunities that might exist where companies may be seeking access.  We are happy to do that.  I should point out we have many overseas missions on which we engage with EI throughout the year where companies come and pitch.  Many of them have political support.</p> <p>  We are indeed refurbishing our office in Waterford at the moment.   Waterford is obviously where our regional manager for the south east is based.  I have no doubt I will be in Waterford, as my team are regularly, during the course of the year.  I thank the Deputy for that further invite.</p></speech>

That concludes all the contributions for today so I have one or two quick questions of my own.</p> <p>  Does the IDA have a strategy of working with EI?  If it does, and I hope that is the case, do the two organisations interact to help SMEs tap into the vast network of climate companies the authority has?  Mr. Shanahan referenced that a moment ago in answer to Deputy Shanahan.  What sort of strategy is there, or does the IDA have a strategy for working with EI?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#O00900"><p>The IDA and EI work extraordinarily closely together at every level.  We look at each other's strategies.  The Chairman will be aware EI launched its new strategy in the last couple of weeks.  The IDA was heavily consulted on that.  We have senior teams that are charged with interacting with each other.  We both have point people who interact with each other to ensure there is co-operation.  Teams right throughout the organisations work in very close contact, so each of us knows what the other is doing and what we are trying to achieve.  As I probably mentioned throughout my contribution today, there are a couple of key things we do together around SME-multinational engagement.  First, the trade mission to Ireland is key.  That is an annual outing where we bring together SMEs and multinationals, one of which is trying to procure certain goods and services and the other is trying to supply them.  We have the capability I mentioned in response to Deputy Shanahan there where we seek the procurement profile of companies coming into Ireland and share it with EI for onward sharing with its companies.  We have identified a number of sectors where we are working together to develop strengthened clusters.  At the moment these include medical technologies, cybersecurity and connected and autonomous vehicles.  They are clusters that both EI and the IDA are working on together in order to foster the relationship between SMEs and multinationals.  That is obviously an ongoing effort and it will continue.  Part of our own strategy is to increase the impact multinationals have in Ireland.  In order to do that, co-operation with EI is key.</p></speech>

My second question is basically a local one but it would be remiss of me not to put it.  I have met Mr. Shanahan a few times in Limerick when he has been there opening companies and the additional jobs are always very welcome.  A number of the companies based in the Castletroy industrial estate and the Plassey area are hugely concerned about traffic levels in the area and the long-awaited northern distributor road that seems to have been put on a long hold.</p><p>Would Mr. Shanahan agree with me that the north side of Limerick, the south-east Clare area and the area between the north side of Limerick and Shannon Airport have potential for massive growth and that the northern distributor road would deliver additional jobs to the Castletroy and Plassey area?  Some of the companies in the area have told me, either through meetings with representatives of IBEC or in one-to-one meetings, that they are concerned about traffic levels in that area, especially coming off the M7 motorway.  We have built the Coonagh-Knockalisheen road.  It is almost completed.  That is critical infrastructure.  This part of the northern distributor road has freed up an awful lot of land in close proximity to Shannon Airport.  Does Mr. Shanahan consider the next bit of the northern distributor road to be critical infrastructure in delivering jobs in the region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022012600002#P00200"><p>As I have already responded, investment in road infrastructure is critical and that includes the northern distributor road.  This road will help us both with some of the challenges existing investors experience and with opening up that area to attract new investment.  Obviously, this is not a policy area the IDA is directly responsible for but, on behalf of the client companies we interact with and the investors we represent, I can definitely relay that good road infrastructure is critical in opening up these sites.  Where there are traffic management issues, we engage with all stakeholders, including our own clients in industrial parks, to try to put in place plans to mitigate the impact of traffic.  Limerick is one of the regions that has benefited very significantly from foreign direct investment, FDI, over recent years.  In some respects, FDI has transformed the narrative and that is very welcome.  We need to do everything we can to continue that.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Shanahan and his team from the IDA for assisting the committee in its consideration of this important matter today.  I wish IDA Ireland continued success in its work over the coming years as our economy recovers and we emerge from the pandemic.  The committee will continue to devote attention to the progress being made in this regard.  In forthcoming meetings, we will be considering different aspects of enterprise promotion and trade.

Insofar as this committee is concerned, the key point to note is that with effect from this week, members and witnesses will have the option of attending meetings within the relevant committee room rather than participating via MS Teams.  Room capacity will continue to be reduced in the short term until all microphones and seating can be returned.  This will be done as quickly as possible.  It is important also to note that masks should continue to be worn by those present when not addressing the committee.  I will remind members of this as necessary.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in any way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against any person outside the Houses or any official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Today's engagement is with representatives from the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, and Social Justice Ireland.  The committee has agreed to examine the indexation of the welfare and taxation system and we have scheduled a series of four public meetings on this topic.  I hope we are going to do some very in-depth work on it.  The committee intends to discuss several areas of interest, including the rationale for indexation, the creation of an indexation system, the operation of that system and the impact of indexation on budgetary sustainability.  We are also hoping to publish a report on that topic.  Today is the first of these meetings.  On behalf of the committee, I would very much like to welcome: Dr. Tom McDonnell, co-director of NERI, and, representing Social Justice Ireland, I welcome, Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy, CEO, Ms Michelle Murphy, research and policy analyst, and Ms Susanne Rogers, research and policy analyst.  I thank the witnesses very much for being with us today.  I hope it will be an interesting session.  I invite Dr. Healy to make his opening statement on behalf of Social Justice Ireland.</p></speech>

We are very happy to provide an input on this issue, which we have been addressing ourselves in a variety of ways for quite a number of years.</p> <p>  Social Justice Ireland supports the indexation of the minimum core social welfare payments to ensure that recipients do not fall behind the rest of society.  We propose that the benchmark should start at 27.5% of average earnings, as a minimum.  The reason we picked that for a starting point or as a first stage in the benchmarking process is that it is equivalent to 30% of gross average industrial earnings, which was the standard that had been set and was achieved in the budget of 2007.  We also believe that the Government should commit to reaching the benchmark of getting up to 27.5% over a two-year period.  We further propose that a pathway and process would then be outlined for the indexation of social welfare payments to 30% of average weekly earnings.  The indexation of social welfare rates would provide certainty to households and people on fixed incomes.  It would also provide certainty to the Government in its planning.  It would further begin to address the many challenges of making ends meet that people with limited resources experience on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  Our submission, which we have sent to the committee, is quite detailed.  It outlines in depth the process whereby benchmarking was established a few decades ago and how the index and targets were set.  We show how they were set and how the benchmark was reached in 2007.  The progress made on social welfare payments and benchmarking between 2001 and 2007 marked a fundamental turning point in Irish public policy, because the achievement of the benchmark to average earnings of core social welfare rates indicated significant progress.  It also marked the delivery of a long overdue commitment to sharing the fruits of the country's economic growth that went back to the mid-1990s.</p> <p>  We propose that the benchmark should start at 27.5% of average earnings as a minimum.  The Government should commit to reaching that over two years.  At the moment, that benchmark is the equivalent of &euro;222.08.  This means that there is a shortfall of &euro;14 between it and the core social welfare rate for a single person today.  We also propose that a pathway and process would then be outlined for the indexation of social welfare payments to rise to 30% of average weekly earnings.  This should be overseen by an independent body, which would outline the indexation pathway and base any recommendations on independently verified data and calculations.  We must point as a model here to the living wage technical group, which has a very clear pathway and process in place for how it calculates the living wage level per hour, year after year.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact of indexation, there is comprehensive research to show that the social welfare system is the key to reducing poverty among the poorest in society.  I accept there are others.  If people have a job, they need things like refundable price credits and things of that nature to be done.  At the core, however, the poorest and most vulnerable are those who are depending on the core rates of social welfare.  Welfare payments target those most in need in society and are very successful at reducing poverty.  Social welfare payments also play a central role in alleviating poverty generally.  When resources are focused on the welfare system, they assist those who need most help.  Conversely, when the Government provides limited resources to the welfare system, it undermines the living standards and the needs of the weakest in society.  That is a critical issue that needs to be taken on board.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that the value of core social welfare payments has been falling over the past decade.  That might not be tremendously obvious to members, but I draw their attention to a report supplied to the committee by the Parliamentary Budget Office.  That report is in the public arena and is only a month or two old.  It analysed changes in the social welfare rates from 2011 to 2022.</p><p>It also looked at core social welfare rates and rate changes over time compared with inflation and wage changes.  The analysis shows that flat increases in social welfare payments, such as the &euro;5 increase to be applied to core benefits in 2022, result in disproportionate failures in keeping pace.  Benchmarked against inflation or wage changes, the value of the payment is not &euro;208 now, but &euro;193 compared with 2011.  This is an important point and is one of the reasons we are arguing strongly that the benchmark should be linked to the income that people are getting in society.  Otherwise, there will be a falling back, which is why we would not be happy with just indexing the payment to inflation.  If it does not keep pace with wages, people will fall behind the standard of living that is generally accepted in society.  Indexation would provide certainty for the Government in terms of resources and revenue generation.  It would also provide certainty for those on fixed incomes who have to make ends meet on limited resources on an ongoing basis.  All social welfare payments should be included in the indexation process, not just a few select ones.  This is one of the objections that we have to the idea of picking and choosing particular social welfare payments to increase at budget time while not increasing others, the core rates in particular.</p><p> In terms of resourcing, all direct taxation should be included.  It should not just be increasing PAYE taxation or something of that nature.</p><p> In general, fluctuations in the poverty rates among those largely dependent on the welfare system have in the past correlated with policy moves that allowed the value of welfare payments to fall behind wage growth.  Consequently, a great effort is required to increase these payments to catch up.  If those dependent on social welfare are not to fall behind the rest of society at times of economic growth, the benchmarking of welfare rates to wage rates is essential.  If we do not do this and instead continue as we have been, the division in society will get deeper.  Something I am prepared to discuss with anyone is that deeply divided two-tier societies are not just bad for the people who are suffering in them because they do not have incomes, but also for business.  Everyone would benefit from a benchmarked welfare rate at the core, which would keep the value of the rate rising with the rest of society.  Benchmarking seems to be the key.  We have suggested rates in our submission as the first two steps.  There is a question over whether even this would be sufficient to allow people to live life with dignity, but the bottom line in this discussion as I understand it is whether indexation should be promoted.</p><p> I will conclude with that.  We will take whatever questions the committee has in due course.</p></speech>

However, benchmarking the various welfare rates to some defined measure of sufficiency is an important complement to indexation.  We need to know whether we are achieving our poverty reduction targets, so some measure is required.  As such, we can say that price indexation is merely a proxy for stand-still policy.  It might keep living standards at their current levels but it will not improve them.  Inflation rates such as the consumer price index, CPI, may actually underestimate increases in the cost of living for lower income households.  For example, the current high level of inflation is concentrated in areas like energy, housing and food and disproportionately affects lower income households.<br/><br/>The principal rationale for wage indexation is that it broadly prevents a worsening of income inequality.  Crucially, wages generally rise faster than prices, meaning that wage indexation will tend to improve living standards for poorer households over the longer term.  The main negative consequence of indexation is the fiscal cost and the opportunity cost.  Indexation reduces scope for policy innovation and spending in other areas.  The annual fiscal space for net growth of expenditure is linked to the economy's medium-term potential growth rate.<br/><br/>Of course, cost of living issues can be addressed in other ways.  It should be noted that indexation of tax and welfare would need to be accompanied by proportional uplifts to legal wage minimums, such as the national minimum wage, as well as to the income thresholds for benefits.  Doing so avoids the potential for labour market distortions that may arise.  NERI proposes wage indexation as the most appropriate baseline.  This could be supplemented with a system of modest and defined annual adjustments that gradually move the individual rates towards an empirically based and politically agreed benchmark for sufficiency that is based on the cost of living for various cohorts.  The growth in average weekly or annual earnings is preferable to the growth in average hourly earnings, as it is weekly or annual earnings that determine living standards.  On the other hand, if we replace our current <i>ad hoc</i>system with price indexation, income inequality will rise over time as welfare benefits fail to keep pace with labour income and capital income.<br/><br/>We are not quite convinced, however, that a triple lock based on some arbitrary minimum is a particularly good idea.  While the triple lock is an effective indexation link for maintaining and improving living standards, it is also the most costly to the Exchequer, limits policy flexibility and could cause economic distortions if it were to grow faster than wages consistently.  I am happy to elaborate on this.<br/><br/>All social protection payments as well as thresholds for access to certain payments, including non-cash benefits, should be given equivalent treatment.  Indexation should apply to all payments if it is to apply to any.  Similarly, were indexation to be applied, it should be applied equally across all taxes on labour, notwithstanding the need to review the tax system on an ongoing and consistent basis against the core principles of fiscal sustainability, economic efficiency and equity.  The issue of sufficiency benchmarking is relevant.  Indexing should not replace the ongoing annual process of reviewing the tax and welfare system.<br/><br/>Excise duties, such as those on alcohol and cigarettes, would ideally be incorporated into any indexation system.  However, price inflation rather than wage inflation is the appropriate baseline for indexing excise taxes because they are taxed per commodity unit rather than on a percentage basis.  If they are not indexed to price, then they will gradually become cheaper relative to other goods.  On the other hand, if they are indexed to wages, they will gradually become more expensive relative to other goods.  Of course, that may be the policy goal.<br/><br/>The economy is a complex and dynamic system with many moving parts.  Projecting often volatile wage and price trends is fraught with difficulty.  This is particularly the case for forecasting over a six-to-18-month time horizon.  As the committee knows, we are going through a period of very high price volatility on account of an extremely truncated economic cycle.  Wage inflation itself can be highly volatile.  Weekly earnings grew sharply in 2020 due to the compositional skew of jobs lost during the early period of the pandemic.  Therefore, indexing to some assumed price or wage trajectory is problematic, although there are a number of potential workarounds.  One way of designing indexation may be to make it backward looking rather than forward looking.  This connects the increase in welfare rates and tax bands to actual developments in the economy.  For example, weekly wage growth averaged over the four most recent quarters of annual growth could be one of many plausible options.  A smoother pattern of growth over time would be generated by including more quarters of data.  Alternatively, indexation could be set at a presumed long-run average for wage growth with this value re-estimated every few years.  This would add certainty to household budgeting as well as to the public finances.<br/><br/>Sharp increases in inflation would remain a potential problem, but this is equally true of our current <i>ad hoc</i>system.  It is not realistic or desirable to expect an annual budget to be completely flexible and responsive to short-term price swings.  Policy stability is important to the perception of the public finances and revaluations should only be triggered in extreme circumstances.  In any event, the assumption is that sharp and sustained price increases would eventually be reflected in higher wage growth and, therefore, in the following year's indexation.<br/><br/>Inflationary pressures in particular areas such as energy costs or housing costs, as we are seeing at the moment, could in theory be addressed via changes to the relevant secondary welfare payments or benefit thresholds.  However, this should only trigger in unusual cases.  Recall that indexation based on wages will, on average, exceed CPI inflation in most years.<br/><br/>NERI anticipates long-run price inflation of close to 2% and long-run wage inflation of close to 3.5%.</p><p>Extrapolating from Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, estimates for budget 2020 conducted by Tim Callan, Claire Keane and Mark Regan and working on a static pre-pandemic basis for total unemployment suggests that price indexation at an average of 2% would cost close to &euro;750 million of fiscal space per annum and that wage indexation of 3.5% would cost in the region of &euro;1.3 billion.</p><p> The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council&rsquo;s fiscal space calculator indicates that a 1% wage increase raises &euro;181 million from not indexing the tax system.  Annual price inflation has averaged 1% over the past three years, while weekly wage growth has averaged close to 4.5% per annum.  Indexation in line with wage earnings is sustainable in terms of fiscal space and is fiscally neutral.  It reduces policy flexibility but it adds to certainty for household budgeting.  Arguably, it also adds to fairness and fiscal certainty because more politically powerful cohorts will have less opportunity to push for special treatment at pre-election budgets.  I look forward to engaging with the committee.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to read part of them and to try to digest as much of them as possible.  The question of whether we would be indexing to inflation or wages is one that stood out for me because I understood initially that we might be linking to inflation and that Dr. Healy was very much focused on linking it to wages.  It sounds like a very positive and good approach.  Are there potential negatives about carrying out that kind of indexation?  What would it mean for the cost of living?  Is it all positive or are there possible negatives?</p> <p>  Why should we link to wages rather than inflation?  We have seen over the past while that wages in some sectors such as finance and technology increased and that there is a shortage of trades so people in those areas will be able to command higher wages.  Many others have not really seen any improvement or change in their wages over the past year.  The situation is lumpy regarding places where we would see wage increases.  Could the witnesses outline why we should link to wages instead of inflation?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses talking about all social welfare benefits such as pensions, working family payment and child benefit?  Would it also include the other benefits along the edge such as the free television licence, the fuel allowance, medical card thresholds and PRSI relating to the cost of glasses?  Are the witnesses talking about the gamut of social welfare?</p> <p>  I am conscious of families that do not receive social welfare payments in circumstances where a member of the family is working.  Would the witnesses favour linking taxation bands or thresholds?  Where would people who are not on social welfare and who are just keeping their heads above water sit?</p></speech>

If we benchmark to inflation, people on social welfare will fall behind the rest of society.  It is as simple as that.  The reason for this is because wages outperform inflation.  One of the things we are trying to do with the most vulnerable is not let them fall further behind.  That is why the benchmark should be tied to wages.</p> <p>  We must then make the point that having chosen a benchmark, we need to then decide where the index is and what percentage of it we will use.  That is why we were presenting what we think are achievable goals, like 27.5% and 30% of the wages situation, in the short to medium term.  Another thing we would say in that context is that it would apply to all social welfare payments.  I do not think it is a good idea to benchmark some social welfare payments while other payments in effect fall behind, which is what will always happen to them in reality.  I would not benchmark the free television licence.  There is a separate set of calculations that go into that.  I will check with Ms Murphy about whether there are other pieces of that she would like to highlight.</p></speech>

It depends on the level of the social welfare payment.  I repeat the point made in our submission that in respect of the challenging situation in which we find ourselves in terms of cost of living increases and the utility credit that is being issued, if we introduce an indexation process and choose average wages, and, as Dr. McDonnell suggested, looking backwards might be more appropriate than looking forwards, we will discover that we will not find ourselves in these types of situations because wage growth is generally beyond inflation in the first place.  It means that Government also has certainty.  There is budgetary certainty.  It means the budgetary space can be used to tackle and target different vulnerable groups, be they people on social on welfare payments or people in low-paid employment.  The positives outweigh any negatives in terms of how we might design it or fiscal implications.</p></speech>

We have been going on about this for quite a while.  There are possibly more than 100,000 people who have a job but who are in households that are living in poverty.  Social Justice Ireland thinks that the key is making tax credits refundable so that people will benefit from the full value of the tax.  The second thing would be to move the minimum wage towards the living wage.  In fairness, the Government has both of those items on its agenda.  Both of them are mentioned in the programme for Government.  We will see what living wage the Government comes up with, but it should certainly be such that it provides the basics completely for somebody with a job.  In that context, it would be well clear of welfare.  There would be quite a gap between the two and there would be no danger of going back to a time, which has not been the case for a long period, where people would be better off on welfare than they would be in work.</p></speech>

In terms of all social welfare payments, the idea is that you would be uplifting the entire system.  It would not be only the welfare payments, but the income thresholds and wage minima.  Everything would be uplifted.  The concern is if that if welfare rates increased but the national minimum wage, tax credits or the tax threshold did not, there would be issues around replacements rates, potentially.  Across the entire system all welfare rates, income thresholds, tax credits, tax thresholds and so forth for the USC and income tax would go up at the same percentage level and that same percentage level would be linked to average wage growth.<br/><br/>As pointed out by Ms Murphy, there is still a process of getting to the benchmark that you are trying to achieve.  For some rates, you may already be there and so you may need less than the headline amount, but for others cases there needs to be a process of catch-up and that process of catch-up should happen over a very short period of time, certainly no longer than three to four years.  There are a lot of other benefits as well.  For example, this gives household certainty.  Looking ahead, households on welfare, the minimum wage or whatever would know that wages will probably in most years grow faster than inflation.  That means their cost of living pressures should not increase.  It is also distributionally neutral so indexing to wages means that income inequality will not increase, by and large.  In terms of Government spending as a percentage of economic output and also taxes as a percentage of economic output, it is fiscally neutral as well.  Whereas it is true that non-indexation does lead to a better fiscal outcome, that is before you have made the<i>ad hoc</i>increases to the different welfare payments that have been chosen for a particular year.  It also depoliticises welfare payments to a certain extent.<br/><br/>In terms of the question as to whether there are potential negatives, the only negative that comes to mind as being potentially significant is that it reduces policy flexibility in other areas.  For example, there are alternative ways of reducing the cost of living such as, for example, by proving free and affordable child care, free public transport or some other policy scheme.  That reduces the flexibility, but that is all it does.  It does not make the fiscal space considerations unsustainable.  Looking over the very long term, where the working age ratio may decline over time, then the situation could be different.  That is decades into the future and it can be compensated for through one-off adjustments as well.  It should be said that there would be nothing preventing a Government not engaging in the indexation in a particular year, just as every year it does not freeze prices for welfare rates.

We know that by comparison with other European countries, Ireland tends to be a lower spender when it comes to the subvention of those areas.  It is estimated that the cost of indexing a long-run price inflation of 2% and long-run wage inflation of 3.5% would be around &euro;750 million and &euro;1.3 billion, respectively.  If we chose to tackle the cost of living through the method of subsidies for childcare, affordable housing and reduced costs for public transport, what would that &euro;750 million and &euro;1.3 billion mean for us in terms of increased subvention?</p></speech>

If, alternatively, we were to spend on universal basic services such as childcare, housing and public transport, it would reduce the cost of living.  The price inflation or cost of living would be lower and that would reduce the necessity to increase welfare rates because the sufficiency benchmark will have changed.  That is what I mean by policy flexibilities.  If we have fiscal space of approximately &euro;4.5 billion every year, and that will increase slightly every year, the question is how do we spend that money.  Indexation is a good way to spend the money, but I would also say that it would be better for the economy and society in the long run if we make those substantive investments in universal basic services in the way that other European countries and increasingly, hopefully, Ireland will do in the future.  They are not necessarily competing with each other directly.  It is not necessarily an either-or situation; you should do both.  Those investments in universal basic services will reduce the necessity to spend on cash payments.</p></speech>

What will happen to price inflation over time is that there will always be compositional effects.  At the moment, it is energy, but later on it could be something else.  Looking to the medium to long-term, I would say that it will be better for society overall, but certainly for poorer households who tend to be more reliant on public services.  Women and children in particular tend to be disproportionately reliant on public services.  An emphasis over the medium term on universal basic services would benefit those groups and overall would have a very progressive effect.  Effectively, it would decommodify a part of the economy which makes market incomes less relevant, and that is better for poorer households in the long run.</p></speech>

What springs to mind is the report published last week by Social Justice Ireland, which I have already quoted twice today.  The Social Justice Ireland report states that if the cost of housing was included, it would show that 19% of people are living in poverty.  That is quite interesting.  I would welcome a comment from Social Justice Ireland on the housing affordability issue and the fact that if it were included, it would put a fifth of people into poverty.</p></speech>

The report shows the impact of the cost of housing being one of the key drivers in the cost of living.  The Parliamentary Budget Office report referred to by Dr. Healy also notes that housing was one of the drivers.  As outlined by Dr. McDonnell, CPI underestimates the impact on low-income households.  When it comes to subvention, we fall behind other European countries in terms of childcare, public transport and affordable housing.  It is going to take a lot more than &euro;1.3 billion to address the gaps we have in the short-term in terms of even meeting the average in terms of our European peers.  In the meantime, we still have to support those households that are on low incomes.  We have consistently argued for a floor of universal basic income and universal basic services below which nobody should fall.</p><p>We do not see these two things as being in competition with each other.  Looking at indexation, it is how incomes are supported.  Over time, if there is investment in, for example, subsidised childcare, social and affordable housing and public transport, that will have an impact in changes to the cost of living, and you can look again at indexation.</p><p> In terms of the areas that the Deputy mentioned, substantial investment capital investment.  There is a question as to how that investment will support our climate goals and also is impact in terms of reduction of living costs.  However, we are talking about indexation.  One of the things that any indexation process that is designed will also have to somehow accommodate the impact our climate transition on low income households, particularly households in fuel poverty, and how the indexation system can support them.</p></speech>

This is very interesting.  Obviously, everything that we discuss in the budget oversight committee is extremely interesting.  Earlier, Dr. McDonnell stated: "Crucially, wages generally rise faster than prices, meaning that wage indexation will tend to improve living standards for poorer households over the longer term."  I would love if he could talk me through this a bit because I am not an expert on it.  Price inflation is running at more than 5% at the moment and there is no doubt that wage inflation has been high in terms of the ICT and construction sectors.  Just for my own understanding, could Dr. McDonnell talk me through the sectors that have been badly hit by Covid?</p></speech>

Absolutely, it is the case that there will be quarters and years when price inflation exceeds average wage growth.  The Deputy is right as well in that there is obviously significant heterogeneity between the economic sectors at the moment.  This reflects the tightness of the different sectors and the fact that some have been locked down.  Overall though, wage growth in the economy is reasonably strong.  I would anticipate that wage growth will be very strong next year.</p> <p>  Earlier today, the Central Bank projected inflation of 4.5%.  I would still expect average wage growth to exceed to 4.5%.  That would mean that if there were backward-looking, welfare aids, admittedly, with a lag, it would still be growing at a faster pace over the medium term than the cost of living.  That means that quality of life, poverty, deprivation - all of those indicators - should gradually improve.  Also, in the context of relativities, the overall picture in terms of the income inequality distribution should broadly improve.  The Deputy is right that there are sectors of the economy where wages are not tracking true just yet.  However, I anticipate that this will change as we move through 2022.</p></speech>

I spoke in the D&aacute;il earlier about the cost of the living, low incomes and the situation whereby there are huge inflationary pressures.  Of course, this will impact on people who are on social welfare.  I made the point in the House that we should be index-linking basic payments.</p> <p>  On the other side of the coin - and I see this in my constituency a great deal - there are people who feel that working does not pay.  People in receipt of social welfare payments get the various the add-ons that come with that, including access to Student Universal Support Ireland grants for third level education, medical cards, etc., because their income is below a certain threshold.  When we, rightly so, try to bring in a system of social welfare which will mean that people will be off the poverty list and can live decent lives, how can we protect them?  I do not think we are doing so at the moment.  There is an anomaly whereby individuals in low-paid jobs who do not get the benefit of grants that might be applicable find will say to themselves that they would be as well off if they were on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit rather than working full time.  How do we get to a stage where it does pay to work, but those who cannot work are taken care of by society?</p> <p>  There is a fine line here.  I heard people talking about the minimum wage.  We also have to take into account whether employers' can afford to pay the minimum wage, especially smaller companies that need workers but that do not necessarily have the wherewithal to pay &euro;20, &euro;25 or whatever it might take per hour in order to make work pay for people.  There is a balancing act to be done here.  I would like to get our esteemed witnesses' take on that and on how they would deal with it.</p> <p>  One other thing that comes into play is when we would have a situation where we have increases, we also have to increase the thresholds for people to access medical cards, social welfare or the fuel allowance, because they are all means tested.  The threshold needs to be brought up and indexed as well.  There is a plethora of additional items that go with social welfare payments.  As one of the witnesses stated, they should all be indexed linked.  That is fine.  How do we keep the working person and the working families in a situation where they will benefit from being in work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#E00600"><p>I would like to take this.  The Deputy asked a very good question.  It is a very critical issue in this whole area.  The most important thing is that we should have a principle that work should always pay.  That should be taken as a guiding principle.  We certainly have that.  One of the issues is that a full week's work should provide enough for a person to have the minimum to live life with dignity as well.  That is where the whole issue of the living wage comes into play.  The critical issue is that there has to be a movement of the minimum wage towards the living wage.</p> <p>  The living wage is &euro;12.90.  It is not &euro;20 or &euro;25 per hour or anything of that nature; it is &euro;12.90.  That is still more than &euro;2 above the minimum wage.  There is an issue that has to be dealt with in that context regarding employers who cannot pay the living wage.  If there were a decision made to move the minimum wage to the level of the living wage, the vast majority of employers would actually step up to the mark.  That would, in effect, create a situation where there would be leeway between both.</p> <p>  The other aspect is that it would be very important to increase the thresholds for medical cards, the fuel allowance, etc.  Part of the trouble over the past decade has been that the approach to welfare has been sporadic.  I made the point in my introduction that it was benchmarked in 2007.  That was a big breakthrough.  A benchmark had been chosen, an index had been set and it was delivered.  It took a long time to get there, but it got there.  That was excellent.  The issue then was that the wheels came off the economy a bit with the crash, the bailout and all that.  As a result, we have had this kind of situation, as I was illustrating at the start, where the value of the welfare payment now is substantially lower than what it was in 2011.</p><p>That is not a good space to be in.  The people who are on the lowest welfare payments - the core payments, as it were - are most vulnerable.  They find that the value of the payment is less than it was more than a decade ago.  I do not think anybody was claiming that they were living in luxury at that time either.</p><p> The other point I would make is that it is important to acknowledge that people want to take up employment.  We only have to look at the level of unemployment to see that.  All of the organisations doing forecasts at the moment, including the Central Bank, which has been mentioned already, and the ESRI, are talking about a very tight labour market going forward.  They are saying that we are going to have quite a substantial increase again in jobs in the coming year.  We must be careful here that we do not develop a situation where there are two economies, with one that is paying good wages and enables people to access to all sorts of services, etc., and another where people who are on a minimum wage that does not even provide them with the minimum to allow them to live life with dignity.  As we discussed already, we need to do what is required in getting the living wage into place and then dealing with issues, such as refundable tax credits and things of that nature, to ensure that people who are in a job can benefit from the full value of what they are entitled to in the first place.  Next, we must deal with issues that may be causing problems, such as the thresholds and people basically being afraid to give up their medical card, or whatever, because they earn too much.  There is a danger that people will fear that the cost of giving it up will be so high that they will not take that risk.  We need an integrated system.  We have been arguing for a long time that tax and welfare need to be integrated.  Benchmarking and indexing welfare would be a good step in that direction because it would help give predictability.  People would know the direction that we were going in and what could be done.  That would be a good situation to find ourselves in.</p></speech>

What you do there is you have a system of tapering.  Rather than taking away benefits in their entirety upon reaching a particular income in terms of wages or whatever, you would taper the benefits so they would gradually be eroded over time.  Even with benefits that do not necessarily have a nominal cash value, such as the medical card, there could be reduced subsidies as wage levels increase, for example.  There are solutions to all of these problems.  Ultimately, the Irish system does a very good job of having very low marginal effective tax rates for most low-pay workers.  The marginal effective tax rate takes into account the loss of benefits.  There is only a very small cohort of workers who have very high replacement rates.  Compared with other European countries, we do quite well there.  I agree that it is something we need to maintain.  One has to consider the wisdom of increasing tax rates on low-pay workers, for example.  Obviously, there are revenue considerations, looking to the future, but perhaps there are better ways to do it.  Ultimately, as well as increasing rates and thresholds, it means wages going up as well.  That means the standard rate cut-off point, the USC and income tax bands, and the whole system effectively, becomes indexed, not just the welfare system.</p></speech>

The tapering of the supports for people who will be coming off social welfare and going into the workforce is the way forward.  That could be something that could be tapered over two to three years to give people a change to adjust and to get to a level of income where they are better off than if they were on social welfare.  I also think there is something to be done regarding people who are on low pay who have real hidden to costs, such as travel-to-work and childminding costs, which they have to factor in when they are considering whether to take up employment or not, based on what they are getting.  I accept that we say that the living wage is &euro;12.90 per hour.  If you take that &euro;12.90, multiply it by the 40 hours worked, take off PAYE, USC and other things, you are left with the take home pay.  Out of that you have to take what you have to pay get to work, buy your sandwich at work or whatever you have to do.  There is a clear issue there.  As Dr. Healy said, the fundamental must be that work pays and we must incentivise people to work.  We need more people working now because there is demand for more work.  It is a great place to be in, but we need to ensure that as many people as possible can transition to work and contribute, and can have a more sustainable living.  I thank the witnesses for their input.</p></speech>

As always, their contributions have been most informative.  To cut a long story short, what I am hearing is that indexing and benchmarking welfare against wages is the way to do it because if we use inflation, the less well off will see a bigger gap growing between them and workers.  In addition, if I heard the witnesses right, there is no trade-off with the need to provide universal services in order to prevent the cost of living from rising, particularly in those areas which disproportionately affect the less well off.</p> <p>  My question relates a little to that posed by Deputy Canney.  How far would the witnesses go in that regard?  I agree with them.  I would like to know how far they would go in decommodifying - and I very much like that phrase; it is a good old socialist phrase - the things that people need to live on, so that they do not find themselves in a situation where the price of things they really need and have to have to live is running away from them.  How far do we go?</p><p>I am in favour of going very far, as the witnesses can probably guess.  I would like to hear their opinion on that.  To take energy as an example, do we start to need to decommodify energy prices?  Do we subsidise them to keep them at an affordable level or cap them?  To my mind, they are absolutely indispensable to living.  Do we have to decommodify them?  Do we have to go back to when there was greater regulation of the energy sector when the ESB was operating on a not-for-profit basis?  Otherwise, we are always prey to these market things.  Do we get rid of bin charges?  I think we should.  They are a serious factor.  For are a low-income family, they are a serious problem.  I have always said that they would be a problem.  The cost of them is going up and up.  How far do we go?  That is really the question.  Should education and public transport be all free?  I would say "Yes".  How many of those areas have become vulnerable to inflation with a rising cost of living do we take out of that inflation spiral?</p><p> Then on wages, particularly the wages of the low paid, one thing obviously is that many of these areas like healthcare and the medical card were mentioned.  We were talking about raising thresholds and tapering them.  Do we go the whole hog and just say all costs for healthcare should be removed?  I would say that is what we need to do.  Social housing income thresholds are a real problem for people now.  People who are actually homeless are now being denied housing support because they are working and their earnings are going over the threshold.  Do we remove all thresholds for social housing so that social housing is not something just for the low paid but is universally available for anybody who wants to apply for it?  I would say "Yes" but these are radical things to suggest.  Would the witnesses say yes?  My questions kind of relate to Deputy Canney's questions.</p><p> I will mention one little story as well, which kind of sums it up for me.  Apartments are being advertised at the moment by an apartment company that has bought whole apartment blocks in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is charging &euro;2,200 for two-bedroom and &euro;2,100 for one-bedroom apartments.  Somebody who was approved for the housing assistant payment, HAP, and was homeless went to the company and said she would like to rent one of these apartments and was told to choose whichever one she wanted.  She was one of the first people in the door.  She thought this was amazing, chose number 11 then went back to the company and told it she was a HAP tenant.  The company told her that it did not do HAP and was not set up for it .  That is outrageous, first of all.  I googled the same company and it is advertising jobs to work in that company to presumably show people around who are looking to rent the places.  Guess how much it is advertising jobs for.  It is &euro;26,000.  Now, at &euro;2,200 for an apartment, the person who is showing people around would have to pay 100% of his or her entire gross income in order to be able to rent one.  In other words, that person could not afford the apartment.  What do we do to make sure wages are actually sufficient to ensure that a person can afford the basic things like housing, healthcare, heat, etc.?  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Obviously, we are looking at a benchmark against wages.  The Deputy's question actually goes back to a point we made when we appeared before an Oireachtas committee a number of years ago with NERI.  It is about thresholds and how we decommodify things and the issue came up in terms of the social wage.  These are things Dr. McDonnell mentioned earlier and to which Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell alluded, that is, to subsidise childcare and public transport and then provide affordable housing, be it social housing, cost-rental or housing that is affordable for somebody to buy.  If we can come to terms with those three issues primarily first, that will go a huge way towards supporting those people on social welfare but also those people the Deputy is talking about, that is, those workers on low incomes or minimum wage or even above minimum wage, which probably would be considered a good income if prices were not rising at such a rate and if the cost of housing were not so high.  If we can get to that point then the pressures on the cost of living would certainly be lower.<br/><br/>We also have to look at subsidising those things that would rise, that is, the biggest multipliers both economically and socially.  Those are the issues.  It is childcare and public transport.  It is looking at investment in education at all levels both from early childhood<b></b>right up now to skills development, retraining and lifelong learning.  It gets back to the cost of housing as well, which was one of the big drivers in terms of the cost of living but it puts pressure on wages and on employers as well.<br/><br/>The Deputy also mentioned healthcare in terms of universal access.  We have consistently pointed out that Ireland is the only country in the EU that does not have primary care that is free at the point of access.  This is something for which we have consistently advocated.  The rolling out of the community health networks and what should be a commitment to roll out and fund the infrastructure for Sl&aacute;intecare would be key here.<br/><br/>In response to the issue of housing, we need to go beyond social housing and look at cost-rental, affordable housing and how we approach housing overall.  I note that the first progress report on Housing for All was published today.  We in Social Justice Ireland would be concerned at some of the issues that have been pushed back.  The issue of land value has been pushed back to December 2022.  There are other issues, again, in terms of how we count homelessness and other things.  We seem to already be pushing back the key issues we should be getting to grips with in the Housing for All plan.  It is not even a year old and yet we are pushing issues back to the end of this year.  I will pass over to my colleague, Dr. McDonnell.</p></speech>

It is what we call a merit good.  We want people to buy into it so we should, if anything, be subsidising and paying people to go into education rather than having them pay for school books, registration fees for third level or whatever it might be.  Lifelong education, of course, should be free for everyone.</p> <p>  Public transport is another one.  We are supposedly trying our best to have a just transition.  We are trying to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  We should be encouraging people to engage with public transport.  Again, a public and social good outweighs the private good.  It should, ideally, be free.  Also, the cost of transport is a barrier to employment, as is the cost of childcare.  To that extent, we can increase employment rates, particularly for second earners and lone parents in the case of childcare if, as we said, we were to make public transport and childcare completely free and decommodify them.  There is, therefore, a strong case in all those areas for very high levels of subsidisation at the very minimum.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned housing.  NERI has proposed cost-rental housing, which would be organised through a new semi-State body.  State-owned housing would, therefore, be available on a cost-rental basis where the income is recycled into the building of new housing.  Over time, the State becomes a much larger player in the housing sector.  There are all sorts of macroeconomic advantages associated with that to deal with the supply issue.  Obviously, the housing crisis has many other factors associated with it.  Land prices are a part of it.  Taxation is certainly part of the solution in that regard.</p><p>We also talked about wages.  Clearly, we have a low-pay problem in Ireland.  We have a very skewed level of market inequality.  We have many high-paid and low-paid workers.  We have a low-pay problem that relates to the fact that we do not have a lot of manufacturing jobs, for example, and we have many bad-paying industries, such as accommodation, food services, restaurants, retail and things like that.  Ideally, we want to move our economy away from those types of jobs over the longer term towards more high-value added jobs.</p></speech>

The living wage could be an impetus to innovation and productivity gains by businesses that currently do not necessarily have to make the changes at present.</p> <p>  There are also advantages to having high minimum wage rates.  For example, there tends to be lower levels of turn for firms.  That means there are lower retraining costs, there tends to be better morale and workers tend to be more engaged.  It could be of benefit to the economy overall, including those small firms, if there is a happier and more secure workforce.  I am pretty sure I missed some of the Deputy's points but, hopefully, that touches upon most of them.</p></speech>

I thank him very much.  I am curious about what he has to say on the energy issue, given that it is very topical at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#H00500"><p>Energy is fundamental.  Energy and food are the fundamental units of the economy.  I do not see making energy free as a merit good in quite the same way as education.  I should have mentioned that healthcare should also be free, universal, single tier and so forth.  I see energy as something that could be dealt with through secondary benefits, perhaps on a time-limited basis.  When energy costs, for example, are accelerating as they are at present, there is a major issue in the short term.  Targeted measures would be the answer to that.  Remember that energy prices are following the economic cycle at present, which normally takes seven to ten years.  In this case, it is happening in approximately 18 months to two years.  We are seeing extreme volatility of prices.  It is absolutely the case that we have an energy crisis at present, but if everything is framed in terms of the cost of living overall, then indexing to wages should resolve most of those issues over the medium term, while acknowledging that there is a necessity for short-term measures to offset the current cost of energy problems we have.  I am not sure if that coherently answers the question.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.291" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#H00700"><p>There is one small thing to bear in mind.  While I agree with Dr. McDonnell on the issue of not making energy free, in that sense, but rather targeting people to protect them, bear in mind that the targeting system we have at present for fuel poverty and so on is not working.  It only targets a proportion of the people who have a problem in that space.  As a result, we have this bizarre situation of endless Government announcements stating that it is dealing with the energy poverty issue through raising the fuel poverty allowance by a small amount, but in actual fact it is not reaching quite a large proportion of the people who are substantially worse off.  I am talking about vulnerable people who are living in poverty, many of whom cannot access money to address fuel poverty.  That is quite a serious issue.</p> <p>  One other number that might be of interest to people in the context of this discussion is the proportion of social housing.  Across the EU, an average of 20% of the housing stock is social housing, but in Ireland it is 9%.  It is hardly a surprise that we have a social housing crisis.  Until such time as we build dramatically more social housing units, and seriously do cost rental, then we are in serious trouble.  We will be left with two-bedroom apartments for &euro;2,200 a month that in some way or other somebody will wind up calling affordable at the rate things are going.  This is surreal and loses all contact with reality.</p></speech>

It is appalling, certainly in my constituency.  I thank the witnesses for today's session.  We are at the beginning of our work on this and I wonder whether some of our questions are very open-ended in nature.  I hope they will bear with us.  We are trying to get to grips with this topic and we hope to do some quite detailed work on it.</p> <p>  With that in mind, one of the things I wanted to ask about today was how a system of indexation would deal with this.  It has been referenced a little in both submissions.  How would the witnesses deal with the operation of indexation where there are sharp increases or decreases in whatever it is benchmarked to?  In this case, we are all talking about wages.  Dr. McDonnell talked about a backward-focused set of data that might relate to four quarters.  Does he believe that would be sufficient to deal with increases or decreases?  What is the danger there?  Does he think we will be able to create a system of indexation that is robust enough to guard against those very sharp increases or decreases and ensure that indexation is doing what we want it to do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.293" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#H00900"><p>Yes.  We can design a robust system that would prove able to achieve that.  It does not have to be full quarters; it could be six or even 12 quarters.  The more quarters that are used, the more evened out it will be and there will be less volatility.  For example, we had a very unusual year in 2020 when wage movements were very volatile because of the skew of low-paid workers, primarily, who lost their jobs.  Over a longer period, wages find an equilibrium that is related to inflation and productivity.  Those two things are feeding into economic growth.  Wages are, in a sense, anchored to long-term economic growth.  Wage increases also tend to be higher than price increases.  Aiming for wage indexation is robust.  It will be fiscally sound, it does not imply an increase in public spending - or an increase or reduction in the level of taxes - compared to the size of the economy and it is distributionally neutral.  It is absolutely affordable and does not necessarily crowd out any of the other options we have described today, depending on political preferences.</p> <p>  There is the issue of very high and dramatic increases in inflation at present.  Looking a little further back, inflation in 2021 was only approximately 2.4%.  It was negative, 0.9%, the year before that.  We are not seeing sustained high levels of inflation yet.  It is true that we are expecting a high number in 2022.  The Central Bank reckons it might be 4.5%, but wage increases in previous years would cover that.  Wage increases in 2022 are likely to be more than 4.5%, if the 4.5% increase in inflation comes to pass.  While there may be a little lag in respect of months and quarters, and catching up with the cost of the energy crisis, we will catch up.</p><p>Hence my comment that an immediate response to the energy crisis could be done with some kind of temporary measure that would not be baked into the system because over the medium term the system would be robust and would be responding to all those things.  Fundamentally, wages are anchored to economic growth, and inflation and wages tend to be anchored to each other with wages being slightly bigger year-on-year.</p></speech>

There is a model of how to deal with this in the living wage technical group.  I mentioned it earlier but did not go into it in detail.  In that technical group we recognised we could not have sudden increases in the living wage either.  We basically had a situation in which we set a limit and that in any particular year the increase, or decrease for that matter, could not exceed a particular number.  That is set out and explained and so on.  We could have a similar situation here.</p> <p>  I have a concern about the way the increase would be based on the last four or six quarters, or whatever.  This is simply because of people on welfare, who are already on the margin and have no space whatsoever in their budget.  If they hit an increase, telling them they must wait 12 months to get recompense, that leaves them in a very vulnerable position.  They are going to be struggling with less than is required for a whole year.  We should be able to work it that we have predictions every year on what the increases in these areas are likely to be, so when we are talking about wages we should have some kind of idea.  At the end of that year, the first part of setting out what the new rate for the following year should be would be an adjustment based on what the actual outturn for wages that year was.  Then we can make the adjustment and add or subtract depending on what has happened and what is predicted for the year ahead.  It is possible to do it in a way that would protect people who are vulnerable and also protects businesses and the economy generally from sudden lurches.</p></speech>

We are really talking about two areas, that is, the welfare system and taxes.  I was wondering if our contributors could explore a little whether we should always be talking about that in terms of the same measure, in that the indexation would always be linked to the exact same measure, or should we be looking at a more nuanced approach?  I am mindful that to a large extent welfare is a very domestic issue to the economy.  Taxes can be somewhat more complex than that.  Do our contributors have any thoughts on whether it should be the same measure across both parts of the economy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.304" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#J01100"><p>My answer to it is "No".  We should not have the same measure across the economy.  The reason for that is one we have spelt out in some detail.  Our position is Ireland is not collecting sufficient tax to deliver the services and infrastructure required, that is, services and infrastructure at what we would say is a western European average level.  It is basically what people would expect from looking at our peer countries in western Europe.</p> <p>  We need to move the overall tax take up.  We are not talking about a huge increase but a moderate one.  We have spelt it out and provided a basis for it.  I am not going to go into the detail here because it is very extensive but we have published it.  A few days ago we submitted an updated version of it to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare that is sitting.  I think the closing date for submissions was last week or earlier this week.  Anyway, we made a submission before the deadline setting out our views on this.  We are talking about raising the overall total tax by a relatively small amount.  This would bring it up closer to the European average but not actually reach it.  That would give us quite substantial amounts of money to make up for the deficits currently there in both services and infrastructure.  Most Irish people want services like health, education and so on and infrastructure like public transport, broadband and social housing to be at a western European level and that we match our peers.  To do that we must get closer to their level of tax take.</p> <p>  We need to deal with the illusion that is sometimes created that we can have European levels of services and infrastructure for American levels of taxation.  We cannot.  It is not doable.  This is one of the things we believe there should be a national discussion and debate about.  We have been urging the Government to have these discussions and use the social partnership process or the national economic dialogue or some process to bring together the various sectors of society to have a discussion about what level of service we want delivered in Ireland and what levels of infrastructure we want and then having a serious discussion based on evidence about how we are going to pay for those.  At least some of that is going to have to come out of the public purse, if you like.  That means we have to see some increase in the overall tax take, the way we see it.</p> <p>  To achieve that, we feel there is a need now for a new social contract.  Most Deputies have probably heard us going on about this already in other arenas and so on.  We believe we should be working simultaneously for a thriving economy, decent services and infrastructure, just taxation, good governance and sustainability.  The just taxation piece is critical in that.  There are five basic things and just taxation is critical if we are to do it.  Therefore, I would not have the same approach to it as I would have to benchmarking and indexation of welfare.  Once we get the total tax take up to the levels that can provide the services and infrastructure we require or that we want as a nation, then we can have a discussion about how to benchmark it and how we keep a balance between our infrastructure and services, on the one side, and the tax take on the other.</p> <p>  The point we constantly make is if one wants a thriving economy, which I think we all do, then we must put in the services.  We must have a good health system and a good education system.  We also need good infrastructure.  We need good broadband, public transport and housing.  To do that we must have a fair, decent, just taxation system.  That is the kind of frame we operate in.</p></speech>

There are two parts to the answer.</p><p>First, indexation as to what we think of as the baseline or starting point for the subsequent year would be not only the welfare component but also the tax component.  That establishes the <i>status quo</i>.  One indexes to wages and everything gets uplifted.<br/><br/>That said, the second part of my answer, which will be longer than the first, is to agree with Dr. Healy and to say there is a revenue sufficiency issue.  Social Justice Ireland, the NERI and many other organisations have repeatedly pointed to it.  There are low levels of per-pupil spending on education, childcare, research and development and all sorts of other areas where it is completely legitimate to have a debate about sufficiency and the kind of society we want.  I do not accept the argument that there is X billion euro in fiscal space every year and that no changes should therefore be made in respect of net revenue, up or down.  The point of what I have said today about the indexation is that the baseline is such that everything is uplifted but that it might then be completely relevant and okay to make the policy decision to increase taxes or whatever it might be in a particular area.<br/><br/>Dr. Healy made the point about the revenue sufficiency.  I do not need to restate it.  It is an empirical fact.  The per-person spending of other western European countries, particularly EU countries, is far higher than ours.  We are way out of line.  That is the reason we have a childcare crisis, to a certain extent the reason we have a housing crisis and the reason we do not have a particularly strong innovation system and so on.  We do not invest.  If one does not invest, one will not get the results.  There is therefore no confusion or surprise as to why Ireland is where it is.</p></speech>

I see Deputy Durkan is back with us, and I know Deputy Canney wants to come back in.  I will get in my two questions because I do not want to take up too much of the committee's time.</p> <p>  I will cut to the chase and ask my first question.  One of the things I am interested in is how many of our population who are in deprivation or below the poverty line we would expect to be lifted out of that poverty through indexation.  I notice that one of the first things the NERI's submission states is that price indexation could be seen just as a proxy for a standstill policy.  I take the point that this is a complementary policy to other services and other cost-of-living issues but, in bald terms, will indexation significantly impact levels of poverty across the country?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#K00500"><p>I will give an initial response.  We have outlined this in our submission as well.  We did some initial figures on this, based on the 2016 census and looking at indexation to the 27.5% of average earnings.  We estimate that about 12,000 working-age adults would have been lifted above the poverty line, using the 2016 numbers.  If that had been increased by one percentage point to 28.5%, we would be looking at an increase of 28,000 working-age adults.  Then one has to take on board the knock-on impact on the households in which those people are living and what the increased income means to those households.  One would expect to see a substantial reduction in the poverty risk.  Our analysis, looking at budgets from 2017 to 2022, has shown that in those budgets in which core social welfare payments were increased, it had an impact in the form of a reduction in the risk-of-poverty rate.  The correlation in that regard can be seen when one increases the incomes of those who are on the lowest incomes and those on core social welfare rates.  There is a correlation in respect of the reduction of poverty risk.</p></speech>

I know it is hard to forecast those kinds of numbers, but it is helpful to at least feel our way towards some kinds of numbers.</p> <p>  That brings me to my final question.  Throughout this session we have dealt with a lot of issues that require a huge amount of data analysis and compilation.  The witnesses' organisations both do a huge amount of research, which I rely on quite often, in this area.  Do they believe that Ireland produces and has access to the kinds of data, disaggregated data particularly, that would allow us to instigate a system of indexation that could be relied on?  Do we have the data on household incomes?  I am thinking specifically of the issue of sharp increases and decreases.  Do we have access to those data?  Do the relevant Departments give access to those data in a timely manner?  I do not know who wants to answer that.  Dr. McDonnell, maybe?</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have now started sharing wage data, for example, with the CSO, so we now have access to administrative data.  That is much better than the way we used to do it.  It is through the PAYE modernisation system.  We therefore have good distributional data - at least, the CSO does - and my understanding is that the CSO will share those data, so the data on the distribution of household income, at least through wages, will be available.</p></speech>

It should be quite timely.  Those are wage data.  As for the inflation data you are talking about, Chairman, the answer is that we do not collect those data as well as some other countries.  For example, the United States has what has been called a personal consumption deflator.  They are able to analyse what is happening to prices at a micro level based on what people are actually buying, whereas in Ireland we rely on a basket of goods and every month the CSO goes out and literally looks in shops and sees what has happened to those goods.  My understanding is that there are opportunities to improve those data based on the way we now buy things, using debit cards and so forth far more than we used to.  Purchasing information is getting better.  That said, it is still not where it could be.  The answer to your question, Chairman, is that we are getting better but certainly not on a real-time basis.</p></speech>

I notice that they are having this conversation in the UK about the reality on the ground as to what people on low incomes are buying.  The UK's consumer price index does not reflect the reality of people on low incomes.</p></speech>

There probably should be a different inflationary indicator that focuses on low-income households and the basket of goods they purchase.  That could be done by the surveys of households as to what they have been spending.  Again, there would be a lag and it would not be real-time but it would certainly be an improvement on what we have.  The focus there would be on lower income households.  It should be remembered that what we and Social Justice Ireland are proposing is wage indexation, so it would be relevant in dealing only with these very specific shocks such as we are seeing with energy prices at the moment.  I ask the committee to remember that we have had about a decade of very stable prices.</p><p>It could be a case of creating all this new infrastructure and administration and never having to use it again for another ten or 15 years because these energy shocks are unusual and something we have not seen much of in the last 15 years.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether I was appreciated in those places or not but we will have to push on.  Indexation has merits but it is not the answer.  When I left the meeting I referenced how it restricts the degree to which Governments can respond and how it leaves them with fewer options.  Dr. Healy mentioned 2007 as almost being the ideal situation in terms of income distribution and so on.  Unfortunately the country was bust and broke at the time and it was not able to pay its way.  We have to be careful to never walk in those footsteps again.  Since then we paid &euro;60 billion to rescue all sorts of institutions that failed and we had to face the other challenge of Covid.  That has not been a bridge too far but it was tardily and carefully crossed.</p> <p>  We have to look at a few things.  I said to Dr. Healy 25 years ago that the biggest issue to affect the country in the next 20 years would be housing.  That was a fact then and it is still a fact.  The cost of housing to any family is a huge impact.  We can have all the taxation increases we want but the amount that goes towards paying the rent or mortgage is the single biggest determinant in deciding how much money is available for the household to live on afterwards.  Unfortunately we have gone in the wrong direction there and the Government is trying to catch up with it.  We know that has been going on for the last number of years and we are making some progress but that progress is not in line with what we would need to be doing in order to alleviate the burden and threat on families that may be on the margins.  There was a time back in the 1980s when it was possible for people to house themselves or be housed and every local authority in the country was able to do it.  However, we had a debate and discussion on that and the whole system changed.</p> <p>  We are now in a different region so what do we do from here?  We have to go for an increase in housing output in order to pull down that single biggest factor hanging over the heads of every family in the country, whether they be middle income or lower income.  In the lower income brackets it affects the household much more.  I am sorry to go on about this but it is something I have spent a lot of time talking about over the years.  I have not solved the problem yet but the problem is solvable if we are successful in providing the number of houses that are needed to meet the demands.  The economy will recover and it is recovering now.  There will be a greater demand for housing in the next two years arising from people coming into the country, staying in the country and working in jobs that are available here.  One only has to look at the recent reports on that.</p> <p>  I am glad to see that the number of jobs available to women has increased, particularly permanent jobs which is good.  I am not saying this just because the women are listening but the mammies have always been seen to give a good economic example.  They try everything and push hard all the time and they are at the coalface.  They know how to do things themselves and they do it.  I will rest my case for now.  I thank the Chair for letting me in again and I am sorry for imposing at the end.  Dr. Healy and I will have this debate again in about ten years&rsquo; time.</p></speech>

Let me put the point of disagreement first.  We discussed this 25 years ago in 1997 and it was in the context of a new national agreement that was being negotiated and the community and voluntary pillar were in the negotiations for the first time.  We were surprised because when one puts in all the pillars that were part of that negotiation, we were the only one to argue for increasing the supply of social housing.  It was in that context that I was having this discussion with Deputy Durkan, who agreed with me but we did not have too many other people agreeing with us.</p> <p>  I want to clarify the other matter.  I was not saying the income distribution situation in 2007 was good.  I was just making the point that in 2007 the social welfare payments were indexed.  That was the issue I was referring to.  There was a whole lot of other stuff going on that we did not agree with at the time.  All one has to do is look at our response to and analysis of the budget that year to see why we welcomed the indexation, benchmarking and so on.  We disagreed with a lot of things.</p> <p>  I refer to the other point the Deputy is raising.  We need both an indexation and a benchmarking of welfare payments and a dramatic increase in the housing supply.  On the one side we have an incredible requirement at this moment because of waiting lists, HAP and all sorts of other stuff.  The Deputy and Ms Murphy have already discussed our recent study on the implications of what is happening in housing for poverty and so on.  One thing that is clear is we need dramatic interventions, not just in the next two years but over the whole decade because the scale of what is required is massive.  What worries me in that context is that we are talking about a huge increase in the number of jobs and a lot of those will bring people in from abroad, which puts further pressure on the housing system.  It is critically important that we get ahead of this loop.  We need to benchmark and index welfare payments at the same time.  We need to do it simultaneously rather than get trying to get housing done before coming back to welfare and other issues.  Increasing the housing supply is the most important thing we need to do as a country, both economically and socially.  We need it from both sides of that equation.</p></speech>

As a member of the Committee on Disability Matters with Deputy Hourigan, it is important to say that while we are improving social welfare supports for people, our citizens who have disabilities have been left in the lurch and treated poorly and unfairly.  One of the things that has come out of an Indecon report is that the costs of their disabilities on top of their normal living is an average of &euro;9,000 per annum.  In whatever context we try to rationalise and improve the lot of people who are on the poverty line, at the top of that agenda should be the rationalisation and implementation of a proper support scheme for people with disabilities.  We must also give them the right to work and make sure that them going to work does not mean they will lose out on some of the entitlements they need to live.</p><p>This is something that we, as politicians, must put at the top of our agenda.</p><p> As we have delved into issues relating to people with disabilities, it has become more and more obvious that they are the forgotten in our society to a great extent.  We are living with that now.  We talk about the sins of the State through years and the wrongs that were done but, right now, we are living through one wrong, which is the way we treat people with disabilities.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  We talk about social justice and about making sure that everybody has the right to live.  I have a document in front of me from the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice entitled Working Notes: Irish Policy at the Centenary.  I was delighted to see that one of the articles therein which is about housing was written by my classmate from secondary school, Mr. Padraic Kenna.  As well as looking back we need to look at what we are doing in the present and at the major wrongs that we can put right.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.</p></speech>

We certainly welcome the publication of the Indecon report which was long overdue.  There is a vast amount of detail in that report on the different types of disability and the different types of costs involved.  At a very minimum we have costed and advocated for a cost of disability payment to support those people with a disability with the additional costs of living that they face on a daily basis.</p> <p>  A report on a strategy for housing for disabled people was published two weeks ago and we strongly urge that the recommendations in that report be implemented, particularly in the context of adaptation grants and the suitability of new builds.  It is important that new buildings are built in such a way as to be adaptable over time, both to provide for people who have a disability now as well as people who may acquire a disability into the future.</p> <p>  We have a very low employment rate for people with disabilities compared with other European countries.  We have to look at how we support people with disabilities into employment and how we allow them to access certain schemes to which they do not have access at the moment.  I refer to schemes like T&uacute;s or community employment, which should be open to people with a disability to help them to enter the labour market.  The tapering issue that was highlighted earlier is crucial in this regard.  It is essential that any additional supports that people with disabilities have are not lost overnight when they enter the labour market.  There must be a tapering and a consideration of how the supports that individuals have interact with their income from employment.</p></speech>

I thank the panel of witnesses for their attendance here today.  I apologise in advance if I ask a question that has already been asked.  As Sinn F&eacute;in's spokesperson for older people, I assist a lot of people with issues related to the State pension.  What is the panel's view on the indexation of pension payments and various benefits like carer's allowance and fuel allowance and also the indexation of various access thresholds?</p></speech>

Of course, like all welfare rates, a constant disability payment should be indexed.  In terms of Deputy Patricia Ryan's question, pension payments, carer's allowance and so forth should all be treated the same as all other welfare rates.  They should all be indexed but adjusted to a particular benchmark which is based upon the cost of living for different cohorts.  That benchmark would need to be established.  There would need to be independent analysis to decide what the appropriate benchmark is but then the indexation, plus an adjustment to the benchmark, would be how to treat it year on year.  That would be true for all groups, not just pensioners, people with disabilities or other groups.  The UK has been pursuing a triple-lock model based on the highest from wages, prices or 2.5% but it is probably going to move away from that model.  In my view, the wage indexation model would be sufficient over the medium term to ensure ongoing quality of life improvements and real disposable income improvements for the groups described by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I ask them to give their opinion on the indexation of thresholds for access to social housing and to outline whether they would favour a removal of some of those thresholds.  What would their view be on using expenditure and debt to get rid of those thresholds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#M00900"><p>We mentioned earlier that the European average for social housing is 20% of overall housing stock but in Ireland it is only 9%.  One of the problems that goes with that is that income thresholds are kept low because we just do not have the houses to accommodate people.  We are arguing very strongly for a dramatic increase in that.  We are arguing for an increase in Ireland's social housing stock to 20% of the total stock, which is beyond what is being planned at the moment on any front.  This is critically important.  If we had a dramatic increase in the provision of social housing we would then be able to take a large number of people out of the private rented sector.  We would save the HAP money they are getting at the moment and we would be able to put people into social housing.  Obviously, cost-rental is in the mix as well.  We would be very supportive of cost-rental as the next stage up in terms of development.  If we could take a substantial number of people out of the private rental sector, we would take a major step towards stabilising the market, a market in which people are paying nonsense rents of &euro;2,200 per month a two-bedroom apartments.</p> <p>  We would also support what Dr. McDonnell was saying about indexation of pensions and of thresholds and would agree that the wages would do the trick rather than the triple lock.  They used that model in the UK.  It fits a particular moment but I do not think we are in that moment here, at this stage.  We should accept wages as the basic benchmark for indexation and then pick the numbers at which we are going to pitch welfare and pension rates.  Obviously, we need research to work out what is required, ultimately, to live life with dignity so that we know where to put those marks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022012600002#M01100"><p>Broadly speaking, there are very few.  The only potential or arguable downside is that it reduces the flexibility of the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to allocate funds in a way that is deemed optimal.  It could reduce departmental ability to determine how to use the fiscal space of &euro;4.5 billion, or even more if taxes are increased.  That loss of flexibility is the only real downside but indexation would probably use up less than one third of the entirety of the fiscal space so it certainly would not preclude the Government from engaging on any of the major policy initiatives that it would want to pursue.</p><p>It is fiscally neutral, which is good from a public spending and taxation point of view in the long term.  It means bond markets, or whoever it might be, can look to the future and know, broadly speaking, how much will be spent.  This increases the reliability of the Irish Government.  This should have benefits for how we are perceived.  It is completely affordable from this point of view.  It depoliticised this very sensitive issue so we do not have a situation whereby people are under-served for three out of five years and then there are big boosts just before an election.  This creates a volatility in household income which is bad for everyone.</p><p> There is a tendency to increase welfare rates disproportionately during the good times.  This tends to amplify booms and make recessions worse.  People on welfare tend to be punished during recessions.  The indexation effectively protects household income and makes it more reliable.  It also prevents deterioration in income inequality.  The benefits dramatically outweigh potential costs.  The only potential cost is theoretical.  It reduces options in other areas.</p></speech>

Dr. McDonnell has made a point about politicising the issue.  This happens over and over again.  Suddenly before an election there are big payments.  These payments do not pay the bills that vulnerable people had to pay over the previous three years.  There would be a freeing up of airspace to discuss other policy issues.  This would be positive from our perspective.  There would be many positive elements to it.</p></speech>

We will be engaging with the Minister on the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I am obliged to read a housekeeping note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person, they will be directed to discontinue the remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise and make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member who participating online to indicate that they are on the Leinster House campus grounds.  </p> <p>  Those were the technicalities.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Joining me are Mr. Andrew Condon, Ms Catherine Clynes and Mr. Peter Molloy from my Department's PEACEPLUS North South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and North South unit.</p> <p>  I am very glad to have the opportunity to engage with committee members today on the SEUPB and the cross-border EU programmes that it manages.  Since the 1990s and the first tentative steps of the peace process, the EU has been responsible across successive funding programmes for the investment of more than &euro;3.3 billion in support of peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland.  This investment has made a vital contribution to enhanced North-South co-operation and to shared better outcomes for the people of this island.  Indeed, I would suggest that today, as we consider both the ongoing impact of Brexit and as we look ahead to rebuilding after the Covid pandemic, this support is now more needed than ever before.</p> <p>  Responsibility for the development and management of these programmes rests with the SEUPB, a North-South implementation body, NSIB, established, of course, on foot of the Good Friday Agreement.  The SEUPB is headquartered in Belfast, with smaller offices in Omagh and Monaghan and has a headcount of 57 staff.  The SEUPB is led by chief executive, Ms Gina McIntyre, and is accountable jointly to myself as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in Ireland and to Northern Ireland Minister of Finance, Conor Murphy, MLA.  There are a number of aspects of the SEUPB&rsquo;s important work which I would like to briefly highlight this morning.  </p> <p>  I might first address the two current, that is, 2014 to 2020, EU cross-border programmes managed by the SEUPB, INTERREG VA and PEACE IV.  These two programmes cover an investment area of Northern Ireland, the Border counties of Ireland and, in the case of INTERREG VA only, parts of western Scotland.  Between them, they have a combined value of some &euro;553 million, representing a major and ongoing financial commitment from the EU, the Northern Ireland Executive, and the Irish Government.  The INTERREG VA programme has a total value of &euro;283 million and is designed to promote greater economic, social and territorial cohesion across the region.  The PEACE IV programme has total funding of &euro;270 million and is intended to advance peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  Both programmes are now fully financially committed in support of some 130 individual projects, but project activity will continue on both until 2023 and into 2024.</p> <p>  The range of funding interventions being carried out under the INTERREG and PEACE programmes is very broad indeed.  I will briefly mention just two today in order to give you some idea of the excellent work being done here.  Under INTERREG VA, the &euro;8.5 million North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing, NWCAM, project is linking the academic capabilities of Ireland, Northern Ireland and western Scotland in order to drive cross-Border advanced manufacturing for the life and health science sector.  Project partners include Institute of Technology, IT, Sligo, Letterkenny IT, the University of Ulster and the University of Glasgow.  Meanwhile, under PEACE IV, the &euro;9.5 million Monaghan Peace Campus project is developing a major new shared space which will serve as a community hub for Monaghan town. This is a landmark cross-community development, achieved with the involvement, support and commitment of the Orange Order and the Ulster Scots Agency.  It is the first time that either body has participated in a PEACE project in County Monaghan.  Finally, in the context of Brexit, it is important that I note that the 2020 withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK, as well as its accompanying political declaration, provides for the full completion of both programmes out to their normal closure dates.</p><p>I will also talk about the work of the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, on the new PEACEPLUS programme, the development of which many members will have been following closely over recent months.  This unique new EU programme will continue to work with the INTERREG and peace programmes over the 2021 to 2027 period by combining these two existing funding streams into a single cohesive programme for the Border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Ireland has consistently advocated for a new North-South EU programme to carry on this important work post-Brexit.  I am therefore pleased to report that programme development is now at a very advanced stage.  The SEUPB has been working closely with my Department and with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland over the course of this process.  The development of the PEACEPLUS programme has been informed by extensive stakeholder engagement.  This has included two major public consultations held across the eligible area for PEACEPLUS in 2019, 2020 and 2021, as well as close engagement with Departments North and South in order to identify and develop areas of cross-Border co-operation.  On foot of this development work the SEUPB has finalised a draft PEACEPLUS programme structured around six thematic investment areas - building peaceful and thriving communities; delivering economic regeneration and transformation; empowering and investing in young people; healthy and inclusive communities; supporting a sustainable and better connected future; and building and enhancing partnership and collaboration.  This draft programme was approved by Government, by the Northern Ireland Executive and by the North-South Ministerial Council in October 2021.  It is now in the process of submission to the European Commission for its final review and approval.  This progress will allow for a formal launch of PEACEPLUS and the opening of funding calls later this year.  SEUPB has already commenced pre-development support work to ensure that the programme can be mobilised without delay following its launch.  While a formal financing agreement for PEACEPLUS is still being finalised, financial commitments from the EU, the UK and Ireland mean that the new programme will have a total value of more than &euro;1.1 billion.  That is more than twice the value of the current INTERREG and peace programmes combined.  This represents an unprecedented financial commitment in the history of these cross-Border EU programmes.  PEACEPLUS is an ambitious and exciting new development that will leave an enduring legacy on this island.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to give these opening remarks and look forward to our discussion. </p></speech>

I open now to any member who wishes to indicate.  While members are thinking I may pose a question.  I have some familiarity with the programme.  I was privileged to co-chair the SEUPB for five years.  It is an extraordinarily valuable initiative.  It has now reached a substantial mass of money.  I have two questions for the Minister.  Will the Minister explain the evaluation process for eligible projects?  In the beginning of the programme much of it was contingent on peace building, sometimes occupying communities in a focused way.  We have gone beyond that now.  Since the bedrock of the Good Friday Agreement had three strands, does the commitment to the bedding-down of peace now require a more all-island approach rather than simply a Border approach, an each-side-of-the-Border approach, so that there is a greater understanding of issues on an all-island basis?  Is that something that could be encompassed or supported by the new funding round?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Leas-Cathaoirleach.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge all of his work in this area.  His work in the past in regard to peace and INTERREG programmes and indeed as a predecessor of mine in regard to cohesion policy and all the excellent work he did on behalf of Ireland during his period in government.  His period in government goes back to the 1990s and after the formation of this Department in 2011, all of that work has left a lasting legacy.  There are a number of key priorities as we move forward with the new PEACEPLUS programme, one of which is to ensure that the programme is accessible.  We now have a draft programme that we are on the cusp of submitting to the European Commission.  We expect a rapid evaluation and assessment of the programme by the Commission because there has been ongoing contact, and the chef de cabinet, Commissioner Ferreira came before the committee before Christmas as well.  We are hopefully going to be in a position formally to launch PEACEPLUS in the first half of this year, as early as possible in the first half of this year.  That is the objective.</p> <p>  One of the key priorities will be to make sure that this funding goes to where it is really needed and where it will make a significant impact.  I have discussed this with my colleague, Conor Murphy, on a number of occasions.  We are anxious that the funding will be as accessible as possible to marginalised communities in particular.  We have placed a keen focus on the issue of grass-roots accessibility.  Therefore a programme of pre-funding support is already under way, and training for applicants.  We see that as an important process of simplifying the application procedures insofar as we possibly can.  It is also important to highlight that the two new small grants programmes now included in PEACEPLUS are designed to allow smaller organisations and groups to access the programme with minimum bureaucracy because very often the accusation is made that there is too much red tape and bureaucracy.  Where a significant amount of EU funding is involved there will always be compliance work and regulations that must be adhered to.  Having said that, within that framework we are anxious, and the SEUPB is also, to minimise the amount of bureaucracy.  Pobal will be involved in administering these small grant schemes on behalf of the SEUPB.  Local authorities will also have an important role in regard to delivering projects in PEACEPLUS.  Each local authority will be asked to develop a PEACEPLUS community action plan.  The SEUPB is already providing pre-development support to councils to start this work.  A total of &euro;110 million is available for the action plans. </p> <p>  I will touch on the issue of programme implementation and give an outline of the structure, how decisions are made and ongoing monitoring.  The SEUPB will be the managing authority for the PEACEPLUS programme.  This role will include responsibility for selecting projects, managing payments and claims, monitoring and reporting.  Programme delivery will be overseen by a programme monitoring committee.  A governance structure is required under EU regulations.  The programme governing committee will include Northern and Southern representatives from central and local government, business, trade union, community and voluntary sector, environment, rural equality, youth and health sector organisations.  It has a wide reach and is intended to be as representative as possible of the communities where we hope this programme will have the greatest impact.  My Department and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland are the member state representatives on the monitoring committee.  PEACEPLUS will be implemented by individual projects that are awarded following thematic calls for applications issued by SEUPB.  Those calls will commence promptly once the programme has been approved by the European Commission.  That formal application stage will get underway in the coming months. </p> <p>  I want to use this opportunity to highlight and build a profile of PEACEPLUS within all the communities of the Border counties and throughout Northern Ireland because the opportunity actually to apply for this funding will be coming on stream quite quickly.  In addition, a steering committee appointed by the programme monitoring committee is responsible for project selection.  This committee will decide to accept or reject project applications using application information and assessment reports produced by the SEUPB.  Steering committees include representatives from the member states and the relevant sectoral Departments, North and South.  We expect that most calls for applications will be launched this year and next year and that  programme expenditure will continue beyond the programme period and will likely run to 2029.  The SEUPB has already commenced pre-application support to facilitate early mobilisation of the PEACEPLUS programme following its approval by the Commission.</p><p>Just to give an example, a workshop for potential applicants for the PEACEPLUS youth programme was held on 10 December last year, with the SEUPB as appointed consultants who are currently working with local authorities of the programme area on the design of their PEACEPLUS community peace action plan.  To be fair, SEUPB and the relevant Departments are doing all that we can to make sure that this programme hits the ground running as soon as we have approval from the European Commission in the coming months.  We look forward to seeing the money start to flow to communities and to getting this formal application process under way as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The next speakers will be Deputy Richmond, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Senator Chambers, in that order.</p> <p>  Is there any scope to broaden the projects that might be considered beyond simply the Border region?  Obviously, peacebuilding can be done on an all-island basis.  How does the Minister envisage the programme dovetailing or working with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s initiative and the &euro;500 million expended there as there will be overlap?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#D00300"><p>The PEACEPLUS will cover the eligible area of Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, which are Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo.  However, there will be scope under the new programme for project partners from beyond the eligible area to take part in programme activities.  This is known as the "functional area concept", based on the fact that it makes sense for some projects to extend beyond the eligible area.  The funding is essentially for the core area for which it is designed, which is the Border counties and all of Northern Ireland.  However, in bringing forward proposals, it will be open to applicants to identify project partners that are beyond that core eligible area.</p> <p>  We see much potential there because, of course, the impact of PEACEPLUS and the need to build reconciliation and achieve the thematic objectives of PEACEPLUS extend beyond that clearly defined geographic area.  We see significant synergies with the shared island unit and there is ongoing collaboration with that unit.  As the Vice Chairman knows, it is based within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This has a similar and related but, ultimately, a different focus.  We will be working to a defined programme because we have significant EU funding.  </p> <p>  As the Vice Chairman knows, we published the PEACEPLUS draft programme.  The overview has been published and it lays out the overall thematic areas that we expect to see implemented over the period ahead.  We have indicated the amount of money across those six thematic areas and, of course, this includes building peaceful and thriving communities, which is a key objective of the shared island unit as well.  As part of that, the Irish Government is providing public resources from this Government towards long-awaited infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland and, indeed, in the Border area as well.  Over &euro;300 million of the PEACEPLUS programme is supporting a sustainable and better connected future.  Of course, many of the shared island infrastructure projects are very much aligned with that.  Therefore, there will be ongoing collaboration and synergies between the shared island unite and PEACEPLUS.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#D00400"><p>I will start with less of a question and more of a comment.  To follow on Vice Chairman&rsquo;s final question, much engagement and overlap with the shared island unit would be something very beneficial and we should look at the potential that it offers in great detail.  Certainly, from a Dublin point of view, it is something that should be pushed through.</p> <p>  I have slightly more specific questions.  Obviously, the draft programme was approved at the North South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in October, but subsequent to that, there has been a boycott of such meetings by a certain unionist party.  Can the Minister comment on what impact that is having, or could potentially have, on the work plan being agreed, finalised and, most important, rolled out? </p> <p>  On a more thematic aspect to the work, these are all very important and we have to stress that much good work has been done by the previous iterations of this body and programmes.  It is the nature of reconciliation and peacebuilding and the evolution thereof, coming out of the post-Troubles era into the more difficult political scenario that, let us be frank, we are facing at the moment.  It is not necessarily focused on legacy issues to do with the Troubles, but very current political issues; the impact of Brexit providing another divisive wedge and the lack of implementation at executive levels of certain policies.  Can the Minister comment on how the programme and plans are being modernised and are reflective of the contemporary needs, as well as what has worked previously?  Where is the potential to grow the impact of the various programmes? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#D00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  I welcome his comments on the shared island fund that we have provided.  It is undoubtedly the case that PEACEPLUS will be directly complementary to the capital investment that is being deployed through shared island fund and, indeed, through Project Ireland 2040.  The new programme will support a broad range of activities, which will contribute to connectivity, prosperity and sustainability across the island.  They are complementary and I very much look forward to seeing progress in the roll out of this programme over the period ahead.</p> <p>  On any potential threats or risks for PEACEPLUS arising from the political situation in Northern Ireland, it is important to say that we did, as the Deputy acknowledged, get approval from the Norther Ireland Executive, from the NSMC and the Irish Government as well, last October.  At this point in time, it is full steam ahead.  The final touches are being put to the formal submission to the European Commission and we expect that to be made within the next couple of weeks.  That will be a key milestone.  With the NSMC approval in place, along with the approval for the draft programme last October as well from the Government here and the Northern Ireland Executive, we believe there is not any remaining threat, as such, to the final steps being taken in relation the submission of the application and the approval by the European Commission, and then the kickstarting of the application process across all of the different thematic areas.  That is important.  </p> <p>  On the reach and impact of the programme generally, there are differences to the previous programmes, PEACE IV and INTERREG VA.  This is very much a combined programme.  It is important to say it is heavily shaped and informed by the extensive consultation process that took place with stakeholders, which goes back 2019 through 2020, and indeed, last year as well.  The nature of PEACEPLUS will be different and not just because of the different scale involved.  As I said earlier, it is more than twice the level of funding available under the combined INTERREG and PEACE predecessor programmes.  The reach and the nature of the programmes are also different.  There have been learnings from the current programmes and those have fed into the process.  In addition, the extensive stakeholder consultation has proven to be very valuable.  It will make for a much more impactful programme over the next number of years.</p></speech>

To be fair, the Commission has been really supportive throughout this whole process.  It will already have seen much, if not all, of the formal application previously.  It has been directly involved in helping to guide the completion of the application process.  Therefore, it will not come as a surprise to it.  Certainly, the timeline that we are working to is that it will be submitted, approved and launched in the first half of the year.  We are working to a timeline within the next four or five months.</p><p>I acknowledge the really strong support at a political level across the European Union and also at the level of the Commission where President Von der Leyen has taken a direct personal interest in PEACEPLUS.  This is a real success story for the European Union and the European Commission.  They want to see it progressed over the period ahead.</p><p> In a post-Brexit environment, this is a programme where the funding is made up of a very significant contribution from the UK Government, the European Union, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government.  It is a unique instrument, particularly in a post-Brexit environment.  The European Commission sees this as an opportunity to further the cause of peace and reconciliation.  With the amount of funding that is available, this is a fantastic opportunity for the North and the Border counties.  We are determined to make this programme as impactful as possible over the period ahead.  We expect a formal launch in the next four to five months.</p></speech>

What does the Minister mean by the pre-application work or the preparatory work that has been done by the SEUBP?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#E00300"><p>There has been extensive consultation and engagement as part of this process.  Forums have been held by the SEUBP with communities and bodies likely to be applying for funding under the different thematic areas.  I referred to a specific one that took place in recent weeks.  Considerable effort has been put into ensuring that this process is as simple and straightforward as possible.</p> <p>  One of the learnings from previous programmes is to ensure that the funding is accessible.  Pre-application support to facilitate early mobilisation of the programme following its approval by the European Commission has already commenced.  There was a workshop for potential applicants on 10 December.  Consultants have been appointed and are working with local authorities across the programme on the design of their PEACEPLUS community peace action plans.  We expect that the groundwork and preparation will be helpful when it comes to the formal application stage in the coming months.</p></speech>

Sometimes when local authorities run projects, they look after those pieces of work that suit themselves and in some cases suit individuals.  The biggest problem we have always had with project funding is that those with capacity are those that receive.  That is understandable in some cases, but it can lead to some of the problems the Minister mentioned earlier of ensuring the money gets to where we want it to go.  Irrespective of the rights and wrongs of the themes that have been chosen, we need to ensure that worthwhile projects are put in place.  What involvement does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have an overseeing this?  I understand that it cannot micromanage every individual project and interaction at a local authority level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#E00500"><p>My Department is involved in the process throughout.  While ultimately PEACEPLUS will involve selecting individual projects to be funded, that will follow the thematic calls.  The calls will be under each individual theme and then the relevant applications will come in.  Normally the applications are of a cross-Border nature.  They generally do not come in from a single entity on a sole basis.  They are generally put together by at least two bodies working together on a cross-Border basis.  While that can include local authorities, State agencies, Departments and non-governmental organisations, third level institutions in the academic area and so on can also be involved.</p> <p>  As the Deputy would expect, there is a robust and transparent process, involving assessment of the applications that come in.  This is approved by the programme monitoring committee to support project selection.  It will also involve independent technical experts where appropriate.  We all have a job to do to raise the profile of this in the coming months and to inform the elected members of all the councils in the relevant areas that there will be funding opportunities and that they should be very much involved through their local authorities in shaping their approach and putting forward priority projects during the application stage.  That is why today's appearance is important.  All of us coming through our respective parties and Independents should raise the profile of this issue with local authorities at an elected level as well as the work that is ongoing at official level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#E00600"><p>I agree completely that there is an onus on all of us to ensure information gets out to the organisations and that those relationships are made.  I have seen where some of the smaller pieces of work have been done.  The SEUBP and whoever else have made connections with some organisations.  In some cases, it is about redirecting them and pointing out that this does not necessarily suit them but it might suit others or a conglomerate of local organisations.  Sometimes the local GAA club might think this is another means of getting funding.  That is fine, but it is not necessarily what this is for.</p> <p>  I wish to put this on the record and I do not necessarily expect a reply.  I was very close to Kevin Mulgrew, someone we lost in recent months.  He was very involved in Coiste na nIarchim&iacute;, the ex-prisoner network, and F&aacute;ilte Abhaile in Dundalk.  He would probably have felt that PEACEPLUS and what was being planned would not fulfil some of the other work that had been done previously by the PEACE project as regards the ex-prisoner network and continuing some of the issues that still impact on former political prisoners, their families and communities as well as those who were forced to move jurisdictions as a result of the conflict and whatever else.  That is where that is.</p> <p>  As the Minister said previously, there has always been a particular problem with projects even through local authorities with the desperate levels of bureaucracy relating to European money and specifically PEACE money.  I had a meeting with the SEUBP at which it was stated that there were two problems when these are run through a local authority or whatever.  Sometimes when tendering, excessive criteria were put in which then had to be adhered to.  Sometimes there was a misread by the local authority and they were nearly tougher than what one would experience from the SEUBP or at EU level.  We need to deal with that and ensure we avoid a recurrence.  That said, we still obviously need top levels of governance, accountability and all the rest.  We do not need to bring it to the realms of farce by, for example, accounting for every individual light bulb bought, which has occurred over the years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#E00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  There is no specific theme in PEACEPLUS related to ex-prisoners but the thrust of the programme is to place emphasis on providing support to the most marginalised within our communities, including ex-prisoners.  They are not excluded from being part of projects that will be funded under PEACEPLUS.</p> <p>  It is important to give a sense of the level of consultation that took place in the development of the programme.  The initial public consultation took place between December 2019 and February 2020.  That involved 16 public events, covering every county in the eligible area as well as a collection of over 300 written submissions from stakeholders.  That was the first round.  There was then a second consultation between March and May 2021 with over 400 written submissions received.  By any measure that is a very high level of engagement from the stakeholders and the general public.</p><p>We often hold consultations in Ireland and we do not get a level of involvement of that order.  There has been, as I said, intense engagement between the two Government Departments, along with the SEUPB.  There has been research and independent evaluations of the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes, so all the learnings from that work and that level of consultation has fed into the development of the programme.</p><p> Now the Covid situation has improved, I am really looking forward to getting out on the ground and seeing some of the projects that have been funded under the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes and also, over the period ahead, to see some of the projects that are being put forward for funding.  I am really anxious to get out and see much of that.</p><p> The Deputy's point about red tape and bureaucracy is heard.  All this funding is of course subject to audit.  There will always be a significant level of compliance work with EU regulations.  It has been consistently raised over the course of the consultation and the programme development that it be kept to a minimum while still complying with the standards we must abide by for the use of public money.  It is to be hoped that will manifest itself.</p></speech>

I have two very brief questions.  First, does the Minister think there have been any negative implications for the programme flowing from the ongoing negotiations on the Northern Ireland protocol?  Second, is he in a position to give a few examples of the types of programmes he envisages being funded under this programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#F00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  In answer to her first question, we do not see any risks to the funding commitment that has been put in place in relation to the ongoing discussions between the UK and the EU.  Obviously, we are monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis but the funding commitment has been provided by the UK Treasury.  The EU funding is certainly secure as part of the overall EU budget and we are now in a position to proceed with the formal application.  There is certainly no suggestion at any point of any party to PEACEPLUS resiling from the funding commitments that have been made.</p> <p>  On the second question on the specific types of projects, we can get a flavour of it by looking at the projects that were funded under the current PEACE programme and the INTERREG VA programme as well.  That will give us an indication but of course we have not made any decisions yet about any specific projects because we are not yet at the formal application stage.  If we look at the six themes that are there we see young people will be a key theme, including supporting youth projects in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland to empower and invest in young people.  That can take various forms.  I would like to see as much of it as possible being led by the community.  We see the projects that involve young people directly, providing services to them and providing facilities to them funded under this programme, as being of great potential.  There is the whole area of economic regeneration and transformation.  Again, there are similarities there with the Shared Island fund.  We will see projects that work towards that objective.  Of course, the cross-community work will always be centre stage in a peace programme because at its heart this is about reconciliation and ensuring peace is deeply embedded by building relationships on a cross-community basis.  It is about bringing people together from all strands of life in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It might be through a project that is socially-based, based on sport, based on community or economic regeneration or involving young people through the education system.  It is about bringing people together to develop a better understanding of each other, where we come from and our respective communities in all their diversity.  That will really be the essence of PEACEPLUS.  I am sure there will be many projects that are very much consistent with those goals.</p></speech>

I am familiar with Gina McIntyre and her staff in the SEUPB.  She currently has 57 staff.  The Minister has just stated the money is doubling.  Therefore, we are going to have to have more staff there.  Will there be more staff allocated to that body but also to local authorities that may be administering the programmes, and to Pobal as well?</p></speech>

She touches on a really important issue, namely, the need to have the capacity to roll out this programme in line with the timeline that is there.  As she said, the SEUPB currently has a permanent headcount of 57 employees.  The staffing allocation was last reviewed back in 2012 so we believe a review is timely given the very significant increase in the funding that is being made available under PEACEPLUS.  Both Departments recognise how vital it is to ensure the SEUPB is resourced appropriately to deliver the new PEACEPLUS programme, as well as managing the ending and the work-out of the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes because those will continue for quite some time as well.  We have approved the terms of reference for an external organisational review of the SEUPB.  That will commence shortly and be completed this year.  This review will allow for an up-to-date assessment of the body's staffing requirements as PEACEPLUS launches and as the current North-South programmes move to closure stage.  It may well be that there may be a recommendation arising from that review for an increase in the resources of the body.  If that recommendation is made then we will work with our counterparts in Northern Ireland to address that issue.  The Senator has touched on an important point and that review will get under way shortly.</p></speech>

The current programmes are fully committed and we expect them to be fully spent.  They are actually slightly over-committed at the moment.  They are committed to the effect of 102% to 103%.  We are hoping to maintain that for the next year.  The aim of the SEUPB is very much to come in at 100% drawdown.  With the previous INTERREG programme, the drawdown was actually slightly over 100% and for the last PEACE programme it was 99%, so the SEUPB has an excellent track record in managing the funds to maximise them.  That will be the aim again.</p></speech>

Does anyone else have a question?  I have one thing to ask of the Minister.

I listened to the Minister's reply to Deputy Richmond on the learning from the previous programme.  Having listened to the Minister's contribution this morning it was clear that one of those learnings was the need to simplify not just the applications but also the process and the ongoing auditing process etc.  I judged from the Minister's comments that one of the main actions he proposes to take is to support those who are applying and, I presume, throughout the process itself.  That is support for those who are applying, but in the actual application process are there any changes from what the Minister has learned and what he has seen before from the consultation process?  Does the Minister propose any other changes?</p> <p>  My second question is related.  Apart from this aspect of the programme, will the Minister give some examples of other learnings, and any specific actions the Minister is taking to address the issues that were raised?  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

The  Northern Ireland Minister of Finance, Conor Murphy, MLA, and I are both very anxious that the programme processes are efficient and effective, and place the minimum burden on applicants at the application stage and throughout the project, in the funding and in the drawdown of money under the programme.  We have been working with the Special EU Programmes Body to make sure that we have a shorter and more efficient assessment process.  That work is ongoing.</p> <p>  There will be pre-application support.  That will involve the SEUPB engaging much earlier and on a one-to-one basis with potential applicants.  That support will be of great assistance and should improve the overall experience for applicants, result in better quality applications and, hopefully, a higher success rate for individual applications.</p> <p>  The body will also make increased use of the simplified cost options, which will significantly improve the claims' processing times.  This has been raised as a specific issue.  I believe it is in development with the final programme and getting the finishing touches.</p> <p>  With regard to the administration of the programme, once applications come in we will see the real learnings.  From talking with the Minister of Finance, Conor Murphy, and from engaging with the SEUPB,  I am aware that they have learned from the existing programmes.  They got the feedback and I gave an indication earlier of the level of public consultation.  It really has been quite extensive.  A consistent message was received from existing recipients under the current programmes, and those who aspire to be funded under PEACEPLUS.  The answer will be in the detail in the roll out of PEACEPLUS.  I am certainly very anxious to make sure that it is as streamlined and simplified as possible.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister's bona fides that there has been a very extensive consultation, and I am aware of some of that.  Those of us who have been around a while, and especially where all kinds of programmes are concerned including EU programmes, would be well aware of the fact that consultation does not always mean that the issues raised are always brought on board.  I am certainly not going to prejudge what is happening in this instance.  I am more than happy to accept that the consultation has been meaningful and not necessarily just box ticking here and there, and that we will see as the programme rolls out that it does actually contribute in a real, meaningful and positive way to the implementation of the programme.  I look forward to seeing it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#G00700"><p>I will highlight the new development of small grants that are intended for local community groups.  Again, this issue came up time and again across the whole consultation period as it was carried out.  It was the issue of accessibility for small grassroots and community-oriented community organisations.  As I said earlier, we have two new small grant programmes included in PEACEPLUS, to allow those smaller organisations and groups to access the programme with minimum bureaucracy.  Pobal will be involved in administering these small grants on behalf of the SEUPB.  Pobal has a wealth of experience in administering grants to local bodies.  Those small grants are an important new reform, which should result in a greater reach of the overall programme and the money percolating down to the very small community groups on the ground throughout the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

In fairness, whatever I may think about what is not in the programme, if the Minister is looking at those things then it covers a fair amount of scope.</p> <p>  How tight are the criteria?  In the process that is left regarding the Commission, I would imagine that nothing is really likely to change between now and hitting the road.  Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#G00900"><p>That is correct.  We are very much at the final stages. The outline of the draft programme has been published, and the full application is just about putting flesh on the bones of that.  The overall thematic areas are now agreed and the draft programme has been approved by all key stakeholders.  Now it is just about additional detail.  The Commission is very much aware of the overall structure and the six themes.  We expect that it would be a further elaboration on that within the final application.  As I said, it is going in over the next two weeks or so.  We are almost there at this point.</p></speech>

I do not mean the governance, which is obviously necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022012600002#G01100"><p>I believe the themes are broad enough to encompass the overwhelming majority of projects that people would have in mind. The steering committee must have regard to the detailed assessment criteria when it is assessing individual applications, but our sense certainly is that the themes are broad enough to enable applications to be successful right across the full reach.</p></speech>

Are they less than &euro;50,000?  Are they less than &euro;20,000?  What does a small grant mean when it comes to this type of money?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the Border counties.  Consider for example Oldbridge in County Meath.  I sought development funding to improve that area.  It is completely out of this programme because County Meath would not get any funding out of this programme, or very little would come.  Is there room to improve the geographical stretch of this programme?</p></speech>

If the geographical areas are outside the direct remit, there is the opportunity to partner with groups from within the geographical area and become part of the application with them.  It is possible that there would be funding for projects that extend beyond that area.  It would be done on the basis of partnering with applicants from within the area.  That is how we envisage this being done. Perhaps Ms Clynes has some information on the quantum of the small grants.</p></speech>

The small grant scheme is currently being developed by the SEUPB and Pobal, in consultation with us.  They are looking at having a number of different levels so there will be scope for quite small grants of &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000, for example, but also for much larger grants.  While this is obviously subject to change, we could be looking at grants of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 at the upper end.  That is in development and the details will be settled in the coming weeks and months but there should be an opportunity for several different scales.</p></speech>

The programme monitoring committee is an EU Structural Funds structure which all Structural Fund programmes use.  It is a cross-border committee which represents central and local government, the community and voluntary sector, the environmental sector, trade unions, the business sector and so on.  It in turn appoints a steering committee for project selection purposes.  The steering committee is a creature of the programme monitoring committee.  The SEUPB, which is responsible for managing the programme, puts out calls for applications which are generally competitive.  When the applications come in, the SEUPB assesses them, using expert assessors where appropriate, and makes recommendations to the steering committee.  A scoring matrix is used and the process is very transparent and robust.  The steering committee, which is set up by the programme monitoring committee, will then consider the tranches of applications in each theme and will score them.  The SEUPB is operating in an advisory capacity at this stage and will make the decision on whether to reject or accept an application.  There is also a review process available.</p></speech>

We are very grateful to the Minister and his team for that.  I am going to abuse my position in the chair somewhat now.  The Minister referenced his availability to talk to us about the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, BAR, fund and I have one brief question on that.  The chef de cabinet of Commissioner Ferreira indicated in December that an initial allocation was made.  Have particular projects been identified and has money been allocated to them from that fund?  The Minister can revert to the committee if he does not have the information to hand today.</p></speech>

As we indicated in the budget, the intention would be to allocate about half of the overall funding in 2022 and the remaining half next year.  There is a reference period and the funding has to be spent before the end of next year.  Again, because it is EU funding, there are very clear criteria.  There must be a direct, explicit link to the impact of Brexit<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the spending decisions.  We have already made a number of allocations in the fisheries area, for example.  We can include expenditure that goes back to the beginning of 2020 because the reckonable or reference period runs from January 2020 to the end of 2023.  In so far as possible, however, we want to use the money on new expenditure and new projects to support the sectors that are most affected by Brexit.  No doubt Deputy Howlin is interested in and aware of the works that are planned at Rosslare Europort.</p></speech>

The aim is to put in place a permanent solution there and that is very much the type of project that will be funded.  In the main, the BAR funding comes in the form of pre-financing.  Approximately 80% is in the form of pre-financing and we account for it subsequently.  The absolute priority is to ensure that we have enough qualifying expenditure to ensure that the money is fully used.</p></speech>

As Minister for Finance, I will be discussing the four Votes within the finance group of Votes.  They are Vote 7 - Office of the Minister for Finance; Vote 8 - Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General; Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and Vote 10 - Tax Appeals Commission.  The net funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes in 2022 totals &euro;497 million, compared with a 2021 Vote group total of &euro;494 million, an increase of &euro;3 million, or 0.6%.  The primary driver of the increase is an increased pay allocation for the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  I propose to focus on the Department of Finance first and give a brief overview of its structure.  The Department is structured around two directorates, the economic and fiscal directorate, programme A, and the finance and banking directorate, programme B.  This structure remains unchanged from 2021.  There are also a number of support divisions which ensure the smooth operation of the Department.  The costs of these support divisions are allocated on a 50:50 basis to each programme.</p> <p>  The net allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2022 is &euro;42.9 million, of which some &euro;11 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers and a further &euro;335,000 to fund the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  Leaving these two expenditure lines aside, the Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for both administrative and non-administrative costs.  The single biggest cost remains salaries and allowances, which account for &euro;23.771 million, or 55% of the total.  A further &euro;5.74 million, or 13%, is provided to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  There is also an allocation of &euro;896,000 to cover a number of bodies that fall within the Vote group, namely the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  The remaining &euro;2.2 million, or 5%, is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support the Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.</p> <p>  The allocation for Vote 8 - Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent, constitutional officer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's mission is to provide independent assurance that public funds and resources are used in accordance with the law, managed to good effect and are properly accounted for.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required by law to issue opinions on the accounts of Government Departments and public bodies that are audited by him; publish reports on important matters at his discretion relating to value for money and the administration of public funds; and authorise, under the comptroller function, the release of public money from the Exchequer for purposes specified by law.  The office assists the Comptroller and Auditor General in his statutory functions and is staffed by civil servants.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's financial audit role covers around 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  Together, these bodies had financial transactions with a value of over &euro;200 billion last year.  The net allocation for this Vote is &euro;9.365 million, which is a decrease of approximately 2.6% on 2021.</p> <p>  I move to Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  This organisation collected a record &euro;97 billion in gross receipts against total administration costs of &euro;488.6 million.  The relative cost of administration in this context is some 0.5% of gross receipts collected.  The committee will be aware of the vital role of Revenue with regard to the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  For 2022, Revenue has requested a net budget allocation of &euro;441.1 million, a decrease of &euro;625,000, or 0.1% on the 2021 Estimate.  Over three quarters of the total budget allocation for Revenue is related to payroll, with an employment ceiling of 7,024 staff.</p> <p>  Finally, Vote 10 &ndash; Tax Appeals Commission, has a net budget allocation of &euro;3.4 million for 2022, an increase of 7% on the 2021 Estimate of &euro;3.2 million.  The Estimate is provided for the Tax Appeals Commission to advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload, while also meeting its obligations as an independent entity.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the finance group of Votes.  I am happy to address any questions that members have.</p></speech>

That compares with the 2021 Estimate of &euro;570,000.  The outturn for the last year was &euro;426,000.  I should make clear that an Estimate is in place for it because it is the intention of my Department and the Department of Health to appoint a new board.  The recruitment process for that is under way.  The internal dimension of launching that recruitment process is complete.

Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and I, and many Members across the political divide, have raised concerns about the operation of this scheme and the fact that many citizens with disability see their applications rejected and are not able to get primary medical certificates.  It is heartbreaking when one hears the individual stories of some of these cases.  The board of appeal all resigned en masse.  The Minister oversees the board, which met him in March to outline its concerns that this was not fit for purpose.  Will he outline to this committee the conversation that it had with him?</p></speech>

At that point, it had brought into statutory law the criteria for access to that scheme.  At that point we laid out the regulation.  As the committee will know that this was subject to a Supreme Court adjudication on the matter.  In the meeting of the committee, the members outlined to me their dissatisfaction regarding the implementation and execution of this policy at that point.  In the videoconference that I had with them, I indicated to them that I was willing, am willing and have work under way to reassess that scheme, as well as the access criteria to it.  That work is a part of a broader review of the status of disability issues in services that is being undertaken by the Department of Health.  As that work is under way, I will do all that I can to facilitate the appointment of new board members to that board, so that we can deal with any appeals that are in place at the moment. </p></speech>

This is an important scheme.  It is valuable and it is needed by those who receive it, given the level of need that they have.  However, it is also a scheme that merits review and consideration.  That will be done now by our Department in conjunction with the Department of Health.  As I have indicated to the Deputy a moment ago, in the meeting that I had with the then board in March, they indicated to me their dissatisfaction with how the scheme was being operated.  I said to them that I wanted a review to be put in place on it as soon as I could do so.  That is now in place.  When that review is under way, I will do all that I can to try to ensure that there is a board in place that implements system policy.</p></speech>

This is a policy area that is overseen by my Department.  I accept that the implementation of the scheme was a matter of dissatisfaction to the members of the board at that point.  I very much regret that they felt that the option that was open to them was to resign.</p> <p>  Getting the review up and running has taken some more time to do than I would have hoped.  Of course, I wish there had been an opportunity to have the review up and running before we got to the point of the board resigning.  All of that being said, I will do all that I can to first facilitate a new board being put in place.  Second, within the review of the scheme that is under way and that does need reconsideration, I will do all that I can to get this part of the module done as speedily as possible.

There are people who have disabilities out there who cannot get the support that they are entitled to.  Families went to the Supreme Court to ensure that they are entitled to this.  They cannot get the support.  This is hugely important, as I am sure the Minister understands, for the independence and the support of individuals with disabilities.  Is this just a systems problem?</p><p>The Minister promised a review a year ago.  No review happened in 2021.  The board told the Minister that they were extremely frustrated with the progress.  Obviously, the Minister did not do anything between then and October to satisfy their view that nothing was going to happen.  Then they resigned <i>en masse</i>.

They are all related to Brexit and the change in the roles of the Revenue Commissioners and general customs operations since the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into place and the transition period ended.  Will the Minister put a little more flesh on the figures - the overall amounts have not changed much - in respect of individual staff members who are working specifically in this area?  Is there any vision to change where they are based?</p><p>Will there be more people allocated to ports of entry?  Bearing in mind that while there has been a deferral for customs checks from the UK for this year, they still loom.  I would appreciate if the Minister could elaborate a bit more on the figures?</p></speech>

Our focus in 2021 was to support traders during the initial Brexit transition with more than 100 staff deployed in that role.  As it stands, we now have 715 staff involved in customs-related duties, 87 staff in control functions, six staff in legislative services, 25 staff in support functions and 117 staff in trader declaration service roles.  The total is 950 staff.</p></speech>

So far, the need for it has not arisen.  What we do have in the Department of Finance is a number of members of staff who are seconded to different embassies.  For example, we have Department of Finance officials based in London, Berlin and other embassies across the United Kingdom and the European Union.  To date, there has not been a demand for Revenue officials to be located there because of what we have been able to do through officials from the Department of Finance.  However, it is a really interesting idea and perhaps as we move through the year and we get further clarity on some issues regarding Brexit it could be that it is something there is a need for, but so far there has not been.</p></speech>

It is on the area of remote working and working from home in the Department overall, not specifically Revenue.  It is light of the proposed legislation announced yesterday by the T&aacute;naiste, which the Minister and I have discussed at least twice during oral questions, about his ability to encourage his officials to maximise the opportunities that remote working presents to them and more widely.  What efforts are being made and what accommodation is there within the Estimates to allow people to tool up to work remotely or possibly at home?  Does the Minister envisage that would require any changes to the Estimates or is it something that is under constant review?</p></speech>

At this point, it is not something that I anticipate will require revision to our Estimates at all.  What the Department did across last year was to undertake a survey regarding what will be the home needs that we will have as we move to a more hybrid form of working.  In terms of what the balance will be between working from the office and working from home, it will probably take a little time for that to settle and become clearer in the Department of Finance.  Following the change in the public health guidance, a lot of officials have been coming back into the Department in recent days who have not been in the building for quite a while.  During the pandemic, quite a number of officials were working in the office in the Department more than the norm because of how much work we had to do with our economic supports, some of which required more regular meetings than perhaps were involved in other Departments.  It will be a few months before those who are working for the Department become clear themselves on what is the balance between home and the office.  This work will be under way between the public service unions and the Government centrally to provide guidance.  The Department will be consistent with that.</p></speech>

The Estimate for 2022 does reflect the funding that the organisation brought forward and the requests it had for how it would be funded across that period.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that this is an organisation that has gone through a merger in the aftermath of 2017, when the Pensions Ombudsman and the financial ombudsman were merged into a single office.  It could be the case that in the Estimate for 2022, some of the efficiencies in regard to that are apparent and coming through.  Any of the key funding needs the ombudsman has brought forward, we have endeavoured to meet in this Estimate.  The office has not raised any issues with me regarding it.</p></speech>

There are concerns regarding the capacity and resourcing of the office to get through its caseload.

It is worth highlighting the issue in the committee given the figures that were received by my colleague, Deputy Doherty, and raising it with the Minister to see if that is something on which he could touch base with the FSPO.</p> <p>  In June last year the Committee of Public Accounts published its examination of the 2019 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 9 &ndash; Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The committee examined Revenue's approach to bogus self-employment which, as the Minister is aware, is a practice whereby a worker is falsely classified as self-employed.  The code of conduct for determining the status of an individual as employed or self-employed was published by the employment status group, which sets out the criteria to provide clarity on whether a worker is an employee or self-employed.  There is a lot of concern out there.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the discussion on bogus self-employment and that it is depriving the State of vast sums of money while reducing the protections and benefits for workers.  It is something that has come up a lot more in conversation.  Official statistics on the financial impact of bogus self-employment are not available.</p><p>Revenue has said it has the power to report on it.

Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell will be aware, from the appearances of the Revenue Commissioners here in front of this committee, that it is a very robust authority.

This was discontinued in 2019.  However, it may have had a significant impact on the culture and practice of employee classification and the practice of bogus self-employment, especially with the rise of the gig economy.  I am wondering if the Minister would mandate Revenue to commission an investigation into this 1997 agreement and its impact on the following 20 years because such an investigation would be of significant interest.</p></speech>

I am not aware of the 1997 agreement that the Deputy is referring to.  I re-emphasise it is not my role to mandate the Revenue Commissioners to initiate an investigation into this.  If the Revenue Commissioners believes this matter merits investigation, they themselves would do so.  It is not my role to require them to do so.</p></speech>

I am wondering what is the reason behind it being based within the Department of Finance here.  As the nominee independent auditor of Departments, public bodies under the aegis of those Departments, etc., I would have through that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be independent of the Civil Service and fall under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER.  Given DPER's role in ensuring that public funds and resources are used in accordance with the law, managed to good effect and properly accounted for, and to contribute to improvement in public administration, I would have thought it would fall under DPER.</p> <p>  Under the current arrangement which sees it as part of the Civil Service, the Comptroller and Auditor General lacks autonomy and resources in the office.  One report found that limitations on the role of the office included a restricted mandate to carry out value-for-money audits, a generally limited mandate to examine the effectiveness of public expenditure and the limited extent to which the Comptroller and Auditor General can follow public money once it gets into the hands of a non-Government organisation.  I am wondering had there been conversations at any point either on moving the Comptroller and Auditor General to DPER, the Department which carried out public service reform, or making the Comptroller and Auditor General independent so that these issues could be addressed.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's point of view.  That is my final question as I must run to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is associated with my Department's Vote for reasons of history.  As far as I can recollect, the Minister for Finance has always brought forward its Vote but it is fully independent of us in the exercise of its roles and, as the Deputy will be aware, has carried out reports on matters associated with the Department on a number of occasions.  I guess you could make the argument that if it were associated with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, given that the Department also oversees the use of public expenditure, it might be better that its Vote were separate to that Department and more associated with us.  Regardless of where the Vote sits, it is an independent body.  The Estimates process is never used in any way to impact on its operation.  We make every effort to meet the resourcing needs that it brings forward.</p></speech>

I want to raise a couple questions on Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  Revenue collected a record &euro;97 billion in gross tax receipts against total administration costs of &euro;488.6 million.  Would the Minister like to elucidate further on the success of Revenue in collecting such a record amount, whether there are still amounts outstanding, and if it is expected they can be collected or are they collectable, and would he comment on the breadth of measures that were responsible for the delivery of such high amounts of tax in the year that has just expired?</p></speech>

I note the role that they have played in two different areas.  The first was the exercise of their key function of collecting tax across that period, and doing so in a way that reflected the exceptional circumstances that taxpayers were in.  They performed a great service to the State across that period.  The second is the broader roles that they performed.  If, before the pandemic hit, I had said to Deputy Durkan that we would get to the point where the Revenue Commissioners would be paying the wages of people, the Deputy would have dismissed that out of hand.  By the implementation of the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Revenue Commissioners paid a share of the wages of hundreds of thousands of people during the pandemic and also performed important functions, such as the role they played in the Covid vaccination certificate in mailing them out to those who needed them so that they could access business services or even travel.  They have performed an exceptional role during the pandemic.</p></speech>

They have a full agenda as it is.  I look at the work they will be doing this year.  The zoned land tax is a big example.  There is the work that is under way now as we exit the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Their agenda is full now with the delivery of their core functions and I have no plans to expand it any further.</p></speech>

As to whether any detailed evaluation of the use of that funding and the operation of the scheme occurred, I do not believe it has yet, or not in a substantial way.  Obviously, the scheme is scheme is still functioning.  We are about to commence the exit strategy from that scheme.  I anticipate that in the months and years ahead a large amount of research, analysis and inquiry will be done into the operation of the scheme.  We should learn from what worked well and what did not in case,  God forbid, we ever need to do something like that again.  In addition, it involved countless billions of taxpayers' money.  That alone merits and requires an overview of its use across that period.</p></speech>

A total of 21,300 businesses received subsidy payments totalling over &euro;470 million.  Has it been possible to quantify the extent to which that was a vital payment from the business sector's point of view?</p></speech>

The operation of that scheme in particular has been acknowledged by the sector as something that was incredibly timely and helpful for it.  The Deputy will remember we introduced the scheme in the context of budget 2021.  At that point we were literally about to go into another phase of our economy being shut down.  Businesses that were going to have to close down again very suddenly were facing a really high level of cost.  We designed and brought that scheme in to seek to reduce that cost and defray the expenses those businesses were facing and it has been acknowledged as a very valuable support by the sector.  To tie this to the Deputy's previous question, we will need to do work, and I imagine the work will be done for us by other organisations as well, to review how that money was spent and what the learnings are.  I expect the work will begin when we exit the CRSS and the EWSS.</p></speech>

They were necessary interventions.  I congratulate all those in the Minister's own office, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and everybody associated with the positive interventions that were made at a vital time in the country's history when there was not much by way of positive news on the world stage.  Everybody should take a bow for the work they did at a vital time.</p></speech>

We had many employers we needed to help.  I hope they can all successfully reopen.  That is the most important thing.  We now need to move ahead with trying to exit this scheme in a careful way, which is what we are trying to do.  As we move through the second half of this year and see a jobs market that does not have the EWSS in place, I hope we will continue to see and expect to see jobs being retained and growing, and viable employers.  Once we get to that point there will be a review of the scheme.  I am sure we have much to learn from how it was implemented.</p></speech>

He opened his presentation with increased pay allocation.  There has been a significant debate over the last number of months on the enormous increase in the cost of living.  That relates very clearly to pay allocations right across the public service, in his own Department and obviously in the rest of society as well.  That rapid cost-of-living increase is reducing the purchasing power of every citizen throughout the country.  Thus, people's real income currently is falling countrywide.  The Government has stood four-square against trying to ease that difficultly by reducing VAT or even asking the EU for a derogation to reduce VAT because of this crisis.  The Government has also stood four-square against the idea of wage inflation to maintain the purchasing power of citizens.  Despite this, we heard the unbelievable news that top civil servant Robert Watt, who awarded &euro;81,000 last year, was also in receipt of a &euro;3,000 increase in October on top of his wage.  On one level citizens are dealing with cost of living spikes, we had a deficit of &euro;7 billion and when he was in last week the Minister mentioned there was &euro;3 billion in tax that has been warehoused because businesses could not afford to pay it, yet the Government is actually involved in creating wage inflation among the political and Civil Service class.  How is that acceptable in any way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022012600002#F00900"><p>It is worth noting that across the period in which the current public service wage agreement was in place we had inflation levels significantly below the figures the Deputy is referring to for November and December.  If we look at the period for 2020 we actually had some modest deflation of 0.5%.  For 2021 the average inflation level across that period was 2.5%, although it increased very significantly across October, November and December.  Across the period in which that wage agreement has been in place it has been either ahead of, or in line with, the rate of inflation.  However, for the very latter part of last year the price inflation considerably increased.  Our expectation is though that as we move through this year we will see an improvement in some of the price pressures many families and businesses are facing at the moment.  As I said on the floor of the D&aacute;il earlier, we as a Government have put in place a whole set of policy measures aimed at responding to this inflationary pressure many have faced.  I detailed what they are, including changes we have made in personal taxation, changes made in social welfare and changes we have aimed to make in relation to the cost of medical care and the cost of childcare.  They are all in place.  As the Deputy knows we have, even for this early part of the year, put in place a measure to seek to reduce energy bills for the first quarter.  I fully appreciate the level of challenge and anxiety this is causing for many at the moment but this is why we have put the measures I referred to in place.</p></speech>

Obviously, most people will have felt in their pocket the significant increase in the price of petrol, diesel and electricity.  Farmers are seeing their fertiliser costs triple and the cost of foodstuffs has increased.  The Minister would present himself as a fiscally-responsible Minster during this period of time.  Is it fiscally responsible to give a civil servant an increase of &euro;81,000 and then one of &euro;3,000 within the same year?  Is it fiscally responsible to have wage inflation within Departments?  This committee has done a wonderful report on the process, or lack of process, by which that wage increase was picked out of the sky.  Contrast the largesse experienced by the political class with the rest of society who are seeing their spending power reduced at this point in time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022012600002#F01100"><p>Again, it is in recognition of the challenges society is facing that we have made the changes that formed the core part of our budget day measures.  We have made changes in personal tax credits.  We have made changes to the level at which a person pays the higher rate of income tax in our country exactly in anticipation of the issues the Deputy is referring to.</p><p>We have measures in place in relation to the cost of childcare and medical expenses, particularly those that help families to deal with the costs of medical expenses for families and children.  There are a whole array of measures in place in the Department of Social Protection, such as the living alone allowance, the fuel allowance, the qualified child payment, not to mention the needed increase in core rates of &euro;5.  All of this is because we fully understand the challenges that many are facing.  It is worth saying that while I have responsibility for the measures that we have put in place to try to mitigate some of the issues that many are facing, the issues around the cost of energy are being faced by the entire world at the moment.  They are being caused by issues that are being led elsewhere.  These are not issues that we control.  However, where we can influence, we are doing so.  That is why we have the different measures that I have summarised in place.</p></speech>

It was not followed by any other European country.  That led to significant damage to supply chains in the State.  I mentioned to the Minister earlier today that we were the only country in the whole of the European Union that closed building sites for four months last year, while we have the biggest housing crisis in all of the European Union.  That has meant that 10,000 houses were not built.  Supply is a big influence on the price of houses, as well as on rent.</p> <p>  The Minister has done a wonderful job in studiously ignoring the name of Robert Watt in both of his answers.  He has studiously ignored the &euro;84,000 pay hike that one civil servant achieved in the space of one year.  There is a contrast to be made between the largesse in wage inflation that was in the control of the Government, with the fall in income and the fall in spending power for citizens across the country.  Citizens experience frustration right now when they see those two different Irelands.  There is the Ireland in which they exist, where cumulatively, all the measures that the Minister for Finance has mentioned have less effect on their spending power than the inflation and the cost of living they are experiencing.  That is their Ireland.  Yet, the area that the Minister of Finance controls sees senior civil servants magically achieve &euro;84,000 pay hikes in the space of one year.  Will the Minister for Finance address that pay hike and how it reflects on the rest of society?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022012600002#G00300"><p>I have addressed that particular issue on other occasions before this committee.  I was a member of the Government that agreed to this appointment.  I was also aware of and supported the process that led to it happening.  I know that the committee has strong views on it.  The Secretary General of the Department of Health is an important post.  The role of the Department of Health has been central to us being able to regain our public health, despite the loss of life and loss of health that we have endured and that many have experienced.  This, in turn, has been important for what we have been able to do with our economy.  The Secretary General of that Department has played an important role in it.</p> <p>  However, the Ireland of which the Deputy speaks, as well as the issues that he recognises and is putting to me, are issues that I also recognise.  I experience these issues through my constituency work when I engage with members of the public and with my own constituents.  I am aware of all the challenges and pressures that they face.  However, the attitude of which the Deputy speaks is also the same attitude that put in place the pandemic unemployment payment to support citizens in a time of need.  It put in place the employment wage subsidy scheme.  We had the backs of our citizens when we got hit by a pandemic.  That speaks to my attitude regarding the need to support our country during a time of challenge.</p></speech>

We will see pay demands, as well as increases in pay, happening right across society, unless the Government ameliorates the sources of these cost increases.  How can the Minister for Finance, or any other Minister in the Government, have any credibility if he tries to back away from those pay claims in the next 12 months, given that today he stands over a pay hike of &euro;84,000 for the highest-paid civil servant in the country?</p></speech>

That matter will be led by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who I will fully support.  Our public servants have played a vital role in the delivery of public services during the pandemic.  We look to recognise those who have been most immediately on the front line through the pandemic recognition payment, which will be paid in the coming months.  The unions will present their cases and the views of the members to us.  They will make reference to all kinds of issues that they believe are important.</p> <p>  The Deputy offers a prediction of what the unions will do.  I also offer a prediction of what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will do.  No matter what agreement we come to, it will never be enough, in his eyes.  He will always condemn it.  That is a prediction that I can make with certainty, given the Deputy's past track record.  This Government, and I in the last Government, have negotiated a series of wage agreements with the public service unions.  We have then implemented them in good faith.  We will do that again. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022012600002#G00600"><p>I want to support Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's comments about the increase of &euro;81,000 plus &euro;3,000 for Robert Watt.  I refer to our report.  While we can all take political positions on many issues, there is a factual aspect to this increase, as well as how it was arrived at.  Quite frankly, the manner by which that increased was arrived at was bad governance, bad administration and it reflected badly on the Civil Service.</p> <p>  I hate when Ministers that I admire, such as the Minister for Finance himself, go into an almost blind defence of the Government, instead of calling out what happened.  We tried to do a report here, but we had nothing but obstacles put in our way by the Taoiseach.  One Minister did not even respond to it.  The fact of the matter is that this was a cosy deal that was done for one Secretary General in Government Buildings.  Then, the Cabinet was bounced into it.  That is the reality of it, as I see it and as the public sees it.</p> <p>  I have to agree with the comments made by others about the &euro;81,000 and that &euro;3,000.  Earlier on in the Minister's contribution, he referred to the fact that old age pensioners got an increase of &euro;5.  Honestly, I am not making this up, and the Minister must find in his own constituency too that it is difficult to explain all of that.  This is particularly the case when it has not been explained to this committee, because we are the central figures in the debate around it.  They studiously avoided the committee.  The Taoiseach did not even turn up for the second day of his Estimates.  It does not look good.  That is all that I would say on that.  I would rail against all that nonsense that goes on in the Government.  I have respect for all the civil servants who are decent and honourable men and women and who are trying to make their way in a difficult environment.  There is a select few of the civil servants that are running the country.  It is not good.</p> <p>  I referred to the pension.  I could also refer to report 42, which recommended increases for certain employees at a level within the HSE.  It was never honoured by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> That was at the very same time as that Department was being run by the Secretary General who got an increase of &euro;81,000.  These people are still not being paid.  I asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to provide us with a report on this matter to allow us to understand what report 42 is about and why these officials, most of whom are retired, I think, are not being paid.  How can an argument be made against them, given the looseness of the process which arrived at this figure and the appointment of the Secretary General of the Department of Health?</p><p> Turning to the tax exemption level, this aspect interests me concerning pensions.  A man with a brewery pension, who is over 65, contacted me because he is paying tax.  The exemption was reduced from approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;35,000, and the effect overall is that he is losing &euro;11, which is a lot when the income and status of the individual concerned is considered.  Are there plans to raise the threshold to bring it back to where it used to be set at &euro;40,000 or &euro;42,000?  I would like the Minister to comment on the topic.</p><p> Again, regarding pensioners and increases, and the negative message being sent out, and I raised this issue with the Taoiseach as well, the cost of living is soaring.  Costs for hauliers, for example, an industry I know well, are significant when it comes to diesel.  Those costs are also going to be passed on at some stage to the end users, namely the customers of companies that use the services of couriers or bigger hauliers.  On the matter of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and warehousing of tax during the Covid-19 pandemic, I ask the Minister to comment on what will happen in that regard now.  Some businesses have significant sums warehoused.  When it comes to the question of repaying those amounts, will the Government be leaving it up to the Revenue to arrive at its own method of recouping that money or will there be some sort of policy change whereby those in this warehousing arrangement for taxes will have a longer term to pay?  The dates have been set, but given the problems that are going to be faced in this regard, I ask the Minister to comment on this subject.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022012600002#H00200"><p>Regarding the two specific questions posed to me, and starting with the warehousing of tax liabilities, the policy in this regard is and will be that companies availing of the ability to warehouse their tax liabilities will have a 12-month period in which no interest will be charged.  After that point, they will move to an interest rate of 3%.  For many companies that will be affected by this, the period during which the 3% rate will apply will begin after the first quarter of next year.  Concerning how that liability will be managed, it will be up to the Revenue to determine the situation company by company regarding the appropriate way in which that tax should be repaid.</p> <p>  I strongly believe this tax must be repaid.  Many taxpayers went ahead during times of difficulty for them and paid their taxes when they were due.  Some did not avail of tax warehousing and for some it was not even an option.  While I appreciate that the payment of those tax liabilities in future could be a challenge to those who availed of warehousing, I am sure the Revenue will deal with this process in an appropriate manner in respect of agreeing to a payment schedule.  The policy on this issue, however, is clear.  That tax is to be repaid.  It will, though, be repaid over a long period, and for the first year of that period, a 0% interest rate charge will be applicable.</p> <p>  Turning to the point raised by the Chair concerning the pension and taxation issue, I will need to get more detail from him, including perhaps the letter from his constituent.  I will need to respond to that query separately because I cannot at this meeting.  I will respond, however.  I am very much aware of the cost-of-living pressures that I debated in the D&aacute;il earlier today and now with several members of this committee.  The Chair will be aware of the measures the Government has introduced to try to deal with these pressures.  The inflation changes in this context have happened recently, but they are a real challenge for those facing them.  I have outlined to the Chair and the committee on several occasions what the Government has done to try to help our people with these higher costs.</p></speech>

That matter will be dealt with by the Department of Justice in future and paid for through funding allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Therefore, there will be a change regarding the costs of the current arrangement, because the Garda will now have responsibility for Ministers, as individual circumstances change.</p></speech>

Why has the overall spending on that Vote not increased to give a greater level of resources to the Comptroller and Auditor General to enable him to delve further into the detail of these audits?  It is clear from the work of the Committee of Public Accounts and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General that much more needs to be done in respect of auditing Departments and agencies across the board.</p></speech>

There has been no increase.  To consider the present position, while there has been a slight decrease in the overall Vote for that office, it still has an Estimate for this year of &euro;9.4 million.  It is a considerable sum, which reflects the importance of the office.</p></speech>

Having examined the role of the office over the past ten to 15 years, however, has the Government not determined that there is a clear signal from that analysis of a requirement for the office to do much more detailed work on the accounts?  Should it perhaps be looking at more than the current number of agencies, particularly those under Departments, to allow the detail to be drilled down into?  The Government should be encouraging a greater level of auditing, and that can only be achieved by increasing the numbers of staff, the various headings in the allocated budget and by ensuring that the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is more widespread and inclusive than it is.</p> <p>  In his opening remarks, the Minister mentioned the Comptroller and Auditor General and the valuable work being undertaken by his office.  He also talked about the functions of the office and that it examines the spending of taxpayers' money.  The office does not, however, look at all the spending of taxpayers' money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not examine the role of local government.</p><p>There is very little real detail in that in the granular format we want in order to be able to analyse the efficiencies or otherwise of local government.  I encourage the Government, as I have been doing for a while, that there should be one audit service, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor General, which should incorporate local government and everything else.  That would achieve greater efficiencies and a better audit because it would be able to go down into every figure.  I would like to see the office being expanded, not for the sake of it, but to include more value for money reports and investigations into how money is spent in, for example, big organisations like the HSE and local government.  We are spending a lot of money on housing and should look at that too.</p></speech>

The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has 199 whole-time equivalents planned for 2022; at the end of 2021, the figure was 171 whole-time equivalents.  We have increased the staff available to that organisation in recognition of some of the points the Chairman has raised.  The current budget of the department has gone up by just under &euro;500,000.  Included in this is a specific request for &euro;300,000, which we received from that organisation to help it deepen its reporting capacity.  They way in which we have looked to deal with the matter is by making more staff available to that department.  It has gained the equivalent of 28 whole-time members of staff since the end of 2021.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, is constantly reforming and creating new entities.  History over recent years shows a greater study is required of how that money is spent.  Now a greater amount of money is being spent and there needs to be a focus on sectors like that.  I hope staff levels in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the ability to audit these figures are improved and enhanced by Government policy.  Rather than the Comptroller and Auditor General asking for money, Government policy should be to ensure it happens with greater efficiency and with a greater desire to carry out full audits and get to the end of the wastage of public money.  It is in the Minister's remit and I would love to see him bringing about a reform of the whole system, in terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General, local government, how the HSE allocates money and how it is chased to the end user to ensure efficiency, transparency and value for money.  Has the Minister any notion regarding reform of the office?</p></speech>

The Chairman has raised in the past a number of issues related to the use of funding.  There have been some issues that the Committee of Public Accounts has looked into.  I believe one of the rationales for the setting up of that Department is to bring more focus onto the use of money in that sector.  While issues have developed in the use of some funding in the sector, in the round the money that goes into our universities, technological universities, institutes and colleges is well spent and plays a valuable role in supporting students and our economy.  The issues the Chairman is referring to are, first and foremost, dealt with by the responsible Department.  I am sure the Chairman has had representatives of the Department in this committee or they have been in front of their own committee, raising issues regarding the use of money in that sector.</p></speech>

I have no issue with that.  He is doing a fine job.  I am talking about the audit of all these agencies, departments and so on that the Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible for.  The reform I am asking about is the obvious one of bringing everything under the Comptroller and Auditor General, in terms of the work being done by the Comptroller and Auditor General now and local government, for example.

That group is responsible for banking policy, which is laid out in Vote 7.

It will take longer than was expected to ensure we regain all the money invested in Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB.  The procedures under way with regard to Bank of Ireland and AIB are going well.</p> <p>  As to what happens to that money when it comes in, it does not represent new money for the Government.  We have an asset that is defined by the value of the share and the nature of that asset is changing into cash when we receive that money.  It does not represent new money that we are planning to spend.</p></speech>

If the sum pertains to salaries, it means the Housing for All portion will be to directly employ individuals within the Department of Finance.  Could the Minister explain how many individuals within the Department the salary figure will cover?  Will the overall complement of whole-time equivalents within the Department of Finance be increased if the money is allocated for salaries?</p></speech>

The &euro;350,000 will be used to pay for their salaries.  On the question on whether it leads to an increase in the number of staff within the Department of Finance, there was an increase in the overall number of staff from 349 from 369.

Housing policy and issues in relation to housing will be covered by all members of the Department of Finance, or by many different members of staff.

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Moran to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chair and the IMO thanks the committee for the opportunity to discuss the issues facing general practice.  No more than many other areas of the health services, general practice has been facing a capacity issue for more than a decade.  At the same time, patient has demand increased and, for a large part of the decade, funding has decreased.  For many years the IMO, the ICGP, the HSE and the Government have commissioned independent reports that have highlighted the problem with GP numbers and identified the required number of GPs to meet the needs of patients.  We have yet to significantly address solutions that will drive change.</p> <p>  Covid has exposed the fragility of our health service but the pandemic did not cause the problems.  In the main they were caused by significant cuts to funding during the years of austerity.  The budget for general practice was cut by &euro;120 million, and it is only this month that the final phase of restoration is being paid.  It is being paid over a period of three years but it is only this month we are getting back to 2008 levels.</p> <p>  Despite the lack of funding, GPs and their teams have continued to care and, more importantly, provided the continuity of care which is associated with better health outcomes, equity of access and more appropriate utilisation of services.  Patient satisfaction with the service is still high but we know there are issues with access in some areas where GPs cannot safely take on new patients.  There are large parts of the country where the number of GPs is not adequate to meet the needs of an ageing population.  Capacity has to be addressed.  We have to look at all the factors affecting capacity while at the same time ensure we do not overburden the service.</p> <p>  How many GPs do we have and how many do we need?  Approximately 3,500 GPs practice in Ireland.  This can be broken down further to 2,500 who hold a GMS contract, which is the medical card contract, 500 GPs who hold other publically funded contracts, such as primary childhood immunisation and maternity and infant care, and a further 500 working outside of publicly funded contracts.  This is an average, therefore, of 0.69 GPs per 1,000 population when we require 1.1 GPs per 1,000 population.  The distribution of GPs is not uniform.  Some areas of the country have a much lower ratio of GP per 1,000 population.</p> <p>  Numerous studies show that the greater the number of GPs per head of population the better the health outcomes, including lower rates of overall causes of mortality.  The most recent analysis of medical workforce requirements from National Doctors Training and Planning estimates that an additional 1,260 to 1,660 GPs are needed by 2028 to meet the needs of population growth, in particular the significant growth of those aged over 65 and those aged over 85 who are naturally high users of the service.  We have a growing percentage of people in these older age categories and they use the services a lot more and place much greater demands on the service.</p> <p>  What are the issues driving these capacity problems?  The demographic trends in general practice no more than the rest the population are stark.  A growing proportion of GPs are over 60 with one fifth due to retire over the coming years.  There are high levels of burnout and stress associated with the demands of the service.  Many GPs are unable to take sufficient annual leave or appropriate sick leave.  A recent IMO survey on mental health and well-being found that 59% of GP were unable to take time off due to difficulties with sourcing locum cover for annual leave and 66% said they were unable to take sick leave.  This is a huge number unable to take sick leave.  Two thirds were unable to find a locum to do so.  The stress and burnout that comes with this pressure is quite high and contributes to people leaving general practice earlier, which builds the capacity problem.  The lower the number of GPs the more difficult it becomes to get a locum.  It is almost self-perpetuating.</p> <p>   For young GPs, there is a high risk burden associated with setting up a practice.  There are significant start-up costs relating to premises, IT staff, medical equipment and other overheads.  The risk burden with setting up in practice initially is huge.  A significant financial cost has to be incurred and many younger GPs are not in a position to take on that risk.  There is insufficient support for hiring a fully functional GP team.  This team includes assistant GPs, practice nurses, healthcare assistants, allied health professionals and administrative staff.</p> <p>  There is increased demand coming through also.  There is a lack of referral options to other services in the acute and community setting.  This means GPs have to manage patients in the community who are waiting for specialist care.  We know that 900,000 people are on some kind of waiting list.  These patients require care for their condition while they await specialist treatment.  In the large, this has been dealt with in the community.  There is no real control over demand unless patient numbers are reduced.  We see that GPs are closed to new patients in certain areas because they simply do not have the capacity to meet demand or safely care for those patients.  Whatever Government policy is on access to GP services it has to be introduced on the basis of sufficient capacity and appropriate supports and funding.</p> <p>  There are potential solutions and I will outline a few of them briefly.  A key point for us is supporting and establishing GPs.  Earlier I spoke about the risk burden.  We have to acknowledge the factors that are an obstacle to establishing practices and develop a model that will allow GPs to start off their careers and support them in this.  We seek an enhanced range of supports including but not exclusively tax relief to assist in the funding of premises for critical equipment, infrastructural equipment including IT systems and medical equipment.  A number of years ago, an Indecon report recommended tax incentives in this manner and we fully support this recommendation.  We call for partnership pathway support funding to allow an existing GP to take on an assistant, who would then enter into a succession arrangement with the GP to take over the practice over a number of years on a phased basis.</p><p>The GP may be close to retirement.  Rather than the list being advertised and nobody applying for it or an issue arising with succession, the GP is able to have an assistant for a number of years who will then take over that practice.</p><p> We need to broaden the GP practice team.  Supports are available at the moment.  There is a practice nurse and practice subsidy support for GPs in the GMS.  These were established in the late 1980s or early 1990s.  General practice has moved on a lot since then.  Additional staff, for example, healthcare assistant grades and allied health professionals, could be taken or a GP may want to have access to physiotherapy, counselling and pharmacy supports within the practice.  There is a need to broaden the supports available in terms of practice subsidies.</p><p> Regarding the workload and structure programmes for delivery of healthcare in general practice, we should certainly be looking at defined models of care.  The chronic disease model has been a great success.  To meet the needs of large cohorts of patients in a structured and proactive manner, it is critical that we expand this programme and that other structured programmes are introduced.  The area of women's health, which has long been neglected by the State, is a priority for us.  We believe a structured programme dealing with reproductive health, including contraception, maternity care and menopause, should be developed in general practice.  Fragmented care is not good for the patient, taxpayer or service.</p><p> The out-of-hours commitments are also a significant barrier to people entering into general practice.  GPs effectively have to fund the cover provided to patients outside of normal daytime hours.  They do this by doing shifts themselves and paying locums for red-eye shifts.  This is a factor for people going to certain areas in that the area may have an onerous out-of-hours rota in place.  The system has evolved from the initial requirement, which was to provide access to urgent care outside of normal hours, to a routine service outside of normal hours.  A national review is required to ensure it is not an onerous burden for GPs, it is equitable across the country and that the model provides safe access to urgent care.</p><p> Tied into that, there is an issue with locums, which has long been flagged.  I talked about being unable to take sick leave and annual leave.  That is obviously not safe.  It is not desirable for GPs to work beyond capacity and it obviously deters people from taking up practice in their own right when they are unable to take leave.  Responsibility for sourcing and funding locum cover currently lies solely with the GP.  Given the huge difficulties and costs associated with this for the GP, the HSE needs to take a much more active role, where necessary, by securing locum cover in certain instances and ensuring that GPs can take leave.</p><p> General practice is a rewarding career.  However, if we wish to make it attractive to the next generation of doctors and ensure the ongoing delivery of high-quality GP care to patients in their communities, we must address these capacity issues now.  We have talked for more than a decade about these problems.  We have produced endless reports.  There is no single quick fix.  A suite of measures needs to be taken and addressing the problem will require significant and ongoing funding.  The time to plan and invest was probably ten years ago but the next best time is now.  I thank members for their time.  We will be happy to address any questions they may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for extending this invitation to the Irish College of General Practitioners.  My colleagues, Dr. John Farrell, chairman of the board, and Mr. Fintan Foy, CEO, are here also.  It gives me great pleasure to address the committee this morning.  I propose to align my presentation with an overarching proposal, namely, to establish a working group on the future of general practice that would look at the key challenges of the GP workforce and workload.  I will also discuss some challenges and practical proposals.</p> <p>  The Irish College of General Practitioners is the professional body for general practice in Ireland.  As Mr. Moran said, we have approximately 3,500 GPs in Ireland and approximately 850 GP trainees.  General practice is fundamental to delivering timely, equitable access to high-quality healthcare across Ireland.  The international evidence is very clear.  Healthcare systems with strong primary care have better, more equitable population health outcomes and are more cost-effective.  One key factor is that one extra GP per 10,000 of population reduces hospital referrals and hospital admissions.</p> <p>  The overarching strategy we would propose is to establish a working group on the future role of GPs in the provision of community healthcare.  This will require engagement of the key stakeholders, namely, Government, the HSE, the Department of Health, the ICGP, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, the Irish Medical Council, IMC, and patient representatives.  General practice essentially needs a much expanded workforce with the appropriate skill mix, high-quality purpose-built premises and administrative and IT supports to ensure we can deliver high-quality accessible care for patients right across this country.  This will require substantial and sustained investment.</p> <p>  Our 2021 and 2022 pre-budget submission called for the establishment of a working group on the future of general practice.  Unfortunately, this group has not yet been established.  However, we are hopeful the committee would support such a proposal and we encourage it to do so.  This high-level working group would work with the key stakeholders to plan and develop the immediate and sustained expansion of general practice in the community.</p> <p>  I will next address the workforce challenges we face.  There are multiple challenges and many factors underlying the current unprecedented workforce crisis we face.  The ICGP has long voiced that we need a sustained and substantial State investment to meet needs.  As Mr. Moran said, the HSE predicts a shortage of at least 1,000, and possibly in excess of 1,660, GPs by 2028.  Underlying this is the fact that our population is growing and recently exceeded 5 million people.  We have a substantial and welcome increase in people aged over 65 and will have almost a doubling of people aged 85 and over by 2025.  While this is really welcome and shows that we are providing very good care to our older patients, it also increases healthcare utilisation.  In 2018, the HSE identified that we need an increase of almost 50% in the primary care workforce by 2025, which is only three years away.</p> <p>  General practice is pivotal in delivering healthcare.  GPs provide in excess of 29 million consultations in daytime each year and well in excess of 1 million consultations in GP out-of-hours services.  General practice has been fundamental in supporting the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic by delivering more than half of the Covid booster vaccinations, which was a key component in keeping society safe and enabling the reopening of our society.</p> <p>  I will now address the challenges that our general practice workforce faces and then outline some very practical solutions.  In a nutshell, we have 30% fewer GPs per head of population than England.  We have a substantial and long-standing workforce deficit.  The Department of Health in 2018 recommended an increase of almost 50% in GP numbers.  We have an ageing GP workforce.  One in seven, or 14%, of our GPs is aged 65 and over.  I anticipate that the majority of these will retire in the next three years.  This is coming rapidly upon us.</p> <p>  Approximately one quarter of our GPs are in single-handed practice, especially in rural areas, which presents its own challenges for people living in villages across Ireland.  We have insufficient primary care teams, nurses, phlebotomists, healthcare assistants and pharmacists.  The workload of general practice is expanding substantially as we have an ageing and frail population with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.  We have the capacity and ability in general practice to care for these people but we need more GPs.  We also know that increasing GMS eligibility predictably increases GP workload and while it is welcome that people can access their GP more readily, increasing the demand on a constrained service is sometimes counterproductive.  The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of all our health service and, most especially, general practice.</p> <p>  I will now address the components of the solutions we propose.  The first of these is the fundamental need for a substantial increase in GPs.  We need to train more GPs and the HSE is supporting the ICGP in doing that.  The good news is that in 2015, we had 159 GP trainees.  By 2021, it was 236, by 2022 it was 258 and by 2026, we anticipate having 350 GP trainees.  It brings its own challenges to achieve that but the process is certainly well under way.</p> <p>  We also need to put in place incentives to motivate young GPs to establish in general practice, retain mid-career GPs and support our older GPs to continue in practice.  Part of this involves looking at the entire streamline.  The development of interns in general practice is necessary.  We need a substantial increase in the number of training places in hospitals because general practice is a four-year training programme.  That programme has moved into the ICGP but it is a four-year programme.  We need to increase the number of training posts in hospitals to allow GPs to train because we do two years in hospital rotations and then two years in general practice.  One of the bottlenecks is identifying suitable training posts in hospitals for our young GP trainees.</p> <p>  We also need to recruit GPs to work in rural areas.  There are many barriers to GPs working in rural areas, particularly the onerous out-of-hours rotas, incentives to make it financially possible for them to do so, guaranteed locum provision, suitable premises and out-of-hours commitments.</p><p>These are all real barriers.  Other countries have done this with success.  We have a very large rural population and the largest percentage of people living in rural areas across Europe.</p><p> Almost half of our practices comprise two GPs and these need specific incentives to make these sustainable in the longer term.  This will include built infrastructure, shared delivery of services, shared network of supports, including staffing, locums and nursing support.  We need to look beyond our own shores and support non-EU GP recruitment.  Non-EU GPs can now apply for training in Ireland and we must accelerate this and support relocation and integration of appropriately qualified non-EU doctors.  This is a short-term response to the current severe deficit but we must provide structural and highly supported entry into Irish general practice.  This is currently under way in part supported by the HSE.</p><p> We have a major shortage of GP nurses in Ireland.  Our GP nurses are highly skilled autonomous clinicians and they have a very broad and deep clinical expertise.  To give an example, in my practice in Cork we have eight GPs but just one whole-time equivalent nurse.  A similar-sized practice in the NHS would have between six and ten nurses and, therefore, we need substantially more GP nurses.  We need to look at the career, development and professional structures to enable more nurses to enter general practice and provide them with a career pathway for advanced nurse practitioners, nurse prescribers and clinical nurse specialists to support the fantastic chronic disease management programme that we have.  Other countries have done this and NHS Scotland has done a similar programme with great success.  We also need far more allied healthcare assistants in addition to nurses and other professionals working with us in general practice.</p><p> There is a major paucity of data in general practice.  The HSE ICGP Sl&aacute;intecare research hub is rapidly addressing this strategic deficit.  Irish general practice is almost entirely computerised and this will provide us with real-time data.  We are seeking a cohort of funded GP-centred practices to provide data on the quantity, quality and quantum of GP activity.</p><p> The final matter I want to raise concerns built infrastructure.  As Mr. Moran said, this provides a major barrier to young GPs coming into general practice.  Society does not expect other healthcare workers to provide their work premises and the bricks and mortar is perceived by many young GPs as a barrier to recruitment, retention, mobility and, ultimately, their retirement.  Other countries, including Scotland, have addressed this.  We call for innovative solutions and we are certainly open to discussing them.  As we expand our GP team, we will need substantially more clinical space, with associated infrastructure costs.</p><p> To conclude, we have an overarching proposal, which is the establishment of a working group on the future of general practice in primary in the community in Ireland.  This working group will address the workforce and workload challenges I have touched on, including the very substantial shortage of GPs, GP nurses and allied healthcare professionals.  We must look at our data and address infrastructure.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to raise these matters and I look forward to its questions.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the role played by GPs during the Covid-19 pandemic, although it is still sort of with us.  They provided a service to patients and administered the vaccine and booster campaign.</p> <p>  There is always a view that there are issues with regard to rural versus urban cover of GPs.  There was a campaign entitled No Doctor, No Village run over a number of years with the argument that rural areas are suffering.  We also hear that in urban areas there are pressures from GPs not being able to take on more patients, see them or provide appointments for a number of days.  What are the obstacles in front of a new graduate who wants to become established in an area of growing population and there is an evident need for additional GP services?  What, effectively, are the obstacles to graduates coming out after being trained and who want to establish a practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tadhg Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#C00400"><p>A new graduate coming out is establishing a business so in the first instance, trying to find a property or premises can be a huge cost before setting up at all.  There is also the question of infrastructure, such as computers and various equipment that we now consider normal in general practice.  Along with that a GP must employ staff, including secretaries, receptionist and practice managers to make the operation as efficient as possible before starting at all.  Patients need to come in the door as well.  Starting on day one, without ever having met patients or being known in the locality, it takes time to build up that relationship.  At the start, banks certainly are not as forgiving as they may have been 40 or 50 years ago.  They are looking for repayments on the loans from the very start.  It can be a huge stressor before even starting.  In the modern environment, many students are starting with loans before they even open in general practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#C00500"><p>Has the rolling out of primary care medical centres assisted in addressing some of the issues?  At least that would be a base from which to start?  Has that been of assistance or is it a case that many buildings are not fully utilised because there was not the buy-in with GPs to start with by the HSE?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tadhg Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#C00600"><p>It is very important not to confuse buildings with people.  I got involved with primary care centres at the very start and there were many promises about them.  We are working in a fabulous centre but it really is about people.  We can misplace the idea of primary care centres as a panacea for the problem.  The problem really goes back to people.  As others have said, between 2010 and 2020 there was a 10% increase in the population and 44% of those were aged over 65.  In the next ten years, there will be a 7.5% increase in population and 35% of those will be over 65.  There is a health tsunami heading for the country with regard to chronic disease and this affects older people more than younger people.  Coupled with this is a shortage of GPs coming to the area.  Although the primary care centres are welcome, they are not a panacea in getting new GPs into the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Madeleine N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#C00700"><p>I agree with Dr. Crowley's remarks.  I wanted to give my insight.  I have been a trainer on the Ballinasloe training scheme for young and emerging GPs for the past 12 years.  Each year, new GPs training would join our practice for training and mentorship.  It is crystal clear these GPs are reluctant to take on partnerships or set up a practice.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I must bring up those savage Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act cuts, which saw more than 40% of the gross envelope of funding to provide GP services removed overnight during the crisis.  It hollowed out GPs, causing lay-offs and emigration among our colleagues, even some quite established colleagues who had to leave.  This did not happen in a vacuum.  Our young GPs now were students at that time and non-consultant hospital doctors.  They were citizens of the State and witnessed what happened.  There is a deep insecurity among them now as a result because, as Dr. Crowley said, they are possibly coming to general practice with loans and at a time they may have young families, be extremely busy or be taking on mortgages.</p><p>They are deeply insecure about entering into a financial situation where they may have incomplete support.  As Mr. Moran said earlier, we need enhanced supports for these young and not so young GPs who are starting off.  We need to look at tax relief and assisted funding for premises and equipment.  We also need partnership pathways support and mentoring.  Until we can do this, confidence among our emerging GPs will not be addressed properly.</p></speech>

In my area west of Galway city, which includes Moycullen, Rosscahill and Oughterard, some GPs are not part of Westdoc.  They tell us of the pressures they are under regarding providing cover.  The HSE has been given an additional &euro;10 million this year for GP services to deal with the pandemic.  I was urging that some of this funding would go to enhanced Westdoc and equivalent services.  What percentage of GPs are in these services?</p> <p>  Are there capacity issues in the universities or is it the case that sufficient graduates are coming out of the system but pressures and obstacles in establishing themselves in the country are the main issues in keeping our highly trained graduates here and working in the Irish healthcare system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.584" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#D00300"><p>I will deal with the Senator's first question on out-of-hours services.  There is a particular situation in Galway but the vast majority of GPs are members of some form of co-operative or out-of-hours arrangement.  It is a very high percentage, around 97%, I believe, but I can get the exact figure for the Senator.  Even where there are such arrangements in place, there are significant issues, for example, rosters can vary and GPs working in more remote areas are more likely to be on duty more frequently.  All GPs in most areas must pay for the red-eye cover, which is where they pay for a locum to cover the 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. shift.  There are significant problems with the out-of-hours services.  We are seeking a review to make sure the system becomes more equitable for all GPs working in it, individual GPs incur less cost and these services become less of a barrier for GPs to enter into the system.  Perhaps the ICGP will address the training aspect of the Senator's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.585" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#D00400"><p>I thank Mr. Moran.  I will give a personal perspective on the GP out-of-hours issue.  I am in Cork and work with Southdoc.  Last Friday, I worked a full day in my surgery before starting work in Southdoc at 6 p.m. and working until 11 p.m. doing house calls and seeing patients.  It was very busy.  Our Southdoc commitment is on top of an already very busy workload.  My rural colleagues have a very onerous out-of-hours rota, which again is a further disincentive to GPs choosing to work in rural areas.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about universities and training places.  We are training a substantial number of medical students in Ireland.  A new university medical college started in the North of Ireland this year.  We have a substantial number of students but we do not have sufficient intern places for all of our graduates.  I would like to see more GP intern places.  That is the key time at which young doctors decide on their future career.  I would like to see more GP intern places, followed by more GP training places or training posts in the various specialties in the hospitals.  There is a major shortage, particularly in some specialties, of training posts in hospitals.  This would also help my hospital colleagues in training their particular specialties.  It would benefit the wider system but particularly general practice.  We certainly need more GP intern places and more specialty hospital places which provide a pipeline into GP training.</p></speech>

With the numbers of graduates, however, not all of them will go into general practice.  We need greater exposure of general practice in the medical schools.  This is something we are going to try to address with the individual universities.</p> <p>  On the Senator's point about starting up in practice, if people do not have access to the GMS list, it is extremely difficult to start up in practice without any patient load.  Financially, it is just not viable.  As my colleagues from the IMO said, we need to find ways of encouraging people to start up in practice to ensure we have GPs throughout the country to address healthcare needs, particularly among our ageing population which has been the difficulty of late.</p></speech>

I am grateful for that.  It helps us as a committee when we get that level of detail.</p> <p>  I will first make a number of broad points before I put my questions.  I was one of those who asked to have this session to put a focus on GP capacity.  In recent times, we have had some anecdotal evidence from constituents and others about waiting longer for GP access and difficulties in accessing out-of-hours services.  Some people are unable to find a GP with whom to register.  This applies not just in rural areas but also in Dublin.  Obviously, there are capacity issues and these are very well set out in the opening statements.</p> <p>  We need to increase GP capacity.  I will get to this in my questions.  We also need to look at how we better support GPs when they qualify and want to establish practices.  There are issues in those areas, as has been highlighted, and also in expanding GP teams.</p> <p>  I will start with the data and facts.  The IMO and ICGP are pretty much on the same page with the figures.  We have some 3,500 GPs.  We have 30% fewer GPs per head of population than in England.  The Department recognises that we need an increase in GP numbers of between 37% and 48%, and that we need to train more GPs.  To take the calculations, according to the IMO opening statement, some 20% of current GPs will retire in the next five years.  This means 700 of the current cohort of 3,500 will retire and must be replaced.  We also need to hire between 1,260 and 1,660 additional GPs.  Taking the midpoint of 1,500 additional GPs and add the 700 who will retire, it means 2,200 additional GPs will have to come into the system by 2028.  By my calculation, that is 366 new GPs every year which is much more than the numbers we are training every year.  We can see the problem here and, to be honest, it is because for the past ten years, we have not done what needs to be done in increasing capacity.</p> <p>  Are the current figures on the need for additional capacity and additional GPs based on a no-change policy?  In other words, are they based on existing levels of service?  As we all know, there is an all-party agreement to transition to universal GP care which will, I imagine, place additional demands on the system.  We must look at the demographics and what that additional demand would look like.  When we say somewhere between 1,200 and 1,600 additional GPs are required, is this built on a no-change policy or does this build into it the move towards universal GP access?</p></speech>

We can certainly clarify those and come back to the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

Would Dr. Quinlan have a view that it would be based on a no-change policy?  I will put the question differently.  As we transition to universal GP care, will that increase pressures and demands on general practice generally?</p></speech>

We have very good research from Ireland showing that when children aged under six got free access to GPs their consultation rates went up 30%.  This is to be welcomed because the evidence also shows that these children who had to pay for access to their GP were actually consulting below the international norms for seeing their GP.  It was not that these children became excessively consulting; they actually reached the international norms.  While we would support increased access to general practice we need to recognise that there is currently very substantial constraint capacity within the system and increasing demand in a constrained system is a very difficult proposition.</p></speech>

Taking the mid-range figure of 1,500 additional GPs by 2028, we know that it has been estimated that 700 GPs will retire, then 2,200 GPs will be needed over the next six years.  Given that currently we train 258, and the ICGP wants that number increased to 350, then we are not going to get there by 2028.</p></speech>

I think that is also why we are looking at very substantially expanding the number of GP nurses and allied healthcare professionals.  If we can bring in GP nurses to support, as they are already doing with vaccinations and chronic disease management, they have a very valuable role.  If we can use phlebotomists, healthcare assistants and more practice nurses to support our work in general practice, that will create additional capacity within the existing GP workforce but, fundamentally, we have a major shortage of all primary healthcare staff currently.</p></speech>

There are very substantial constraints in the hospital training posts.  We need high-quality training posts for GPs so that when they emerge from their training they can actually practice autonomously.</p></speech>

We have identified those and we have gone some way to identify the numbers needed over the next few years.  General practice training has come under the remit of the ICGP since October.  Before that there were 14 different training programmes that were roughly based around the old health board areas.  It is, therefore, only in the past number of months that the responsibility for GP training has come under the aegis of the ICGP.</p> <p>  The structure of GP training means that two years are spent in relevant hospital posts, in the subspecialties, and two years then spent in general practice in a mentorship model learning the ins and outs of general practice on the ground.  There are not sufficient hospital posts to accommodate the GP training numbers.  That is a barrier to expanding the numbers more quickly and, therefore, we have to engage with the NDTP and other organisations to try to ensure that we have sufficient hospital posts for the first two years of the training of our junior colleagues, and then we have to ensure that there are sufficient trainers to increase.  The Deputy is quite correct about the numbers.  We have to look at making things a little bit more attractive to encourage people to stay on so that 700 people will not retire and that we can get more people into general practice.  There is no quick-fix solution.</p></speech>

On additional capacity, obviously there is a commitment from the political system to deliver universal GP care.  We have a system that is under fierce pressure and we need additional capacity just to stand still.  I know that there is a plan to increase training capacity.  I support the calls for additional supports and flexibility in respect of staffing subsidies and establishing practices.</p><p>I have a question for Mr. Moran on the working group that has been proposed on GP practice.  For nursing, for example, we have a safe staffing and skill-mix framework.  We need something similar for GP practice that would look at the science and tell us how many GPs we need, how we are going to train them and then it is up to the political system to deliver on same.  If that work was done and we had a commitment to do that, as well as looking at the flexibilities in how we better support the young GPs coming in and establishing practices, and the other issues that have been raised, and as a <i>quid pro quo</i>then from the political system to GPs, could GPs in a realistic timeframe of, say, over five or seven years, deliver universal GP access?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.598" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#E00900"><p>The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  I will touch on the NDTP report.  The 1,260 figure is based on under-18s coming in but that is on a standstill basis without any retirements.  Again, the number is much higher and is probably in excess of 2,000 the number of retirements is taken into account.</p> <p>  Universal GP care needs to be done.  Of course it is a laudable ambition but there is absolutely no point in replacing one barrier, which is cost at the moment, with another, which is time, if we are going to create waiting lists within general practice.  At each point it needs to be examined to see the effect on capacity.  At the moment we are saying we have 0.69 GPs per 1,000 of the population and the NHS, which has its own issues, has 1.1 per 1,000 and, therefore, we would need to significantly boost capacity before we could do that.  Would it be possible in that timeframe?  "No" is the answer because we simply do not have the capacity in the system at the moment.</p></speech>

If there is a commitment from the HSE and the Department that a framework is put in place to increase capacity and the issues that Mr. Moran has raised in his opening statement such as barriers to establishing practices, greater flexibility in staffing, the mix of staffing in general practice and so on were addressed, surely there would be an expectation from the public that the <i>quid pro quo</i>for that is the decision by the political system, supported by the people to deliver universal GP care, could then be implemented.  I accept there are capacity problems and that a lot of that needs to be addressed.  We also need to hear from representative organisations that if the political system steps up to the plate and provides that capacity, there has to be a<i>quid pro quo</i>.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#E01100"><p>There does.  We are in favour of universal healthcare but the timeframe that has been mentioned is very tight.  The <i>quid pro quo </i>is access to GP services.  At the moment, even within the system that we have people cannot access the GP and in many areas they cannot get on a GMS list or must wait for a period.  We need to increase that capacity before we can really look at anything.  We already have commitments relating to the under-12s and moving on to children aged six and seven and going through that.  That is a starting point and we need to look at how that affects capacity as we go through that and roll that out in a measured fashion.  If we increase the capacity that will be fantastic but if we are unable to do that properly then we are just going to create waiting lists within general practice and the situation will be a lot worse than it is now.  There is no point in having free care if one cannot see a GP or must wait for two weeks to see a GP.<br/><br/>Obviously we are in favour of universal healthcare but it needs to be done in a measured fashion where we are able to say, and assess at each juncture, what is the capacity now, what is the likely effect of the introduction of further free GP care, and whether we have enough capacity to do that in a safe fashion, which is going to increase access in an equitable manner for all citizens.  At the moment, we have a hybrid system and it is not perfect but waiting times are nowhere near what they are in the NHS.  We are aware that the NHS has 1.1 GP per 1,000 population so we need to significantly increase capacity.  It is something that we should all aim for in as quick a manner as possible but also in as safe a manner as possible.  If we introduce a situation where a patient cannot see a GP within a certain timeframe then that is a dangerous situation to be in.  We need to be very careful on this and we need to do this in a planned fashion.  Putting a timeline on that is difficult.  We need to see how the measures take place and to see whether capacity is being increased in a measured way, and if it is, then we would proceed on to the next stage.</p></speech>

Many GPs will have been in contact with public representatives during this time to raise particular issues.  I do not want the meeting to go by without acknowledging the critical role that GPs play, not just in maintaining continued care of patients, but also in continuing to roll out the vaccine which has kept people safe.</p> <p>  Although this might sound a silly question, what is an assistant GP?</p></speech>

They would usually be salaried by the practice they are employed in.  They may not be a partner but they might aspire to partnership or they may just be getting some experience in general practice before they go out and try to work on their own by getting a GMS contract and establishing themselves in practice.  It is somebody who is working with an established GP on a salaried basis.</p></speech>

What are the particular pinch points?  I represent Dublin South-West, which moves towards the mountains and takes in Rathfarnham, Templeogue, Greenhills, Citywest, all of Tallaght, Knocklyon and Ballycullen.  What is interesting to me as someone who comes from Rathfarnham is that Scholarstown Road runs from Marlay Park to Oldbawn and there is no GP practice south of that road and no GP practice has been established, although there are thousands of houses.  We have a new primary care centre coming in Ballyboden and Tallaght is reasonably well provided for in terms of primary care, so, moving north of that road, there is a reasonably plentiful supply of GPs.  Through bereavement and retirement, there has been a loss of GPs.  The impact the loss of just one GP has is incredible, and I know some local GPs would have up to 8,000 patients on their books.  That is just the geography of it.  It has always struck me that in all of that newly developed area which has developed over the last ten to 15 years, there is no GP practice.  What can we do to help deal with that?</p> <p>  One of the things I have been conscious of is that if GPs have a family practice, it tends to be the end house converted into a practice.  Even in the planning system, we do not make provision for GP practices in new developments, although we make provision for preschools, village centres and so on, and a GP may get the top floor position in that.  Is it something the witnesses have a view on?  Would it help if we included it in the planning requirement for an area?</p></speech>

When I drive around, I see massive building going on at the moment in Glanmire and we have not expanded our GP capacity anywhere near sufficiently to look after these people.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s pain in regard to his constituency and I know Deputy Colm Burke in my constituency will feel the same.  This is a widespread problem.  In terms of looking at solutions, the ICGP proposes a working group on the future of general practice so we have a strategic, high-level working group to accurately identify and work through the solutions.  Looking at the GP workforce is fundamental but that will take time, as Mr. Moran said.  It is also a matter of looking at the wider primary care team of GP nurses and allied health care professionals to support general practice and to support GPs, so we create capacity within the existing system.  That may represent a shorter term solution but there are no quick fixes.</p></speech>

A healthcare assistant will take some of the work from a nurse and allow our highly skilled practice nurses to increasingly do the more skilled work which is well within their capability and capacity, such as chronic disease management, advanced nurse training and nurse prescribing.  By bringing in people with a lower skill set, it increases the capacity and we get the correct skill mix within the primary care team.</p></speech>

In terms of how we help GPs, it is the GPs on the way in, the GPs who are already there and the GPs who are on the way out.  If I take the GPs who are already there, because that is the focus of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, at the moment we get allowances for certain staff members, such as a nurse or a secretary, but it is very defined as to what we can do.  For a practice such as a group practice or a single-handed practice, it would be better if the practice was allowed to take the pot of the allowance and decide what is required for its particular area.  This would mean not only healthcare assistants but also an allied health professional, such as a psychologist or a counsellor, could come in to add to the pot of treatment that a GP or a group of GPs can provide in the area.  That would be very important.</p> <p>  In areas where GPs are single-handed, we must remember that GPs do not go into general practice because of business; they go into general practice to treat patients.  In my case, I arrived to find that I was running a business and no one had ever explained what this was about as I thought I would just be treating patients.  Some people are very good at business; they were not trained that way but they were born that way.  If there was an allowance between four or five practices, GPs could have a practice manager who would allow them to look after the general practice side and allow the manager to look after the management side.  That might make it easier for the GPs who are already there.</p> <p>  In terms of GPs who are coming into the system, as we mentioned earlier, it is financially crippling for a GP to come in who does not have an established practice to join.  It is about trying to help them establish, first, with the various grants we alluded to earlier, but also with a hub and spoke model that allows for single-handed practitioners.  To be single-handed is very difficult in this day and age.  The GP is an employer and a doctor and has legal responsibilities, and there is a lot of stress.  In an environment where we are looking at work-life balance, the GP is going in the opposite direction when we are trying to encourage people, first, to go into general practice and, second, to establish themselves.</p></speech>

First, the days of people coming out of college debt-free are gone.  Most students, particularly postgraduate students who have gone into postgraduate medicine and do a degree somewhere else, go back in at 24 or 25 years of age and by the time they leave medical school, they will have a debt of approximately &euro;100,000 to pay off.</p><p>They could go to a financial institution to borrow money to buy a house to set up, because that is what is required but a house, with the various health regulations that are there, must be equipped and invested in.  It is not just a matter of buying a house; they have to equip it to meet certain standards.  Then they have to employ people on top of that, including practice secretaries and practice managers.  Before they start practising at all, they could find themselves in debt to the tune of close to &euro;1 million.  No bank, in this day and age, is going to give the imprimatur to them set up and all will be fine.  It just will not happen.</p></speech>

A good way to look at this is to compare the urban and rural situation.  The Deputy referred to a large area in his constituency where there is no GP.  In the same way that IDA Ireland supports business, we need to consider something similar for our young or emerging GP colleagues.  If two GPs want to set up, as Dr. Crowley has just said, the financial barriers are enormous.  They are at a very difficult stage in their lives, with young families, their own personal mortgages and their own personal debt from college fees.  In that context, we need to look at supporting GPs in much the same way that IDA Ireland supports our business colleagues.  That could include providing tax relief and help with the cost of premises and equipment and with set up fees.  Our GPs are highly trained and highly qualified and what the State will receive in return will be a multiple of what it invests.</p> <p>  Regarding our rural colleagues, what we are seeing now, and this is no longer confined to just the western seaboard, is significant difficulties in getting emerging GPs to take up lists because of remoteness and poor out-of-hours cover.  Furthermore, small lists with very little other income apart from the GMS list, means that many practices are not financially viable.  That has to be looked at as well because it is not just an issue along the western seaboard but right throughout the midlands as well.  I know of a practice close to Kilkenny city that has been finding it extremely difficult to find a GP, as Dr. Crowley can attest.  We have to tackle this.</p> <p>  Universal healthcare through Sl&aacute;intecare is a great aspiration that I very much support but emerging GPs do not want to be left on their own, where they have to create waiting lists, they are isolated, they have financial burdens and are referring into a void because there is no secondary care for their very unwell patients.  Let us say a young woman or young man attends a GP with a cruciate injury sustained in a weekend sport.  The GP will try to arrange secondary care but that patient will not even be seen for two years, not to mind getting treatment.  All of these factors are making GPs very reluctant to set out on their own without supports.  We have to support them.</p></speech>

As a member of a Government party, this is the first time this pitch has ever been made to me.  I ask, if not implore, the IMO, if it wants to take this further, to put flesh on the bones of what is required.  The idea of an IDA Ireland-style start-up grant scheme sounds very practical, given the crisis that exists in GP provision nationally.  If the IMO has not done so, I urge it to put together a detailed list of what is required in terms of start-up grants, subsidies and so on that would enable GPs to establish themselves.  It would then be up to politicians to advocate for that.  A detailed pre-budget submission could be prepared over the coming months.  I am not throwing this back on the IMO but I am interested in advocating for this and I am sure my colleagues on this committee are too.  I did not appreciate that the debt a qualified doctor emerges from medical school with was so large.  On the planning side, it is not right that a doctor has to buy a house and then furnish it.  GP practices should be constructed within all new developments and offered to GPs, with some kind of deal around paying back or leasing back over time.  That would be one way around that difficulty.  I do not know if that sounds terribly patronising or if the IMO has been over this ground previously but I ask the witnesses to give a brief response.</p></speech>

I apologise to the witnesses who did not get a chance to respond.  If members see that a witness has raised his or her hand, I ask them to allow them in.  I do not want to break the flow of the conversation but ask members to bring witnesses into the discussion whenever possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.620" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#G00700"><p>I welcome our guests.  It is important to acknowledge the essential role that general practice has played in the health service down through the years.  General practice is very much the front line and the first point of contact for people.  Traditionally people have been vary satisfied, in the main, with the level of care being provided and the accessibility of their local GPs.  The relationship between patients and GPs is a very trusting one.  I say that notwithstanding the difficulty that many people have in accessing care as a result of cost barriers.  That is very much central to the approach taken in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is about removing the cost barriers but it is also about refocusing the health service away from the very expensive acute hospital system and putting a major focus on general practice.  That includes doctors and all other essential healthcare workers at primary care level.</p> <p>  There are major opportunities for GPs to be part of something that is really transformative for our health service and that is what the public wants.  It makes sense for people to be able to access care at the earliest stage when an issue develops for them.  It also makes sense for them to have an ongoing relationship with general practice.  In the main, people want to access care locally from people that they know and trust.  That kind of approach is very much enshrined in Government policy and in Sl&aacute;intecare and that is why it is really disappointing that we find ourselves in a situation where there is a commitment to vastly expand general practice and primary care but we do not actually have the staff to do that and there are real obstacles in the way.  One of those obstacles is the current model of care.  While acknowledging the fantastic work that has been done down through the years, it is also important to acknowledge that private contractor, single-handed practice is a model that is no longer attractive to younger graduates.  There must be a way of acknowledging what existing GPs are doing, supporting them better in that while also developing a new model that recognises the desire and the needs of new graduates.  </p> <p>  We know from the HSE's updated workforce plan of November 2020 and from the very extensive research that has been done by the ICGP that younger doctors do not want the kind of model that has been in existence from the beginning of this State.  We have to recognise the fact that people are working to a 50 year old contract, albeit one that has been updated somewhat.  It just does not meet the needs of patients or medical graduates.  Research shows that medical graduates want a better work life balance and they want to be working in multidisciplinary teams with a much better skill mix.  They want to be medical practitioners as opposed to business people.</p><p>Many of the people graduating from medical school are broke as it is because of the cost of that.  They do not want to be in the position of having to take out a mortgage to buy a premises.  They want to concentrate on providing healthcare, in the main.  The proposals from the ICGP need very serious consideration.  In the absence of updating the contract and the model of care, what has happened, as mentioned by all of the witnesses, is that we now have a severe shortage of GPs.  The impact of that is that in areas all around the country people cannot access basic primary care.  This applies in rural areas as well as in urban areas.  As Deputies, we are increasingly getting queries from constituents who cannot get on to a GMS panel to access a general practitioner.  We know that the inverse care law applies.  The inverse care law is that the more people need healthcare, the greater the need, the less likely they are to be able to access that care.  We know from the witnesses' colleagues in Deep End Ireland that there are serious, major problems in areas of high urban disadvantage.  The existing model does not address that.  </p><p> Because we are not addressing those key problems, we are seeing the corporatisation of primary care.  That is not desirable.  The big companies are coming in from abroad and running general practice.  That is not in anybody's interest.  Unless we address the fundamental underlying problems, that trend will continue and we will lose all of those good elements of primary care and general practice.  We have to listen to what the ICGP is saying.  Its proposal around a high-level working group to address these underlying problems is key.  I would hope that as a committee we would take up those issues.  The problems go much deeper than tax reliefs for the existing model.  </p><p> I have a question for Dr. Quinlan.  To what extent has the ICGP engaged with our many medical graduates in recent years who voted with their feet and have gone abroad to work in other healthcare systems that provide work-life balance, premises and opportunities for part-time work that younger GPs are looking for now?  How much has the ICGP engaged with those people and what are the primary reasons for them emigrating?</p></speech>

General practice is a fantastic, rewarding, intellectually stimulating career.  There are financial challenges, as expertly outlined by Mr. Moran, but it is a phenomenal career.  This week, I had in my practice a young doctor who had just returned from Scotland.  She was engaged in my practice as a medical student in 2014.  She has an interview for the ICGP training scheme in February.  We are engaging continuously and we are reaching out internationally to support and bring people back.  I have also had a report from a colleague who moved to Scotland recently.  She tells me that the big different between her working as a GP in Donegal and working in Scotland is that she has enormous supports, such as have been described here today, in terms of healthcare systems, GP nurses, advanced nurse practitioners, nurse prescribers and a great deal of administrative support, including practice management support.  These are all of the requirements we have highlighted in our document, including the working group.  My colleague has all of those supports in Scotland, which enables GPs to work at the top of their licence throughout their working day.  We are working very closely to recruit young GPs to this fantastic career.  The financial piece is important.  As mentioned by Dr. Crowley, he is a doctor primarily not a business person.  I would look forward to working on the ICGP collaborative working group with all of the stakeholders to look at the future of general practice.  It would be a high-level working group with real muscle to deliver.</p></speech>

Clearly, premises has been a problem.  I have previously made the point that we would never expect school principals to provide their own schools.  We have highly trained GPs.  Surely, it makes sense that the State would provide premises for them, along with all the other health professionals required to work in a multidisciplinary team.  What is Mr. Moran's view on the State providing premises for GPs, working either as salaried GPs, which has been mooted in the past and which I know a lot of young graduates would be interested in, or on a contract basis?</p> <p>  The other side of that is that there would be a recognition of the costs incurred by existing or established GPs in providing those premises.  Surely, it is possible to address that issue.  We end up with these ridiculous rows about the rent that the HSE is charging GPs to use the State primary care centres.  What proposals has the IMO brought forward to address that issue and to ensure that people are freed up from having to get a mortgage and provide their own premises?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#H00500"><p>There are a range of issues in regard to premises.  As the Deputy will be aware, in the current system, there are HSE-owned premises, developer-owned premises and GP-owned premises.  These are primary care centres that are well set up with a variety of different systems in place.  With regard to the contractual position, the contractor basis is the preferred model.  There are employed GPs within general practice.  They are working with other GPs.  Most of the studies show that while initially some GPs want to work as an employee, they later want to set up in practice.  It is very difficult to see how two different models could exist side by side.  </p> <p>  On the premises point and the system operating on a contractor basis, the support that would be there would be welcome.  Previously, GMS premises were often provided free of charge, but that was a part of the work to get a GP into an area.  That took away that cost.  There are a significant number of GPs who have invested in their practices heavily over the years.  That would need to be taken into account when looking at something like this.  If that were the case, it is something that should be looked at.  There is a difficulty sometimes with primary care centres getting GPs in because there is a rent to be charged by the HSE to the GP and then the GP is working in another premises down the road.  Obviously, that does not make sense.</p></speech>

Why is the IMO opposed to a new model of care?  Why does it not recognise that there can be two different models of care, that is, one for existing GPs and those who are established and that being an option for new GPs and a different model for those GPs who do not want to invest in premises and want to work solely as GPs in a multidisciplinary team?  Would Mr. Moran accept that it is possible to have a dual model?</p> <p>  Second, I ask Mr. Moran to comment on the creeping corporatisation of general practice and if he sees that as a major problem.</p></speech>

The GP works within a practice but is not a partner within that practice.</p></speech>

It would lead to a fragmented system.  We believe that whatever system is there should be a unified applied system.  For the individual GP, there is progression through the existing system if he or she wants to work as a salaried GP for a time, which some do, and then set up in a practice, they can do that.  If we take away the entrepreneurial aspect of general practice, what then happens with the out-of-hours services?  For example, would the employed GP also do out-of-hours duties?</p></speech>

There are a lot of good GPs working within corporate set-ups.  It is changing.  The GMS contract is with an individual named GP.  A corporate entity cannot enter into a GMS contract.  It has to be  a doctor registered with the Medical Council who has a GMS number.  The contract the HSE has is with the individual GP.  While there might be entities beyond that set up in certain circumstances, the package of care is provided by that individual GP.  Notwithstanding that and the fact that the contract with the State must be entered into by the individual GP, we are seeing more of these practices set up where a limited entity is behind that.  It is a reality.</p></speech>

It has been an extremely difficult two years for everybody.  Hopefully, an end to the pandemic is in sight.  It has probably been the most challenging two years for every medical professional.  Anybody working in this field came across people in quite stressful situations.  It was, and continues to be, the medical profession's greatest hour.  We owe the profession our ongoing gratitude.</p> <p>  Deputy Shortall touched on a number of my questions.  It is obvious that we need more GPs.  What effect has the emigration of qualified graduates, particularly in the past ten years, had in terms of GPs who could have worked in the health system but went abroad for a variety of reasons?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#J01600"><p>I was a graduate who emigrated.  I came back in the late 1990s, which was before the time of austerity.  We have a long tradition of doctors emigrating, gaining experience overseas and coming back.  Unfortunately, many doctors emigrated during the decade of austerity and stayed abroad.  That is part of the workforce deficit we are experiencing.</p></speech>

They are all serious issues that are reflected in the capacity issues we addressed.  As Dr. Quinlan said, there is a long-standing tradition of Irish graduates going away, getting experience in other healthcare systems and bringing back new ideas.  That has happened.  What we need to do now is attract them back and make sure they stay so it is as much about retention as it is about recruitment.  Bringing people back is the challenge facing us now.  I echo what others have said.  General practice is a wonderfully rewarding career.  A number of organisations within the college are very active.  A continuing medical education network provides support to GPs who are working and trying to ease their workload.  We also have a network providing practical supports to people trying to establish a practice so we are doing our best with the resources we have but it comes back to the issue of capacity, which we all identified.  We have called for a high-level working group to address the needs we all identified and clarified by everybody in this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Madeleine N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#J01800"><p>The Deputy's question is a good one.  As we all know, the effect of emigration down the years across the board has been multi-factorial but what all younger GPs saw when they went abroad were highly functional systems of care in both primary and secondary care.  Primarily we are doctors and we want to work in really high-quality systems.  It is very difficult for them to come back to Ireland and see this quite broken system of care.  One issue is very close to my practice because I specialise in women's health.  The way other countries such as Australia deliver women's healthcare is fantastic.  The underinvestment that has been the case for decades in this country has been informed culturally, which is something we all know a lot about.  We should be leaving this culture behind.  The recent highlighting of menopause care and the <i>ad hoc </i>approach in this country was very welcome because it was something GPs had been talking about for a long time but menopause care is just one aspect of women's healthcare.  We need to look after our women and girls from adolescence through to their child-bearing age and menopause.  Regarding the very specific example of menopause, those are highly complex, individualised consultations that GPs are not funded to do under the GMS system so we are doing them on a <i>pro bono</i>basis.  They are not once-off consultations.  We need to see these women on a regular basis and we need to be dynamic in and individualise their care.<br/><br/>I am an early abortion provider in a rural community in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  This has shed light on a very difficult hidden fact in Irish women's healthcare, namely, that working poor women will never prioritise their healthcare needs above those of their children and families.  We see a high proportion of women who are unable to afford good-quality contraception so they now find themselves with unplanned pregnancies.  Thankfully, they can now access care in Ireland.  We really need to look after women and girls from the time of adolescence right through to contraception for all women who need it and really high-quality menopause care.  To bring it back to the question about emigration, for me looking at other countries and coming back to this healthcare system, that is a really good example of how emigration has affected us.  <br/><br/>Regarding corporatisation, in other countries, GPs can access retirement planning and feel very comfortable with it.  The corporates are probably the only area that offers retirement planning.  The State needs to sit up and take note because there is a place for them in certain circumstances but our current model should not be dismissed.  Again, our rural colleagues have given significant service to this State and worked onerous rotas in very isolated practices single-handedly.</p><p>While it is important that we move towards group practices, we have to acknowledge what they give.  We cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater by taking away rural services and moving them into group practices.  We need a hub and spoke model and we need to continue to provide dynamic, responsive rural care.  During the pandemic, we could see how our rural colleagues stepped up in very isolated situations.  We need to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

Six or seven years ago, free GP care was introduced for children under the age of six.  That had an effect on capacity.  The Government has introduced free GP care for children aged six and seven, which is great.  Most of us will agree that universal healthcare or Sl&aacute;intecare, whatever we like to call it, is very positive.  I am making a political charge rather than a medical charge in saying some of what we hear on the issue of universal care is lip service.  What effect is free GP care for six and seven year olds having in the witnesses' practices?</p></speech>

The ICGP has recently commenced a community gynaecology course, with more than 200 GPs logging on for each module of that.  With the HSE, we interviewed and are due to appoint a women&rsquo;s health lead.  These are very positive steps.  However, I agree with Dr. N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh that there is substantially more that we can do.</p> <p>  Coming back to the expansion of GP care to children, in principle, it is a fantastic aspiration.  However, in practice, giving free GP care when we know many patients across Ireland already have substantial difficulty accessing their GP in a timely fashion increases the burden and demand on an already constrained service.  Therefore, while it is a very noble aspiration, we need to recognise that we are in a difficult place in terms of our workforce in general practice and our ability to deliver that care.</p></speech>

We have had the pandemic for the past number of years and discussions have not been taking place on that, nor was the capacity available within general practice.  As the pandemic recedes, we might expect to see those discussions resume.  That should be done in a graduated fashion, with free GP care extended by a couple of years each time and capacity issues assessed.</p></speech>

If Dr. Crowley leaves the meeting and logs in again, we will try to bring him back in.  We still cannot hear him so we will have to move on.  We cannot hear Senator Conway either.

I welcome the witnesses and congratulate them on the role they have played throughout the pandemic.  It was called upon.  They rallied to the cause and that is much appreciated and admired.</p> <p>  Has the new GP contract in any way addressed the issues that have caused problems in the provision of GP services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.657" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#K01200"><p>The 2019 agreement  has had a very positive effect insofar as it has begun to unwind the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, provisions.  It is only this month that they have been fully unwound.  We hope that will have further effect as it beds down.  However, it is only a reversal of cuts and the restoration of funding to 2008 levels.  If we are to improve capacity, we need to directly target that with targeted incentives, for example, in the area of assistant GPs.  If a single-handed GP is close to retirement, he or she may wish to bring in an assistant GP who would take over the practice over a period of years.  Obviously, that is a sensible transition provision.  If the outgoing GP were supported to take on an assistant, it would help address the situation where we see lists coming up in certain areas and no suitable candidates applying for them.  That is one aspect.</p></speech>

We are working through the GP agreement as well.  The chronic disease management, CDM, part of the GP agreement is being widened from January of this year to include all medical card patients over 18 years of age who have a chronic condition.  That is a huge achievement.  In fairness to the HSE, it has put a great deal into that as well, particularly in terms of IT support and rolling out that change.  That will make a significant difference to patients&rsquo; lives and how they are managed within general practice.  Hopefully, it will lessen the burden on the acute setting and reduce the number of acute presentations by people with these conditions.  That is being worked through.  There is also work taking place on community healthcare networks - these are groups of populations of 50,000 - to deliver care at that level and have a GP lead along with network manager.</p> <p>  All of that work is taking place but there is a wider issue of capacity that we need to start looking at.  We want to engage with the HSE, the Department and the political system on that.  These are some of the solutions we would see on that.</p></speech>

Otherwise, they get struck, left on the shelf and added to the list.</p> <p>  In the event of an all-out effort being made, how can we dramatically increase the number of trainee GPs being accommodated in training?  That question has been asked before.  There is a necessity to increase that number dramatically in the shortest possible time.</p> <p>  I see three hands raised.  Who wants to go into the breach?

One of the barriers to increasing training numbers and making the training as relevant as possible is access to suitable hospital posts.  That is where primary care and the ICGP need to co-ordinate matters with the national doctors training programme to ensure we have access to suitable hospital posts.</p></speech>

The rate-limiting factor to growing the trainee numbers is, as Dr. Farrell said, the access to training posts in hospitals.  We are competing for those training posts with all other specialties.</p><p>The problem in hospitals is the emphasis on service rather than training.  There is an urgent requirement to move service posts to trainee posts.  That is a political decision, and then it is a decision that needs to be made locally by the HSE and the hospitals.</p></speech>

Within a hospital the emphasis is on service.  Training bodies such as ours are saying that we need to move this philosophy of emphasis on service to training.  With training, however, one also gets service.  That is one factor.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to increasing the training numbers rapidly.  We must also be conscious of the fact that there are only approximately 1,000 medical graduates coming out of the system annually.  It would be very difficult for us to go beyond the 350 GP trainees, which we are targeted to get to by 2026, because we are also competing with all of the other specialties.  That is also a rate-limiting factor. Training is not a short-term solution but we are committed to getting our training numbers up to 350 within the next three to four years.</p></speech>

It is all very well to talk about austerity, which was mentioned a couple of times, but we never had austerity in this country.  We had the IMF running the country when the money supply was cut off.  It was unfairly cut off to a lot of people who were very deserving, including in education and in health.  It was cut off and we had no control over it.  We are now in a position where we are trying to rebuild the system again.  We do not have the IMF and we must follow certain standards.  We have to rebuild the system from the point of view of our constituents and the growing demands of an increased population.</p> <p>  How quickly can we gain access to a greater supply of GPs if we have to take them from abroad?  What can we do about that?  There is a very lethargic method of dealing with applications from nurses, for example, who want jobs and who want to join here.  Nurses may have qualified in the UK but when they make an application to join the hospital services here, they could be waiting six months before the response, or more.  They keep complaining to us that they make the application and then the response is slow.  We must get out of that situation in a hurry.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments.  Unfortunately, there is no quick fix. There is no state whereby we can magically look abroad and bring doctors in quickly from abroad; it is not going to happen.  A problem at the moment is that our GPs have been trained, and the training they get here through the college is fantastic, and then they are well sought after across the world.  It has been happening for years that they go course, get experience, and come back.  Now our problem is that they are not coming back.  We are also not getting doctors from abroad coming in, so there is no quick fix.  Training more people sounds great but we must be realistic that we are also competing against other medical professionals here for their training schemes.  We must train our GPs to a certain level so when they go out they are able to actually provide the service for which we are training them.  General practice is a specialty.  One does not just train quickly up to it.</p></speech>

It must be possible to solve the problem at some stage.  If we do not put in place the mechanism to deal with it, the public will lose confidence, politicians will lose confidence and GPs will lose confidence, and we will then be in the situation where we are not capable of dealing with the magnitude of the problem that is unfolding.</p></speech>

If we look at it in perspective, we went from 159 training places in 2015 to 258 this year, which is a very substantial increase, and it will be at 350 by 2026.  It is a very substantial increase.  It is a competitive market internationally for healthcare professionals.  If we were to look at the allied healthcare professionals in general practice, which is our GP nurses, healthcare assistants, phlebotomists, and administration supports, that would liberate GP time in the short, medium and long term.  That does represent a further weapon in our armoury to support general practice in delivering care for patients.  A high level ICGP group, with all key stakeholder groups, engaged in looking at the work the future of general practice in deliver community care, would work through these problems relatively rapidly and come up with workable solutions.</p></speech>

We need to respond but if we cannot make a quick fix then let us have some fix in the shortest time possible.  If we have to import personnel then let us do it.  Let us recognise the problem and address it.</p></speech>

We want to attract our emigrated personnel back and encourage our highly trained personnel not to leave in the first place, in conjunction with attracting people who had have not trained in Ireland who are high-quality professionals from internationally.  This is absolutely something I would be very interested in looking at.</p> <p>  Points were made earlier about increasing subsidies for staff and making that more flexible, supporting our young GPs in making the decision to join partnerships, and a mentorship model.  None of these need a long run-in time.  This could all happen very quickly if the will was there.  During the pandemic we saw that when there was a will for the HSE to make changes, things happened overnight.  Locally, our primary care centre was converted into a clinical hub, built and ready for action within ten to 14 days.  When there is a will within the HSE we saw how it worked, they went ahead and did it.  Give us the subsidies, give us the succession planning, give us the mentorship, and give us the retirement planning.  Then people will be attracted back and people will be attracted to stay.  I believe that this should be our starting point.</p></speech>

The figure of 350 GPs out of a potential 1,000 GPs is a fair whopper of a number, and it could be substantial.</p> <p>  Reference is often made to bringing in doctors from abroad.  At a previous meeting we had a brief conversation about the ethics of recruiting doctors from overseas and the impact of depleting other countries, and particularly developing countries, of their medical expertise, especially given some of the limited growth opportunities Ireland has for doctors who have come from abroad.  This is slightly outside the focus of GPs but it reminded me that we had that conversation.  We cannot be outside of the training opportunities for people moving globally.  This is very important.  We cannot rely on bringing people in.  There is an ethical concern and we have discussed this topic at a previous meeting.  I just want to flag it here.</p> <p>  Reference was made to women's healthcare, and health care for pregnant people.  We are talking about service provision and people being able to access care.  Do the witnesses believe that the conscientious objection around abortion care is resulting in a depletion of care for pregnant people?</p><p>Would the witnesses say it is a good thing, particularly for those in rural areas?  For example, I note that Sligo has no GP that we know of who will provide abortion care.  There may be care provided under the radar.  People are forced to either travel across their county or outside of their county in order to access timely care.  I assure the witnesses that I am not asking for their personal opinion on the merits of conscientious objection, but rather asking them as representative organisations whether they are concerned that this severe lack of options for women or pregnant people in this area.  It becomes a bit of a postcode lottery as to whether or not people are able to access timely care.</p><p> I have spoken to a few GPs and one of their big concerns is about how they can interact with and support people with mental health issues.  They told me that there is essentially no primary care mental health service in Ireland.  They noted that people who are not in the GMS have to pay the market rate if they are in crisis and there is no embedded model of care.  They stated that mental health accounts for the bulk of GP workload but they are left on their own.  They referred to the lack of availability of psychological therapies for non-GMS patients and the months-long waiting list.  The cost of psychotherapy for a year can be over &euro;1,000.</p><p> These GPs also raised the lack of social management options and told me that nothing is embedded in GP primary care for key workers, or anything like that.  In their statements and briefing notes, the representatives of the IMO and ICGP spoke about the more embedded, broader model of care that people will be able to access in GP clinics.  I ask them to speak on the issue of mental health.  The GPs I spoke to said that one of most devastating things is not being able to offer the mental health care that is crucial at the moment.  I put that question to Dr. N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh and Dr. Quinlan.</p></speech>

There is an impact if GPs are unsupported by their local hospital and are expected to provide care in a vacuum.  For instance, there is no peripheral hospital providing that care in all of counties Donegal and Sligo.  I have colleagues who have very bravely stepped up to the mark and are providing high-quality care, but in terms of accessing follow-up care or in cases where the woman or girl has gone over the ten weeks' gestation period, after which point care cannot be provided in the community, their nearest hospital is Mayo General Hospital.  The model of care is that it is provided in the hospital.  Conscientious objection is something the HSE needs to address in those peripheral hospitals.  One will find that GPs will become providers if that is removed.</p> <p>  With regard to contraception, the main barrier to care for women receiving care and all people who need contraception is the financial barrier.  There are very few conscientious objectors now with regard to contraception.  Women, girls and people who need contraception have a good choice of who provides it, but they need to be supported.  There needs to be a structured programme for women and all people who need contraception.  I spoke about the issue earlier.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned mental health in primary care.  Mental health care in primary care is non-existent.  GPs are really under pressure to provide the care.  Again, this speaks to the subsidies.  We should be able to use our subsidies as we see fit, perhaps to employ a psychologist for a session or two a week.  What we keep talking about is the need for structured and evidence-based care.  We will deliver it, but it needs to be evidence-based and properly resourced or it will not work.</p></speech>

One is about the brain drain from low and middle-income countries to resource-rich countries.  The HSE has signed up to the WHO agreement on that issue.  We support and endorse that.</p> <p>  Looking at the mental health issue, this is really important to the Irish College of General Practitioners.  Many of our patients have severe and enduring mental health issues.  Working with the HSE, we are looking at several issues on that front.  The first is the physical health of these people.  People with severe and enduring mental illness die, on average, between 13 and 30 years younger than everyone else.  There is an appalling loss of life for this cohort.  A substantial part of that relates directly to their physical health issues and needs.  The second issue is that there is a substantial void in the ability to access counselling for people, when they need it, in a timely fashion.  Working with the HSE, we are looking at appointing a GP clinical lead in mental health.  Ultimately, we would like to see a chronic disease management programme for people with enduring mental illness, among others, similar to the existing and really good chronic disease management programmes for asthma, COPD, diabetes and heart disease.  Mental health is something we are passionate about and on which we are working closely and on an ongoing basis with senior HSE staff to deliver.</p></speech>

To reiterate what our colleagues would say, I cannot count the number of times that all GPs, particularly those in this room, have been in consultations with severely distressed people with mental health issues who had nowhere to go.  Our only option is to keep bringing them back to the practice while we are trying to facilitate public services.  GPs are the first line of contact for mental health issues and there are no resources.  To reiterate what we are saying in terms of going back to free GP care, sometimes structured care and programmes offer far better value for money for the State and patients.  Mental health would certainly fall into that category.  It would be high up on the list of any GP working on the ground in Ireland.  Mental health issues are huge.  The number of cases we have seen in the past couple of years, particularly during Covid, has been very upsetting and distressing.  We could spend the day sharing various stories.</p></speech>

Obviously, that is one particular setting but all of the care options were provided.  It would relieve some of the pressure, as Dr. N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh has said, if GPs were able to decide how to use that funding themselves and direct it as best they see fit within their own practices.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I have been following the discussion.  I address my first question to Mr. Moran.  I was alarmed to learn, from Mr. Moran's opening statement, that in Ireland we average 0.69 GPs per 1,000 population.  Mr. Moran suggested that we require 1.1 GPs per 1,000 population.  That is how needs are reacquired in Ireland.  The population here is based in rural areas, apart from some large cities.  We need that kind of cover of GP practice if we are to provide a full service to our population.  I wonder how we rank in relation to other European nations.  Are we laggards or are we there or thereabouts compared with other nations in terms of standards?</p></speech>

We are towards the bottom of the table.  England, as a comparator, would be up around the one GP per 1,000 mark and Scotland would be slightly higher than that.  We are behind.  There is also an issue with the distribution of GPs.  For example, within a county there may be a 1:1,000 ratio, but in another county the ratio may be 0.55:1,000.  It is the number of GPs and where they are that are the issues that need to be addressed.  We are significantly behind the European average.  It is sometimes difficult to know in terms of part-time workers, whole-time equivalents and issues like that.</p><p>Comparing jurisdictions can be difficult but on most of the measures, we would be behind the average.</p></speech>

I live in south Clare, where there are a number of GP practices, but in the west of the county, resources are far more stretched.</p> <p>  There are out-of-hours GP support services, such as Shannon Doc in the mid-west, which has been fantastic, and we have all availed of that out-of-hours support at one time or another.  Coming out of Covid, have Shannon Doc and equivalent services across the country sufficient firepower?  As Deputies, particularly speaking as a Deputy from a Government party, is there more we can do to bolster that?  As I have just referenced, people in west Clare and across the county lean very heavily on that out-of-hours service.  Does more need to be done from a GP point of view to bolster that and give them more firepower or is the current position sufficient, coming out of Covid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#N00300"><p>The GPs who work within and who are members of the co-ops are the ones who need to be supported.  The GMS contract, which is what every GP works under, is a 24-7 contract and the out-of-hours obligation in that is discharged through the out-of-hours service.  Sometimes, the GP will provide a shift but they are also in many cases paying for the red-eye shift, so they pay an amount to the co-op to hire a locum doctor to cover that shift.  Obviously, we cannot have somebody working 24 hours a day so a locum doctor covers the red-eye shifts on a rota basis.  However, that is a significant cost to those GPs.  If there is something to be addressed, it is that there should be an overall review of the out-of-hours situation generally because it is not equitable across the country.  There may be a very good set-up in Shannon or in County Clare but there may be a different set-up in another part of the country as they are all on different systems.  A review would be timely from the GP point of view to ensure the rosters are equitable.  The supports should go to the individual GPs who are supporting the co-ops and who are members of the co-ops.  They are paying for the red-eye shifts in many cases and it is a cost to the practice for them to provide this cover.</p></speech>

As I should have said at the outset, collectively, GPs have done an incredible job in the past two years.  There have been negatives, of course, and there were appointments that GPs were unable to fulfil because they were snowed under, which is not their fault and is a fact of the crisis we have been in.  One of the positives has been how prescriptions have issued and how everything has moved very fluidly in that regard.  Will some of those gains continue?</p> <p>  GP nurses have been fantastic.  Much of the time when I go to my local GP practice, I do not even need to go into the doctor because the small-level stuff that I need can be adequately dealt with.  This leads to huge fluidity.  The State provides some subsidisation for GP practice nurses.  I am curious as to whether there is standardisation of pay and conditions or is each practice the employer and sets its own terms.</p> <p>  With regard to GPs who train abroad, I did an Erasmus year study during college in the Czech Republic and I was amazed to find out there were eight or nine Irish students training to be doctors at the time and they are now all in the system, hopefully.  Is the trend for them to come back home or do most of them stay and practice in continental Europe?</p></speech>

The ICGP is very supportive of this and we are co-hosting a global rural medicine conference in the University of Limerick in June of this year, so we are absolutely committed to it.  I am also very conscious from my conversations with GPs in County Clare of how fragile the GP ecosystem is in Clare and the concerns about the retirement of one or two GPs in the more rural practices - no GP, no village.  We share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about continuing the gains made during the pandemic.  Electronic prescribing is fantastic, in particular for our patients.  Just yesterday, I sent off a prescription for one of my patients who was at home in Cork.  He rang me to ask could we send his prescription to his local pharmacy as he had gone back to college in Dublin, and I was able to email his prescription to a pharmacy in Dublin.  This is bringing phenomenal benefits.  Our colleague mentioned earlier how, given the right supports and encouragement, the HSE turned on electronic prescribing overnight, which was something we had been seeking for a long time.  There are further benefits we can harness from electronic prescribing but it is certainly a great start.</p> <p>  In terms of whether we are going to maintain the benefits of the pandemic, the answer is absolutely &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  One of the huge benefits we have had is that we have moved a lot of our education online.  Twice a month, we have a webinar for in excess of 1,200 GPs and much of our GP education is delivered online, although, obviously, we have a blended approach because some of it needs to be face to face.  We are absolutely committed to maintaining the benefits of the pandemic in terms of IT.</p> <p>  On the role of GP nurses, in my practice, with the assistant GPs we have one whole-time equivalent GP nurse.  If we were in the UK, we would probably have between five or six and ten GP nurses.  We absolutely need the resources to employ and upscale our GP nurses.</p> <p>  I might leave the terms and conditions issue to Mr. Moran because that is more within the remit of the IMO.</p></speech>

They are part of the GP team.  We hear in hospitals about the consultants and their teams and we are now in a position where we talk about GP teams.  These people who work with GPs in practices contribute hugely to the functioning of GP practices.  We were talking earlier about allowing a general practice to change its subsidies to allow us to take on people, such as allied health professionals and healthcare assistants, depending on the area of need that we perceive is required for the practice.  These will allow the GPs - the senior clinical decision-makers within our ecosystem, as Dr. Quinlan calls it - to make decisions that will be best for the patients.  The nurses have employment contracts and we liaise closely with nursing unions and GP practice bodies on terms of employment but, ultimately, the GP is still the employer.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a great point on training abroad.  He was abroad himself on Erasmus.  I worked in Australia for a year and learned a huge amount about a different system and then came back and brought it with me.  That has been the tradition for Ireland since time immemorial.  The problem now is that the systems over there are very good to work in and people are not returning.  That is a very important point.  When we go back to the figures we had, of the GPs who go abroad, it is very hard to estimate prospectively how many people will stay abroad.  In terms of the study that the ICGP trainees did in 2019, before they left 9% of them had already planned to go abroad and how many will return is a serious issue going forward.</p></speech>

The ICGP and the IMO are hugely supportive of our practice nurse colleagues, who have really stepped up to the mark in delivering the vaccine programme and the booster programme over Christmas and the new year.  They are wholly responsible in most practices for delivering all of the childhood vaccines, as well as dealing with women's health issues, cervical screening and chronic disease management programmes.  General practice would be lost without them and we hugely value them.  Obviously, the terms and conditions are up to each individual practice but we try to look after them as best we can because they are hugely valued members of the team.

Hearing the issues with general practice and the workforce crisis being discussed has been an eye-opener.  Many of my questions have already been asked and Senator Hoey touched a little on the issue of mental health.  I want to ask questions on this.  There is no doubt that a high-level working group to address all the issues relating to general practice is badly needed.  It is vital having heard the presentations.  It has to happen.</p> <p>  I want to speak about mental health.  There are several areas I want to discuss.  There have been many reports on the negative mental health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have seen the huge surge in mental health problems in general.  It probably comes out of the whole trauma of Covid-19.  The witnesses spoke a little about GP burnout.  Are there supports that would help GPs in general in the work they do, bearing in mind we are in crisis with regard to the issues in general practice the witnesses have brought before the committee?  Are there mental health supports for GPs given the amount of work they do and the threat of burnout?</p></speech>

We are very aware that GPs have been under stress for a significant period of time.  What are we doing to address this?  More people are in group practices with peer support and peer review of work.  This has been beneficial.  We are conscious of the fact that 50% of our GP colleagues work in either one or two person practices.  For many years, the college has had continuous education groups.  These have been of huge help but they have been impacted by the pandemic.  They comprise GPs who meet locally, often in a local building, to discuss clinical problems and get updated on what is new.  They offer significant peer support for people under pressure in practice.  They are able to discuss difficult cases and caseloads.  They have been of huge value.  They have been impacted by the pandemic but I hope, with the easing of restrictions, we will be able to get back to them.  They have been in place for a significant number of years.  They are greatly valued by our GP colleagues.  They are one of the main ways for people to get support.</p> <p>  Dr. Rita Doyle has just stood down from her role as president of the Irish Medical Council.  The IMC has been very aware of the pressures that doctors generally are under.  There are support systems.  The Irish College of General Practitioners has the doctors' health in practice programme run by Dr. Andree Rochfort.  It is accessed by colleagues when they are under pressure or in psychological distress and in need of a helping hand.  No more than anyone else in the community, doctors are human.  They have a significant workload and come under their own pressures.  The college addresses this through various strands.</p></speech>

I count myself as a middle-aged GP at this stage.  I am learning about work-life balance from younger GPs.  I am the first to say my work-life balance is atrocious at times.  I am learning from what my younger colleagues expect and demand in terms of their mental health and their ability to stay longer in the job.  This will impact on replacing GPs who are retiring.  GPs are no longer willing to work the hours and other mad stuff that was done in the past and they are right.  We can see the ill-effects that have been created in people in my generation.  The hours that GPs work is another factor of the GP crisis.</p> <p>  I am hugely into sports.  Huge numbers of GPs have got together in exercise groups, walking groups and running groups.  This has been very important in Covid.  I emphasise what Dr. Farrell has said about collegiality of GPs locally.  It is always good to pick up the phone to speak to someone locally who understands the worries and concerns.  When people are living in a community it is a bit difficult to speak to just anyone.  They need to be able to speak to someone who understands what they are going through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Diarmuid Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#O00400"><p>Dr. Crowley and Dr. Farrell have addressed some of the issues.  With regard to burnout, we know that 40% of GPs have had great difficulty in securing a locum for sickness or holiday leave in the past two years.  This is a substantial driver of personal burnout.  Very good research from Ireland shows that for every two hours a GP consults patients, a further hidden one hour of non-patient-facing work is generated, including reading letters, writing referral letters, managing blood test results and making phone calls to hospitals and patients.  There is a substantial hidden workload.  My door seems to close at 6 p.m. but I will be there until 7.30 p.m. or 8 p.m. doing this hidden work.  These are factors that contribute to the pressure in general practice.</p></speech>

With regard to what Dr. Quinlan said, when I started as a GP I did not regard anything that was not patient facing as work because it was hardwired into me that it was my job.  Very quickly I realised that a huge proportion of my work was paperwork.  Going back to what we said earlier, it is about support.  We need to get in there before the GP gets burned out.  Peer support and exercise are very important but we need to provide support to GPs before they get to the point where they are absolutely overloaded with work.</p> <p>  A point particular to women is that maternity leave cover is very difficult.  We have good support for women who are partners to take maternity leave but the problem is accessing a locum.  It is a huge stress in pregnancy for GPs not to know whether they will be able to take a week or full maternity leave.  We have colleagues who went back to work much earlier than recommended for anybody else in any other place of work.  This is something we really need to address for our female colleagues.</p> <p>  Another element is that many female colleagues who are planning families with their partners will be reluctant to take on partnerships for this very reason.  They will stay as assistants because they know that as assistants they will be able to access maternity leave, even if it is unpaid.  A practice may not be able to pay them because it will not be subsidised if they are assistants.  There is a vicious cycle for women.  It could be easily addressed if we supported women to get into partnership.  It comes back to supporting our younger colleagues and they will deliver.</p></speech>

I am sure GPs have seen more people coming to them with mental health issues, stress and anxiety.  I am not speaking about extreme mental health issues.  I am speaking about the everyday stresses of life that come with Covid-19.  Is there a better way to equip GPs in managing this?  Do some GPs have a mental health expert in their service?  Is this something that could be looked at?  If someone presents with a mental health issue of anxiety or stress, is there somewhere that person can go within the service or to whom they can be referred?</p></speech>

When this started back in March 2020, one of the significant difficulties was referrals.  Everything was affected and a lot of people, particularly the elderly population, were very fearful of coming to see their GP.  The number of face-to-face consultations reduced dramatically as we were encouraged to practise more online or on the telephone to triage problems that arose.  Due to mental health services being underfunded and under-resourced for such a long time, GPs themselves deal with a huge number of mental health issues in general practice on a daily basis.  That has become more obvious in the past 12 to 20 months with the pandemic.  We manage a lot of it ourselves.  We have access to counselling in primary care but as Mr. Quinlan alluded to earlier, sometimes that is not quick enough or readily accessible enough.  Unfortunately, people who need counselling have to come up with their own funding to access that through private counsellors.  Where those services are not available there have been increased referrals and self-referrals to emergency departments because people have not been able to access the necessary psychiatric care or acute psychiatric assessments.  It is an issue.  Through our educational webinar series we have tried to support GPs by providing education around mental health issues.  That is something we have done from a practical point of view.  In the main, GPs have been left on their own but we are used to that.  We are the last generalists in dealing with all the different problems that present.  Psychiatry and minor and major mental health issues are the bread and butter of general practice.</p></speech>

There would be meetings between GPs and the network manager within that area to identify its needs.  One area might need additional physiotherapy support whereas another might need counselling support so it is about trying to target those supports a lot more locally through that system.  That is coming on stream through the GP agreement.  It is not there yet but it is hoped that that will come on stream in the next year or so.</p></speech>

Historically we had a very large psychiatric institution in the area so as a result of that there are a lot of healthcare workers in psychiatry living and working in the community, in the unit in Roscommon and in Ballinasloe.  The problem with accessing care is that if people who have family working in the Roscommon service or any of the local services become unwell they may not want to go into that system.  There is a problem with postcode psychiatric services and it is particularly problematic in rural areas as people who need very serious psychiatric care are unable to access it with any degree of privacy in the local hospital because of employment arrangements.  This is something GPs have been talking about for a long time and it causes a lot of stress for the patient, their family and the GP.  It is grossly unfair and does not affect any other area of medicine except psychiatry and, therefore, it must be looked at very seriously.</p></speech>

I first pay tribute to the GP community throughout the country for the role they have played in this pandemic, particularly in the roll-out of vaccines and the booster vaccine.  If it was not for the significant role GPs and general practice played in general, that roll-out would not have been the success it is today.</p> <p>  Clearly, based on the figures Deputy Cullinane outlined earlier with regard to expected retirements and those going through the system, we are not going to have enough GPs over the next ten years.  In fact, we will be down on the numbers we have now.  What can be done in the short term to attract GPs from abroad who might be prepared to come to Ireland and locate here?  What can we do immediately to make it attractive for GPs abroad to come and be employed in this country?</p> <p>  My second concern relates to the out-of-hours service.  This is clearly an important service, particularly in rural areas where people are not as near emergency departments as they would be in Dublin or other cities.  Some out-of-hours services are working very well and others are not.  Clearly, funding is needed.  Are the witnesses aware of examples internationally where out-of-hours services are working well?  It is obviously a matter of resources but if there are lessons that can be learned or if there is an international model that we can emulate, we need to hear about it.  I fully support the need to review the service because we need a system that is unified and that works in every part of the country, not just in some.</p></speech>

The HSE has signed up to the WHO agreement on that.  On recruiting GPs from overseas, the terms and conditions for coming here need to be attractive so we need to make it attractive for GPs to come.  If they are attractive for overseas GPs they would be attractive for Irish GPs so we would need to address all the issues we have raised about the workforce and the workload capacity.  In a nutshell, we need more GPs and GP nurses.  We need the physical infrastructure, that is, the bricks and mortar, and we need the IT to support GPs to do their jobs.</p> <p>  On the out-of-hours service, I am on the Cork SouthDoc committee.  General practice in Ireland delivers in excess of 1.3 million consultations per annum so it is extremely busy and we do a huge volume of work.  I spoke to the manager of our local co-op in the past week in advance of this meeting.  They identified the need for more GPs to support out-of-hours care so it is available across rural areas.  We need more GPs and GP nurses to undertake appropriate activities within.  It is essentially a manpower issue with the GP out-of-hours service as well.</p></speech>

Ten years ago, England separated the daytime contract from the out-of-hours contracts and it caused a lot of difficulties.  The out-of-hours service became a bit more corporatised with non-daytime GPs working within it and a lot of the work was just referred back to the daytime service.  People also had difficulties with access.  There are difficulties with out-of-hours services in all jurisdictions.  A review is the first step to ensuring there is uniformity and equity for all GPs and the co-ops that they are a part of.  It is not an easy problem and it is one that needs to be looked at but a review would be the starting point for that.  There was a HSE review five or six years ago but I am not sure if it was ever published.  It certainly needs to be looked at afresh now with regard to how the individual GP commits to that service and pays into it.</p><p> On attracting GPs from abroad, the things that will attract GPs from Ireland to take up positions are the same as those that will attract GPs from abroad.  It is dependent on putting in place the incentives that we have spoken about.</p></speech>

It was not easy for practices.  There was an increased volume of work that had to be done.  It has been much appreciated.</p> <p>  I was in the UK four years ago looking at GP practices.  While there, we were advised that the practices we were looking had reduced the waiting time for seeing patients from 14 days to eight days.  There was one practice that had 20,000 patients where all the GPs resigned on the same day.  None of the adjoining practices would take on the 20,000 patients so the local hospital had to hire doctors to cover the needs of those patients.  I hope we will never go down the road here where there would be a waiting time of 14 days for a person to access a GP.  It is a commitment of GPs here in that they have been able to provide a comprehensive service to their patients.  Therefore, it is important that they get the additional supports to provide that service.</p> <p>  A number of people raised the inadequate number of support personnel, particularly nurses and care assistants.  One of the challenges we will have is the availability of a sufficient number of trained nurses, even if we wanted to increase the number of nurses.  Is there a proposal to train people as care assistants so that a sufficient number of people would be available within a short timeframe?</p> <p>  My second question is about primary care centres.  The figures I have state that 127 primary care centres were built by 2019 - I do not have up-to-date figures - and at the time, there were another 70 in the pipeline.  Is sufficient work being done on that, especially in major centres of population, to provide the necessary supports to GPs to come into primary care centres and, at the same time, on the co-ordination of other healthcare providers, such as physiotherapists, counsellors and all the support mechanisms needed in the community?</p></speech>

Unless it is for acute problems, which GPs will always manage and for which they provide a same-day service, the reality unfortunately is that for a lot of practices there is a waiting time of a couple of days to see a GP.  It is down to capacity issues.  The committee should also know that there is an increasing complexity of care in general practice. The days of very quick consultations are gone.  With an ageing population, complex medical issues and multimorbidity, consultations are taking longer.  With the advent of the chronic disease management programme, we are able to address some of those in a structured way, which is great.  It goes back to the fact that there are capacity issues.  If someone is acutely unwell, that person will certainly be seen and provided with a same-day service.</p> <p>  My practice moved into a primary care centre two years ago and it has provided us with ready access to ancillary services, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and our public health nursing colleagues.  It is great and is one of the models of care but, going back to what Dr. N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh and others said, it raises the questions of who owns the buildings, who pays the rent and who looks after the cost involved in providing the infrastructure.  That is something we believe needs to be looked at also.</p></speech>

I work in a primary care centre.  It was a self-developed primary care centre whereby eight GPs came together in 2003-04 and got involved in the development of the centre.  We learned an awful lot of what can go wrong and what will go wrong and we came out the other end.  It is clear from what happened since that there will no longer be GPs self-developing, which is a pity.  The Indecon report produced a number of findings which, if followed through, would result in GPs being willing to develop their own centres for the needs of their population.</p> <p>  In terms of the primary care centres developed by developers, they are now facing this situation of the rent, the property and the management.  I get a lot of calls because we did our own centre.  In speaking to a number of colleagues about ongoing management fees, one would definitely need a business degree to cope with some of the hidden snags that exist for GPs.  Having listened to people's stories, GPs were burned.  It worked out for us but there were other GPs for whom it did not work out.  It has moved away from GP developers to developer-led primary care centres.  There are issues in terms of how the payments occur.  It goes back to what we were talking about before.  I am sorry for taking up so much of the committee's time.  We will have to look at the infrastructure for GPs and make allowances according to that.  It is well worth looking at the Indecon report.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Crowley suggesting we should now look towards either the Department of Health or the HSE to become directly involved in providing the centres and then working with GPs?</p></speech>

They are important but they are only buildings.  We are in a primary care centre, but our ancillary staff are employed by the HSE.  The HSE staff work from the building.  They have their waiting lists.  It is great to meet someone across the corridor and there are advantages, but they are still people experiencing pressures.  It does not sort everything out.  It is a great location to work from.  It is handy for patients that they come to the same centre the whole time, but ultimately it is about people and our problem at the moment in the health service is a lack of people.</p></speech>

As such, GPs will also face that challenge.  Is there a way of dealing with the provision of support staff who are adequately qualified to provide the support that GPs need?  Do we need to develop a programme in this regard?  Elderly care was referred to, for instance.  We have approximately 740,000 people who are aged over 65 years and that figure will increase to 1 million in the next eight years.  There will be increased challenges for GP practices and therefore they need more support.</p></speech>

It would not take a whole lot to look at that and actually alter the way GPs work.  What we can do at the moment is very prescriptive and it is a huge aspect of something that could be done in the next couple of months that would provide huge supports to GP practices to cope with the tsunami they are facing.  I will not say that it is a quick fix.</p></speech>

Certain defined tasks, which we have spoken about previously such as electrocardiogram, ECG, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, are things a healthcare assistant could do that might free up a nurse or a doctor to do something else.  That is certainly something we would like to look at.</p> <p>  With regard to practice nurses, people progress within practices and different practices have different set-ups around that.  There is a level of progression within a practice.  If a nurse is there over a period of years, obviously, that is different to somebody just coming in.  There are salary and career progressions so there is a system of sorts in place.</p></speech>

One of the concerns that has been raised with me by GPs is the difficulty in getting access to support services.  What can be done to try to improve that, in particular where a GP has a patient who needs urgent attention and is trying to get him or her through the hospital system?  Does Mr. Moran think much more can be done on that in order that people can be dealt with?  I know there were challenges over the past two years with Covid-19 but now we have moved away from that, what improvements can we achieve in that whole area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#R01200"><p>I will make one point on that and I might defer to one of my clinical colleagues, Dr. N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh or Dr. Crowley.  The waiting lists are substantial and a significant amount of care is going to patients who are waiting on these lists.  Even for something like a hip operation, that will be a six-month wait.  The patient is in a lot of pain while he or she is waiting and being looked after within general practice and managing that pain.  That is difficult for the patient and the GP.  These are things that need to be looked at but I will pass on to Dr. N&iacute; Dhalaigh to make a point on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Madeleine N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#R01300"><p>It is really just to elaborate on what Mr. Moran said.  A practical example would be that waiting lists have huge ramifications for people in the community and GPs providing care.  As I mentioned earlier, if a person who is, say, a plumber, carpenter or in gainful employment has a sporting injury or otherwise at the weekend and comes into us with a cruciate ligament tear or some sort of injury that is going to impact their ability to continue their work and if they do not have private healthcare, they are looking at a two-year wait before they are even seen and given treatment.  They are out of the workforce.  It does not make any sense at any level and certainly on a human level, it is absolutely atrocious.</p> <p>  What we are doing as GPs is managing them by managing their pain and helping manage their disability if they cannot access physiotherapy in a timely manner.  Our physiotherapist colleagues are excellent but there are just not enough of them.  That adds a clinical burden on to GPs but it is also very difficult from an emotional labour point of view for GPs to have to witness this terrible bottleneck in the hospital system, which is not the fault of our hospital colleagues; it is the system's fault.  A root-and-branch review of that has to happen.</p> <p>  Another example of this is our young scoliosis patients.  Thankfully, I do not have anyone at the moment with that condition but I have GP colleagues who are absolutely at their wits' end trying to support these young people in pain who just cannot access timely care.  It is awful.  From a GP point of view, therefore, the professional and emotional labour from watching that and trying to manage it is immense.</p></speech>

That is very much to be lauded.  We also have limited access to virtual clinics, which will be really good for patients because essentially, it resources GPs and consultants to communicate directly without necessitating the patient travelling to the hospital, if we could build upon that.</p> <p>  Finally, another really good news story is that the HSE, ICGP and other key partners worked to get GP access to diagnostics, particularly MRI and CT scans.  The preliminary reports outcome for that shows that giving GPs access to MRI and other radiology has reduced emergency department referrals by 74% for these patients and outpatient referrals by 85%.  Giving GPs access to diagnostics and other supports, therefore, can substantially improve hospital waiting times, emergency department attendances and outpatients referrals.  The HSE is doing a lot of good and we need to build upon this.</p></speech>

I will give the example of someone who trained in obstetrics and gynaecology for nine years, decided it was not for them and then got involved in the GP training scheme.  They have a huge amount of expertise yet they could not get hours in a hospital at the same time as working as a GP whereas in other countries, in particular, Canada, there is far more connectivity between GPs working in their practice but also doing some hours or days in the hospital.  Does Dr. Quinlan believe this should be considered so there is connectivity?  We seem to have drawn a clear line - a person is either out in the GP practice or in the hospital system but he or she cannot be between both.</p></speech>

GPs are working across many hospital departments, certainly in my area.  My concern at a strategic level is that I would not like to see that as a one-way flow of GPs going into the hospital and obviously coming back to general practice with very valuable skills.</p> <p>  I would also like to see the potential for young hospital doctors to come and spend more time working in general practice so we have a better shared understanding of each other's working lives and what patients come to us.  It would work both ways.</p></speech>

There is not enough exposure at undergraduate or, indeed, postgraduate level to general practice in training and equipping our doctors.  It has been shown and it was said earlier that if people have intern posts in general practices, they are more likely to pursue a career in general practice.  There are only four or five posts in the country at the moment and the undergraduate exposure to general practice training is also pretty limited so we need to try to improve that.</p></speech>

I hate to go back in history, but one of the fears about taking on staff is that when the FEMPI measures came in there were huge cuts to staff, which nearly paralysed a generation of GPs.  I still hear colleagues say they are afraid to take on staff because we are still in that zone where it is difficult to do so because they may be cut again and we will have to let people go.  Reducing wages paralysed staff.  That is one of the other issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#S00600"><p>I have a few questions and I also wish to get clarification.  Some of the members mentioned the Covid pandemic.  For me, it highlighted the importance of having a medical system that works but also that delivers for citizens.  The witnesses referred to 29 million consultations, 1 million of which take place in the evening.  Society owes GPs a great debt.</p> <p>  The main focus of many of the questions has been on the retention and recruitment of GPs.  A number of members, as well as witnesses, focused on the bricks and mortar or built infrastructure of GPs.  The IMO referred to enhanced supports, including but not exclusively, tax relief, the funding of premises and so on.  I seek clarification on that issue.  What would be the opinion of witnesses on State-run GP services where practices are kitted out and staffed through the public service and GPs would be on contract with the HSE?  Would that cause difficulty among members, in particular those who, as was outlined, are having difficulties with payment of services?  First, it would reassure taxpayers that the money is going into those particular areas.  The investment could be in areas of high deprivation or rural areas where there is clearly a shortage of GPs.  Would that be too radical a plan, as part of the solution going forward?  Perhaps someone could give a reply on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Val Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022012600002#S00700"><p>We had a little discussion on this earlier.  The issue with having two different systems working side by side is that it makes it very difficult to do that.  With regard to GPs working in rural areas and areas of deprivation, some strides have been made in recent years, in particular on the deprivation side under the IMO GP agreement where an additional amount of funding is going to the top 150 practices working in areas of deprivation.  That has helped.  There will be a further roll-out of that this year and a new system going in towards the end of the year that will help with deprivation.</p> <p>  On GPs in rural areas, we need to expand the supports that are available.  They were agreed around ten years ago.  There is a need to look at that and to support GPs in that area.  I do not think the way to go is a system whereby we would publicly fund everything and the GP would work within it.  The independent contractor model has given us the best of both the private and public systems.  There is some entrepreneurial spirit among GPs, and we also have their clinical dedication to their patients.  It is very hard to see how two separate systems would marry up with regard to the out-of-hours system.  If they are employed, is it suddenly the case that paperwork currently being done in the evenings would no longer be done?  How would it work?  If certain services are provided on a fee-per-item basis in the existing system but not on a fee-per-item basis in the employed doctor system, will the employed doctor have an incentive to do these things?  We have incentivised certain parts of care in the way it is set up.  For the CDM programme, for example, the GP does two scheduled reviews per year and is paid a certain amount for that.  An employed doctor is paid the same, regardless of what he or she does, so it is difficult to look at that.</p> <p>  There is a role for an employed doctor.  It is already in general practice and it is working in existing GP surgeries.  Once a number of doctors are finished their training, they may want to work as an employed GP for a number of years but after that, they may want to take on a practice in their own right.  Even if there were an employed GP in a certain area, it is not the case that he or she would stay forever, which would mean that continuity of care would be suddenly lost.  With the existing system, where GPs invest in the area and in practices, they are committing to the area and that helps with continuity of care.</p> <p>  In short, that is not a system we would look at because there would be too many difficulties with it.  We have had reform overload in the health service and sometimes we need to improve the system we have to the greatest extent possible rather than going back to the drawing board because we would end up going backwards before we can go forwards and never get to the destination.</p></speech>

They would be able to get holidays and we would like to think there would be supports for them.  It would be part of a solution.</p> <p>  What model would Mr. Moran like to see for GP services?  Quite a few were mentioned, including different networks such as SouthDoc, TLC-Doc in my area, Caredoc, Shannondoc and so on.  They all seem to work with different structures.  Would GPs like to see the system restructured State-wide or along existing lines with greater uniformity?  Does the current system based on different approaches in different areas require greater clarity and uniformity of structure or are they happy with how it is developing?</p> <p>  On foreign doctors, it was mentioned that we are somewhat reliant on doctors from South Africa.  Doctors from South Africa were unable to travel during the pandemic.  There are different models in different areas.  What is Mr. Moran's view of the structure?</p></speech>

The co-ops grew up organically in each area, so they all have different systems.  What would be best would be to review the situation, including all the stakeholders and individual co-ops, and look at the GPs who are working in the co-ops and funding them for red-eye shifts and the HSE.  Everybody must look at this to ensure a better system is put in place for all the GPs working in the system.  That would I hope be less onerous both in terms of the number of shifts and the financial cost to the individual GP.  There is no easy solution to that.  All the stakeholders must come around the table to come up with a solution everybody would agree is pragmatic.  That would require a review, in consultation with all the different co-ops and the GPs working in them.</p></speech>

We could not do that without addressing the Gaeltacht issue separately and specifically because it would be an outstanding matter.  We need to undertake this process separately to identify what is appropriate for the same considerations but within the Gaeltacht areas.  This is very useful and is almost moving ahead of the single houses part of the rural housing guidelines.  The ultimate aim is to have an updated set of rural housing guidelines this year but also to have, in due course, a more specific set of guidance on Gaeltacht planning matters generally, which also extend beyond housing.</p></speech>

The issue with this is that we are subject to environmental assessment in that any document we prepare has to go through that process, and there is a consultation that goes with that.  If a full strategic environmental assessment is required, that is a slightly longer process, and to a certain extent we have to be advised and to take that advice on board.  We would also seek to engage in consultation, which again adds some time to the process.  It is important, however, given the widespread interest in and sensitivity of this issue.  Clearly, this issue is of great interest to many people in every local authority in the country.</p> <p>  The Gaeltacht matters can be dealt with probably more readily because it is a more confined area and is very well regulated in respect of the planning Acts, with very clear policies as to what should happen.  We have identified that what happens in the in-between, as it were, in the eight local authorities to which this refers needs a degree of co-ordination.  With agreement around language testing and other matters, we are advanced in this, having had discussions with colleagues in other Departments and in the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, as well as having initiated a steering group with the eight relevant local authorities.  We believe the Gaeltacht matters can be addressed more readily and without perhaps the significant requirements for environmental assessment that might apply more broadly.  I do not want to diminish the Gaeltacht as a subset but it is very much a more discrete element of the overall consideration of housing.  Given the progress and co-operation we have had, because there is a lot of very targeted interest from Gaeltacht areas, we believe this can be resolved more quickly.</p></speech>

These designations arise from a European perspective, they are European designations, and for that reason they require particular levels of assessment, protection and control.  That is part of the overall consideration of rural housing.</p> <p>  I am suggesting that Gaeltacht-specific matters can be resolved and will be almost ready to go when the rural housing guidelines themselves have been addressed.  We will find it very difficult to avoid environmental assessment of the guidelines because of the issues the Senator has mentioned and the fact that very often, clearly the most scenic areas would be places where people would very much like to live or to have a holiday home, but that is where the conflict can arise and there are sometimes pressures for development that just cannot be satisfied.  That is going to have to be very much part of the rural housing guidelines rather than tying that necessarily to Gaeltacht guidance, if the Senator understands what I mean.</p></speech>

Ideally, one would expect every local authority to be able to provide that service, but it is a reality that the planning service is under pressure across the board.  There are relatively small numbers of people in individual counties and it is quite difficult to attract and retain staff of any kind, never mind those who are qualified in planning and engineering and other skills, as well as being sufficiently fluent in Irish.  It is an issue we need to be practical about but at the same time we must meet the objective, which we believe we can do with this group.</p></speech>

In the three counties that have large Gaeltacht areas, Mayo, Donegal and Galway, more than three quarters of all houses built in the last ten years have been one-off houses.  That adds up to approximately 8,000 or 9,000 houses in those three counties alone.  That is not insignificant.  There is great demand near larger towns and cities and that has to be managed.  There is also the question of more scenic areas.  We often hear about the problematic cases, that is, those that are more borderline and difficult.  People are obviously very aggrieved if decisions do not go their way but permission is granted for approximately 88% of planning applications in Ireland.</p> <p>  There are absolutely quite significant problems and constraints in particular areas and there are issues to be addressed but we do have guidelines in place.  They are out of date - they are from 2005 - but they do exist.  The policy put forward in the national planning framework seeks to simplify and clarify those guidelines and to work with them.  It does not contradict or change them.  There are outstanding issues with Europe in respect of cases elsewhere, particularly cases involving family ties, a ground that is seen as problematic.  To comply with European legislation, we should really be relying on local social ties.  However, by and large, all local authorities have rural housing policies.  As we know, it is a long time since 2005 and there has been a drift in terms of what people have done.  Even looking at the eight local authorities that have Gaeltacht areas within their jurisdictions, there is quite a variance in what is considered local when building in one's home place.  It varies a lot.  We need to put in place an updated set of guidelines that offers a consistency in approach for comparable parts of the country.  That is what we are trying to do.  </p> <p>  The reality is that there have been many other urgent legislative needs in recent times.  We have seen the reform of the strategic housing development, SHD, legislation in respect of large-scale residential development.  We contributed significant elements to Housing for All that have materialised as legislation.  We are feeding into the Attorney General's review of the planning system.  We have prepared development plan guidelines, which had to be done as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

That process started last spring.  We are completing the recruitment process now.  We have more or less doubled the team of professional planners to be able to deliver on the objectives.  We cannot say for sure on what date it will be published but we have given a definite date by which we will prepare a document for the Minister of State that will start the ball rolling with regard to making a set of proposals to update everything, bring it all in line and give guidance.

Without getting into the specifics of the County Meath case, the bottom line is that given the need, target and objective to increase the number of people who speak Irish daily in Gaeltacht areas, it is probably fairer to say that it will be easier for people who comply with the language objectives to get planning permission in Gaeltacht areas.  The legislative provisions are actually quite strong.  Every development plan must include objectives to do with the promotion of Irish as a community language and that must follow through to how planning applications are dealt with.  There are very strong provisions that allow planning applications to be refused if they have the potential to affect the cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht.  It is also possible to put conditions on planning applications.  It is quite well regulated at the development stage of the process.  The matter the Deputy raised with regard to holiday homes or subsequent sale is more problematic.  Perhaps the solution does not lie solely with the planning system.  What can be done years after permission is granted, when people have lived in a property and whose lives have then changed, is very different.  That might have to be dealt with through other means.  That is worth exploring more broadly.  There are a number of different issues in play here.</p></speech>

We had a period of public consultation on those after that and have taken on board advice given to us.  That guidance will address many other things and all the mandatory objectives development plans are supposed to include, including those for the Gaeltacht.</p> <p>  Most local authorities are at various stages of their development plan processes and there is never a perfect time to bring out guidance, simply because the cycle goes on continuously.  It is open to all local authorities to vary their plan to take on board what they may be at odds with, if that is an issue.  By and large, they will not be in the vast majority of cases and a degree of transition is taken into account, where it may not have been possible to do that.</p> <p>  With regard to the point about native speakers and people from inside or outside particular areas, whatever guidance we offer more specifically on the Gaeltacht will have to be fair and apply equally.  We will take advice from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, as well, as to whether that matter could or should be addressed.</p> <p>  Broadly, in planning terms, it is difficult.  If one has a particular requirement for a public policy reason, which we would say here, I am not sure one can discriminate within that between different places of origin, if people comply with the spoken language requirement.</p> <p>  One of the problems has been there has not been a consistently agreed test.  That would be a real breakthrough for us in providing guidance, because there would be a standard to which all eight local authorities could seek to apply.  Certainly, looking at the eight different development plans now, there is no agreed test.  That would be significant development to move things forward for people and offer more certainty to those who wish to continue to live in Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  The target set for increasing the population of people who speak Irish on a daily basis in Gaeltacht areas is important because it gives a certain level of policy support to that objective for development plans.</p></speech>

Mura nd&eacute;anfaidh siad &eacute; sin sna m&iacute;onna amach romhainn agus an plean forbartha &aacute; chur le ch&eacute;ile, an bhfuil an Roinn chun teacht aniar agus ar th&oacute;ir orthu chun &eacute; sin a cheart&uacute;?</p></speech>

On the latter question, in positioning how the planning system will respond to the crisis of the Gaeltacht, as characterised by Deputy Connolly, there are two elements.  There is the process and the guidelines piece.  Where we can take effect immediately in the process are some of the matters that have been touched on by my colleagues and the Minister.  The language assessment and the planning referrals, in particular, are immediate interventions that are positive to the system and can improve and create a good evidence base and standardise the process across the eight local authorities.</p> <p>  The other piece is on the section 28 guidelines.  In our advanced drafting of that piece of work, there are two elements to that.  First are the rural housing guidelines, which the members will be aware are not exclusive to the eight local authorities and apply to about 28 or 29 local authorities throughout the country where there is a rural housing policy.  The second set of guidelines, the draft development planning guidelines referred to by Mr. Hogan, are almost near completion.  They are to guide the 31 local authorities in their development plan review process.</p> <p>  That takes me to the question about the local authorities where Gaeltacht areas are located.  One of the eight has completed its development plan review process, there is one that has not commenced it as of yet and is due to do so in May, and there are six currently under review.  The Deputy is absolutely right in the sense that the section 28 guidelines may not be available to those local authorities or may not be completed by the time they have completed their development plan review.  However, there are legislative mechanisms in place to address that through the variation process under section 13 of the Act.  As part of our engagement, through the working group, with those eight local authorities, we see that forum as being essential to address matters such as this in Gaeltacht areas.  While the elected members of a local authority can trigger or request a need for a variation, as part of our engagement we can influence and, with agreement and discussion with those eight local authorities, bring in changes.  The third piece of that series relates to the overall section 28 guidelines to which the Minister has committed specifically for the Gaeltacht.</p> <p>  This is a staged process with immediate interventions available to us now and with complex considerations to be brought into the section 28 guidelines.  We acknowledge that, across the rural housing guidelines, the development plan guidelines, and the Gaeltacht guidelines separately, a real synthesis and a balance must be struck around meeting the needs of the locals and the Gaeltacht communities for housing, education and other public services across the board.  We are committed to it on that front and committed to working with the local authorities.  This is the first time there has been a real concerted effort.  We are grateful to our colleagues in the Department with responsibility for an Ghaeltacht for working with us in that regard.  We will see this work continue throughout the year and after the finalisation of any section 28 guidelines to ensure these matters are addressed comprehensively.</p></speech>

The evaluation of development plans is now in the first instance a matter for the Office of the Planning Regulator.  It is empowered to look at every aspect of the Act with regard to what should be in a development plan.  That is one of the areas it could assess and if there are deficiencies or problems it would highlight that through the process.  Hopefully in most instances those sorts of things would be addressed within the process but if there is an outstanding issue at the end of the process it would then make a recommendation to the Minister, who is empowered to consider the matter and form a view as to what should be done next.  That is the process for development plans and that sets the tone or the scene for what happens thereafter.  One of the key things that better guidance can do is influence the sorts of things that would be said in a development plan about what should happen both for rural housing on one hand and, more specifically, for Gaeltacht areas on the other.  That is the position we want to get to with the working group we have set up.</p></speech>

It reflects a lot of what was raised and discussed already at the working group that was convened last May.  Some of the recommendations relate to seeking legal advice on the inurement clauses that are applied.  There is also a recommendation on the terms of reference.  On a point of clarification, terms of reference were circulated to the working group in May and were agreed at the inception meeting.</p><p>The members of the committee were provided with those in the Minister's circulated statement and so will have had sight of them.  We have read and reviewed those recommendations and they will feed into the work of the working group.  We agree with some of them and will certainly be taking them back to the working group.  There are many process-related issues but there is also a need to reflect on the debates held over the course of November and December and the questions raised here today.  It encompasses all of the planning process, policy and some of the other related service issues.  We hope to aggregate some of those into the correct stream, whether that is a section 28 guideline or something that can be directly addressed now within the process.  We will seek to do that as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh rud speisialta d&eacute;anta do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht.  M&aacute; t&aacute; fadhb leis an uisce n&oacute; go mbeadh an teach i flood plain n&oacute; mar sin de t&aacute; freagra againn mar gheall air sin ach ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; ruda&iacute; breise tugtha do dhaoine ag maireacht&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht. </p></speech>

Molaim an obair at&aacute; ar bun aige.  Go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an gcinneadh maidir le TEG mar d&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; sin an-difr&iacute;ocht go deo.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag l&eacute;amh an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an Aire agus l&eacute;im rud amh&aacute;in amach.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; seo ann roimh a am.  Deir an tAcht um Plean&aacute;il agus Forbairt, 2000 go gcaithfidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la sa Ghaeltacht a bheith bunaithe ar oidhreacht teangeola&iacute;ochta agus cult&uacute;rtha na Gaeltachta a chosaint, agus an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn san &aacute;ireamh.</p><p>B&rsquo;fhearr liomsa d&aacute; mbainf&iacute; an focal "cult&uacute;rtha" as an m&eacute;id sin mar n&iacute;l ciall leis agus baintear m&iacute;bhr&iacute; as istigh sna comhairl&iacute; contae.  Ceaptar go gcaithfidh an Ghaeilgeoir a bheith ag dul ag rinc&iacute; c&eacute;il&iacute; agus peil Ghaelach a imirt.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh cainteoir d&uacute;chasach rugba&iacute; a imirt - chuala m&eacute; ar maidin faoi chail&iacute;n at&aacute; ar fhoireann na h&Eacute;ireann anois - n&oacute; sp&eacute;is a bheith acu sa snagcheol.  N&iacute;l aon bhaint acu si&uacute;d leis an nGaeltacht.</p><p> M&aacute; th&eacute;im go dt&iacute; an Fhrainc, labhra&iacute;tear an Fhraincis ann sa chuid is m&oacute; de ach t&aacute; sp&eacute;is acu i ngach uile ruda&iacute;.  N&iacute; dh&eacute;arf&aacute; go mbaineann teanga na Fraince le cult&uacute;r faoi leith.  Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam go minic, leis an bhfocal &ldquo;cult&uacute;r&rdquo; ansin, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh duine as Cill Chainnigh a bheith c&aacute;ilithe mar go bhfuil cult&uacute;r faoi leith acu &oacute; thaobh na hiom&aacute;na&iacute;ochta de, mar a fuaireamar amach ag an deireadh seachtaine.  Mar a deirim, baintear m&iacute;bhr&iacute; as.  Mura mbeadh feidhm agus m&iacute;bhr&iacute; &aacute; bhaint as, ba chuma liom faoi.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag caint faoi ruda&iacute; teib&iacute; ach t&aacute;im ag r&aacute; go dtarraing&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo triobl&oacute;id.  B&rsquo;fhearr liom gurb &eacute; an tagairt a bheadh ann n&aacute; gur cheart c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la sa Ghaeltacht a eagr&uacute; ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht a choinne&aacute;il ina phobal labhartha Ghaeilge, mar is &eacute; sin go d&iacute;reach at&aacute; i gceist againn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo t&aacute;bhachtach mar go bhfuil an fhocla&iacute;ocht ch&eacute;anna istigh sna treoirl&iacute;nte agus is as sin a &eacute;ir&iacute;onn an m&iacute;thuiscint sna pleananna contae.  Baineann an rud seo ar fad le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga.</p><p> Is &eacute; an dara rud n&aacute; go bhfuil coimhlint&iacute; ann.  Luaitear istigh sa ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oidhreachta n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha.  Aonta&iacute;m go gcaithfimid iad a chosaint.  Luaitear an plean sp&aacute;s&uacute;il n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta n&oacute; an creat forbartha n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, mar a thugtar air anois.  T&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht leis sin ach nuair a scr&iacute;obhadh &eacute; sin, n&iacute;or tugadh aird ar riachtanais teangeola&iacute;ochta &aacute;irithe na Gaeltachta.</p><p> N&iacute;l a fhios agam ar smaoinigh an Roinn riamh ar na h&aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil na Gaeltachta&iacute; is l&aacute;idre sa t&iacute;r.  Ar ch&uacute;is stairi&uacute;il, is pobal scaipthe Gaeltachta, fi&uacute; le daonra dl&uacute;th i go leor c&aacute;sanna, at&aacute; i gceist ach n&iacute;l aon bhailte mar a thuigeann daoine &oacute;n bhfocal "bailte" sa ghn&aacute;thchomhth&eacute;acs.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; pobal ollmh&oacute;r thart ar an gCeathr&uacute; Rua ach go dt&iacute; le f&iacute;orghairid n&iacute; raibh aon bhaile ar an gCeathr&uacute; Rua seachas baile beag b&iacute;deach ina raibh scoileanna agus mar sin de ann - n&iacute; raibh aon lonna&iacute;ocht mh&oacute;r sa bhaile.  Is &eacute; sin an &aacute;it as a bhfuilimid ag teacht.  Mar a d&uacute;ramar sa ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is a r&eacute;it&iacute;omar taobh istigh d'Fhianna F&aacute;il - t&aacute; eolas maith ag an Aire air mar bhall d&rsquo;Fhianna F&aacute;il - ba cheart go mbeadh l&aacute;idreacht teanga sna Gaeltachta&iacute; ina ch&uacute;inse suntasach nuair a bh&iacute;tear ag d&eacute;anamh cinneadh faoi iarratais phlean&aacute;la do thithe aonair sa Ghaeltacht.</p><p> T&aacute; an f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; seo f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach soil&eacute;ir nuair a smaoin&iacute;tear ar dhaoine n&oacute; ar conas a dh&eacute;anann daoine cumars&aacute;id.  Is tr&iacute; labhairt lena ch&eacute;ile a dh&eacute;antar cumars&aacute;id.  C&eacute; leis a labhra&iacute;onn daoine ach leis na comharsana agus lena mhuintir f&eacute;in, nach ea?  M&aacute; ta gas&uacute;ir ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os, agus m&aacute; t&aacute; na comharsana agus a mhuintir f&eacute;in timpeall air agus m&aacute;s cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge iad ar fad, is m&oacute; seans i bhfad go leanfaidh siad leo ag labhairt Gaeilge.  M&aacute; th&oacute;gtar an teaghlach sin agus m&aacute; chuirtear iad in &aacute;iteanna eile gan a bheith gar do sheantuismitheoir&iacute; agus cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chasacha agus mar sin de, bristear an gr&eacute;as&aacute;n ansin ar mhaithe le hid&eacute;-eola&iacute;ocht &eacute;igin a bhaineann le p&aacute;tr&uacute;in tith&iacute;ochta bailte.  N&iacute;ltear ag tabhairt aon aird ar ph&aacute;tr&uacute;in teangeola&iacute;ochta at&aacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach anseo.  Mar sin d&rsquo;iarrfainn ar an Aire smaoineamh ar staid&eacute;ar a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gceangal idir an p&aacute;tr&uacute;n lonna&iacute;ochta agus aistri&uacute; na teanga &oacute; ghl&uacute;in go gl&uacute;in.</p><p> N&iacute;l mise ag r&aacute; nach bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; in am tr&aacute;th baile caighde&aacute;nach l&aacute;nGhaelach a bhun&uacute; agus go mbeadh east&aacute;it tith&iacute;ochta l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge i gceist.  N&iacute;l aon ch&uacute;is nach bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh ach caithfear &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh go mall r&eacute;idh agus na foins&iacute; teanga a choinne&aacute;il idir an d&aacute; linn agus gan an p&aacute;tr&uacute;n lonna&iacute;ochta at&aacute; ann i l&aacute;thair na huaire a scrios.  Nuair a dh&eacute;anfaidh an Roinn machnamh air, t&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go dtuigf&iacute; c&eacute; leis a labhra&iacute;onn daoine agus a bh&iacute;onn teagmh&aacute;il acu leo.  Feicim le mo chlann agus mo gharchlann f&eacute;in a th&aacute;bhachta&iacute; is at&aacute; s&eacute; go bhfuil deis ag an gclann agus ag an ngarchlann Gaeilge a labhairt lena mhuintir f&eacute;in agus teagmh&aacute;il lean&uacute;nach a bheith acu leo.  D&rsquo;iarrfainn mar chuid den chomhchoiste seo breathn&uacute; ar an gceist seo.  Is &eacute; sin an dara rud.  </p><p> Is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad rud, mar sin, breathn&uacute; ar an bhfocla&iacute;ocht at&aacute; san Acht nuair a bheidh Acht plean&aacute;la &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar&iacute;s.  N&iacute;l ann ach c&uacute;pla abairt ach s&iacute;lim go bhfh&eacute;adfadh an fhocla&iacute;ocht a bheith n&iacute;os fearr mar go bhfuil m&iacute;bhr&iacute; &aacute; bhaint as agus as na treoirl&iacute;nte.</p><p> Is &eacute; an dara rud n&aacute; breathn&uacute; go heisceacht&uacute;il ar an bpatr&uacute;n lonna&iacute;ochta Gaeltachta sna Gaeltachta&iacute; l&aacute;idre agus a r&aacute; go gcaithf&iacute; iad a chaomhn&uacute;,  M&aacute; fhaigheann an Ghaeilge b&aacute;s mar theanga pobail sa Ghaeltacht, beidh deireadh l&eacute;i mar theanga pobail mar n&iacute;l s&iacute; in &aacute;it eile ar domhan.  Caithfear &eacute; seo a l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il go f&iacute;orch&uacute;ramach mar t&aacute; s&eacute; s&aacute;ch leochaileach.</p><p> Is &eacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; rud a luafainn leis an Roinn gur fi&uacute; smaoineamh air n&aacute; rud a rith liom agus m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  Mar is eol don Aire mar pholaiteoir - n&iacute;l ach ceathrar f&aacute;gtha sa chruinni&uacute; anois - b&iacute;onn muid ag pl&eacute; le hiarratais plean&aacute;la agus tuigimid na constaic&iacute; at&aacute; ag an bpobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il d&uacute;chasach agus iad ag iarraidh ceadanna plean&aacute;la a fh&aacute;il.  An bhf&eacute;adfainn rud a mholadh don Roinn?  Is trua nach bhfuil baill thofa ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Is &eacute; ceann de na dearmaid mh&oacute;ra a rinneadh n&aacute; deireadh a chur leis sin.  In &eacute;agmais &eacute; sin, an bhf&eacute;adfainn a mholadh go gceapfa&iacute; roinnt comhairleoir&iacute; contae le Gaeilge &oacute;n nGaeltacht &ndash; caithfidh an Ghaeilge a bheith acu &ndash; ar an gcoiste comhairleach?  T&aacute; siad ag breathn&uacute; air seo &oacute;n talamh an&iacute;os, &oacute;n bpobal an&iacute;os agus &oacute;n gcaoi a fheiceann an pobal air mar go bhfuil siad ag pl&eacute; leis na fadhbanna plean&aacute;la.</p><p> T&aacute; moladh amh&aacute;in eile agam.  T&aacute;im ag iarraidh a bheith praitici&uacute;il.  T&aacute;im beagnach r&eacute;idh.  N&iacute; g&aacute; freagra cuimsitheach a thabhairt air seo.  T&aacute;im ag iarraidh roinnt tuairim&iacute; a spreagadh.  Creidim go mbeadh s&eacute; ina chuidi&uacute; m&oacute;r d&aacute; scr&iacute;obhfadh Teach an Chustaim - is &eacute; an tAire a scr&iacute;obhfadh mar n&iacute; f&eacute;idir le teach scr&iacute;obh &ndash; chuig na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la chun treoir a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh go gcaithfeadh na plean&aacute;laithe at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis na hiarratais ar an talamh sa Ghaeltacht a bheith in ann a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  I gConamara, mar shampla - is &iacute; Gaeltacht Chonamara an Ghaeltacht is m&oacute; sa t&iacute;r - t&aacute; daoine a thagann chugam ag na cruinnithe agus na clinic&iacute; nach labhra&iacute;onn aon Bh&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge ag na plean&aacute;laithe chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute;, ach is fadhb eile at&aacute; leis n&aacute; nach bhfuil an tuiscint ch&eacute;anna agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir-----</p></speech>

I had interpreted it and understood it to mean that the language was associated with the cultural heritage and patrimony.  It would be concerning if it was being extended into other facets in Gaeltacht areas because the primary and clear objective is linguistic.  That is understood and that is a good point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.893" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12022012600002#O01300"><p>I have seen this in practice and it is in the county plan in Galway.  There are three levels but it all comes from the Act.  I do not blame the planners because they follow the law.  Rather than testing if the family will be Irish speaking and evaluating that, they ask if one is in the GAA club or this or that club.  For example we have the polasa&iacute; neart&uacute; Gaeltachta in Galway so if an Irish speaking family comes to live in Cois Fharraige they can get planning; t&aacute; eisceacht ann.  How can they be in the club when they are not in the area yet and so on?  There is a meaning being taken out of this that to me gets away from the real thing we are trying to do, namely create Irish speaking communities.  Whether those people are interested in tiddlywinks, Gaelic football or hurling is immaterial.  As the director in the Roinn knows, my personal preferences might be for hurling and Gaelic football but that is not germane to the issue.  The issue is purely linguistic.  From my practical experience that word is open to misinterpretation so that is why I am suggesting that the Department clarify that issue once and for all.</p></speech>

On the national planning framework, there is a reference and policy objective on page 85 on the Gaeltacht and Gaeltacht language plans and supporting their implementation and ensuring it stays on the agenda for the planning system.  This is the opportunity to put more flesh on the bones of that and we just have not gotten to it until now.  Looking at where the language is strong and why that may be is an interesting suggestion, as well as looking at the settlement pattern that goes with that.  I did not fully understand whether the Deputy was advocating for a different form of settlement or replicating what is there but the Deputy mentioned the idea of a Gaeltacht town.  That is going a bit far but there are opportunities where there are water treatment services or land available.</p></speech>

I am saying it is possible that in the future you could have Gaeltacht urban areas.  However, we do not have any Gaeltacht urban areas so even the little towns in the Gaeltacht such as Dingle were English speaking for a fair way back.  The places where the language stayed stronger, even if they were heavily populated like Cois Fharraige always was, such as An Ceathr&uacute; Rua and Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n, for whatever reason were all dispersed communities.  There could be big and rapid compact developments but if you do that too quickly in the Gaeltacht you will destroy the language.  If you think of the linguistic reality and if you allow somebody to build on their family lands who is coming from an Irish speaking family then mam&oacute; and dad&oacute; are next door and the kids are running between the houses.  They are all Irish speakers so you have a great chance that the kids grow up with Irish.  If you take those parents out and put them into a town away from the sources of the language, the link is broken.  When we talk about maintaining the existing communities and their structures in the strong linguistic areas, there is a much better chance of getting it on to the next generation and I suggest that a study be done of this.  Bheadh a fhios ag Aodh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic faoi na ceantair &aacute;irithe.  It was interesting to listen to parents talk about their kids recently.  They said that when Leitir M&oacute;ir was playing in Galway they noticed the Irish the young teenagers had because the pattern has not been disrupted there.  The Gaeltacht is small and unique.  There is no other area anywhere in the world that is Irish speaking so it is this one or none.</p><p>It would be worthwhile having special rules, particularly looking at this issue, and if a special provision is required in the revised spatial strategy, it would be worthwhile doing do.  If I draw up a plan for the Gaeltacht, I would have no control over the planning system if Government policy were to come against me.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned and I know we discussed earlier - I am not sure if the Deputy was here - the need for planners to be able to deal with communities through Irish.  That is something we would agree with, but we explained that it is quite difficult within local government to secure and retain professional staff, in particular - planners, engineers, and people like that.  One of the ideas we had was that if it cannot be provided in one local authority, it should at least be provided on a shared service basis.  That would be working towards more local availability.  I know Dr. Aodh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic had further thoughts on that.  It is just a function of the availability of people right now.  Certainly in our scenario, we sought to prioritise someone who can speak Irish fluently.  As part of the expansion I mentioned earlier, we have taken on someone who can do that.  There probably are not a lot of people who are both qualified in planning and comfortable working professionally through Irish.</p></speech>

They are not a peasant people.  I live in the Gaeltacht; we are not a peasant people.  The level of education of Gaeltacht people matches that of anywhere in the country.</p></speech>

We are in a much wider context because of the difficulty across the board in securing planners for a whole range of things that are national objectives we need to do and looking, with the local government sector, at how we can broaden the base of recruitment for planners and looking at other areas and how people could be fast-tracked into training.  The suggestion is reasonable and can be taken on board.</p></speech>

We solved it very quickly.  We gave a number of scholarships to people to do masters and some of them went on to do PhDs in placenames.  Then we had a great supply of them - some who worked in placenames and branched out and others who are only just qualified in this, but who are authorities in this particular subject.  It is not rocket science to decide to give a few scholarships to people in town planning to do a postgraduate with a condition that they would be capable of doing their business through Irish.  It did not cost a fortune before.  It was actually very economical because they were given the equivalent of a science bursary if someone were to do a PhD or MSc in science.</p></speech>

Section 28(1) of the Planning and Development Regulations allows for any local authority to refer a planning application onward with regard to the impact on the linguistic heritage of the Gaeltacht area, as Dr. Mac Cormaic has said.  In practical terms, every single planning application could be referred.  The reason for the divergence might be found within the development plan policy in which linguistic impact statements and language assessments are not required for every single type of development.  In fact, they only apply to developments comprising a minimum of three units.  In that case, not every single application for a rural house would be referred to the &uacute;dar&aacute;s as one of the referral bodies.  Again, the &uacute;dar&aacute;s is also listed as a prescribed body in the regulations and so would receive all the material in respect of a development plan review or local area plan review.  With regard to the planning application system and daily run-of-the-mill planning business, such referrals are made at the discretion of the local authorities, which would normally rely upon their policies.</p></speech>

As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on its website following our meeting today.</p> <p>  Before I invite one of the witnesses to deliver the opening statement, I wish to explain some limitations with respect to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses today are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue the remarks.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House campus to participate in our public meeting today.</p><p> I ask members and witnesses to please identify themselves when contributing.  This is for the benefit of the Debates Office staff in preparing the Official Report.  I also ask everyone to mute their microphones when not contributing to avoid background noise and feedback.  When witnesses and members wish to contribute I ask that they use the raise hand facility.  I remind those joining today's meeting to switch off their mobile phones or put them into silent mode.</p><p> With the housekeeping out of the way, I ask whether Ms Doherty has been able to join the call.  As she has not, I ask Ms Forbes if she would like to take the opening statement.</p></speech>

This is my last year as chair of the RT&Eacute; board and perhaps prompted by this, I recently visited the RT&Eacute; 60 Years of Television exhibition at the National Photographic Archive.  There were many memories, many moments captured on stills camera and video.  One particularly poignant moment, from 1974, was of children picketing the gates of RT&Eacute; in protest at the decision to end the &ldquo;Wanderly Wagon&rdquo; programme.  It was a glimpse of a more innocent time but it highlighted for me the paradox RT&Eacute; has to deal with.  The only way it can make savings is to cut services or programmes but doing so brings upon it the wrath of the audience it is seeking to serve.  Happily, in 1974 the protesting children won the day and &ldquo;Wanderly Wagon&rdquo; continued for many a year.</p> <p>  It may have been a very different world in 1974 but even from when I was appointed to chair the RT&Eacute; board almost eight years ago, the world has become a dramatically different place, not only for RT&Eacute; as an organisation, but for the cultural identity of the nation.  It is a genuinely existential moment for the provision of public service broadcasting in Ireland.  This is the result of a critical confluence of factors, including, but not limited to, the emergence of the multiple content providers which we all know, for example, Apple, Sky and Amazon Prime; the relentless advance of social media into the personal lives of audiences across multiple levels and functions; the shift in advertising to highly targeted, data-driven platforms; the move from communal viewing and listening into niche narrow-casting to individuals and community interest groups; the rapid advance of multiple new technologies in the media space, which Douglas Rushkoff refers to as &ldquo;the acceleration of the acceleration&rdquo;; and the growth of political populism allied to a Wild West online environment in the provision of reliable information and analysis.</p> <p>  These profound shifts outline both the difficulties created for the national broadcaster and the increased importance of public service media at a time of unprecedented disruption.  We need a thorough national public debate on all of these issues, a debate that is rooted in the public interest and does not shy away from uncomfortable truths, including the matter of public funding for the State broadcaster and our broken licence fee system.</p> <p>  This is a subject that the members&rsquo; predecessors on this committee made very clear recommendations on in 2017.  The present model is resulting in huge losses, not only to RT&Eacute; but to the independent sector.  I have calculated these amount to be approximately &euro;500 million in the past decade and nowhere has that been felt more than in the independent sector.  I look forward to the publication of the report of The Future of Media Commission and, I hope, a clear plan for how the Government intends to implement its recommendations.  I very much hope this committee will play its part in helping secure a sustainable future for a high quality and diverse media in Ireland.</p> <p>  I have spent much of my working life in and around public service broadcasting in the most all-embracing sense of that term.  As chair of RT&Eacute;, I have always believed that a fully funded, independent public service media, operating as the hub of a vibrant creative industries network, is fundamental to democracy.  I am particularly mindful of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s role in the provision of high-quality news and current affairs, something that has been particularly evident in recent times.  I am proud to note the performance of RT&Eacute;, the RT&Eacute; executive and RT&Eacute; staff during that intense pandemic period.</p> <p>  However, we must remain alive to the dangers faced by public service broadcasting, PSB.  Just last month, Sir David Puttnam, once the digital champion for Ireland, resigned from the House of Lords citing this very issue as one of the reasons he had to make that decision.  He argued that the government had ignored his report into digital technologies, public service media and democracy.  He warned that political power was being &ldquo;ceded to a few unelected and unaccountable digital corporations&rdquo; and that a pandemic of misinformation and disinformation had taken hold.  He said: &ldquo;If allowed to flourish, these counterfeit truths will result in the collapse of public trust, and without trust democracy as we know it will simply decline into irrelevance.&rdquo; Indeed, this real and present threat was the very reason I called for a future media commission to be established and I am grateful the Government did so.</p> <p>  This is not a problem particular to RT&Eacute;.  Many European public service models have different levels of funding and not all of them are provided with the funding that is needed to sustain the necessary level of service.</p><p>During my term as chair, I have worked with two directors general and constantly changing board personnel under four different Ministers.  During this period, both RT&Eacute; and the board have had to realign, as have many other public bodies, to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance.<br/><br/><b></b>The focus on governance must be at the heart of the board's work and is critical in ensuring public and stakeholder confidence.  In the open forum of a board, occasions can arise where there is concern regarding the appropriateness of decisions that must be made.  On such occasions, a consensus has to emerge.  The emergence of this consensus can take time and careful negotiation, and I have consistently followed this protocol as chair.  The specific case the committee has asked about was no different in this regard.  Ultimately, however, each individual has to accept responsibility for the decisions he or she makes while the negotiated consensus is evolving.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that it is clear that RT&Eacute; takes its Irish language remit extremely seriously.  However, issues such as the Irish language and the RT&Eacute; strategy statement can no longer be addressed in isolation from the more nuanced understanding of the interconnected nature of this industry.  RT&Eacute;, at its best, can be the glue that binds the cultural well-being of the nation together.  It can be the prism through which we construct the idea of ourselves, and it is often the voice of Ireland for the global diaspora.<br/><br/>The creative industries that RT&Eacute; is at the centre of are at the forefront of a workplace upheaval, a revolution driven by a new understanding that if the first industrial revolution was driven by brawn and physical work and the second and third by brain and intellect, the fourth, in which we find ourselves, will be driven by an economy of the heart.  This is not some fanciful romantic notion but a conviction that the work we do should be grounded in what we believe in, bring fulfilment and make a sustained contribution to the common good.  All of us share the aspiration that RT&Eacute; should be at the heart of this new era by embracing a public service model that can become the template for the rest of Europe.<br/><br/>After eight years as chair of RT&Eacute; and public service media, my love and commitment for RT&Eacute; are matched only by my concern for its future.  Time is a commodity we no longer have.  I thank the members very much for listening.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her question.  She is right in the sense that we have a number of Irish language obligations.  We take them very seriously, as Ms Doherty pointed out.  In 2017, we were found to be in breach of some of our obligations and put in place a renewed plan to provide more content in the Irish language for the Comisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  It is a three-year report.  It comes to its end in March of this year.  We are now preparing the next report, in which we want to address current affairs.  At this moment, we provide "7 L&aacute;" for TG4.  The other content we provide is more a combination of factual and entertainment content.  We are addressing the current affairs aspect of that in our next three-year plan, which is coming in March.</p></speech>

We went through maternity pay, sick pay and holiday pay.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>reported that it had been made aware of specific examples of such cases.  If the Department of Social Protection dictates that RT&Eacute; must pay it a settlement for not paying employer PRSI it is obliged to pay, will RT&Eacute; ensure the employees or former employees are paid what they are entitled to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.968" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022012600002#C01600"><p>As I said last week, I refute the notion that we engaged in bogus employment practices.  RT&Eacute; has had many different relationships with employees and contractors over the years.  A confluence of factors, including changing laws, definitely caused a problem.  We are now in this process to really look at the legacy issues involved.  What I said last week was that we are very committed to working to find the right solution to this issue.  It is very complex.  We have the scope section of the Department of Social Protection and Revenue involved.  We have committed to our trade union group that we will collectively come to an agreement and work through the industrial relations process we have in place at RT&Eacute;.  We have a good track record in getting things done through that process, but we are not in a position at this point to say exactly what will be involved in that.  We need a little more time to work through the complexities of this to come to the ideal solution.</p></speech>

We know RT&Eacute; has already paid the Revenue Commissioners &euro;1.2 million.  We know that the Department of Social Protection is now coming after RT&Eacute; and that the net has been widened to include 500 workers.  Where the Department of Social Protection tells RT&Eacute; to settle for not paying the workers or the employer PRSI, would Ms Forbes not think it morally right to ensure the employees or former employees are paid what they are entitled to?  I am sure she could answer that on moral grounds.</p></speech>

There is a lot at play.  We want this to be a fair process.  That is the ultimate aim.  There are many elements to it.  Certainly, we will be endeavouring to work with the trade union group to come to a solution that is acceptable to everybody involved.</p></speech>

My fear is that, in two, three or four years, when RT&Eacute; will have made what could be multimillion euro settlements with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners or taxpayer as a result of its failings, it will not pay the workers what they are entitled to after having engaged with them.  I do not have any confidence given that Ms Forbes cannot even say from a moral perspective that the workers should be paid.  My fear is that, in ten years, the Committee of Public Accounts will be asking about large legal settlements and the then director general will tell the members not to worry because the settlements relate only to legacy issues, which is what we were told last week.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge that, during the Covid period, the news team in RT&Eacute; provided great public sector broadcasting in difficult circumstances.   We are consuming much more content at home.  I pay tribute to the work being done in the drama sector, which is provided by the independent production companies and RT&Eacute;.  It is also important to acknowledge the online school services during that period.</p> <p>  Curiously enough, during the lockdown period, I watched episodes of "Wanderly Wagon", which is on YouTube, with my nephews.  It was groundbreaking television and, while I do not call for its return, it is important that we tell those Irish stories for children. Children's television is important to encourage creativity.</p> <p>  The absence of the report of The Future of Media Commission before this discussion is a problem.  I hope the witnesses will agree to return to the committee to engage on the report once it has been published.  I will speculate to a certain extent.  One issue being considered concerns the future funding of RT&Eacute;.  In Australia and in other European countries, public sector broadcasting is funded directly from the Exchequer and the licence fee has been abolished.  What is the witnesses' view on that?  Do they believe RT&Eacute; should move to a publisher-broadcaster model?</p></speech>

I am not in favour of a publisher-broadcaster model for RT&Eacute;.  We need to enhance the output of RT&Eacute;, as well as with the independent sector.  Publisher-broadcasters in the past may not have held on to their audience as RT&Eacute; would and would want to do.  I would look more closely at the proposal this joint committee's predecessors made in 2017 on the model for collection of the licence fee.  It would provide certainty for RT&Eacute; and allow it to plan ahead.</p></speech>

We have moved into the digital space but a criticism here has concerned RT&Eacute; digital policy, its expenditure on digital and the frustrations most people felt when trying to use the RT&Eacute; Player.  Some of those are being addressed.  The RT&Eacute; Player is competing against Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon.  What improvements are being made to the player?  Can users get a better service?</p></speech>

This is important because RT&Eacute; has in the past been accused of always going with the begging bowl.  I was trying to think of a different analogy.  I thought that if you give people a fish, they will be fed for a day but if you give them a fishing rod, they will be able to fend for themselves.  RT&Eacute; has faced a decade of brutal cuts and the only way any organisation can grow and improve is through investment, not continual cuts.  It is difficult for me, although Ms Forbes may have a different view, to talk about specific key issues where RT&Eacute; is not delivering, for example, the RT&Eacute; player, not achieving the Irish language target twice and being unable to spend the statutory money provided for independent productions in one year but making it up in the next year.  Those are all about resources and certainty of funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.993" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022012600002#D02200"><p>We have seen incredible growth in the RT&Eacute; Player.  Streams in 2020 were up 35% on the previous year.  That was driven by the pandemic and people having a voracious appetite for every sort of content.  The player has grown significantly in the last two years in terms of usage and people viewing it.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Disney, Amazon, etc.  There are a couple of fundamental differences between what they provide and what we provide.  First, the Senator knows the scale and resources of those multinational giants.  The other big difference is what they do in terms of on-demand viewing versus live.  RT&Eacute;, being a national broadcaster, has a large amount of live output.  This can also be watched through the player.  We have spent a lot of time and resources improving the delivery performance of our live content and that held up incredibly well through Euro 2020 when we - I will use my head of technology expression - almost broke the Internet with huge concurrent streams watching that event.  There is room for improvement and we are not complacent.  However, as Ms Doherty said, we have to match the moneys we have with what we can do.  Further investment is required and, pending an outcome on funding, it is top of our agenda.</p></speech>

We are now considering the introduction of a content levy on some of the streaming services.  RT&Eacute; is happy with that proposal.  What model would Ms Forbes favour?</p></speech>

While there are amendments to propose and detailed work to do, the point about the levy is important.  There are companies coming into this jurisdiction, if you like, and not creating content for this jurisdiction.  Other countries, as the Senator knows, have brought in this levy.  We have done work as a combined industry, with Screen Ireland, TG4 and Screen Producers Ireland, to say we need a levy like this because it would create some much-needed funding for Irish programming.  We support that.</p></speech>

There is a lot of great innovation happening around content and the Irish language.  As Ms Doherty mentioned, it must be looked at in the round.  We must consider what we can do versus what we have to spend.  We are committed to doing as much as we can.  2FM also has a chart show as Gaeilge.

That has been the case for many years.  In light of changes in legislation, we are looking at that.  The vast majority of people want to retire at that age and, of course, we facilitate that.  As I said, there is work to do on the issue.  We watch the relevant legislation carefully in that regard.</p> <p>  As regards staff numbers, the Senator will see in some of the briefing documents we sent the committee that we have been on a constant process of staff reduction over many years.  In fact, staff numbers are now 21% lower than they were in 2008.</p></speech>

I will move on to some of the slightly more controversial issues on which the committee has written to and engaged with RT&Eacute;.  There is the question of the party that took place.  That issue was raised at this committee.  I want assurances that there was learning from that.  I will also make a comment arising from a matter Ms Doherty raised relating to governance.  We also take governance very seriously.  The principle to which we hold, and without getting into a debate on the matter, is that this committee and the Minister recommend the names of members of the RT&Eacute; authority.  We were slightly concerned about the events that happened in that regard.  The principle must be accepted that it is these Houses that make the decision on who sits on the RT&Eacute; authority, rather than the authority itself.</p></speech>

Of course there is huge regret over the way the recent appointments emerged and turned out.  However, when new appointees come on to the board, as four did recently, we welcome them graciously.  We had already signalled a concern around corporate governance, principles, ethics and morals and how we would manage them.  We set up and put in place a comprehensive system to allow us to welcome all four board members and ensure we could run the board as the committee and audience would wish.  All four members were warmly greeted and given time to express what they wanted to bring to the board.  It was interesting and exciting.  Unfortunately, there were issues around Covid-19 on the same day.  We have a system in place whereby the RT&Eacute; executive brings forward a contract for either capital spend or content spend that is over a certain amount.  This is good financial control and a good system for the board.  We never get to see any of the independent stuff.</p></speech>

It is not the case at all.  Let me just explain one point that I think is very important.  I tried to navigate and negotiate this.  The person concerned recused himself.  We had a discussion.  Such was the commercial nature of the individual's relationship with RT&Eacute; and such was the vast sum of funding the board was being asked to give to another board member that my colleagues on the board could not reach a consensus.  I asked for some time on the issue and that was agreed to.  I got some time but, unfortunately, that time was then taken away from me because the individual chose to resign even though I asked him not to.  It is important for that background to be understood.  This was at no point a challenge to any system that the committee has in place.  We regard it highly.  However, I could not get consensus at board level.</p></speech>

Having said that, I apologised at the time it happened.  We reflected on what happened and carried out an internal health and safety review.  It is fair to say the incident was not at all reflective of how we conducted ourselves during the pandemic.  I agree that it should not have happened but we learned from it and moved on.  That is important.  We also co-operated fully with the Garda investigation at the time.</p></speech>

I want to get the good news out of the way.  It is not possible in broadcasting to please all the people all the time.  Most of the time, the feedback I hear from members of the public about the role RT&Eacute; plays is generally positive.  There is some great content out there.  There is not enough Irish content but the job that is done by everyone at the national broadcaster at every level is generally considered to be positive.</p> <p>  That said, there are areas that need to be improved.  RT&Eacute; needs to read the room about the licence fee at the moment.  This is not a time to be going to people and looking for extra money.  In a way, RT&Eacute; needs to earn that money and prove that a fee increase would be worthy and the right thing to do.</p><p> I am sorry to keep going back to this issue but last year, we were in contact with RT&Eacute; about the new year celebrations in 2020 going into 2021.  In 2021 going into 2022, we had an awful debacle with the new year television celebration.  What has RT&Eacute; got against New Year's Eve?  Last year, it got the tone wrong and this year it managed to get the time wrong.  It has one job on New Year's Eve, which is the ten-second countdown.  I would say that CNN was welcoming in the new year before RT&Eacute; this year, it was so far behind.  Simple things like that resonate with people if they are not done right.  Then, a few weeks later, RT&Eacute; comes along seeking an increase in the licence fee.  The two do not wash.</p><p> Will RT&Eacute; look at the new year celebrations next year and try to get them right, once and for all?  What we have seen in the past couple of years was insulting to people.  There was a difficult Christmas and new year period for many people who were at home.  There was huge viewership.  One would have thought that more effort would go into getting the programming right.  I will not go any further into what we got.  We know what it was and it was not good enough.</p><p> Regarding the Irish language, a reference was made to more money.  Why are Irish language programmes always the additional extra if there is more money?  Why do we not seem to be getting Irish language programmes when other areas are not sacrificed?  That is what I am picking up from the conversation here and from earlier comments.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that?</p><p> Regarding children's programmes, I grew up in an era which, in hindsight, may have been a golden era of Irish content.  We have seen a significant fall-off in that in recent years.  Culturally, that is important.  The one great hope that we had in recent times was the return of "The Den".  For some reason, that programme did not come back in 2021, although we understood that it would.  Why did it not come back in 2021?  In 2020, it was one of the most positive developments across the board in RT&Eacute;, yet autumn 2021 came and "The Den" did not return.  Will the witnesses explain that?  I have not been able to find out definitively what happened there.  It was a huge mistake.  It was one of the most positive developments we have seen in children's television programming.  It is not just for children, but also for the big kids among us who really enjoy it too.</p></speech>

I will try to take them in the order that he asked them.  I must make clear that we are not asking for a licence fee increase.  We are asking for the licence fee system that underpins public service broadcasting to be reformed.  Some &euro;65 million is going uncollected each year.  That is through a combination of evasion, with people simply not paying a fee, and a growing tranche of people, currently 15%, claiming not to have a television.  Through a loophole in the Broadcasting Act, if people watch RT&Eacute; on their computers at home, they do not have to pay for a licence.  We are saying that much money is being lost in the system.  We are not asking for more.  We are asking for the system underpinning this to be reformed.  There is ample money to meet the needs and address some of the areas the Deputy spoke about.</p> <p>  Irish language content is just one of many areas that have been undernourished in the last years.  We have had to make sacrifices in every single area.  Ten years ago, we were spending &euro;80 million in the independent sector and we are now spending &euro;40 million.  Every single genre of activity, whether drama, culture or children's programming, has had programming reduced because we are operating with &euro;100 million less in the last ten years.  That is the reality.  We cannot continue to do more with less money.  We are trying to do the best that we can with the resources that we have.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point on children is well made.  Like the Deputy, I grew up in that golden age of television.  I had one channel for most of my life and then a second one came along.  Kids today have an explosion of content.  We compete every day with Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, which are global giants.  Having said that, we have a strong, uniquely Irish kids' offering.  We have a lot of children's content in the Irish language.  We are working with local animation companies to ensure we are supporting the industry for kids.</p> <p>  The issue here is that children are not watching traditional television.  For many years, we have seen a move to an online world.  We are on YouTube and we are increasing our presence in that space.  Anybody who has kids knows that they want to see what they want when they want to, and they will not wait for a linear schedule.  There is a lot going on here but do not think for a second that Irish language programming is the only area that is underfunded.  There are many, given the situation that we are in.</p></speech>

I remember it from the first time around.  As the Deputy said, it fulfilled a fantastic role during the pandemic.  We keep these matters under constant review.  "The Den" fulfilled a particular role.  We have stood it down for now.  That is not to say that it might not come back again.  We are evolving all the time.  Different programme ideas work for different times.  I recognise the value the programme had.  It certainly brought nostalgia back to the fore.  As the Deputy said, children and parents enjoyed it.</p></speech>

We all grew up in a certain area.  There are programmes that we prefer to others.  We do not always agree.  That tension will always exist between public service media and the audience.  Going back, the bigger picture is that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which is the regulatory body set up by the Government, recommended an increase of &euro;30 million a year for RT&Eacute;.  The previous committee recommended in 2017 that there should be a change in the licence fee.  If that umbrella overview is sorted now, we can make the programmes that everybody wants.</p></speech>

The number of parents who contacted me on behalf of their children was not insignificant.  It is important to make that point.  I know it is funny but, at the same time, there is a serious point too, which I would like to be taken on board.</p> <p>  New Year's Eve is a night when many people are at home and will look for Irish content.  Many will look to RT&Eacute; television.  Are the witnesses looking at plans for this year?</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, this year was very difficult.  It was a difficult year here too.  Many things that were supposed to happen on New Year's Eve did not happen, including the annual fireworks and the big bang moment at 12 midnight.  There was meant to be a huge concert in Dublin Castle, which had to be cancelled because of Covid.  There is no doubt we were dealing with incredibly difficult circumstances.

I am conscious the committee is focusing on the points that have been highlighted but, with the indulgence of the Chairman, I will circle onto the issue of bogus self-employment.  Will RT&Eacute; be carrying out a review of why this practice was allowed to continue for so long?  Obviously, it is very expensive and will be a significant cost to the State.  I refer to the issue of women who have lost out on maternity pay, carer's benefit and so on.  There is a gender dimension to this.  Will there be an internal review of why this practice was allowed to continue for so long?</p> <p>  On board recruitment, is it an issue that there is no board member with trade union or industrial relations experience on the-----</p></speech>

I mentioned to a previous speaker that the nature of broadcasting employment, and the media generally, is a combination of many contracts on an ongoing basis, such as part-time contracts and so on.  It was flagged to me when I came in that we needed to look at this whole area.  At that point, we immediately engaged a review of contractors and very quickly put in place a change to our policy of employment, first on a go-forward basis.  We have done the review.  A combination of time, legacy and changes in employment practice got us to where we are.  I am now confident that we are on the right footing.  We have put the employment-first practice in place and are determined to work with the various bodies with which we are working to get this to a good conclusion.</p></speech>

Currently, that representative is Mr. Robert Shortt, who has an economic background.  He is a terrific representative for the RT&Eacute; staff.  I refer to the modelling of other European broadcasting stations and the sheer volume of staff they employ.  We have come out of a period of extreme economic upheaval and there is a serious threat in the jobs market but we have a duty of care in employment to those who are employed in RT&Eacute; and this balance is almost impossible to achieve in an atmosphere where an organisation is constantly being threatened and funding is not available to meet the fundamental costs.</p></speech>

All present agree on how important a national independent broadcaster is for democracy.  I say "Well done" to them on their efforts in the past two years.</p> <p>  I have two questions on the Irish language.  Is RT&Eacute; willing to make more sports commentary available in Irish?  I am referring to sports other than Gaelic games, such as international soccer or rugby matches.  Ms Forbes referred to this digital offerings in her opening statement.  Is there a reason digital offerings are not included in commitments of Irish language hours?</p> <p>  How much do the highest earners cost?  For what percentage of the overall budget does that account?</p> <p>  Ms Forbes stated at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that RT&Eacute; is considering a blended model where free-to-air services would be supplemented by paid services to which viewers could subscribe.  I ask her to provide an example of that or more details on the idea.

What is the success rate of An Post in that regard?</p></speech>

I will deal with them in reverse order.  The relationship with An Post is between it and the Department.  We have no role in that relationship.  An Post is commissioned by the Department, so the Deputy's question is more for the Department.</p> <p>  As regards the blended model, I was referring to the idea, in the area of sports in particular, of having rights whereby there could be a subscription model as well as a free model. For example, GAAGO is a venture we have with the GAA whereby people in territories outside Ireland can watch Gaelic games coverage for a subscription fee.  If is fulfilling a need, if one likes, outside the territory.  Another area is that this year we announced the launch of an over-the-top subscription service with the United Rugby Championship, URC.  We were able to work with it to ensure a combination of free-to-air matches and over-the-top matches were available.  This is becoming popular in the sports arena in particular because it allows us to ensure there is a free-to-air model.  In the case of the URC, all of the Irish provinces' matches in Ireland will be on TG4 or RT&Eacute;.  Those outside the jurisdiction will be able to subscribe to get those matches, but also other matches, importantly.  That is what that model is.  It is something that we started with the GAA and are now doing with URC TV.  We may seek to pursue it with other providers.  It is an interesting model to combine free and paid access while ensuring that citizens of Ireland are getting the coverage for free.</p> <p>  As regards Irish language commentary on other sports, the work we are doing with TG4 in this space is interesting because TG4 has the rights for the URC as Gaeilge and we have the rights in the English language.  I hope that, in time, there may be more like this.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to high earners.  The top ten, as such, account for just under 1% of our total cost base.  That number has been reducing over time.  The top ten earners now account for almost 40% less than in 2008.  In fact, in 2019 I committed to it being reduced by 15% and that has been achieved.  It is something we are keeping under review.  I know it can be of interest to many people.  I recognise that but I also stress that these presenters are very much in line with other presenters in the open market and, in addition, they have a dual role for us, if one likes.  They are providing a public service but they also allow us to optimise commercial income, which is, as the Deputy is aware, a very important part of our income base, accounting for more than 40% at the moment.</p></speech>

In fact, it is quite the opposite.  Any increase in the licence fee would be totally unfair to those who are paying it.  We are saying the failure of the collection system, which is a combination of people evading payment of the fee along with the people who are claiming not to have a television, is bleeding &euro;65 million.  If that money was collected, there would be ample money in the current system to discuss the funds we are looking for or that the BAI recommended we should get some years ago.  We are not saying the licence fee should be increased.  We are saying the system should be reformed to avail of that bucket of money that should be available to the wider sector.  That would not only be to RT&Eacute;, which gets the fast majority of the licence fee revenue, but a big percentage goes into the BAI sound and vision fund to which broadcasters and radio projects can apply for funding for more content.  It is a very important generator of Irish content.  If the system was reformed, there would be money in the system with which to do other things.  That is the point.  We are not looking for an increase in the fee.</p></speech>

It is very much valued.</p> <p>Given that Deputy Griffin was calling for "The Den" to be brought back, I call on Ms Forbes to ensure "Radharc" would be brought back.  A good friend of mine, Fr. Bob McCabe from Navan - mass is often broadcast from Navan and we provide a service at 10.30 a.m. on RT&Eacute; News Now - told me many elderly people would love to see old episodes of "Radharc", a much loved programme, re-broadcast on RTE News Now in the afternoon.  Ms Forbes might take that on board.</p> <p>  Ms Forbes mentioned GAAGO and my ears pricked up when she spoke about the fees charged for the external purchase of such games.  It is great for the diaspora to be able to avail of that.   Ms Forbes is looking at her financial models in the context of The Future of Media Commission report.  I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne that it is regrettable it is still not published.  It has been on the Minister's desk since 16 October.  It is a disgrace we have not yet got that report.  It has been leaked to be damned in any event.  RT&Eacute; is competing with Sky Sports in the context of the GAA.  Does Ms Forbes ever envisage pay per view events would be considered by RT&Eacute; in its financial funding models given it is competing against Sky Sports now for those games? </p></speech>

We are fighting constantly with rights' increases.  In recent months we have come together with other broadcasters to ensure we can keep as much content free to air as possible.  The notion of public service broadcasting is to provide the best Irish content to the audience.  To do that for the United Rugby Championship, URC, we came together with TG4.  We share the matches and on top of that there is the URC TV player.  Also, we announced just last week that to ensure the Six Nations remained free to air, we and Virgin Media have come together to ensure that happens.  That was extremely important for ourselves and Virgin Media but, most important, for the Irish people.  That is a model to try to keep the sports free to air.</p></speech>

However, the price of these events is quite substantial.  Ms Forbes is categorically saying that to be able to secure events she would not anticipate ever putting any such games on a pay per view platform on RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>

The Future of Media Commission report is likely to kick that back to Ms Forbes in terms of finding those gaps in funding, notwithstanding the &euro;65 million.  Is that something that has been countenanced by RT&Eacute;'s  financial controller on the basis that these events cost an awful lot of money and we are competing against pay per view platforms?  A television licence fee costs &euro;160.  My Sky basic package subscription costs me more over &euro;1,000 per year.  If I want to watch a big sports event on Sky, I will pay &euro;29.95 to view it on top of my subscription.  Has consideration of having a pay per view model for sports events domestically in Ireland ever been on RT&Eacute;'s financial controller's desk?</p></speech>

The Sky deal on the GAA ran from 2017 to 2022.  That deal was criticised and the GAA was heavily criticised.  The GAA has a financial model it has to fulfil.  Politicians like to get up and kick the GAA in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and at this committee.  Is that a scenario whereby RT&Eacute; could work with Virgin Media, which has previously had the GAA rights, and squeeze Sky off the pitch to secure complete free to air for GAA domestic games in Ireland?</p></speech>

Returning to the financial situation, Ms Forbes mentioned the evasion of the licence fee.  I discussed that with her at the Committee of Public Accounts previously and with respect to a petition some five years ago but nothing has happened since.  This committee previously reported on two key proposals, one, to get Revenue to collect the fee in order that we would get the &euro;65 million into the system and, two, to have a flat broadcasting charge, regardless of the people who say they do not have a television yet they have a plasma screen stuck on the wall.  In terms of grappling with this issue, this committee's recommendations is the closest we have come to doing so.   We have seen from the leaked extracts from The Future of Media Commission report that it is proposed to abolish the licence fee.  Does Ms Forbes support that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1058" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022012600002#H02200"><p>It is important to say we put forward in our submission the recommendation all the members made in 2017.  When asked, we would favour the idea of a household charge collected by Revenue, as the committee's report indicated many years ago.  The discussion of the funding is not for me or anybody on this call to decide; it is ultimately a matter for the regulator.  This is why the creation of a new regulator, that is the media commission, which is proposed in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, is also fundamental to this process.  It is not for any of us here to decide.  There are numerous models that have worked for many countries.  Italy is a great example of that.  It moved from a chronic evasion space to bringing in a charge, which was linked to the electricity bill.  The compliance level was at such a level that they reduced the overall amount of the charge.</p><p>There were many models.  The model to which the Senator referred to in terms of abolishing the licence fee and going to a tax-based system works fantastically well in the Nordic countries, for example, but the crucial thing here is that whatever happens-----</p></speech>

It is a discussion because, ultimately, the &euro;500 million that has been lost over the past number of years has impacted on what programming can be done with what was coming back to RT&Eacute; and what it would be required to raise from a commercial point of view.  That is why I was going with my line of questioning on what other financial models Ms Forbes has countenanced, because if RT&Eacute; has to compete on an international basis, be it the Olympics or whatever, she is considering pay-per-view models in order to be able to buy these things, because it has a huge impact on what RT&Eacute; can provide in its programming.  With regard to the abolition, is Ms Forbe's preferred model to keep with the TV licence fee?  I am looking at the submission she sent into us which she has headlined as saying it is no longer fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I am talking about a court case in the public domain.  RT&Eacute; has not changed the policy.  With two ladies at the helm - and I wish them well and have no animosity towards them - I am surprised that this policy has not changed.  People are getting emails nine months before they are due to retire to tell them that the date is coming.  Ms Forbes has said she would engage with everyone.  That is not an answer.  We know of certain deals with some of the male presenters, whose names I will not mention, who are there at 66 or 69.  It seems very strange that in the present climate, RT&Eacute; cannot make right what was found to be wrong by the courts.</p> <p>  The same goes back to the situation with paying Revenue.  While RT&Eacute; outright denies there are any strange practices going on in terms of subcontractors or whatever, will there be huge social welfare bills?</p> <p>  Gaeilge, &aacute;r dteanga, is certainly not the only area to feel cuts.  Does Ms Forbes work with Foras na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge or Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the people who try to promote our language and culture?  Does she engage with them?  I received considerable complaints about the content this Christmas and I will not even go into new year's debacle.  There are problems and it is just not good enough.</p> <p>  I disagree with some of my colleagues about the coverage of the pandemic.  What type of funding has the Government paid in advertising to RT&Eacute;?  There was no balance and it instilled fear into our elderly population, in particular, who have RT&Eacute;, do not use other channels and pay the licence fee.  I am deeply critical of and have many more questions about that, because it frightened the life out of people and went totally over the top.  Nobody with a different narrative was allowed near the place or inside the front gate.  RT&Eacute; did not cover protests that were held and gave suspect numbers of figures of those who attended them.</p></speech>

We do.  We have a great relationship with Comhaltas.  We work with it on covering the fleadh every year and there is an ongoing, strong relationship, as there is with all of the Irish language bodies.  We are committed to doing more in this area, but it is a challenge.</p> <p>  The advertisers decide where they want to advertise and at what weight.  It has nothing to do with us in terms of any advertiser, be it Government or not.  That was a decision taken by the agency that works for the Government to place advertising around messaging and information, etc.  That was a feature of the pandemic and it is worth saying that advertising during the pandemic, especially in the early days, was significantly challenged.  We and every other broadcaster and media outlet saw massive reductions in advertising.  It was a challenging time for anybody relying on advertising given the economic state of the country, but that has nothing to do with us.  Whoever the advertiser is decides where they advertise and what the message is.  Provided the message is legal and complies with the codes, we take that advertising.</p></speech>

I will be able to ask parliamentary questions to ascertain that, but it was unfair, unbalanced and the one narrative, with nothing or nobody else involved.  Ms Forbes is not answering the questions, but I cannot make her do so.  I am very unhappy.</p> <p>  With regard to coverage of the fleadh, it is a wonderful event.  I go to most of them.  My family takes part in them and we have sadly missed them for the past couple of years.  Why would RT&Eacute; not cover that?  I am not talking about engaging with ways RT&Eacute; could nurture the language.  It is bound to be in breach through the content it has provided.  What is it doing, meaningfully, to correct that?</p></speech>

Every five years that is addressed and as part of that process, RT&Eacute; goes out to talk to its audience and ask it what it thinks of RT&Eacute;; what it wants and whether it likes RT&Eacute; and trusts it.  Let us talk about some statistics.  For 2020, of the audiences who are committed to RT&Eacute; and watch it said, 89% said it was important that RT&Eacute; produced a mix of programmes and content.  Some 89% agreed audiences should have access to a broad range of high-quality content.</p><p>Some 92% say it is important to provide coverage of events of national interest across cultural, sport, politics and other areas and 87% also say that it is important that RT&Eacute; provides archive material documenting the heritage and everyday life in Ireland, which should be accessible in all formats.  Earlier, a Senator mentioned "Radharc".  I was totally committed to "Radharc" programming.  There is a vast swathe of hours of wonderful television.  During my time on this board, because the archives were in a perilous state we put some capital expenditure into protecting and upgrading them.  Those archives will be made available free of charge to everybody around the country.  We may or may not like a particular programme or think there is not enough of something, but all of those things can be addressed.  We do address them regularly with our public.  My ask of this committee is that it tell us what type of public service media it wants and, when The Future of Media Commission statement is made, to tell us how it will respond.  If we believe, as has been stated, it will come out as revenue, how will this committee respond?</p></speech>

We are obliged to consult with the public.  It was done by an independent research company on our behalf.  Almost 10,000 members of the public engaged with us.  It was one of the biggest engagements ever in a public consultation.  The numbers referenced by Ms Doherty are robust.  They highlighted what is important to the people of Ireland and what they want from their public service media.  We are in a process with the board.  Hopefully, pending the publication of The Future of Media Commission report we will then be publishing our next public service statement based on that.  That is about outlining the principles and activities that we need to undertake on behalf of the Irish people to ensure that we are fulfilling our remit.</p></speech>

In her opening statement Ms Doherty said that she was one those who called for The Future of Media Commission.  Is it frustrating to her or Ms Forbes that we have yet to see the publication of the report of The Future of Media Commission?  The commission's inaugural meeting was on 29 October 2020 and it was required to report within nine months, which brought us to 29 July 2021.  Come this Saturday, it will be, at least, six months' since the Minister received the report of The Future of Media Commission.  Is that frustrating for Ms Doherty and Ms Forbes?</p></speech>

I do not know where they are coming from.  A Government party Senator who spoke here earlier criticised those leaks.  It appears we have a three party Government running in three different directions.  A considerable amount of public moneys was allocated to that commission.  It cost &euro;420,000 to set up that commission to produce a report.  I call on the Minister to publish The Future of Media Commission report.</p> <p>  I commend RT&Eacute; on working with others in the industry on drama and sport and with Virgin Media television to ensure that sport remains free-to-air.  On the RT&Eacute; player, I am one of the people who combines subscription services with the RT&Eacute; player through the Apple television box.  Following on from the Committee of Public Accounts hearings last week, how much funding will be required to bring the RT&Eacute; player to a world class place?  I acknowledge the difficulties around live television streaming online, but how much will be required to bring RT&Eacute; play to world class place?</p></speech>

It is something that we have been looking at over the past number of years.  We have made progress.  We are competing with very heavily funded global players in this space.  In the submission to The Future of Media Commission, we made it very clear that capital investment is something that this organisation has been starved of in that we have been in a constant downward funding cycle.  The current ways and means of watching, listening, etc. have changed so much that we have to be at the table in this space.  Our capital expenditure is &euro;7.5 million for the entire organisation.  It needs to be significantly more than that.  That is something that we have addressed and are continually addressing.  We have made some provision in the future for some of this but if funding does not come our way then this cannot come to a place where it an be up there in that world class space.</p></speech>

I have never had the opportunity to ask questions about 2rn or Saorview so this may just be an opportunity for me to make a comment if the witnesses cannot come on it.  Some 10% of television households receive services through Saorview.  With the exception of RT&Eacute;, all channels are standard definition on Saorview.  We moved to a digital terrestrial television service so that we could have more choice for viewers and, also, HD services.  In the past, ComReg has commented about 2rn and RT&Eacute; having the ability to engage in exploitative and exclusionary behaviours in terms of digital terrestrial television.  Is it good enough that for 10% of television households most of their channels are in standard definition and for it to be so difficult for the likes of TG4 to have Nuacht TG4 as a standalone channel and, eventually, C&uacute;la4 as a standalone channel on digital terrestrial television?  Is that acceptable to RT&Eacute;?  Is there anything that can be done to improve the situation?  While I am talking about the RT&Eacute; player, linear broadcasting will be around for at least ten years.  Can we improve that situation for 10% of television households such that they can have high definition?  For example, if one watches Leaders' Questions on RT&Eacute;, it will be in HD, but if one switches over to the Oireachtas television channel it will be in standard definition.  I know which one I would go to.  Is that an acceptable situation?  Is there anything that can be done to improve that for so many television households?</p></speech>

I am happy to provide a great deal more information on this.  The Senator is correct that RT&Eacute; is obliged to entertain conversations on this with every broadcaster and we do.  The Senator may have be aware that Sky News has recently come on to Saorview, which means we now have RT&Eacute;, TG4, Virgin and Sky News.  The model is a regulated tariff model.  We do not set the price.  It is regulated.  Part of the problem here is that we are a small jurisdiction and transmission costs are expensive.  The more people that come on to the service, the less it will cost every other party.  That is the challenge here.  We do not, nor would we ever, prevent anybody coming onto the platform.  It always boils down to economics.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  As I said, I am happy to provide further information on all of this if the committee would like me to do so.  </p></speech>

As others have said, it is disappointing the Future of Media Commission report has not been published for us to speak about here today.</p> <p>  The witnesses sent documentation on the appointment of board members, which is in the brief for today.  To be honest, I was extremely frustrated and disappointed with what happened last year when there was a nomination by the working group fully endorsed by this committee, which represents licence holders and the taxpayer.  The views of this committee should have been taken on board and adhered to.  It was frustrating that even when we sent correspondence to RT&Eacute;, we did not receive return correspondence for the following meeting.  We had to send correspondence again, including about the party that took place.  It is very disappointing when this committee represents the taxpayer, which funds the running of RT&Eacute;.  It is a remit of the committee to make such recommendations and they should have been taken on board.  There should not be a position where a person nominated by this committee and who was extremely experienced in television felt he had to resign after the first meeting.</p> <p>  Many topics have been discussed over the past hour and a half and I will touch on a few of those.  I compliment RT&Eacute; on its sport coverage, particularly its coverage of many minority sports.  We have free-to-air GAA etc. but it has been mentioned by others that one must pay approximately &euro;29.95 to see premium games on Sky etc.  We recently had representatives from the Federation of Irish Sport before us and we spoke about the 20x20 campaign and increasing the coverage of ladies' sports and participation in those sports.  What is the position of RT&Eacute; on that?  There are definitely many more female commentators on various sports but is RT&Eacute; looking to increase both the number of commentators and coverage of ladies' games?</p></speech>

He correctly points out that sport in its entirety is something we must represent and that is very much the objective.  We were active participants in the 20x20 campaign and throughout that period we proactively increased our representation of women.  Last year was incredible for Irish women in sport and at the RT&Eacute; sports awards, seven from the ten of the nominees were women.  The winner, Ms Rachel Blackmore, was a woman, which was utterly fantastic.</p> <p>  We showed 36 live women's sports events in 2021, which is a record outside of 2019, when we showed the Womens' World Cup.  We have made great progress and continue to do more.  This year we have the Women's Six Nations, the Women's Euros and European games that include athletics, swimming and rowing.  Our endeavours in the area go on.  We have seen record audiences for the Irish women's soccer team, which has been fantastic, and we have more female pundits, presenters and co-commentators.  Last year we managed to show every one of the women's international soccer matches, despite huge issues with where they were etc.</p> <p>  We are very committed to increasing our coverage of women's sport and that is again against a backdrop of decreased and challenging funding.  Sport is a particularly expensive area.</p><p>Certainly, our 20x20 campaign continues and we are very proud of the progress we have made.  We want to do more.</p></speech>

However, we run the RT&Eacute; board very much in a 21st-century flat structure.  It is not a hierarchical structure and we need to get consensus.  The consensus was not available on the day and there was a genuine concern about conflict of interest and perception of conflict of interest with such an enormous contract being handed to a board member.  That posed my board colleagues huge concern and much anxiety.  It is not what we would have wanted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1097" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022012600002#N00300"><p>That is fair enough and I thank Ms Doherty.  I have some points on children's television.  People were talking about this and it stirred some memories, and I can still remember watching Zig and Zag at lunchtime in the canteen at college.  I have three young kids but when they turn on television they do not switch to RT&Eacute;, to be quite honest.  During Covid-19, however, there was a project linking in schools and doing some programmes on television at a certain time.  It is an area that could be looked at, perhaps with languages like Irish etc.  Perhaps it could be tied in with the Department of Education so that kids at home full-time or at the weekend could be doing some educational work by watching certain programmes on RT&Eacute; approved by the Department.</p> <p>  I take the point that RT&Eacute; is not yet seeking an increase in the licence fee and the witnesses are 100% right that a significant amount of money is out there.  My party, Fine Gael, in a proposal for The Future of Media Commission indicated there could be a public service media charge on all households that could generate a figure of more than &euro;65 million.  Such a fund, if it comes about, should be available to all media, including written media, regional newspapers and radio stations.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, funding is approximately 7%, although I could be wrong.</p> <p>  Perhaps I am misreading what was said in that this should be moved away from An Post.  The witnesses may not want to say it but that should not happen.  The witnesses mentioned that we must amend the Broadcasting Act and that is the first action to be taken.  We should not remove An Post as the collection agent.  The difficulty that An Post as a collection agent has arises from the anomaly in the Broadcasting Act and that should be dealt with first.  We do not want a position where the licence fee is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not something I am in favour of and we must amend the Act and let An Post collect the fee.  A significant amount would be collected.  What are the views of the witnesses on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1098" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022012600002#N00400"><p>As I said, there are many ways in which the fee could be collected.  We must get to a solution that is fair, transparent and accountable.  Those are the priority characteristics.  An Post is the current collection agent and it has had issues with the way in which its contract has been rolled over.  It has asked for help with the database.  We are at a point where we need an overhaul of the system to really reflect the current ways of viewing, watching and listening.  The notion of a television licence fee is outdated because of what people are viewing in so many other ways.</p> <p>  It is important for us to discuss the range of options because there is probably no bad option.  As I said, there are many different options in play around Europe and we are not the only country that has seen huge evasion rates over the years.  Other countries have grappled with it and came up with a solution, whether it is a charge or taxation system.  A number of countries have come to a place where they are happy with this.  That is part of the reason The Future of Media Commission was set up and it sought to look at the funding of public service broadcasting.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct also in speaking about the sustainability of the Irish media sector because we are a vulnerable sector.  We are a nation squeezed between two English-speaking giants that have very strong media and broadcasting players.  We are sort of in the middle of that.  To maintain the Irish voice and strong independent Irish journalism, the commission was again asked to look at the wider sector.  As I mentioned, the &euro;65 million out there in uncollected or evaded fees could go an awful long way not just with RT&Eacute; but the wider sector as well.</p></speech>

The recommendation we put forward was that this would be a media charge on all households.  I believe we would see significantly higher percentage payment through the An Post network if it were payable by every household.  I am delighted Ms Forbes agrees this should be spread across all media, as that is an extremely important point.</p> <p>  A delegation from RT&Eacute; was before us approximately 18 months ago and there was a comment about there being 100 managers in the organisation.  There has been much cost-cutting etc. within the organisation so what are the number of management positions and average salaries of those positions?</p></speech>

Very broadly, we have been looking at our resources for many years, as the Senator knows.  We have had a number of initiatives to look at staffing.  It is also important to note that our role and the remit we must fulfil is very demanding.  Staff are in place to fulfil those services.  In the briefing note there was a table showing the other public service broadcasters in Europe of comparable size to RT&Eacute; and overall staff numbers.  One can see we are very comparable or even below other broadcasters of our level.  We have been assessed many times by independent entities on the right staffing levels for RT&Eacute; and we are there or thereabouts.</p> <p>  More reductions in staff now would be linked with reductions in service.  We all know that is not right because that would be a reduced service to the public.  This is an ongoing area for consideration and we look at it constantly but this is very challenging.  It is also very challenging in an environment where we need new skills.  There has been much talk today around digital and technology and such areas are very expensive to hire into.  Those people are in high demand.  We have a constant challenge to facilitate both new skills coming in while maintaining our current services.  That is where we are.</p></speech>

I really appreciate the Senator's support for change as that must happen in how funds are collected and bringing certainty to that.  Ms Forbes mentioned earlier that the key elements are independence, stability, fairness and accountability.  RT&Eacute; has probably always suffered from an assumption that it should meet the needs of those who are in charge of it.  The only people that RT&Eacute; should meet the needs of are citizen audiences who are paying for the service.  RT&Eacute; must continue to shine a lens on all aspects of society it represents.</p><p>It should be a patriotic public service media in that it shows all that is bad and good about a nation in order that it may be able to confront and negotiate all that is good and bad.  No public service media can be a voice for a specific set of political ideologies.  We have darkening political clouds all over place in the two English-speaking countries near to us, the UK and America, which are now into sound-bite politics.  If public service media gets something wrong, it is a mistake.  If commercial television gets something wrong, for example, Fox News, it is an ideology and an agenda.  We have to do the best we can, including everybody here today and everyone in politics, to ensure that we protect the independent voice, that we do not have sound-bite politics and that we do not truncate very important issues and assertions of some core truths into something that is glib and untrue.  A lie and an untruth are two different things.  We are watching so many untruths unfold around us.</p><p> I have to say that trust in RT&Eacute; news and current affairs is extraordinarily high.  It gives me comfort, as an Irish citizen, as I am sure it does many others.  To give certainty to that voice in the future and to have the committee on our side for that, no matter what members agree with, like or do not like, is very important.  As I said in my statement earlier, time is not on our side. </p></speech>

Again, there is a very clear code on how to make an official complaint.  We endeavour to respond to complaints within 20 days.  That is our norm.  Beyond that, I will give the Deputy details from our annual report of overall numbers.  We received 32 complaints in 2020 and 55 in 2019.  Of the complaints that came in, zero were upheld by the BAI.  The authority is our regulator so all the complaints that go to it are then adjudicated on by it.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Doherty and Ms Forbes for their contributions and engagement.  When the Future of Media Commission report has finally been published, and there has been time to reflect on it, it will be useful at that stage for our committee to meet again.</p> <p>  The point Ms Doherty made was very important.  We may often disagree and we may take issue, but I agree with colleagues in that, for the most part, there is trust.  We talk about trusted journalism and trusted public service journalism; that is clearly there.  The overwhelming majority of parliamentary colleagues would say that while we might not always agree with programming, and we will take issue with some of the stances taken on programmes, or the perceived lack of balance, there are very clear examples of such journalism, such as the "Prime Time" coverage last week and this week of the very tragic death of Eden Heaslip.  That type of programming informs the work we do and the issue we are dealing with as a committee in respect of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  Certainly, there will always be tensions.  That is healthy, but that partnership is important. </p> <p>  Deputy Griffin had so many scripted one-liners about the new year's eve show that Ms Forbes might consider hiring him to present it next 31 December.  He could provide some light entertainment.  Again, I sincerely thank the representatives and all their teams for the work they do.  We look forward to engaging with them again.</p></speech>

You are all very welcome.</p> <p>  On privilege, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p><p>If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are now once more permitted to participate in meetings from the committee room, which is a welcome development and we welcome the Minister in that regard today.</p><p> I remind any member who wishes to participate remotely of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I call on the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#B00200"><p>I am glad to be here.  Our officials were here yesterday for a good productive session.  I hope I can add to that and look forward to our wider discussion on the National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland, or NIFTI as it is commonly called.  It is the Department's new framework for supporting the consideration and prioritisation of future investment in the national land transport network.  It is our response to the national planning framework and the projections for population growth and settlement patterns we will have to 2040.   It is key to underpinning the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework.  It is critical so that investment in the transport sector is underpinned by and supports the delivery of the national strategic objectives in that framework.</p> <p>  NIFTI sets out the transport sector&rsquo;s strategic priorities to deliver on that 2040 vision.  It does not identify specific projects for investment, determine the total amount of transport funding available or decide upon the allocation of funding to different areas.  Its role is to act as a common lens through which to consider potential investment at an individual project level. </p> <p>  Decisions on investment in transport continue primarily to be shaped by programme for Government priorities, including a commitment to invest 2:1 in favour of public transport compared to road projects and to invest &euro;360 million each year in active travel.  It is not just the national planning framework we have to adhere to, but also critical project plans such as the climate action plan, Our Rural Future, the metropolitan area transport strategies and the soon to be agreed, subject to Government approval, sustainable mobility policy.  There is a variety of policy objectives that NIFTI sits within.</p> <p>  NIFTI sets out four priorities of the national strategic outcomes.  They are decarbonisation, protection and renewal of existing assets, promotion of sustainable mobility of people and goods in urban areas and enhancement of regional and rural accessibility.  They are the key objectives of transport investment.  One is not prioritised over the other.  They may combine and be met in different ways.</p> <p>  Beneath that there are hierarchies.  To deliver the most appropriate solution, the investment priorities are set out in modal and intervention hierarchies.  Modal refers to promoting active travel first and promoting public transport before private transport because that meets a variety of other policy goals I mentioned earlier.  Similarly, when it comes to investment in the intervention hierarchy, it is far better to repair, manage, use or upgrade an existing asset before we look to build new.  That is a better use of space and resources and provides a better emissions profile when we have that investment hierarchy as well as the modal hierarchy.</p> <p>  As I am sure members would agree, getting assessment of all the complex arrangements we have around approval of public capital projects, in particular, is complicated.  We have in the last decade put in place new structures in government to guide investment projects, particularly large capital projects, in the public spending code, which has to be adhered to.  In our Department, transport-specific guidance has been put in place in the common appraisal framework, CAF.  That will be updated later this year.  It is also being reviewed on an ongoing basis, for example, as we learn more about the real cost of carbon dioxide and the need to price and cost that properly and to look at the broader planning and other gains we need to get from our investment decisions.</p> <p>  The existing requirements cover consideration of a range of factors, including strategic alignment with sectoral and Government policy, economic and financial appraisal, as well as feasibility and deliverability.  It is noted that existing requirements under the public spending code, which was updated in 2019, include the need to set out and demonstrate the strategic and policy alignment of any proposal being submitted, such as alignment with the national planning framework.   Both the public spending code and the 2016 common appraisal framework transport appraisal guidance already include requirements to develop and consider a range of possible options and a variety of types of interventions, for example, different modes or network management as opposed to investment options. </p> <p>  The National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland has been developed to better serve and support our agencies and local authorities to demonstrate strategic alignment with the national planning framework through the NIFTI transport priorities. They will assist in the process of picking the right options by re-emphasising the need for a variety of options to be developed, and for this to be done with reference to sustainability and value for money.  An interim update of the guidance to account for NIFTI at the project level will be published shortly and in advance of a revised and updated common appraisal framework, which will be published later this year.  That is the broad outline.  I look forward to the variety of questions members may have and to our engagement.</p></speech>

The Minister will be pleased to know that the briefing we got the other day dealt with a number of questions.</p> <p>   My understanding is NIFTI is ensuring that the national strategic objectives are being adhered to and that, when anything is being assessed, all other factors need to be taken into account, including the national planning framework and anything that has been determined in relation to rural living or climate action goals.  That makes complete sense.  Will the Minister walk us through the process in relation to how that is happening?  He spoke on the radio about the fact that planning is complicated and can be incredibly difficult and trying to get anything done in transport takes too long.  What are the pieces of work being done to deal with that?  Some of that might be what the Attorney General is looking at as regards the overall system of planning.  That is two questions in one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#B00400"><p>I think it is true that it takes too long.  O'Devaney Gardens is one example.  That is in the housing area but it has taken 17 years.  The metro has taken 23 years, at least, from when I saw it as a fairly advanced project.  BusConnects in my constituency in Dublin has been five years in consultation.  We need to speed up the delivery of projects because the public get rightly angry at the uncertainty around that.</p> <p>  Planning is one element of this and the planning review by the Attorney General that the Deputy referred to is important.  His assessment and that of a number of people is that the Planning and Development Act 2000, while well intended at the start, has been amended so often that it is difficult to assess the law.  It is so complicated.</p><p>One of the reasons we have so many judicial reviews is that planning is so complex and people can query facets.  That is deeply frustrating for all concerned, be it those interested in developing a project or those opposing it.  That very critical fundamental review will be central.  Included in that, we need to look at the regulations with regard to the likes of environmental impact assessments and when we need those.  We need to be really clear in terms of what the regulations are in order that clarity is brought.  That is one element of the acceleration we will need.</p><p> A second element will be important in the lifetime of the Government.  We have three remaining years in government, all going well.  That three-year timeframe brings us to 2025, halfway through this critical decade for meeting the challenge of climate change.  I have said to my officials that, in working with the agencies, we now need to accelerate progress in the area of sustainable mobility and support investments that support our climate action plan and national planning framework objectives.</p><p> Transport will be the hardest area in meeting our climate targets.  Everyone believes agriculture is the hardest area but I believe transport is the hardest.  There are certain areas, such as haulage, where it is very difficult to get solutions.  In other areas, we have embedded a dispersed population model, which requires people to have very long commutes and promotes private car use rather than other more sustainable modes.  In truth, the NIFTI is based on a national planning framework.  My assessment is to ask whether we are delivering on the objectives of the national planning framework.  If I were to summarise and reduce this to key areas, it is primarily centred on better balanced regional development, compact development and low-carbon development.</p><p> We are not delivering better balanced regional development.  According to the latest analysis, 74% of new housing is in the greater Dublin, eastern and midlands regional area.  Counties Meath, Kildare and Fingal are booming and going beyond meeting targets but Dublin city is not.  In truth, it seems that in the rest of the country we are not delivering better balanced regional development.  We need to make an urgent change to start seeing development in counties Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick and towns and villages around the country.</p><p> Second, in terms of compact development, again, while we are seeing many planning approvals for apartments and other developments in the city centres, they are not moving to activation.  Most of the development is still occurring in a further dispersed development model.  We are not delivering compact development.  We have an urgent need, particularly coming out of Covid-19, to bring life back into the centres of our cities.  We should use this moment, in Covid, when we do not have so much commuter traffic.  We should not allow that to return but instead try to get space to improve the local environment and make it attractive to live in the centre of a town, village or city and thereby meet our second objective.</p><p> Third, in terms of the climate side, as I said, all the modelling is showing that even with all the electric vehicles we may deliver and all the public transport projects that are in the plans, they will not, on their own, deliver the level of emissions reduction we need to achieve.  For this reason, we need to do more faster.  That applies in particular to sustainable mobility.  On Monday last, we announced funding for every county, town and city in the country to improve the local environment and sustainable mobility.  One simple example is that when I was young 20% of children were driven to school, whereas now that figure is 60%.  Could we reverse that?  That would be good for parents and everyone else because there would be less traffic at rush hour.  It would be good for health and emissions.  That is one example of how we need to change.</p><p> The NIFTI helps us and gives guidance.  It states that we should promote active travel first, if we can, and use existing assets rather than always building new because the latter is very expensive and takes time.  That is a useful part of the overall jigsaw.  My job, more than anything else, is to advance the acceleration of real projects in the next three years.  That includes roads projects.</p><p> Deputy Lowry has spoken to me many times about Tipperary town.  This is an example of where some roads investment can support sustainable mobility and remove traffic from the centres of towns.  Some 30% of retail in Tipperary town is not open.  The figure in Dublin city centre is not too far off that.  I do not know if anyone has done a survey.  We need to urgently restore the high street.  We do that by removing as much traffic as we can and bringing life back into the centre of our towns and cities.  We need to do that quickly in the next three years.</p></speech>

I accept the difficulties and also that part of the Minister's job is to look at means of speeding this up.  When the Minister appeared before the committee previously he spoke of a survival of the fittest scenario almost with regard to planning applications.  We probably need a planning process that takes away from that.  The Minister indicated that the Department had put some sort of elements on transport with regard to speeding up the process.  It is just a case of how and when all this can be done.  It needs to be done, however, because we cannot work on the basis of who can get through the planning process based on skill, luck or whatever else.</p></speech>

If I understand Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; correctly, there is to a certain extent an element of competition between local authorities and cities.  I will give Limerick as example.  I opened <i>The Irish Times </i>a few months ago and read a full-page advertisement stating that Limerick was going green.  It was great; I was thrilled.  That is absolutely right for Limerick, the city and various other places around the country.  If Limerick is to do this, it must now deliver on the sorts of projects that would actually make that vision real, for example, connecting the University of Limerick, UL, the Technological University of the Shannon, formerly LIT Tipperary, and MaREI.  That would transform the centre of Limerick.</p><p>Only 3% of the population of Limerick live in the historic core.  It is a stunning Georgian city with a beautiful river and King John's Castle.  It has everything anyone would want.  It is a dramatic, beautiful, fantastic city with history, culture and a good economy.  However, this process cannot be forced.  We cannot say to Limerick City and County Council and its executive that they have to do it.  If they do not want to do it, it is very hard to push it through, particularly when it comes to delivering at a local level on the street.  If Limerick is not willing or interested in doing it, we will go to Galway and say that if Galway wants to go down that route, it will get funding first.  It is not saying &quot;No&quot; to any one council; it is recognising that there are limited resources and if cities, towns or counties are not looking to be progressive in that way, the funding will naturally go elsewhere.</p></speech>

I do not want a message to go out today that Limerick is not very much on the cusp of looking to go green.  That is being rolled out on the ground in a very positive way with the Limerick Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, plan which is about to be published.  I will engage with the Minister on it in my own time but I would not want any misunderstanding to come from our meeting.  I assume the Minister is very supportive of the work Limerick is doing.</p></speech>

Planning is something with which we have had constant problems but one of the great examples of planning is the Luas line.  As somebody asked me on the first day the Luas opened, is it not great that they have kept the old Harcourt Street line?  Officials have been great down the years in that they recognised the line might have been needed again at some stage in the future.</p> <p>  That brings me to the issue of Galway and the Salmon Weir Bridge, the proposed footbridge from the Woodquay side to the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.  We are looking at this issue and the Minister's officials met the Gluas very light rail committee in Galway.  One of the issues is that any development should be done with a view to providing very light rail at some stage, hopefully in the not-too-distant future.  This brings me to the planning for the bridge that is to cross the River Corrib.  It would be the ideal route for any very light rail system coming from Oranmore and heading to Barna.  It would link up Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, University Hospital Galway, Merlin Park University Hospital and the whole lot.  It would create a tremendous commute across the city.</p><p>I would be interested in whether the Minister is willing to take something like that on board at this stage, even though the project itself might not happen for years to come.  I am mindful of what happened with Dundrum shopping centre and the cost to the Exchequer for that tiny piece of road that bypasses Dundrum.  I forget how much it was at the time but it was the most expensive piece of real estate in Europe, if I am not mistaken.</p><p> That brings me to the matter of engaging with local representatives and the county councillors on the ground.  We had a meeting here some time ago at which I raised the bus stop in Corrandulla, which is 10 km from Corrandulla.  On the same route there was another bus stop that was 2.5 km from the local population density area.  That suggests that planning is being done on maps rather than on the ground.  We do not have a Google car driving around to see what is the ideal place for bus stops and the like.</p><p> The Minister brought up the issue of judicial reviews.  I have no difficulty with people objecting to planning on reasonable grounds but surely to God they should be local and living in the area, not people from outside the jurisdiction and in some cases outside the country.  That causes great problems.  I am mindful of the loss of the data centre in Athenry in Galway.  We could argue about data centres all day long and I would do that with the Minister quite happily but that was an industry that was coming to Athenry and it was lost and that created bad blood.</p><p> There was a very interesting piece on Pat Kenny's show yesterday about electric vehicle charging points around the country.  Dungarvan has one and they were talking about the scenic routes around the Waterford coastline, which is very short on charging points.  Visitors coming to the country will not be able to rent electric cars because of the lack of charging points.  On the other side of it, I know a couple of people who have bought electric cars recently and all of them are horrified with the electricity bills they have received this last month.  Maybe it is just a case of getting used to it but there seems to be a huge issue of electricity charges now with electric vehicles.</p><p> I walked to school as a child and frequently walked home for lunch and back to school in the afternoon.  We would love to see that happening but we are living in a very different society now.  It is not just an issue for the Department and its planning; it is a societal issue that will require the policing of safe routes to school for kids.  I do not know how the Government will do that.  It has been done in some continental countries where children can leave their homes and we know they will be safe the whole way to school and back but in the current environment in this country, I think there would be huge resistance to children being let out on their own, even at secondary school level.  These are issues that the Minister and his Department will have to confront in the near future.  I thank him for his time.</p></speech>

On Galway, I agree with the Senator about the cross-city link project.  It will run from Barna through to the hospital, NUIG, over the Salmon Weir Bridge, and through the centre out towards Parkmore.  This is something Galway fundamentally needs because so much of the population is living on one side of the city and working on the other.  This will give them an effective crossover point and access to the college, the hospital and the city centre.  The Salmon Weir Bridge project is part of that.  It has been funded this year and is going to construction.  It will allow much safer active travel and is right in the centre of a beautiful part of the city.  That will allow us to put in really high-quality public transport infrastructure on the bridge.</p> <p>  We have committed to doing further research on the light rail but I see it working in a similar way to what I think might happen in Cork and Dublin.  There are similar plans for each of those three cities.  Limerick is different because it has so much existing rail line, but for those three cities we will build high-quality bus corridors, get the patronage up and get the transport-led development.  That will give us a signal as to where to put the housing and then we can upgrade it to light rail.  The housing has to be connected to the transport planning.</p> <p>  If we were to look at accelerating things, there are various projects in Galway.  The development of Oranmore railway station is funded in my mind and can be done by 2025.  There is also the likes of the Dublin Road and other key projects.  I am encouraged by what I see happening in Galway City Council and the fact that it is looking again at Salthill.  It is willing to test different ways of doing things to see if we can change the sense of place and come out of Covid by holding onto some of the public space and using it in a different way from in the past.  That cross-city link with a view to getting a quality bus corridor and making a safe active travel space is the way to go.</p> <p>  On electric vehicles, we have a real timeline challenge here because electric vehicles are coming at huge scale, beyond what anyone can expect.  All the motor companies are starting to realise that if they do not provide electric vehicles and if they do not have the range capabilities of the cars that are now selling out, they will fall behind.  Electric vehicles will be particularly useful for rural Ireland because there are not as many charging complications as in the city.  In my constituency there is a real problem with charging cars in rows of terraced houses or apartments.  It is not easy.  In rural Ireland, it is much easier because the connection point is not a difficulty for a one-off house in the country.  People also tend to do more miles because of the more dispersed settlement model and that is where electric cars come into their own because they are cheaper.  Even with the current high electricity prices which, please God, will be a temporary phenomenon, electricity is still a fraction of the cost of petrol and diesel.  That is before taking into account that the maintenance cost of an electric vehicle is also a fraction of that of a vehicle with a combustion engine.</p> <p>  Our Department is engaging on the issue of charging points.  We have taken this responsibility from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications because it is a transport project.  We are looking at a range of initiatives.  The high-speed chargers at the motorway stations and interchanges are starting to be effective.  From my own personal experience using the 50 kW chargers, they give you the capability of covering the country because you can stop for half an hour, have a coffee and quick read of the paper and that will get you to Cork, stopping halfway.  I agree with the Senator that we need to scale that up.</p> <p>  With regard to the destination points, it is not just an issue in Dungarvan.  It is the same right around the country for endpoints like Clifden or Dingle.  I hate to call them that but this is a real issue when people get to the end of a peninsula or a popular tourist route.  We will have to roll out a range of chargers.  There is a role here for the market as well as the State.  The State is supporting the ESB to provide some of these motorway and other stations but there are also other providers like Ionity in urban petrol stations.  That competition helps because hotels, retail outlets and shopping centres in those locations have an opportunity to gain business if they have good infrastructure.  The challenge is the distribution grid.  We need a strong grid in order to power these things and it is not always easy or popular to build a grid.  People in Waterford will know that that has been a contentious issue in recent years but we need the grid.  We are aware of the challenge of getting all those charging points in place because the cars are coming.</p></speech>

The Minister might look at grant-aiding to ensure that hotels in places like Clifden, Dingle, Dungarvan or west Cork have the wherewithal to put in charging points because it would be a huge advantage with regard to electric car rental for tourists and so on.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#E00100"><p>Apologies for not being here; I was speaking in the Seanad on broadband, another important issue that falls within the Minister's remit.  We have had discussions with the Department recently about the framework that is supposedly under discussion and how we can plan for the future of transport from a climate change perspective.  I know that others have spoken about electric vehicles, EVs.  I am concerned about that issue on two fronts.  First, it seems that while we expect to have around 1 million EVs on the roads by the end of the decade, from talking to people in the industry, it seems that Ireland is competing with other countries and will be under enormous pressure to get the number of vehicles required.  I know there has been relatively good uptake to date.  The range anxiety issue that others have talked about is still an issue.  I spoke to people in the ESB the other day.  They are looking at this purely from a commercial point of view.  In my view, there is a lack of ambition on the part of a State company that should be rolling out that service much more aggressively.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement on funding for cycle and active travel, including walkways and footpaths.  That is very important.  Lighting will need to be installed as part of that.  For some time, local authorities have shown a lack of interest in extending the lighting system around some of our villages.  Most smaller towns and villages are looking at developing walkways and footpaths that run around their curtilage.  The village that I live in, Tulla, is a perfect example.  Part of a road was upgraded several years ago and a footpath was extended to effectively form a looped walk.  Around one quarter of it is unlit, and at this time of the year it is dangerous.  I know why the local authority does not want to extend the lighting, but is going to have to do so.  It is part of getting people into that way of life.  I know it will create additional pressure on the grid but it would be relatively small in real terms.</p> <p>  In addition to funding for footpaths and cycleways, we need to provide for lighting.  It is like getting people to make a big spend on an EV.  They are then captured as climate change ambassadors and from then on, they start to change other aspects of their lives to achieve carbon reduction.  It is the same when we get people out walking.  They do it at this time of the year, from a health perspective, to work off the pounds gained over Christmas.  However, if people get into walking for that purpose, they also become active travel enthusiasts thereafter.  We must make it as easy as possible for them to do so.</p> <p>  The other issue that has been a bugbear of mine, and I have raised it with this Minister and his predecessors, is school transport.  I have argued for a long time that we should not restrict children who live within two miles or a mile and a half of their school, or whatever the distance is, from school transport based on their postcode, etc.  If there is a bus passing, it should be big enough to take them.  While dropping my kids to school for the past 15 years, I have seen people driving to the schools who, frankly, do not need to drive.  They may live only a mile or a mile and a half away from the school.  We would like to get them cycling and walking, but the first thing we need to do is to get them out of the pattern of dropping their children off every morning.  The best way to do that is to give every kid access to a bus, which would mean having a few bigger buses.  The buses are there anyway.  As I said previously, we would get champions and ambassadors based on attracting them in.  Where we would really attract young people is by getting them to use public transport.  Is it any wonder that the first thing young people want to do when they get a job is to buy a car when they have been driven everywhere, particularly those living in rural Ireland?  If we can get kids on buses from the start, we will go a long way towards making that modal shift and changing behaviour because it will become second nature to them as they progress through life.  As an initiative from a climate change perspective, we should look at providing access to a school bus service for every child.</p></speech>

We have all the plans we need, including the national climate plan, the national development plan and very good rural development plans.  It is delivery that we have to accelerate and be good at now.  If I were to pick various projects, and I am trying to do that in each city, one of the key ones is probably the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan.  I do not know if the Senator has had a chance to look at it.  It came out of the National Transport Authority, NTA, consultation with councils around the country.  It is really good and gives local authorities real flexibility to come back to us with route alignments that they are considering.  The experience has been really positive.  In Dingle, a new regular loop service around the peninsula was introduced.  The service used to run once a day.  Whether someone got a bus depended on the lunar schedule but the service is now regular and has recorded a 25-fold increase in patronage.  It is not only tourists but also young local people who find it a godsend.  It is a similar story in County Leitrim where a new service is being tested and trialled.</p> <p>  The interesting issue here is looking at how to integrate other public transport services that we need, whether they are services for local health authorities, social welfare offices or Local Link services.  That can also apply to school transport where, as part of rolling out Connecting Ireland, we can look at whether connections can be made with the school bus fleet transport mode.  We have an advantage in that a review of the school bus transport system is being undertaken by the Minister for Education.  Everyone in the political system is aware that the issue is a real bugbear for our constituents.  As part of that review, there is an opportunity to look at integrating school transport and a revived and new Connecting Ireland rural bus service system.  There are clear plans in place.  If I recall correctly, they would need approximately &euro;57 million in the next three years.  We may get savings if we used some of that service to help us on the school bus service.  That is exactly where we should be going.</p> <p>  I keep coming back to the point that we need to show the same urgency with some of these measures that we did during Covid.  We were able to do things that the public service never thought we would be able to do in the testing and vaccination programmes and so on.  We need the same urgency and can-do attitude towards turning things around in the housing and climate crises, particularly in transport.  There were not many good things about Covid, but one of them was that people got to know their local environment.  I bet the loop walk in Tulla the Senator mentioned was busy.</p></speech>

The Senator is right.  LED lighting could be a way of delivering on that.  It uses a fraction of the energy and has a lower operation and installation cost.  The lights are smaller but provide strong, downward light.  They do not cause a serious light pollution issue.  As the Senator said, we should look at solutions like that to promote walking in every way.  The key point in respect of both greenways and those routes is that they should not just be for power walking.  They should be used for kids to get to school.  We should design them in ways that allow people to get to the shops and meet neighbours, thereby joining up communities.  They should not just be leisure routes.</p> <p>  On the issue of EVs, this is a challenging and interesting project.  I keep coming back to the point I made earlier that the grid is the key in an urban context, for example, where there is an apartment block or a row of houses.  If every house gets a heat pump and an EV, there is a challenge as to how we manage the local distribution grid.  Also, for more interurban and rural journeys, the big challenge with turning what are currently petrol stations into charging stations is the grid.  To do this quickly, we need a lot of power.  One of the innovations we may start looking at is aligning our parking with where the power is.  For example, if there is a local authority location, perhaps in a town, we would think about putting the parking close to the ESB substation.  Rather than bringing the power to where the parking is, we would start parking close to where the power is.  The grid is the key constraint.  There is an issue with getting the power if there is distance involved.  With some of the interurban motorway petrol stations, the difficulty is being close enough to the grid to get real power.  We need to start designating, designing and looking for places in the grid where we can put the parking, rather than bringing the grid to the parking.</p></speech>

Yesterday we had a very good presentation on NIFTI.  That gave us a clear understanding of the framework for the future of planning, investment and infrastructure, and how that can be compatible with environmental objectives.  From that perspective, we understand the role and importance of it.</p> <p>  A couple of issues have been raised.  I refer to the planning laws and the review thereof.  What participation does the Minister have in that?  How has it progressed?  How quickly will we have new planning laws?  There is a significant concern in respect of serial planning objectors in particular.  These are vexatious objectors who hold up developments for an inordinate length of time for spurious reasons.  They have no familiarity with the location or development to which they are objecting.  Effectively, the same objectors appear in every county and there needs to be a curb on that activity.</p> <p>  I am a firm believer in the town centre first philosophy and principle since the Minister explained it to us and because Tipperary town has been a beneficiary of it.  All towns have suffered dramatically in recent years, mainly because of planning decisions that were taken 20 years ago.  Towns are bereft of shopping opportunities because the big supermarkets and outlets were positioned on the outskirts of towns at the request of the planning authorities at the time.  The heart was torn out of every town in Ireland.  As the Minister stated, it has even gone to the cities now.  In my county of Tipperary there are Thurles, Clonmel, Nenagh, Cashel and Tipperary town.  Each of them has so many outlets that are locked up.  We need to restore town centres and make them places of living again.  We need to bring families back into them and make them living centres, as they were before.  There are so many derelict buildings.  There are unoccupied pubs and shops.  I know the Government has recently taken an initiative to address this issue but it is absolutely essential if we are to return some vibrancy and activity - commercial, living and day-to-day - in town centres.</p> <p>  From what I heard on NIFTI, I presume the agreement to proceed with the bypass of Tipperary town is compatible with the NIFTI objectives.  Obviously, there is a significant environmental dimension to the bypass in that it will alleviate traffic congestion, noise pollution and pollution from vehicles.  In general, it will open up the town, take the traffic out of it and allow people to come back into the town to trade with local shopkeepers and do business in a normal way.  Is the Minister satisfied that plan is in line with NIFTI?  I ask him to reiterate his commitment to the bypass and its funding.</p> <p>  As an aside, since that progress was made and the Minister committed to the bypass of Tipperary town, the route process has been expedited.  We are nearing completion in that regard and will shortly have the preferred route identified.  In that context, many local farmers and people with land and properties in the area are concerned with regard to the compulsory acquisition of their lands and what have you.  That certainly needs to be upgraded.  The compensation must reflect the current value of the land.  The compensatory measures that are in place at the moment are outdated and not in keeping with modern costs and values.  They certainly need to be reviewed.  </p> <p>  If the Minister were to address those few issues, I would be happy.</p></speech>

It is a cornerstone of environmental good practice that people have the ability to use the law to question process or policy objectives or individual projects.  Although these cases may cause hindrance and discomfort to many people, in many instances the objectors are often proven right.  I do not think a curtailment of the right to challenge is the key approach here.  Part of the problem is that, as I stated, the legal structures are so complicated that it is very hard to know in many instances what is the right process or project and that, in itself, is leading to many challenges.  The Attorney General and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage recognise that.  The Attorney General came to the Government and committed to providing that kind of review, update, modernisation and consolidation, more than anything else, of what is a very complex area.  The Attorney General is a person who, when he sets himself a goal, you can have faith he will deliver on it in that timeframe.  This is part of the acceleration of projects we need to do.  I meet him regularly to get an update and an assessment and to feed in my own thoughts on what we need to do.  I recently had a meeting with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and Niall Cussen, the Planning Regulator, and both said they think it provides the opportunity for us to deliver the national planning framework objectives, as does NIFTI, to try to provide support as we update and modernise the law to provide for or support more compact development.  They have a good stakeholders process through which organisations like that can give their input.  I am confident it will be delivered in time and will be transformative.</p> <p>  As regards town centres, I will take Tipperary town as an example.  One could take the example of Castlemartyr or another village.  I could not have been more clear publicly and privately with TII and others that I think this is the priority.  Mr. Ebrill may be tired of hearing me constantly saying to do the relief roads, bypasses and town centre first projects first and give them the greatest priority.  We are at a critical moment, particularly as rural Ireland could benefit significantly, coming out of Covid, from people remote working and not necessarily having to live in a city.  In fact, it is happening.  We can see it happening.  House prices are going up outside the main cities in a way that has not happened previously.  The house price is higher there, which is indicative of a pattern of people deciding they will not have to live so close to their work.  That is happening.  It is critical that we get this moment of transformation right.  To my mind, it is critical that we get as many people as possible living in the centre of towns because that is fulfilling the NIFTI principles in a sense.  It is using existing assets.  We do not have to build new assets everywhere.  It means people living within walking distance of schools, churches, pubs, community centres and football pitches so that we can move away from a car-based system and we, as a state, do not have to provide ever-outwards development, which would be extremely expensive.  In addition, you get the benefit of a very strong sense of community life.</p> <p>  We are not going to get all retail back, to be honest.  I refer to this process of development outside towns in the context of retail.  There was a case in the High Court before Christmas regarding an out-of-town retail unit that still got approval.  That makes me scratch my head wondering how it is in tune with the latest planning thinking.  The decision surprised me.  We will have a review and update of the Housing for All strategy later this afternoon with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>  What I am also hearing in the context of town retail that is not being utilised - it could be an old pub or a shop - is that we are going to look at innovation around whether planning permission or whatever is needed for it to be reintroduced as a domestic dwelling.  My view is that we need to look at bank lending rules around that and some of the access, egress and insurance rules in respect of fire safety and so on.  We do not want to take any chances but we have to consider the obstacles to living above the shop and the conversion of some of those properties to residential use, particularly at a time when house prices are rising and there is a housing crisis.  We need to amend a variety of those regulations to bring people back into the centre.  One of the advantages of that is that when it starts to happen, local retailers start to gain and benefit.  It can be done at scale - Tipperary town is big enough to do it at scale there - in terms of putting a large population in.</p><p> As for the nature of that road, I do not know the alignments and I would be keen to see them.  In any event, it does not need to be a motorway.  In fact, it cannot be a motorway because there are so many other towns and villages we need to bypass.  We cannot do this at a scale of four-lane highways everywhere.  It will also be better for the town if it is not an impassable barrier.  At the same time, we should use this as an opportunity to take out the through traffic, particularly freight traffic in the likes of Tipperary town, which is on a major freight route from Limerick to Waterford.  I think we should be bold.  My advice, which I will be making clear, is we should use this opportunity to stop the through traffic, make the town accessible and create a civic space in the centre.  Some towns have done that and shown it works.  If we do not do that, traffic will always flow through and we may miss that opportunity.  Let us make Tipperary town centre a spectacularly attractive place to walk through and to have a child.  A colleague of mine says a town centre should be a place where you can let go of the hand of a five-year-old and not be terrified that he or she will get injured.  That is what we need to do.</p><p> The Deputy might remind me of his final question.</p></speech>

I found it very informative and we now have a better understanding of how it works and what investment will be needed into the future.  I support the contribution made by Deputy Lowry regarding the town centre first initiative and building up our town centres to deal with dereliction and get people back living in our towns and villages.  There is a tie-in here in regard to Government policy.  There are major investments in rural regeneration projects, town and village schemes and repair and lease schemes operated by county councils and supported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Department of Transport and the Minister have a role in trying to make it easier and more attractive to live in towns.  I very much welcome the package that was recently announced for Clare, with &euro;5.3 million for the active travel programme, including to upgrade footpaths that have not been upgraded for decades.  It is really good news and I compliment the area engineers, the road engineers and the design office of Clare County Council on the work, dedication and time and effort they put into making those applications.</p> <p>  The fear in respect of NIFTI or any other framework that will be used to evaluate programmes is that some key projects might not get through the loop.  For example, in the case of the northern distributor road in Limerick, the first phase is under construction, which is really welcome, although there is an issue with it that I wish to raise relating to the section from Coonagh to Knockalisheen in Meelick.  There is provision in the scheme for a walking and cycling route from Knockalisheen centre to Watch House Cross in Limerick, which is welcome, but there is currently no provision for walking and cycling infrastructure into the village of Meelick, which is very concerning.  There will be much more traffic on this road once the project has finished and we would be able to encourage people from Meelick village to walk or cycle into and out of Limerick.  Will the Minister put me in touch with an official in the Department of Transport to whom I can speak?  I have raised the matter with Clare County Council, which has acknowledged it is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  It would be beneficial if we were to tie in that work with the other ongoing work.</p> <p>  Turning to the second phase of the Limerick northern distributor road, is that project viewed positively by NIFTI?  It is a key strategic project for the mid-west, whether Clare, Limerick or north Tipperary, and it will provide much-needed better access to Limerick and the University of Limerick, UL, campus.  It is a key priority for the county councils of Clare, Limerick and Tipperary and an important component of the spatial plan the southern assembly has compiled.  It ticks all the boxes and we need to see progress on it.  Will the Minister come back to me on that?</p> <p>  Finally, he might also give us an update on the national aviation policy.  Has there been any work on that?  Will there be an opportunity for stakeholders to have input into that critical policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#G00700"><p>Yes, there will definitely be an opportunity for stakeholders to have input to the policy.</p> <p>  I might focus on the Deputy's first set of questions.  If we are going to differ on this, we might as well be honest, upfront and clear on why there are differences.  It is not anything ideological but I have clear views.  The potential for Limerick is huge, but I think that potential will be best met with the development of public and sustainable transport, particularly using the existing rail network as the centre for development.  It is encouraging that the NTA's work in Colbert Station provides a model for transformation of the city, addressing the housing crisis and providing economic development, which should be one of the first parts of the good work the authority is going to do.</p> <p>  If I were to look for a second example in Limerick, there are many examples I could highlight.  I will be pushing for, and hope to deliver within this three-year timeframe I mentioned, plans, funding and everything to be agreed and in development for a railway station in Moyross.  The reason behind that is there is a huge area of land, relatively underdeveloped, close to the city and within five minutes' walk of Thomond Park and Limerick Institute of Technology, and on a sustainable public transport route, which would be the epitome of good transport-led development.  I could go on with other examples, particularly in Limerick, where there is real opportunity.</p> <p>  My clear view is that the northern distributor road would take Limerick in a completely different direction, into Clare.  I acknowledge the college and the businesses upstream along the River Shannon will want to do that and will see that as an appropriate development, but the problem is we cannot do both.  We cannot say we will build back the centre of the core of Limerick and build around public transport and, at the same time, say we will extend into Clare on a roads-based system, which can only accentuate or continue a dispersed, unsustainable development model.  I have made that clear publicly before this committee and I will make it clear to the NTA and the council.  I could not have been clearer with the council manager and will say the same to the councillors with great respect.  I am clear in my view and I am not alone in that view.  TII, which I have asked about it, clearly feels it is not the right road project, although the agency may be influenced by the fact, as was said at a previous meeting, that there would be a huge contractual cost to the existing owners of the tunnel under the River Shannon if we built a further crossing over it, which would be a result of that northern distributor road project.  In a sense, it would go against NIFTI because, according to that framework, we should take into account what we have already built.</p><p> By going with the northern distributor road, we would completely undermine what was done in Limerick over the last ten or 20 years.  More importantly, it undermines what could be done in terms of bringing life back into the centre and creating a really attractive urban core.  The fact is that 3% of the population in Limerick is living in the historic core.  What I would prefer to do, as I said earlier, is deliver the example of the BusConnects projects for Limerick.  We are starting by including that funding this week for O'Connell Street.  One could argue whether we want that cross-city route through O'Connell Street or via the bus station, which would be a good connection point.  However, the NTA and others would come back and say that O'Connell Street and Limerick retail need a lift and that Limerick needs to create that special sense of place.  I believe that is the way to go.  Taking an alternative route on an unsustainable, uneconomic basis, without good transport planning in regard to the roads into County Clare, would be the last thing we should do in Limerick.</p></speech>

This is shocking news for the region.  I am disappointed with the attitude to this road.  It is a key objective of Clare County Council and of the local authorities in the region and has been for years.  Would this be a case where the Minister is interfering, on a personal level, because he thinks Limerick should develop in a certain way?  I look at Dublin and I see the Luas, heavy rail, light rail, roads and major investment.  Why can Dublin have both yet the Minister is saying the mid-west region cannot have both?  There has to be equity.  This is a key piece of infrastructure not just for County Clare but for the whole region.  It will open up UL and access to Shannon Airport and get things moving.  I absolutely agree that rail should be looked at and invested in, but why can we not do both?  Why can we not have this major investment in the mid-west just like we see in places like Dublin?</p></speech>

I have said the same thing three or four times now in this committee and it is not particularly new.  Yes, I have a role as the Minister responsible and included in that is my role around funding.  Limerick needs more investment in public transport, and that is my clear view.  We need to invest in the Ballybrophy line, which is being retracked at present and we are going to put extra funding into that.  The strategic rail review will, in regard to that line and the Waterford to Limerick line, ask the question as to what those lines are for.  Do we let them just chug along at bare minimum use or do we want to make strategic use of them?  I think we should make strategic use of them.  I think we should build new stations along that line.  It is not just that we have the stations in Nenagh and Castleconnell, but we need additional stations and we need to build around that and have the industrial estates served by that.</p> <p>  The Deputy knows that the Limerick to Ennis line lay unused for years.  It was then proposed 25 years ago that some money would be spent on it and everyone said it would never be used, but it has been hugely successful, to my mind.  I would like to see us putting in the stations, doubling down and going further.  Similarly, the existing rail line to Foynes has not been used but we will open it up for freight and for commuters.  I see no reason we should not do a spur to Mungret as well and put stations in at Dooradoyle, Crescent and Adare, and start creating that metropolitan rail network for Limerick.  Why is it that we have to change at Limerick Junction when going to Limerick?  Every time, people have to get out of the bloody train and get on a different one.  Why is it a single track from Limerick Junction to Colbert Station when we could twin-track that relatively easily and cheaply, for a fraction of what the road would cost, then put a station in at Ballysimon and watch that area bloom.</p> <p>  Yes, I think that is what we should be doing in Limerick.  I am unequivocal in my view that Limerick has been starved of good public transport options.  We put a lot of money into road and we built the bridge under the Shannon.  Another road and another bridge would undermine that first investment so let us build the public transport.  More than anything else, in the three-year timeframe in which we could do it, let us build BusConnects and the active travel that we are going to do in Dublin and Limerick as well.  I said to the city manager at the time we approved that road, which the people of Moyross really needed and wanted, that it was fine but on one condition.  The condition was that we open up and take down the walls in Moyross that separate it from the rest of the city and its communities, and build the active travel and BusConnects connection between UL, LIT and Mary Immaculate College.  I think that will transform the city in three years.</p></speech>

The Minister interfered in a process in Limerick.  The people of Moyross were entitled to it but the Minister created chaos.  The Coonagh-Knockalisheen route was to go in, but the Minister did everything possible to ensure it did not go through.  It has now gone through and it is going to make an enormous difference to people's lives.  Everyone agrees about the double line between Limerick Junction and Limerick.  We have all been proposing that for the last two years.  The Minister was not listening, although he is now listening.  To be honest, we agree with an awful lot of this stuff.  We agree with a rail system in Limerick.  The initial LSMATS plan did not have it and I put forward that it should use the existing rail lines.  That is not exclusive to the Minister.  We all proposed that.  The issues are not mutually exclusive.  We need to put a rail station into Moyross but, equally, we need to have connection into the area as well.  They are not mutually exclusive.  We need to put extra stations along the rail line and, in time, to have a spur to Shannon Airport off the Ennis rail line.  None of these are exclusive.  It is about that integrated model.  Limerick needs to progress across a range of areas, including the northern spur.  I will hand back to Deputy Carey.  I did not wish to interfere.</p></speech>

We built a station at Pelletstown recently which would be similar to the type of station to be put into Moyross, and it cost about &euro;12 million.  Could we build that in three years?  Could we get it through planning and get it constructed?  If we went about this climate crisis in the same way we went about the Covid crisis, could we do that?  I think we could.  I think the people in Moyross would see that as a hugely positive development.</p> <p>  There is a lot of work done, a lot of the network is already there and it is a matter of joining it up.

There is a long-standing issue that has been going on for 20 or 30 years in that the railway line floods annually.  I did not get a commitment from the Minister that he was going to sort that out.  Suddenly, now, we are going to have train stations everywhere and a spur to Shannon that has been talked about for 30 or 40 years.  I would greatly welcome that.  I would love to see the work starting tomorrow.  I would love to see a rail station in Moyross and stations throughout Limerick.  It makes sense.  The Ryder Cup is coming to our part of the world in a number of years and it would make an awful lot of sense to have that connectivity there.  However, I am talking about the here and now.  The Minister needs to bring people with him.  He needs to bring the region with him.  He needs to have another look at his policy in regard to the mid-west region.  He needs to ask why can our region not have both rail and road as alternatives.  The Minister needs to have another look at that.  The Minister needs to take that on board.</p></speech>

I will surprise him by not being as parochial as I usually am.  I have a few national issues to raise.  I am worried about NIFTI because I feel it is another fence in a process that could outdo the Grand National when it comes to building infrastructure.  I have been through this with the Minister before, particularly at the meeting in October.  It takes between eight and 15 years to build a road in this country.  To answer some of the questions the Minister put to my colleagues a few minutes ago about building rail lines, the problem is similar if not worse in rail.</p> <p>  There are many things we do right in Ireland.  It is a fantastic country to live in and I often think we put ourselves down too often.  However, here is one area we are not doing enough on, as I know the Minister will acknowledge.  That is investment in public transport.  It has been a problem historically.  I note Mr. Ebrill is here.  What we did with roads from the 1990s until 2010 was transformative.  Much of that was under Fianna F&aacute;il Governments and that is something our party holds dear and proud.  When it comes to the transitional or modal shift we require for investing in public transport, we are nowhere near where we should be in a country as developed as ours.  Given the wealth of the State in comparison with many countries, it could be strongly argued we are not doing enough.</p> <p>  I think it is sinful that, although the all-Ireland rail review is ongoing, we are not entertaining the proposal for high-speed rail in excess of 300 km/h.  It is daft.  I often hear many of the Minister's colleagues in the Green Party speaking about higher speed rail.  We need to look at that area.  I would almost disregard the transition to electric vehicles and put full focus on the electrification of intercity lines.  It is possible to travel from Cork to Dublin using technology that is already used in France, Belgium, the UK, Germany and China, for example.  This existing technology can be bought and implemented in Ireland and could provide journey times between our big cities of, in some cases, under an hour.  That would transform every part of rural Ireland, particularly on the existing Cork-Dublin, Dublin-Belfast and Limerick-Dublin lines.  I want to see the Minister, as a Green Party Minister who cares deeply about public transport, put a degree of focus on that.  This is not a bypass that will cost &euro;50 million; it is a multibillion euro investment that the Department should be looking at. </p> <p>  Is NIFTI just another analysis and another step to interrupt a process that is already highly complex?  I was delighted to hear Deputy Lowry refer to the planning process, which I have raised with the Minister already.  It is a disgrace as it stands.  The damage serial blockers are able to do to a process where there should be alternative ways for making representations when issues exist around planning is a huge concern to development in Ireland.  We know it has cost us billions of euro of potential investment.  The Minister made his point on the democratic process and I appreciate where he is coming from, but not to acknowledge that is an issue is a cause of serious concern.  The Minister needs to take that on board because walking the streets of rural Ireland, I find that it is an issue everywhere.  People come from far and wide to object to projects in towns.  Public transport is an area where that has been a huge hindrance.  Will the Minister reply on those points?  I will contribute again if the Chair gives me some time.</p></speech>

Hopefully that thinking goes into his submission to the strategic rail review, which is ongoing.  The specific opening requirement was to look at high-speed rail, originally on the Dublin-Belfast-Cork line but subsequently extended to other cities.  We are not ignoring it.  The interim funding done in the last year will shave something like ten minutes off the Dublin-Cork journey time.</p> <p>  The Deputy is looking at a bigger, bolder initiative.  I will give two or three personal thoughts in that regard.  First, I was at a conference in Cork about ten years ago attended by a leading academic from the UK.  I cannot remember his name but he was very impressive.  He made a point concerning other cities, particularly in a country as lopsided as ours with so much development in Dublin.  It was that investment in Cork, Limerick, Galway or Waterford does not undermine Dublin.  It is not either-or but that we need to invest in the regional cities at scale.  The real priority is building out as quickly as we can.  That is why we put the European recovery funding into Cork metropolitan rail.</p></speech>

I want to be very focused.  I appreciate the European relief funding is being directed towards the metropolitan rail network in Cork.  That is &euro;184.7 million, if my memory serves me.  I am talking about a multibillion euro investment in a Cork- Belfast line.  Joining up the network would involve tunneling under Dublin, the electrification of the entire line and dealing with getting from Heuston to Connolly.  There is no plan or discussion about that.  I know he Minister is doing the all-Ireland rail review but the public consultation for that closed on Friday so I cannot feed into that process.</p></speech>

It is an area we should look at and I say that because of the congestion coming into Dublin.  At the moment, for somebody living in Cork who wants to drive to Dublin, and there are thousands of such journeys every day, the rail journey time does not compete with the road journey time.  That is also the case for Limerick and Galway.  If the Minister wants to get cars off the road, we should not be talking about congestion charges or ways to fine and tax people; we should be looking at investing in alternative and more appropriate forms of transport over the next ten to 20 years.  It is a horrendous failure of investment that we have not connected the largest airport in the State to our rail network.  I think we can all accept that but it is up to us to fix it.  That is why I put these points forward to the Minister as part of this new NIFTI process.</p></speech>

Others are Oranmore station, the twin-tracking of Limerick, building out the metropolitan rail network, building Moyross station and moving the train station in Waterford.  These are all achievable, deliverable, immediate priorities.</p> <p>  It is not a case of saying "No" to a high-speed, 300 km/h, several billion euro line from Dublin to Cork.  However, there is risk.  Everyone says it is great that we have all the motorways going to Dublin.  What has happened?  Currently, 75% of new housing is in Dublin and the surrounding counties.  We have to start delivering better balanced regional development.  That is at the centre of the national planning framework.  The way to do that is light rail for Cork and Galway, as we discussed earlier, and metropolitan rail systems.  The Limerick rail network and the Cork metropolitan rail network will be perfect for the new battery electric trains we have bought, which could charge in Mallow and run to Midleton on that charge, or charge in Nenagh or Ballybrophy and run to Shannon on the other side.</p></speech>

We had a &euro;75 billion ask when we went into the national development plan and that is just for existing projects.  That is before we consider the Waterford-Limerick rail line which is underutilised.  In fact, we could reopen it to Rosslare if we were investing in rail or look at the Ballybrophy line, which is also underutilised.  To add another one to the mix, the small investment in the western rail corridor between Claremorris and Athenry is relatively inexpensive.  Which should we invest in first - a 300 km/h rail line to Dublin, the western rail corridor or the Waterford-Limerick rail line?</p></speech>

We do not see enough of it in the big Chamber so it is nice to see it in this room.</p> <p>  I will scale through a couple of issues on NIFTI.  Have any projects gone ahead over the past 20 years that the Minister believes would not have fallen within the framework of NIFTI as it has been constructed?  By the way, I think is a fantastic framework.  It is good and I welcome it.</p> <p>  What progress will be made on the Rosslare line?  One of the objectives of the Government, which the Labour Party supports, is increasing freight by rail.  A number of areas are booming in Ireland, one of which is Rosslare Europort, which has seen a 400% increase in traffic since Brexit.  However, everything that comes off those boats goes onto the roads.  What is the Minister's plan with regard to reopening the rail line there?</p> <p>  Another objective of the Government which everyone supports is the rolling out of greenways.  They are a success no matter where they are.  Are there any regions or areas in which there are competing priorities with regard to providing a greenway and also getting a rail line back into use for either a metropolitan line or the use of freight?  Can the Minister shed any light on that?</p> <p>  While I am discussing that area of the country, I will mention the Barrow Bridge that links counties Wexford and Kilkenny.  What are the plans regarding the future of that bridge?  Will it be left in the open position for navigation?  Are there any plans with regard to that?  One of the points of NIFTI is sustainability, protection and renewal.  This bridge, for example, is vulnerable to damage from storms such as the recent Storm Barra.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's thoughts on that.</p> <p>  Greater balanced regional development is something we all want to see and to which we all aspire.  There is a big debate about flexible work this week, which we have touched on in this debate.  Is the Minister satisfied with the Government's plans with regard to people being able to work from home and having a guarantee that they can do so?  This will be key.  We are already seeing the fruits of it in the property market and people's desire to go back and work in the communities in which they grew up or perhaps in a new community.  There is a desire to live in rural Ireland but it needs to be backed up with a workers first approach so that people can have certainty that if they are resettling or want to resettle, their jobs can go with them and decentralisation can happen, be it in the private or public sector.  It can happen now by people working from home as opposed to trying to move a whole Department and all the rest, as happened 20 years ago.  There are huge opportunities here.  I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on that debate as it relates to regional development.</p> <p>  On town centres, I spoke to a woman before Christmas as she moved into an apartment in a town in my constituency.  It is not above a shop; it is in an apartment block.  It is adjacent to being above a shop, however.  She commented how positive that was and how she felt she was right in the centre of things near the shops and coffee shops she goes to.  Above-shop living is actually quite desirable to people.  When does the Minister believe changes will be made in our planning legislation and planning objectives to promote that?  We saw it on a grand scale when we had the lockdowns in Dublin and the major cities in 2020.  They were deserted because people were no longer living in them.</p> <p>  My dad met his brother and his best friend in the centre of Dublin where they grew up.  He commented on how Thomas Street is just not the vibrant street it used to be when he grew up.  I replied that neither he, his brother or his best friend live there any more.  They went back because that is their home.  They go back for a pint and all the rest but how do we ensure the next generation of people who are growing up there will stay in the city and that we can return people to the centre of our cities in a very real way?  We know that developments are coming through.  I am not someone who likes to object to development because at the coalface of advice clinics, I see people who need roofs over their heads.  As patchy as our current social housing framework is at the moment, a portion of anything that is built will go to our local authorities for allocation.  That is still a driving force, however broken our system may be.</p> <p>  When will we really and truly deliver public and affordable housing in communities, be it above a shop or a one, two or three-bedroom dwelling?  Whatever the units may be or however they look, when are we going to deliver to the extent that we will really regenerate Dublin, Galway or anywhere in between?</p></speech>

I will go right back to when I was involved in the Dublin transportation advisory committee in the mid-1990s.  I was very involved in the development of the Platform for Change plan, which was really the best plan, one which we rooted in good, deep, sustainable planning concepts.  I will always remember when - it must have been in 1999 or 2000 - the engineers and all the brains behind that plan gave us a presentation with a slide that read whatever we do, build the metro first and do not widen the M50 first.  What did we do?  We widened the M50 first and did not do the metro.  As a result, Dublin has now developed as a doughnut city.  That is not blaming anyone but that was a fundamental mistake.  In setting a strategic direction for the city, it is going to very hard to recreate a sustainable model.  We will do it but that is an example.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about freight.  Again, included in that is this idea of Dublin being at the centre of everything.  I believe 95% of roll-on roll-off freight comes through Dublin Port.  Roll-on roll-off is our main freight and haulage mode.  Everything comes into Dublin Port, drives through the Dublin Port tunnel and down the country to drop off stuff before going out through Dublin Port again.  It is the biggest challenge when it comes to climate.  We have a real issue with how we are going to address this.  The haulage business is not making money out of it.  The rail review includes looking at freight.  We are looking at a wider haulage strategy.  That will require a whole range of different solutions such as how we fit the circular economy into it, among other things.</p> <p>  To give an example of greenways competing against other public priorities, I will perhaps take Rosslare Port which, again, is developing, particularly for roll-on roll-off freight.  With Brexit, the land bridge is less attractive so we are seeing much more going through Rosslare.</p><p>On the issue of the rail line, the Deputy mentioned the Barrow Bridge.  It is being kept in the position that it can be opened until after the rail review.  We await the findings of that.  Some people are saying that rail line could be turned into a lovely greenway while others want it to be connected to the port.  With Rosslare set to become more strategically important for the State, some ask why we would get rid of that rail connection.  That is an example.</p><p> The western rail corridor was mentioned previously.  If members want to get into a civil war, as Senator Dooley might know, his friends further along the western coast - Deputies from counties Mayo and Galway - have very different views on whether we should develop that line as a rail corridor or as a greenway.  I dare not even mention the subject because it is so sensitive.  There are examples like that.</p><p> On the issue of remote working, it is full of real benefits and potential.  It has the potential for us to revitalise rural Ireland, develop hubs and towns across the country and transform how the country works for the better.  For many people, working form home is going to be very attractive.  They have found over Covid that it works.  There are some risks to it.  First, we need to avoid the risk of not taking the road space while we have it.  Going back to what I said earlier about the much reduced level of commuting, we should quickly and urgently, in the next two to three years, make sure we do not return to having every distributor road going into the city full of traffic, which will inexorably happen.  Traffic fills the road space, so we need to take some of that space, particularly in the city centres.</p><p> Working from home could also accentuate what we have seen in the hollowing-out of some areas.  In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, the south inner city suffered particularly during Covid.  While the north inner city at least had a large number of people living in it, in the south inner city, where there is a large number of offices, hotels and retail spaces, it did not have enough people in it.  We need to bring people back in to Thomas Street and elsewhere.  We have been trying to do it and talking about it for decades, but it is time for us to do it.  The point I made earlier in respect of Tipperary town applies just as much to Thomas Street.</p><p> The provision of public land is also an issue.  Our Department has responsibility for Dublin Port.  We are going to take land from Dublin Port and give it over for housing.  As we build the DART+ out west to Maynooth and the need for the storage of trains is moved beyond Maynooth, we can then take the incredible storage site in Inchicore which is a massive centre for potential development.  We can and will turn Cathal Brugha Barracks into a new living quarter close to the centre of the city where residents will not need a car.  One of the questions being raised is how to bring down the cost of apartments and provide affordable cost-rental housing in the likes of Cathal Brugha Barracks.  People can walk from that location into town.  It is close to good public transport infrastructure.  People in that area will often be working perhaps five or ten minutes down the road.  As is happening in cities right across Europe, where there are sustainable zones, we could put 1,000 homes in there and car parking would not be required.  We would save a fortune because the land is very valuable.  We could create really high-quality development in that location, which is beside the canal.</p><p> We will take the through traffic out of Rathmines main street, which was designed as a stunning boulevard.  Let us bring that back and put the housing in with it.  That is utterly doable.  There is a clear commitment in Government to housing.  It is our first priority.  Young people will continue to be priced out of our State unless we take these bold measures.  It will not be easy for the Army, but we can build new, better, high-quality barracks, whether it is at Baldonnel, Gormanston or McKee Barracks.  They need modernisation.  At the same time, we could use the land at the Cathal Brugha Barracks for sustainable communities close to the centre.  We need to get people back in the centre of our cities, particularly in south Dublin and Dublin city.  The area is hugely successful but it cannot just be a financial services and tourism centre and not be our town where we live.</p></speech>

The same goes for towns in my own constituency, such as Swords and Balbriggan, and even villages like Lusk and Balrothery.  The closer people can live to the centre, the better.  I thank the Minister for his response.  I want it noted that I did not bring up MetroLink.  It can happen, when the Minister is in front of me, that I do not mention MetroLink.  That is not to say it is still not my priority.  I was happy to hear the Minister mention it in the context of what we could have done 20 years ago and state that he is supporting the strategic objectives we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#L00300"><p>I thank the Minister for attending and taking questions on such a wide range of issues.  I will focus on a few areas, one of which is active travel.  The Government has made a significant commitment on this issue and there was a launch earlier this week.  The bike-to-work scheme excludes large numbers of people.  Should it be expanded?  Should we have a central plan for our cycle network?  We can look at a roads map or a rail infrastructure map but we cannot look at a map or plan for our cycling network.  That is a difficulty when these projects are being delivered locally.  There is sometimes significant resistance to projects and arguments that we are building cycle paths to nowhere.  For example, I can look at the Project Ireland 2040 plan and every project that TII is delivering.  I can see at what stage of development it is, for example, if it is at design stage, and a number of key indicators in relation to that.  I think we should have the same for our cycle network.  We should also have champions.  I know there are various programmes, but there is not enough there yet in terms of local champions and leadership in relation to it.  Those are the points I wish to raise on delivering active travel.  I agree there is ambition there from Government.  However, while the Climate Advisory Council also agreed there is ambition, it asserted that there is a deficit in implementation.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is accessibility and affordability of public transport, whether in school transport in our urban centres or in our rural communities and villages.  There is a significant opportunity to enhance that.  Again, the Government has plans but I am raising the delivery of those plans.  Like other members who have spoken, I can give the Minister multiple examples of people in new communities in my constituency who have told me they were thankful their son or daughter had passed the driving test and is ready to go on the road because there is no public transport to the train station and the price of the train ticket is extortionate, particularly in areas outside the greater Dublin area.  While there is positive policy intent, we are a long way off in terms of practical delivery.  How does the Minister intend to address the accessibility and affordability of public transport, principally public bus transport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#L00400"><p>On active travel, the Deputy is absolutely right.  We need a national network.  A company called Sustrans was involved initially in delivering the UK model and developed a national cycle network.  Such networks work for a variety of different reasons, particularly in relation to tourism.  We can sell Ireland abroad as a place to come and cycle or walk, activities which are hugely popular and will grow.  Critically, we must ensure that these are not seen as just leisure and tourist routes.  The network should be seen as bringing people into and through the town or city.  That is why we have amended the mandate for TII to give it the job in that area.  TII is an incredibly effective delivery agency.  It has good engineering and contracting experience.  It is good at dealing with landowners in respect of compulsory purchase orders.  That national network is key.</p> <p> The position is similar when it comes to the cities, although it is not only TII that is involved.  The NTA is working on these metropolitan area transport plans on a statutory basis in Dublin and on an advisory basis in the other cities.</p><p>Included within that are the cycling plans, and even down beneath that.  Again, I am able to pick Dublin as an example.  What I have seen in the four Dublin councils is that they are evolving and developing really good progressive cycling plans.  They have to be rolled out in an integrated way, so it is not a case of having bits here and there.  We are doing the Royal Canal at the moment, and we do need to complete the entire route.  It will be politically difficult because I know there are some sensitive areas along the route.  Similarly on the south side, we have done some really good bits on the Grand Canal between Portobello and Baggot Street, but we have not linked it up to Inchicore and further out.  We have also done really good work on the north quays of the Liffey, but the south quays are horrific.  This year we are building a really good cycle route from Clontarf into the city centre, but there is no point if it gets to Beresford Place or to the Millennium Bridge and we are into the horrible multi-lane car dominated transport system on Pearse Street or Tara Street.  It does have to be part of an integrated network.  What I am saying to the NTA in particular, and I will say it to local authorities &ndash; I had a meeting with 350 engineers on Zoom this morning &ndash; is to do the co-ordinated bit first.  The same thing applies to Limerick.  Routes must be coherent and not stop-start.  They should not have a pole in the middle of the route or throw people out into the traffic in an unsafe way and promise them safety.</p><p> Coherent city and national networks are what we have to do in active travel.  We will do this.  We are only warming up.  The level of spend has been slow to date &ndash; it was &euro;45 million four years ago and it will be up to &euro;289 million this year.  That is not a small increase.  It took time to get the engineers in the offices.  It is still taking time.  Dublin City Council has been unconscionably slow in getting some of the staff in, but they are coming.  The key issue is the councillors.  They must buy into the vision.  For example, in Dublin city centre, councillors in Dublin City Council must decide if it is their view to stop the city being dominated by cars as part of the revival of the city.</p><p> In terms of accessibility and the cost of transport &ndash; I also include disability access as a key element in this, and the availability of public transport - one of the key issues in the Connecting Ireland public transport project is that it provides public transport to the people with the least public transport, who are often in the villages in rural areas.  That is key.  We have a number of initiatives in Dublin city, for example, the 90-minute fare and improvements to the Leap card as part of the BusConnects project.  It is a significant benefit to be able to hop from the DART to the bus or the Luas to the bus and so on.  We are extending a lot of the Leap zones.  In Cork, Mallow, for example, is being included.  I remember Deputy Sherlock was always pushing for that and I am glad we are delivering it.  We will have a youth fare this spring, initially on the public transport routes but also on private routes, although that will take a little bit longer.  That halving of the fares for people in their early 20s is important to get them into the habit of using public transport.</p><p> As I said, I was at a meeting the NTA organised with engineers around the country.  There was a simple slide put up which I will share subsequently with the committee as it is something that I have always held to be true.  Again, I am looking at Dublin city, because it is my city.  Most households in Dublin city do not have a car.  The biggest accessibility problem we have is that historically we were always investing in the private transport system and ignoring the fact that anyone with a disability or a low income who could not afford a car were not benefitting from that.  In fact, they were often the people who suffered most from the air pollution and from the unsafe road conditions.  The first key social justice aspect of transport to my mind is to switch towards active travel and public transport because that benefits the poorest in society disproportionately.  I do not think that is a bad thing for us to do.  That is the key.</p><p> I agree with some of the points made about pricing.  It is very expensive on some of the routes.  We will systematically address it.  It is not easy.  There are so many different calls on the money.  It is not like a magic wand, but the first principle is to support those less well-off in society by investing in public transport and active travel.</p></speech>

I agree with what the Minister said about the city.  Many people living in rural and regional areas, who are not serviced by good public transport and in some cases none at all, are forced into car ownership.  We heard from Dr. Hannah Daly and others at the climate committee about long-term affordability.  I have lived that experience myself when I was commuting in and out of Dublin.  On a point of principle, I was taking public transport because it was part time, but the minute I moved to the car I was saving time and saving money.  That is not the way it is supposed to be.  We need to build a system that improves on that.</p> <p>  I wish to raise with the Minister a couple of points relating to projects in my county.  We have the Boyne greenway which is proceeding at a frustratingly slow pace.  The initial feasibility study on it was done in 2011.  I met with the Navan cycling initiative last night.  It raised its frustrations in terms of the practical delivery of the project.  In the first instance, we need to expand the greenway from Navan to Trim and while it should be, it is not on the radar at all.  I know projects of that type and scale have been progressed in other areas in a more efficient way.</p> <p>  I also wish to pick up on the Government's initiative for students commuting to college.  Is there an indicative timeline for the new scheme?  How will it apply to public transport and also to private operators?</p></speech>

It will be a couple of months because we have to update all the systems, but we are on track to deliver it according to the timeframe set out.  I do not have the details on the Boyne greenway but I will have a look at it.  I would be interested in getting Deputy O'Rourke's views on the extension from Navan to Trim.  We were asked earlier about examples of old railway lines, which could be greenways or could be reintroduced as rail, and it is one of those examples.  Is part of that the old Kingscourt line or is it separate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#M00500"><p>No, it is separate.  There are particular issues at the Navan to Drogheda end because there is an old navigation pathway along the Boyne, which is a complication in terms of development, but there are not the same constraints on the Navan to Trim section.  However, that is not proceeding and it is something we would like to see progress at a pace.</p></speech>

What I am saying to TII is that we must be careful we do not over-engineer.  We learnt during Covid that we could do things very quickly.  The critical political decision is for there to be a good surface and to provide the space.  Does it have to be the mother of all engineering solutions with all the bells and whistles?  Greenways in particular do not carry heavy weight.  More than anything else, it is a matter of reallocating space.  TII must be careful not to over-engineer in some of the solutions.  We can always go back and re-engineer if there is a particular problem.  Speed is of the essence now.  We can test it, and it is great if it works, we can double down on the investment and if it does not, we can take it out.  A lot of the time now, it is all about the speed of delivery.  We must give the same message to TII and councils; to build quickly here.  I know that is not easy sometimes because of the planning system but the public will be supportive of these new services because they really want them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#M00700"><p>I thank the Minister's officials for the briefing yesterday on NIFTI.  It was very clear and concise and explained to a lot of people what NIFTI does and does not do.  My understanding is that it does not choose projects, but it was described as a lens through which to assess a project and how it fits with national strategic objectives in terms of planning and other infrastructure.</p><p>It is important when we are spending large amounts of public money that they comply with those overall strategic objectives.</p><p> I am getting a bit of stick over the N11 in my constituency.  I am reassuring people that we will continue with the safety improvement works that need to be done on the N11.  We need to maintain our roads to ensure they are safe.  We will continue to improve those access points for that roadway to improve safety and help people get on and off that road.  There are too many exit points onto it as well.</p><p> In tandem we will still proceed with providing express bus routes along that road, which is key.  We cannot continue to spend billions of euro on roads and then be expected to spend billions of euro on public transport where they are running beside each other creating competition.  We need to be careful about how we spend the money.  The N11 has sufficient capacity.  If we can get people onto express bus routes and invest in the rail line which is running parallel to and which serves all those population centres down the east coast of Wicklow, that is a smart way to do it.  I hope I am right in assuring people that we will proceed with those kinds of measures.  The initial plan of six or seven different selected routes across greenfield sites, sensitive environmental areas, third lanes and talks of tunnels was just crazy and created considerable concern among residents.  I think we have achieved the right balance there.</p><p> I was delighted to hear so much discussion on rail earlier.  As the Minister knows, it is an issue close to my heart.  I have never heard so much discussion on investment and support for investment in rail infrastructure throughout the country.  However, we need to be clear on it.  We need to sweat the existing assets.  When people talk about high-speed rail, I do not think they understand that to put high-speed rail in place would probably require having four tracks between Cork and Dublin which would cost billions of euro.  We should use the existing infrastructure, and ensure those trains run at good frequency at good speeds and serve the population centres along the way.</p><p> The key to sustainable public transport is that it must serve populations.  I think of stations such as Avoca, Geashill in Offaly and even Castlebellingham in Louth.  They are areas where for a small amount of money we could open a station and bring a bit of life and vibrancy back into those towns and build sustainability into them.  A lot of life was brought to towns by bringing the railways to them, and a lot of life was taken away from towns by closing railways and depending on cars for getting around the place.  That did enormous damage from the 1960s onwards and we need to reverse that trend.</p><p> The southern arch route from Wexford to Waterford and on to Limerick could bring that connectivity back.  It would cost a small amount by comparison with road investment.  I believe the electrification of the rail line from Greystones to Wicklow town could be done for about &euro;20 million, which is small when compared with the price tag on road investment.  NIFTI provides a good opportunity for us to do that.  Is it meeting a strategic objective?  Does it support compact growth?  Does it support decarbonisation?  It is a helpful tool to have for that.</p><p> The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently discussed transport-oriented development, TOD, with representatives of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, who produced an excellent report on TOD about two years ago.  Is there enough collaboration and discussion involving the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Transport and agencies such as the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the CI&Eacute; group to identify an area where, if we provide more trains or buses, we could increase the population to make it a self-sustaining town where those other services follow because there is a population of scale there?  Is there enough of that TOD discussion going on involving the Department of Transport, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the LDA and Irish Rail?  Irish Rail can develop a railway station pretty simply.  It has been doing so for years and has off-the-shelf designs that would fit perfectly.  It can do it pretty quickly and it might be worth looking at towns, especially those with closed stations.  I ask the Minister to consider all those points.</p></speech>

I would love to know his views on what we do with the Wexford line.  It is a stunning rail line.  It passes through Avoca and Rathdrum and is probably one of the most spectacular rail journeys in the world.  Do we use it effectively?  I come back to asking this fundamental question in the national rail review particularly because it is subject to coastal erosion.  We will need to invest a lot of money to just maintain the existing line.  As we are doing that, I agree with the Deputy about a bus corridor on the N11 and the electrification of the rail line as far south as Wicklow.  I would be interested to hear in the Deputy's views.  I said earlier that some of these new battery electric trains can sometimes extend the electrification.  The advantage with that is they involve a quicker pick-up.  They are in and out of the station in less time.  They are much cheaper and cleaner to run.  There are many benefits.  I would be interested to hear the Deputy's views.</p> <p>  There is real co-ordination coming between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Transport.  As I said earlier, we need to accelerate to meet our climate objectives.  We need to show the same urgency we showed in dealing with Brexit and Covid to deliver because otherwise we will not meet our climate targets.  Looking at various Departments in detail, transport is the biggest challenge by far.  We need the same urgency and the same can-do approach to turn things around.  That will require teams in the public service that pull all our agencies together.  We have done that with the Covid pandemic, with Ministers meeting officials every week to ask if it is happening.  We need that level of engagement to drive change at the scale and speed we need.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has a critical role in this.  As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, I would love to see better analysis of actual outcomes with the national planning framework.  My sense is that we are not actually delivering that.  The truth is that there is still concentrated development on the east coast and a dispersed development model which is very hard to service with public transport.  Some good things are happening and it is not all bad.</p> <p>  Part of the problem is that we do not have good data.  The data system the Dublin local authorities have is different from Cork's which is different from the rest of the country when it comes to assessing what is happening on the ground with planning and housing.  We can get aggregate information for a county, but that does not give the granularity of detail we need to ensure that we are getting sustainable compact low-carbon balanced regional development.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage might look at what is happening today.  Are the transport policies we are introducing today delivering the outcomes we want?</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that NIFTI is this lens.  It is all about the national planning framework.  If we are not meeting the objectives, we should be clear about that.  As well as meeting climate plans we also need to meet those planning objectives, including town centre first.  I am terrified that we will end up with local authority housing in the centres of cities and towns with still a mass evacuation of the better-off outside leaving us without the sustainable mass we need to make attractive vibrant communities using existing infrastructure and assets.  While there is good co-operation between our Departments, we have a lot of work to do to get a detailed analysis of what is happening on the ground, not just at county level but down to the district electoral divisions.  We will need to work on that project jointly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#N00500"><p>The great thing about this committee is that approximately seven minutes is always loose, which is to the credit of the Chairman because he is very good at giving latitude.  It also allows the Minister to have an exchange with us.  It is always appreciated.</p> <p>  We had a very good briefing session with departmental officials yesterday.  It is a very good idea because it short-circuits some of the stuff and answers many of the questions we may have.  A colleague of mine from the time I was on Clare County Council, P.J. Kelly, has been a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor for a long time; I think he is Ireland's longest serving councillor and is a really talented person.  He once referred to our county development plan as the refusal kit because he said there were many good policies there but there also were many policies that automatically shut down or refuse development.  None of us wants NIFTI to become the same over the lifetime of this Government.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we were briefed on the hierarchy of the options and how everything works.  However, that needs to work positively.  The Minister and the officials who are present need to work through that menu of options.  When a road or other infrastructure is involved, of course, we first need to remediate it and bring it up to modern standards before building something new.</p><p>I get all of that requirement for value for money and meeting public needs, but please do not allow it to become the "refusal kit", as P.J. Kelly would have called it.  We spoke in the Chamber some months ago about the Limerick northern distributor road, phase 1 of which is progressing fantastically down along the Clare-Limerick border area.  The Chairman can attest to that.  Phase 2, however, remains in a state of limbo.</p><p> I have been watching this whole debate from my office.  Reference was made to a lot of rail projects, which again I am very enthusiastic about.  A few months ago all of us in our constituencies went onto media, social media and the airwaves to talk about the national planning framework and all of the very positive projects that were going to happen including rail spurs out to Shannon Airport with many stops along the way in suburban Limerick, north Clare and on up to Ennis.  There was a mixed review from people.  Many people were as delighted and enthused as I am, while many others felt that it was pie in the sky.  I do not want to put words in the Minister's mouth but earlier he touched on this.  These projects must go through a lot of hoops and are often delayed by many years.  That concerns me.  I hope the Minister will champion moving things quickly through all of those realms so they become shovel-ready projects that are actually going to be delivered.  I believe the Minister and his officials want to see this.  However, I do not believe we can have a scenario where a metro north delay happens with every nice project that we now look forward to and anticipate around the country.</p><p> I happened to be in Beijing in the year it hosted the Olympic Games.  That was a worst-case scenario because they brought bulldozers through parts of the old town to clear it for fancy shiny stadiums.  That is not where we want to be at.  Equally, we cannot have environmental lobbyists who are based in the heart of Dublin city objecting time and again to projects in Clare.  I will not name this person because that would be an abuse of the committee, but it has happened time and again.  It has held up key projects such as the Killaloe bypass that are now happening.  There must be some entry threshold or pre-qualification for someone to object.  I would not, in a month of Sundays, object to a project in the Minister's constituency, elsewhere in Dublin or in Wicklow.  I would not do so because what does it matter to me?  I am at the other side of the country.  There are, however, people who meddle continually in what is happening in County Clare and in the mid-west.  We must have some pre-qualifiers to ensure we do not see all of these projects fall off the cliff because of vexatious and interfering objections.</p><p> I have some questions, and I want to leave time for the Minister to respond.  I believe the Minister will have to grasp the issue of rail ticket pricing.  I have some real-time information.  I have been fiddling around on my phone here on the Irish Rail app.  I travelled with Irish Rail this morning and I use it as many days as I can to get to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We are a family with three children and it is a rite of passage for every Irish family have a day out at Dublin Zoo and go home again.  Today it will cost a family of five &euro;182.57 for a return train journey with Irish Rail from Limerick Station to Dublin's Heuston Station and back in the evening.  By contrast, the same family of two adults and three children could today take an overnight sleeper train from Amsterdam to Vienna for &euro;75.80, with bed and board and everything going on that train.  It is wrong.  It is more than double-fold a journey.  As another contrast, I could mention the little holiday that my family have already booked this year.  In August, we will fly from Shannon Airport to Edinburgh with Ryanair for approximately &euro;120.  It is ludicrous.  I love the train and train journeys.  I am a huge advocate for getting on the train and using it, as much as Deputy Matthews is.  It is absolutely insane to think that one can go from Amsterdam to Munich, or from Shannon to Edinburgh, more cheaply than one can travel to Dublin by train, which is a journey of one hour and 55 minutes.  It is crazy and it is deterring people from using the train.  We want to see modal shifts and new attitudes, but it will not happen unless the price is right.  I really want the Minister to grasp that.</p><p> My final point to the Minister is school transportation.  We can talk time and again about decarbonising our economy, putting more trains on and opening new stations but the answer is to consider what happens in July and August.  When the schools are closed, it is easier to get from one side of Dublin to the other or from one side of Ennis to the other.  Even in Limerick city, where the Chairman is from, or in any other town in Ireland, one can get from one side to the other with relative ease because the schools are closed and there are not 1.8 million cars making school journeys in the mornings.  It will take some devising, but the answer is for the Minister and his Department to seize control of school bus transportation from the Department of Education, take it over and put bus after bus on the road.  I imagine that the Department of Education would be glad to offload it.</p></speech>

I have often said in this committee that we need to advance a lot of projects in the Clare area and in the west of Ireland.  Reopening a train line is fine but building a new rail line takes many years of procurement and different stages, which are arduous and costly.  A new hydrogen-powered Scania bus for &euro;100,000 would bring people every half hour on an existing road network, and that makes a huge difference.  In my neighbourhood we have a very enhanced bus service into Limerick city from south Clare.  It was approved and then six or seven weeks later it was functional.  This should also be in the nexus of solutions.  I have thrown a lot at the Minister, but I know as always he will have plenty to say, and I thank him in advance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#O00400"><p>I agree with the Deputy that we need to make public transport cheaper.  It is a difficult balancing act because there is a whole variety of ways in which we need to make it cheaper.  As I mentioned earlier, the Connecting Ireland new public transport service for rural Ireland is a hugely progressive development.  That needs new money and additional public service obligation, PSO, subvention.  It needs the Exchequer to be able to provide.  We are already very tight on the PSO.  How exactly we make the finances work and how we do this is a critical issue.  I would be arguing that we should do this.  The Deputy can mention it to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, in his conversations in advance of the budget later this year.  I would be very happy to support it.</p> <p>  There is one thing to flag among all the difficulties.  I have been one of the first to be upfront in saying that we are not going fast enough and that things are not working as well as I would like.  One thing we should not ignore is that prior to the Covid pandemic, public transport numbers were going up steeply.  There was a huge demand, despite the price problems that do exist and particularly for families in the circumstances like that.  While I do not have the exact figures here, across the board Irish Rail numbers were increasing in almost double digits per year.  It was the same in the bus services.  The more this gets better, the better the chance of bringing down public transport fares.  We want to build a virtual circle of success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#O00500"><p>Irish Rail at the time was very competitive on price if people booked online.  We all use rail.  Punctuality on Irish Rail is very good and the staff are very good, but the broadband is very poor and mobile coverage is non-existent.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  The Minister should be going back to Irish Rail to ask what it can do to enhance broadband, to get mobile coverage and to enhance the range of customers who would use it.  I can get from Limerick city to Leinster House quicker by train than by driving.  It is not the exclusive of any particular group who are pro-rail.  I want both rail and road.  I do not wish to digress but I get frustrated when people speak about rail.  There are fundamental issues at the moment.  There are a lot of positives but the two major negatives are broadband coverage and mobile coverage.  The broadband is not great and the mobile coverage is a complete and utter disaster.  In this modern day and age that should not be the case.  If we want people to travel by train and encourage them to travel by train, they will do so.  A business person will drive because he or she will want to have mobile coverage in the car.  One cannot take that risk in a train.  These are basic things that can be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-26a.1237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022012600002#O00600"><p>Taking Clare for example, I agree with what was said about the bus service.  We need rail and it is important, but I recall some years ago Ennistymon was served by just one or two buses a day.  I agree about the costs, and the ability for us to double or triple that, and then the response when there is a reliable service is transformational.  There are incredible towns and beautiful villages in Clare, right across the county.  Reference was made earlier to Tulla.  In Kilrush, Kilkee and right up to Lisdoonvarna, my sense is that a lot of them are starting to revive.  People are thinking that they can raise a family and work remotely in County Clare, in a really attractive local environment with a strong culture.  Some places are doing more than others.  I will not give names here but everyone knows that certain villages are holding up while others are not.  What is it?  Why is it that one revives but not the other?</p><p>This might go back to the projects we fund.  Connecting Ireland is critical because we could design a route in County Clare, as is starting to happen, where there are Local Link services.  Previously, the Loop Head peninsula had a system whereby the post delivery was also a bus system.  We need that sort of integrated transport planning that kills two birds with one stone and provides a regular service.  Those towns and villages in County Clare in particular - not just Ennis, but all the towns and villages in the county- could really boom if they were on that bus service route.  They will always be served by bus rather than by rail.</p><p> As regards the important review of the school bus transport system by the Minister for Education, I was merely saying we have to wait and see what it says in respect of the right way to go about it.  If the Department of Transport has a greater role, then we should not shy away from that, particularly if it can provide some of that interconnectivity such that the bus transport for schools is connected to the wider enhancement of public transport systems.  We will not be shy if that is the right thing to do, but that will be a matter for the Minister for Education and the Government to call.</p></speech>

I suppose the green way of life is how he has lived all of his life but, ideologically, many people did not buy into the greening of Ireland until recently.  Far more people will not make the modal shift until it makes sense for their pocket.  I get what he is saying about the PSO but, unfortunately, people will not make the modal shift to rail if a journey costs &euro;182 for a family.  I can raise the issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, but I hope the Cabinet will look at it holistically because it is simple.  If there was a maximum price limit on rail travel such that you could take a family of five up to Dublin and back for &euro;30, suddenly it would be more competitive and more efficient than going by car and it would make far more sense for the Department to acquire additional carriages and have longer trains that get to Dublin more quickly, as well as for all the other good reasons.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I mentioned the concern that many of these projects to which we look forward could be delayed.  Can the Minister give any hope of indication in respect of the line of stops from Limerick city to various locations in south Clare and out to Shannon airport?  When or how might that be progressed?</p></speech>

As Deputy Matthews stated, we could build stations on existing lines relatively cheaply.  Irish Rail has project plans it could take off the shelf that are not hugely expensive.  I would start with Moyross in the next three years and then build out from there.  We can do it and the council can help by doing the planning around it with the Land Development Agency so that we get housing benefit as well as transport development.  I see no reason we should not start building out the network in the next three years.</p> <p>  I have a timing difficulty as I have to join the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste at a press conference at 4.15 p.m.</p></speech>

I was due on at 2.57 p.m. but it is now 3.53 p.m.  I wish the Minister had said that an hour ago or after I finished speaking.  Not to worry.  I will do my best.  There is a lot in NIFTI but, although it is a new name, there were programmes and structures before.  I again thank the officials for the presentation yesterday.  There was previously the strategic investment framework for land transport, which considered projects.  NIFTI makes sense.  There is a lot of jargon in it.  There are investment priorities, modal hierarchies and intervention hierarchies.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe spoke about moving people from private to public transport.  I will try to develop that point and ask how we get people from private and even public transport to active travel, with a particular emphasis on people in the school scenario, at both primary and secondary levels.  The Minister knows D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown particularly well.  The safe routes to school programme and many other initiatives are happening there, though not all of it has total buy-in yet.  Some projects will get such buy-in but others will not.  We have to get people early.  I would nearly say we should be giving every primary school person the option of having a bike for a year for free and seeing how that works out.  They would not be given a bike but allowed to hire it free of charge and asked to use it for a year to see if it will work.  If they are using the bike, it can be sold to them.  We need to get people trying to travel by bicycle.</p> <p>  The Minister and I are very familiar with the Goatstown Road-Clonskeagh Road.  It is a great road but it is now almost over capacity in terms of bikes.  It is difficult to get past people cycling more slowly than you are.  A person may be cycling behind me and want to get past but will have to try to negotiate the wands and everything else.  It is better than it was but we need to encourage people who have never cycled or who have not cycled in 20 or 30 years to say they actually do not need that.  There are barriers.  Those barriers are not just the provision of showering facilities at workplaces and that kind of thing.  Leinster House is, by a significant margin, the safest place in Dublin to park a bicycle, although I suppose the Government Buildings complex is probably just as safe.  However, there are many places in the city where you would not park a bicycle with the confidence that it will still be there when you return two or three hours later having gone for a meal or to the cinema or something.  That is a significant barrier.</p> <p>  As a Government and as a State, we need to see what is stopping people from trying to cycle or walk.  What is stopping them from moving up that modal hierarchy?  The most reliable way in terms of time for me to get to Leinster House is by bicycle.  If I can travel by bike, I do so.  There are many people, however, who have never tried it.  They do not have a bicycle, have not thought about it and may not qualify for the bike-to-work scheme.  They would need to make an investment to get going.  I refer to the motor tax pricing system.  People are charged a significant amount of motor tax upfront.  They pay a large amount in motor tax and car insurance and may have already outlaid &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500 of a fixed cost.  Even with fuel at its current price, that is a difficulty because people have already shelled out all that money.  Although it may be difficult to do and account would need to be taken of people who have to travel long distances, we should consider whether motor tax should be based on usage rather than on the type of car.  Under the current system, once the motorist has paid the tax on the car, there is an incentive to drive it, rather than it being the other way around.</p> <p>  Much of what I intended to raise has been covered.  Last week, you could fly with Ryanair to Cyprus for &euro;7.99.  You certainly cannot get to Killarney by train for &euro;7.99 at any time of the day or year.  I am sure that not everybody on that plane was travelling for &euro;7.99 but Irish Rail may need to get more competitive.  Maybe it needs to run offers, such as a &euro;10 or &euro;5 fare to Killarney on Tuesday mornings, for example.  That would ensure the train is full.  I can drive to Killarney, although it would take me a while.  However, it would also take me a significant amount of time to drive to Heuston Station and find parking, or even to get their by train, bus or bicycle.  There would then be the issue of finding a safe space to park the bike or maybe take it on the train.  Much of the time, issues such getting into town and getting out of town at the other end, such as if you are not travelling to Killarney town itself, for example, are the barriers that prevent people from moving up the hierarchy.</p> <p>  I welcome NIFTI as a concept.  I understand we are relatively short on time and I want to allow time for the Minister to respond.  We need to keep as many people as possible remote working.  The Goatstown Road-Drumartin Link Road was mentioned this morning on AA Roadwatch.  Many people who did not have to travel previously are now travelling again.  They may feel they ought to travel into work or maybe they are being asked to do so.  There are many people in back-office operations who have been able to work successfully from home and, as such, have not had to travel to work.  Employers and employees, together with the Government, should try to ensure that people can continue to do so.  Part of that relates to improving the provision of broadband, which the committee will discuss tomorrow.</p> <p>  We need to keep people off the roads if they do not have to be on them and ensure that people make shorter journeys as high up the hierarchy as possible.  Sometimes motorists - I am a motorist too - forget that every single cyclist or person on public transport would, most likely, otherwise be travelling by car; either getting a lift or driving themselves.  Their choice to cycle or use public transport frees up the roads for those who do need to drive and are not in a position to use alternatives.  I welcome it.  It is positive but there is a lot to do to get people out of their cars and onto public transport and, in addition, off public transport and onto bikes in particular.  The more we can do in that regard, the better.  It is to the benefit of everybody's health and, in particular, the Minister's priority in terms of decarbonisation.  There is also the fact that catering for active travel is far cheaper than building a new road or railway line.  Let us do as much of that as we can.</p></speech>

I am a constituent of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where he was formerly a councillor.  We have a long history.  The Clonskeagh Road is very familiar to me.  I live off it.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown has done the best in terms of advancing new active travel.  It is very difficult.  The proposal for Deansgrange is very contentious.  Clonskeagh Road is next up or one of the routes into the city centre at which we are looking.  It is a major cycling artery through Ranelagh and into the city centre.</p><p>It is not designed to be safe at the moment.  The junction at the bottom of Clonskeagh Road and Clonskeagh Bridge is a controversial spot.  There is a pinch point where there is a right turn onto Beaver Row.  There is a question of whether it should be reallocated to be a single carriageway, with space to make it really safe to cycle on, which engineers are recommending.  That is a very difficult decision.  Many people use this as a commuting route or for local access.  It changes.  It is contentious and difficult.  It might be helped by the fact that I understand the council will look at Beaver Row.  I think it is Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

As we all know, the current patterns on the road are atrociously inappropriate.  The use of the road is not good for anyone.  It is not safe or easy to navigate.  Could we decide, on that road, to take that space?  That would change how we use Clonskeagh Road.  That is a local government political decision.  These are difficult political decisions.  They are the hardest decisions of all because people's everyday lives are affected.</p></speech>

Some &euro;360 million a year brings it well above 2:1 overall.  In one way, I am surprised that &euro;360 million is not included in the 2:1 because the bulk of it is capital.  Many projects have very little headroom, especially roads.  I want to deal with roads.  We have dealt with rail.  We have very poor rail.  Roads are equally important.  That &euro;360 million is on top of the 2:1.</p></speech>

I have looked at the national planning framework.  The two top ones are compact growth, which we all agree with, and enhanced regional accessibility.  It refers to all regions in the country having a high degree of access to Dublin as well as to each other.  Not every route has to look east.  Accessibility can involve places like Cork and Limerick, to give one example, and the Atlantic corridor from Cork to Galway, as well as access to the north west.  That is the number two objective of the national planning framework.  We have the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy, LSMATS, which I hope will address rail, because it was not in the original plan, and will address issues like the northern distributor road.  We got a good briefing yesterday from the Minister's officials about NIFTI.  It goes maintain, optimise, improve, new.  When it goes down to new, it refers to major road capacity upgrades, including upgrades from single to dual carriageways.</p> <p>  The N20-M20 project is currently out for public consultation.  They are coming back in with route selection shortly.  Does NIFTI's structure in any way prevent a motorway from coming through the TII process?</p></speech>

I said this earlier.  I think we should prioritise bypasses and likes of the bypass at Charleville and Buttevant and do that in the same way that we are talking about Tipperary town.  That does not preclude the upgrade of the road.  Do I believe a full motorway makes sense in this instance?  I do not.</p></speech>

The second objective under the national planning framework is to connect cities.  The Minister speaks about the cities growing.  Cork, Limerick and Galway must be accounted for.  Many of the areas on the route from Limerick to Cork are treacherous, particularly between Charleville and Mallow.  Bypasses are needed, but equally we have to address travel time and deal with sections of the road.  Is the Minister ideologically opposed to roads?  I am trying to understand.</p></speech>

It is good engineering and good outcomes.  I do not think NIFTI indicates that there is a first priority and then a second priority.  It is about better-balanced regional development.

As I said, we have an existing project pipeline requiring &euro;70 billion.  Much of that is in Limerick, Cork and Galway.  If there is one thing that I want to make clear here, it is that I think we need to invest in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick in particular, because we are not seeing them develop quickly enough.</p></speech>

The national planning framework, which he has quoted, specifically addresses enhanced regional accessibility and specifically mentions linking Cork and Limerick.  Ultimately, if we are to have proper balanced regional development, we must connect the cities.  I accept that we must have compact growth within the cities.</p></speech>

I hope he does not mind.  Professor Edgar Morgenroth is an economist from DCU who was involved, as I understand, in the drafting of the national planning framework.  I heard him say one thing that is simple but true.  If we really want to see Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick develop, we must invest in the cites.  That is the big plan.</p></speech>

I am also coming a distance with him in that we need to build up the cities, but for whatever reason the Minister has an ideological position whereby he will come out against something that might be good.  He deliberately did so on the northern distributor road earlier.  The LSMATS plan may show that it will be required.  What the Minister is forgetting is that the northern distributor road could have buses and public transport on it, which would make the lives of people living in the area infinitely better.  The fundamental point is that I do not see rail, public transport and roads as being mutually exclusive.</p></speech>

If we build the motorway, it arrives at Blackpool in Cork.  We will then have to build a motorway to the Dunkettle roundabout and northern ring road around Cork.  That then undermines the rail investment we are making in the Cork metropolitan area.  It is also incredibly expensive.  We have an issue in that while &euro;35 billion is a lot of funding, the truth is we will have an incredible challenge in meeting the existing road projects and public transport projects, in particular.  It will be an incredible challenge.  That means we then come to some investment decisions in the context of climate and sustainable compact development, which both influence me, in addition to budget matters.  I know we have discussed this and have different views-----</p></speech>

I know that route intimately and grew up along it.  We have a once in a lifetime chance and you are the Minister.  TII is doing its work.  I hope the Minister will have an open mind on what the professionals come forward with, whatever that is.  I want to see a dual carriageway and motorway along that route.  I want to see Charleville, Mallow and Buttevant bypassed.  It stands to reason.  If we are serious about policy, that project must go ahead.  I want to let non-members in for a minute.</p></speech>

I will talk about roads and the recent announcement by TII that a number of projects have been pushed off funding for 2022, namely, the N4 from Mullingar to Roosky.  This affects Longford, Westmeath, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and south Donegal.  Looking at a map of Ireland, and we can picture one in our heads, the north west is the one region that is not properly serviced with access to our capital city.  That has to be a priority.  The Industrial Development Authority was before the enterprise committee earlier today and its representatives spoke about the fact that accessibility to Dublin is needed for all regions.  Our region has no such access.</p> <p>  We are weeks away from an identified preferred route after more than two years of consultation and the design office will now close down.  That is not acceptable.  Funding needs to be put in place to keep that process going until we identify the route instead of pushing it back until 2026 because what will then happen is the entire process will have to start again.  Four years of work has now been done.  We already wasted four years of work in 2006 and 2007.  I ask the Minister to make a comment on this issue.  On balanced regional development, we have to be fair to all those counties in the north west from Longford onwards.</p></speech>

We are not meeting that yet and we will have a real challenge to do so.  The reality on the roads side is that we have many roads in planning and incredible capability in road-building.  TII and the local authorities are superb at building roads.  They have endless numbers of projects.  It is very difficult.  We cannot give false promises and say that every single road will be developed now.  It is not ruling them out.  It is not saying that at some point in the future they will come in as a development possibility, but there is a budget limitation.  We have got so many different projects, all of which were being developed.  We do not have enough engineers to do all the planning and design of all the roads that were being planned.  I had to give direction to TII to say, "Hold on a second here; we have to prioritise", and the prioritisation is along the lines I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

An entire region of the country will not be serviced and other projects are going ahead.  I honestly do not think that is fair.  It is very unfair and if we want to get investment into where I am from, Longford, and the entire north-west region, we need that accessibility to the capital.  That should be prioritised over any other road projects.  Every region, including Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast, has good road accessibility.  The north-west region does not have that.  That has to be a priority.</p></speech>

The Department did a report on the ratio of spending between roads and public transport.  I have statistics and I am wondering if they relate just to the capital budget or to the entire budget.  In 2018, the ratio was 55% on roads and 42% on public transport projects.  It was the same in 2019.  In 2020, it went to 53% on roads and 45% on public transport.

In 2020, 53% of the budget was for roads and 45% of it was for public transport.  Am I correct in saying that since 2021, the budget has been 67% on public transport and 33% on roads?

I do not mean to cut across the Minister, but someone driving from those brand-new investment, top-of-the-range roads then hits the section at Longford.  People coming from Mayo will meet the N4 in Longford.  They will have a brilliant road the whole way to Mullingar, but from there to Roosky that 50 km road is not fit for purpose.  We are then spending hundreds of millions on the far side of it.  In between, there is a road that has a capacity for 11,000 cars but 18,000 cars are on it.  It does not make sense.  As I said, we have to have balanced regional development and we are not getting our fair share.</p> <p>  There are eight designed routes at present that went out for public consultation.  People that I know, who live in my area and are neighbours, are on those routes.  They now do not know what the preferred route will be because the process has stalled.  What will happen is that all the routes will be stalled with regard to planning, etc.  We have to provide the funding to at least get to a situation where a designated final route is decided on.  We will then know how to go forward. </p></speech>

As the Minister knows, in Connemara, we probably produce more renewable energy, by a mile, than we consume in fossil fuels because we have some of the biggest wind farms in the country.</p><p>We are doing our bit.  When I did an analysis of where the job is getting done with regard to renewable energy, I saw that it is getting done in places like Connemara.  When we need something, however, it becomes something different.</p><p> Will the Minister explain two things to me?  The Minister knows the Maam Cross to Clifden road very well.  It was to be developed online up to a uniform national standard, which is quite modest.  In other words, it was to be the same as the new bit at Derrylea.  That is what was to happen and nothing more.  Why has the planning of that been stopped?  It is just about making it safe.</p><p> My second question is very pertinent and simple.  Public transport funding will have a ratio of 2:1 against road funding.  There is no railway in Connemara, except for a little bit at Maam Cross.

These are areas where we cannot put it on the railway line because there is no railway line.  Can I take it that the 2:1 ratio will include an input for roads to accommodate buses?</p></speech>
