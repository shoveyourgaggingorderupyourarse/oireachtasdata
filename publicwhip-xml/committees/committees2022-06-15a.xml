    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022061500002#A00200"><p>Senator Mullen is substituting for Senator Boyhan.  Ms Tara Kelly is standing in as clerk to the committee today in the absence of our clerk, who is down with Covid.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to examine strategic priorities for Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  The committee will hear from Ms Suzanne Eade, chief executive of HRI, and her officials.   Since 28 February, the legal requirement of mask-wearing in all settings has been removed. However, it is still good practice to continue to use face masks or coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.</p> <p>  I must read the note on privilege.  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses to give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  The committee will hear from Ms Eade, chief executive of HRI, Mr. Jason Morris, director of racing and strategic projects, and Mr. John Osborne, equine welfare and bloodstock director.  I call on Ms Eade to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Eade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022061500002#A00300"><p>I am very grateful for the opportunity to meet with the joint committee this evening to introduce myself and to discuss HRI&rsquo;s key strategic priorities for horse racing and breeding in Ireland.  Joining me are Jason Morris and John Osborne.  I joined HRI as chief financial officer in September 2015 and was appointed to the role of CEO in November 2021.  I am the HRI representative on a number of industry bodies.  Before joining HRI I held a number of senior leadership positions in multinationals in Ireland, the UK and Switzerland.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semi-State body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry and operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and eight subsidiary companies.  Its functions are set out in legislation.</p> <p>  HRI has a clear vision, as set out within its strategic plan for the period 2020 to 2024, to make Ireland the global leader in horse racing and breeding.  The HRI board and the wider organisation&rsquo;s resources are focused on priorities which will deliver that vision.  These include: growing what is already the second-most attended sport in Ireland; attracting footfall and viewers from all over the world; building on the international reputation of our dedicated workforce; investing in infrastructure such as Tipperary Racecourse, through the provision of a second all-weather track there, and the Irish Equine Centre; equine welfare, integrity and traceability; and expanding a sustainable, rural industry.</p> <p>  The horse racing and breeding industries are incredible assets to this country.  I am proud they are significant industries across all Ireland, producing in excess of &euro;2 billion in total expenditure annually and supporting approximately 29,000 direct and indirect jobs.  These are enormous figures that contribute to the rural economy and my focus will be on growing the business at every level.  It is fully our intention to increase the impact of the industry on the economy which is currently estimated at &euro;30 for every &euro;1 allocated to horse racing through the horse and greyhound racing fund.</p><p>I represent an industry that delivers on Government investment and a sport that continues to be one of the most popular activities, in both a sporting and social sense, in this country.  In 2019, the last full year unaffected by the Covid pandemic, racecourse attendances exceeded 1.3 million, making horse racing the second highest attended sport in Ireland.  This figure included an estimated 80,000 tourist visitors.</p><p> It is a strategic priority of HRI to broaden the interest and appeal of our sport to the widest possible audience, both domestically and internationally, by investing in marketing, promotion and event creation around racing throughout the year.  Our recent research shows that 44% of the Irish population has an interest in the sport, up from 39% last year, and this figure continues on an upward trajectory.  During Covid lockdowns, we continued to invest in marketing and content creation relating to racing to maintain engagement with fans and supplement the live broadcasts on television during that time.</p><p> Ireland is a global leader in horse racing and breeding.  Irish-bred horses and horses trained in Ireland are the envy of the world.  We have an outstanding tradition of horse care and this recognised tradition is responsible for so much of the inward investment in Irish breeding and horse racing.  Big race wins do not go unnoticed by our overseas competitors.  People choose to invest in Ireland because we are world class, which is something we often take for granted.  Every industry and sport has its big names and dominant figures and horse racing in Ireland is no different, but the mainstay of our industry are the smaller operators.  In the breeding industry, 92% of the almost 7,000 breeders across the island own five brood mares or fewer.  Through Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, we are supporting breeders with the IRE incentive scheme, a series of more than 200 races in Ireland and Britain in 2022, with a &euro;10,000 voucher for the winning owner, if the winner is Irish-bred, to be redeemed against the purchase of an Irish-bred horse at an Irish bloodstock sale.</p><p> By consolidating and building the industry, I am sure that we can continue to face up to Brexit.  The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU and the rest of the world is challenging.  Broadening our marketplace beyond the UK, which accounts for up to 80% of our exports, is a key strategy for Horse Racing Ireland to counteract potential Brexit impacts.  Brexit has caused considerable logistical and financial issues, with significant additional costs, extra paperwork and planning relating to horses' movements that were seamless under the previous tripartite agreement.</p><p> Providing extra opportunities to race will be key to further strengthening our industry by increasing participation across all levels.  Prize money stimulates investment.  Along with competitive racing and a programme geared towards quality at every level, prize money has a positive impact on smaller operators in Ireland.  Ireland is a shop window, giving owners and breeders the opportunity to trade.  The larger yards and owners are important customers for smaller operations to sell to when they have a horse with form.  A constant influx of human talent is essential to that competition, as is equine ability.</p><p> On the racecourse itself, there are a number of emerging talents working their way through the training ranks and enjoying a share of the success on the biggest of stages.  In a hugely competitive sphere, we can be heartened that 52 trainers from 19 different counties have trained their first winner since the beginning of 2020.  There was a terrific spread of winning trainers at the recent Irish Guineas festival at the Curragh, which is a tangible indication of increased competition.</p><p> The Chair and members will be aware of the plans in place for the strategic redevelopment of Tipperary Racecourse, which will provide Ireland with its second all-weather track.  Our investment in Tipperary Racecourse makes it key infrastructure and the track&rsquo;s associated training facilities and community amenities will not only be of benefit to its immediate neighbours, but to the county as a whole, building on the more than 2,500 jobs which are supported directly and indirectly by racing in County Tipperary.  Those jobs fuel almost &euro;400 million in annual expenditure in the county alone.  The training of horses is labour intensive and the number of horses in training is a key indicator of industry employment.  It is hugely encouraging that all categories of ownership have grown, with more than 1,000 new owners attracted into ownership last year.  A record owner retention rate of 80% in 2021 was a terrific vote of confidence in the industry.  However, these figures will be challenging to maintain in the current economic environment.</p><p> We are concerned about the significant difficulties felt by the point-to-point and pony racing communities, which are two key grassroots sectors, in acquiring insurance cover.  This is a situation that puts the long-term viability of both in doubt.  Given the geographical spread of racecourses, it was only right that a number of them were at the disposal of the HSE for Covid-19 testing and vaccination.  Cork Racecourse was among the first testing facilities in the country and along with Leopardstown, Fairyhouse, Punchestown, Limerick, Navan and Galway racecourses, it went on to play a significant role.  The facility at Leopardstown has benefited greatly from a recent development and the payback will be seen in the years to come as racegoers enjoy the very best of international competition at meetings like the Leopardstown Christmas Festival, the Dublin Racing Festival in February and the opening day of Irish Champions Weekend in early September.  Its strategic importance, as Dublin&rsquo;s only remaining racecourse, should not be underestimated.</p><p> HRI will continue to invest in the development of facilities at all 26 racecourses, which are spread across 17 counties of the island and are very much at the heart of their urban and rural communities.  HRI is currently supporting two racecourse capital development schemes covering 2022 and 2023.  The first is to expand stable yards to maximise their capacities and a second is focused on developing industry facilities.</p><p> Equine welfare is an absolute priority for everyone.  The industry was heartened by the positive endorsement in the report by the joint committee in November 2021 arising from concerns aired last year and we will continue to work with the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure progress is maintained on both the implementation of the committee's recommendations and those put forward by Dr. Suann&rsquo;s review.</p><p> Disease prevention is a vital part of our equine welfare strategy and the recent announcement of an equine herpes outbreak in a British training yard underlines the constant need for vigilance in this area.  The Irish Equine Centre has a vital role in ensuring the health of all the bloodstock involved in our &euro;2 billion industry and Horse Racing Ireland is fully supportive of its efforts to secure funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the complete redevelopment of its current facilities.</p><p> Embracing the government&rsquo;s national climate action plan, we are working on a sustainability strategy to guide and assist the wider breeding and racing industry, which will be finalised this summer.  CSO statistics show that equine activity account for over 12% of the land base in Ireland.  Equine farming is low intensity, producing lower emissions with paddocks remaining in pasture all year round, and it is already recognised as a green and sustainable way of farming.</p><p> The welfare of those employed throughout the country in the racing and breeding industries is addressed through Horse Racing Ireland's education and training department, Equuip.  While seeking to attract new people to the industry by showcasing available opportunities, Equuip is focused on developing our people by enhancing their skills in order to build sustainable careers.  Through support from HRI, the many employers associated with both horse racing and breeding will be encouraged to grow their businesses by educating, training and providing career pathways for a long and successful career in the industry.</p><p> I thank the members of the joint committee for their interest in the horse racing and breeding industries and the work they do in our interests.  I thank them for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself this evening and to outline where I believe the industry stands and our plans.  I will be happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022061500002#B00200"><p>A number of members have indicated they want to speak.  They will have ten minutes each.  If members want a second round of questions, we can facilitate it.  We will give everyone a chance to get in with the first batch.  I have three quick questions first.</p><p>Will Ms Eade give a timeframe for completion of the all-weather race track in Tipperary?  When will it be in place?  When will racing take place there?  Ms Eade mentioned insurance, in passing, for point-to-point and pony racing.  Does HRI have any insight in to how we can get the cost of that insurance to what will be a reasonable level?  Both are considerable nurseries for horse racing.  Point to pointing has become a big business and is the conveyer belt for our success in national hunt racing.  It would be a disaster if lack of insurance were to put that in jeopardy.  The same goes for pony racing.  While it is not producing the horses for HRI, it is definitely producing a conveyer of jockeys.  Most of our champions have come out of the pony circuit.</p><p> In terms of a database for horses, all thoroughbreds are microchipped.  We know where they are.  We have had meetings on doping, on rigorous testing of doping in the industry and on making sure that the industry has a clean reputation.  Without a database in place for us know exactly which premises each horse is meant to be on, it is extremely hard to give full confidence to the public in the testing regime, especially out-of-training testing.  It is imperative that if inspectors are going into a yard to test, they know exactly how many horses are on that premises.</p><p> In these days of computerisation, it should not be too difficult to have a movement system in place to simultaneously record the movement of horses from A to B.  If one is going in to a yard, one should know the number of horses there.  If one has a bovine inspection and has 50, 200 or 300 animals, one has to have that number of animals in place when the inspectors come on to the premises.  They will be counted and checked.  We need to do the same on the equine side.  I know there are issues with non-thoroughbreds with regard to microchipping, but we are talking about thoroughbred horses this evening.  We need to get that house in order as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Eade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022061500002#C00200"><p>In terms of the Tipperary project, we are working very closely with all the relevant bodies in Tipperary on the planning process.  We have a design team in place.  The plan is that it will be complete by the end of 2024 and that we will be racing in quarter 1 of 2025.  That is the current plan, subject to any delays we might face in the planning permission process, funding etc.</p> <p>  Insurance has been a problem throughout the industry and the equestrian sport.  We have had problems with premiums for our own insurance.  We also worked very closely with the racecourses that encountered some problems in terms getting their relevant insurance, which we resolved.  it was a very difficult process for point-to-point racing to get insurance, because of a belief of an issue that had happened in terms of an accident in one location.  We are really struggling on the underwriting side.  Fewer underwriters are willing to take on the level of risk across that industry.  In fairness to the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee and the registrar of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, they have got insurance in place for point to pointing but only after a long period of time.  They had to work very hard to get it.  </p> <p>  In terms of pony racing, I have been liaising with Mr. Colm Sayers from the Dingle racing group.  He is trying to resolve the pony-racing situation.  My understanding is that they are quite close to getting a solution.  I do not know the cost of it, but we are engaging with and supporting the group in terms of what it will cost.  I think they were expecting a result either yesterday or today.  I have not got an update from Mr. Sayers as to how he is doing with that.  I know that pony-racing groups are trying to work in the background on all the safety aspects of how they run their racing, which will in turn help with the insurance matters that they face.</p> <p>  Going in to 2023, we will have to work more closely with both the IHRB and HRI to look at where the potential gaps are, based on some litigation that happened in the UK.  Insurance problems will not go away in the short term.  We need to work out how we will resolve any gaps that may be in place as a result of insurance companies and underwriters not willing to support it to the level at which we need it.</p> <p>  The Chairman's final question about was about the tracing of the thoroughbred horse.  We implemented a new system within the racing system in HRI in order that we have full traceability on all horses, unnamed and named.  The unnamed process was implemented just a couple of months ago.  We were unable to register a horse until it was named for racing.  Now, we have full traceability once it is in a racing yard.  That is the complete section in terms of racing.  The second piece relates to what we are working on with the Weatherbys traceability system.  I ask Mr. Osborne to talk about where we are on that system currently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Osborne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022061500002#C00300"><p>The point to emphasis is how strong the identification process is.  It now has five strands.  Every horse is uniquely marked and recorded in the passport.  Horses also undergo DNA analysis, are microchipped and are now issued with an e-passport, which is basically access to the centralised database that is built.  We are working on the functionality that can flow from that database.  We trialled a centralised holding of vaccination records.  In the past, a horse whose vaccinations might have been a few days out of date would travel all the way to the races, only to be turned around at the stable gate.  Now when the horse is entered, the vaccinations can be checked at entry stage and it will not travel to the races if the vaccinations are known to be out of date.  That is a significant technological improvement available to us nowadays.</p> <p>  Identification is very strong within the racing programme.  Ms Eade mentioned the fact that unnamed horses are now known, but the concept of a racing pool is also being rolled out.  Once a horse is in training, it remains subject to the scrutiny of the regulator, regardless of where it may live.  In other words, a trainer with a horse in his or her care is duty-bound to record that the horse has relocated to a different premises, until it is recorded as out of training or retired.  We will know where the horse is throughout its racing life.  That gives us a much better control of the horse.</p> <p>  One of the weaknesses is post racing and the degree to which we can maintain that record, transnationally.  That is a problem with which all countries that have horses are grappling.  It is interesting that this coincides with the Department's own equine census, which it completed at the end of last year.  As Mr. Michael Sheahan updated the committee two weeks ago, the Department is planning to repeat the exercise again in December.  That database will be of all equines in this country.  We will be a subset of that but we feel we also will be leading the charge in terms of the technological solutions to some of the challenges and plugging the gaps.  We are most keen to make sure that change of ownership is always up to date.  It is currently a weakness in the system.  We should always be able to name the person who is the keeper of the animal.</p></speech>

I congratulate Ms Eade on her appointment and wish her well in her new role.  In order not to have to continue to repeat it, this committee recognises the valuable contribution that horse racing in Ireland makes to rural economies, the wider domestic economy and local communities.</p><p>We will take that as a given.  The sector receives substantial State funding, amounting to approximately &euro;70 million this year.  I would like to touch on that area first.  I read the strategic plan, which states that the aim of the HRI is to secure an increased multi-annual funding model.  Is that a reference to the Oireachtas grant?</p></speech>

It is difficult for an industry that is trying to grow strategically when it is not exactly sure every year what funding it will get for the following year.  We are trying to sustain some of what we are doing.  If we consider, for example, the IRE incentive, I do not know whether I can afford that next year.  To give the breeders enough time, it would be great if we knew-----</p></speech>

It is making a difference to the breeders.  They want to keep it growing and they want to do more with it.

Domestically and internationally, we have done really well.  When considering legislative change for the horse racing and greyhound industry and thinking about the funding method, would it be worthwhile for the committee to look at the relative size of each industry and its relative growth prospects based on a change in funding?  That is an aspiration but everything is subject to legislation.</p></speech>

I have stressed that we are very keen to ensure the viability of all 26 racecourses.  In terms of the way those deals are moving, they are now more correlated to the actual turnover that a track generates.  For instance, a streaming income comes in based on the volume of streams an individual racecourse has for an individual race and it then receives income from those streams directly correlated to the revenues generated on the track.  The way the deals tend to be migrating are from the overall payment model, which was perhaps in a pot, to now being much more closely linked to what each individual track receives.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Morris see how there might be a difficulty for smaller racecourses that might need additional funding in order to expand, but they are unable to do that because of the stipulation on co-financing?</p></speech>

There has been significant expenditure at the major tracks, for example, the recent developments at The Curragh and Leopardstown.  Smaller tracks probably do not need to spend as much.  These particular schemes are focused on industry facilities like stable yards and weigh rooms, those areas which are fundamental to the infrastructure of racing going forwards.  We believe that the racecourses can carry out work.  We financially evaluate their applications and check their business plans.  We check affordability.  We want to make sure they can-----</p></speech>

I welcome all the speakers, in particular Ms Eade.  I congratulate her on her new role.  I will try not to repeat what everybody is saying, but it goes without saying that we are hugely proud of Irish horse racing and the position it has globally.  I am very much in solidarity with her stated aim of establishing Ireland as a global leader.  That is important to maintain a high profile for Ireland as a country and Ireland Plc.</p> <p>  In terms of attendance at tracks, that has been coloured by Covid, but in the most recent non-Covid year it was 1.3 million.  The strategic development plan runs to 2024.  What are the attendance figures projected to be?  It will be very challenging in the post-Covid era, especially as people's pockets are very challenged at the moment.  Could Ms Eade give me some detail on how she expects to ramp up the numbers between now and 2024?</p></speech>

That was the growth potential that we were talking about.  Those two years have been tough.  We have been very lucky in that people have stayed very engaged.  In fact, the engagement with our sport went up during Covid.  We were one of the few interesting sporting events at a time when people could not go and enjoy a lot of sport and racing got a really good platform.</p> <p>  There are a lot of different areas.  I mentioned the fact that it is about event creation.  People are looking for a lot more when they come racing.  The festivals themselves are giving a lot of entertainment to people.  If we take Leopardstown, for example, in the next month or so, we have musical events.  People can enjoy racing for the day, and they can enjoy a band or music afterwards.</p></speech>

Ms Eade referenced the breeders and their success, which was great to see.  I have a keen interest in racing, but it is very much from the outside.  In terms of the breeders, are we seeing new entrants or is it very much the old guard, people who have traditionally been horse breeders?  Could Ms Eade give us any indication of whether there are new entrants coming into the sector?  Looking at it from the outside, when we see successful breeders interviewed after a race, they are normally my age or older.  Are there new entrants and, dare I say, non-horsey people coming into this area?</p></speech>

We had a great result in the Land Rover race in Punchestown where Miche&aacute;l Conaghan, who is probably in his late 20s, bred the winner.  He tried to sell the horse last summer.  He put him in training, and he won the Land Rover bumper at Punchestown.  He sold him subsequently for a lot of money.  There are a lot of people participating at that level from his cohort of people in their late 20s.  It is very exciting.</p></speech>

I know it is hard to capture everything in an opening statement, but I am concerned that there has not been any acknowledgement of the threat and socioeconomic challenges presented by gambling, which is a huge problem across the country, in particular with the advent of online gambling.  Ms Eade stated the industry benefited from Covid, but so too did the spectre and problem of online gambling in many family homes.  In terms of HRI's corporate responsibility and a corporate risk matrix, where does it see itself as an organisation?  What is HRI doing to address gambling and to proactively engage? I accept that there is a reference to it in the small print on all HRI's advertising, but there is nothing that tells me it is comprehensively tackling this issue or engaging with the problems it is creating.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that we are also very supportive of responsible gambling, but we might need to state it in a bit more of an upfront manner.  I take on board that point.</p><p>On the other suggestion, we were very supportive of the idea of an element of the take from the Exchequer tax on gambling being ring-fenced for gambling addiction services, and that was something we recommended.</p><p> I take on board the Deputy's points.  We will do more to make that a bit clearer but, as I said, we are very supportive of the regulation that is coming in.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Ms Eade referred to equine welfare, although it amounted to little more than a footnote in her remarks.  Generally, I see a high level of welfare in the racing industry.  There are, obviously, some rogue operators but, generally, it is quite good.  Nevertheless, I am concerned our guests did not address in their opening remarks the issue of doping and the threat that poses to the industry.  We have had a number of exchanges and presentations to this committee from people who are very exercised about it, so I had thought our guests would have addressed those issues and sought to give us some degree of comfort and reassurance.  They might wish to take this opportunity to address that point.  There have been a number of TV programmes and a significant number of newspaper articles about the issue.  Much as I asked about HRI's focus on gambling and gambling welfare, where does the issue of anti-doping fit into its corporate responsibility and corporate risk matrix?  How big an issue is it for the organisation and how much of its resources are focused on dealing with it?  What reassurance can our guests give us that it is front and centre in the organisation's strategic plan?</p></speech>

It is a given our integrity has to be of the highest quality and all the testing we are supporting through the integrity budget is aimed to deliver that world-class integrity system.  It is very important to us.  We were very disappointed by the articles last year.  We know the work the IHRB has put in place to improve the quality of testing.  It now has an International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, IFHA, accredited laboratory and is being more transparent in its reporting of anti-doping.</p> <p>  As for where it is on HRI&rsquo;s risk register, it is probably the first or second issue.  We discuss risk at every meeting of the HRI board, and equine welfare and equine anti-doping are issues discussed in the context of that risk register.  It is very high on our agenda and we have no tolerance for doping.</p></speech>

What tangible actions has HRI taken as an organisation?  I acknowledge it is on the agenda of all the board meetings, but what action has been taken specifically with regard to the cases raised in those media reports?</p></speech>

The best in class in anti-doping and so on are Hong Kong and Australia, and our chairperson was very clear that he wanted the IHRB to benchmark itself against those countries.  We hold it to account.  It has a new CEO who will be starting in two weeks.  He will be invited to a meeting of the HRI board.  The main topics of conversation will be those areas and that is how we will hold it to account.</p></speech>

I mentioned transparency regarding information and reporting.  The biggest issue for me initially was not that it was not doing the work but that there was a bit of a vacuum in respect of the information coming in.  It has done a great job at making that information far more transparent in order that people understand what is going on, the level of testing and any adverse findings.

In my view, the IHRB has come a long way in that regard.  The Dr. Suann report highlights where it may have some gaps in resource and that is something on which we in HRI need to work with it urgently in regard to the budget for next year to ensure there will be no gaps in providing the outcome of that work it is doing in the background.</p></speech>

On the subject of gambling, I always feel a little conflicted about this issue given I was involved in bringing in the late, great Barney Curley to the Houses when we honoured him in 2015 for his wonderful charitable work for schools and hospitals in Africa.  At the same time, it pricks my conscience as a legislator when I look at racing, generally on a Saturday morning, and I see the frankly manipulative advertising by gambling organisations, especially aimed at young men, it seems to me.  It seems to be aimed at a class of people who probably have a much poorer chance of being able to own their own home than did the generation who went before them.  It strikes me HRI might be involved in something of a conflict of interest given most of the &euro;70 million it gets from the State comes from the betting tax.  Is it tempted, therefore, to keep shtum in the hope there will not be significant change here?  If there are restrictions on gambling advertising, one would hope there will less betting, which would, of course, affect HRI's budget.</p></speech>

We do not face some of the issues that might be seen with, say, casino gambling and that drive some of the very dangerous behaviour.

Ms Eade would have to agree a lot of organisations would envy its position, as would the promoters of many other activities in the country.</p> <p>  We will move on from that because I want to follow on from what Deputy Carthy asked.  He raised a number of issues but I will focus on the core one.  I am going to run a number of issues by Ms Eade and she can tell me whether I am wrong.  She knows as well as I do that the owners of a number of the smaller racecourses feel aggrieved at the way HRI is collecting and distributing its share of media and data rights money.  This goes back to the days of the Turf Club.  The original arrangement, as I understand it, was that 7% of the deal being done with satellite information systems was for data, while the much more lucrative media rights, at 93%, were to go to the racecourses, and that situation continued until 2011.  The regulator was basically getting 7% and the racecourses were getting 93%.</p> <p>  When HRI was in the saddle as the sole permitted negotiator for all this, when it was negotiating one big cake for the sale of data and media rights, by bringing in the fixture charge of &euro;13,500 give or take in respect of each event, that meant that the overall take from the sale of data and media rights was no longer 7% for HRI but rather was something more like 16%.  By definition, this means a smaller percentage of the core of the cake goes directly to the racecourses.  I do not think I am misrepresenting Mr. Morris by saying he indicated that the lion's share of the money being spent on capital and racecourse development goes to the larger courses, some of which HRI owns.</p><p>Some of the smaller racecourses feel that while it is true that they accepted this new arrangement, they did so under a form of duress because they were not in a position to look elsewhere.  Is this not a fact?  Horse Racing Ireland is the sole permitted negotiator of this deal and is now getting 16% of the total cake but distributes it disproportionately to the bigger firms.  In terms of the money that is distributed from the media rights directly back to the racecourses, the bigger courses get something like &euro;300,000 of a cut off the top whereas the smaller courses get &euro;65,000 and only the remainder is divvied out more or less on a fixture-by-fixture basis.</p><p> As I understand from my sources, and others will have similar sources in the racing industry, the smaller racecourses feel that HRI has abused its position, and continues to do so, by taking a much greater share of the overall data and media rights money than it used to take.  Moreover, it is distributing it disproportionately to larger racecourses.  Not only that but because of the fungibility of money and the fact that HRI effectively takes more money away from the racecourses before anything is distributed, HRI is then using that money for capital and racecourse development and I put it to the chief executive that the authority has distributed that money disproportionately to the larger racecourses, some of which it owns.  Of course that frees up the &euro;70 million that HRI gets from the State to a much greater degree.</p><p> Please correct me if I am wrong but I think there is a ministerial directive that 50% of the money that comes from the State would be used for development.  As far as I understand, in 2021 either &euro;42 million or &euro;46 million was spent on prize money.  That is a much greater percentage and is 60% of the &euro;70 million take that Horse Racing Ireland gets from the State.  I do not think there can be any issue about confidentiality in terms of deals already done.  For taxpayers to assess for themselves or to their satisfaction how HRI uses the &euro;70 million, they need to know the authority has managed to negotiate &euro;35 million a year on a multi-annual basis for data and media rights.  As present, HRI is taking about 16% of that.</p><p> Does the chief executive accept there is concern among the owners of smaller racecourses that they are in a situation where they can only deal with one auctioneer, which is the HRI?  As under legislation, the HRI is the sole auctioneer, the smaller racecourses must take what they get and the authority is taking more than it used to take.  Is that not the case?   </p></speech>

We do that.  To be perfectly honest, the media rights committee has done an excellent job.  Going back 20 years when the media rights was at "X" value, it has grown fivefold as a result of the work done by the media rights company so I am very comfortable that racecourses are getting a strong share of a very strong media rights fund.</p> <p>  Together, the HRI and the AIR have worked really hard to improve the quality of pictures of data through investing in systems etc. to make sure that the quality and, therefore, the overall media rights pie has grown for Irish racing.  HRI is not abusing its position.  I refute that and the Senator has made a regrettable statement because we have invested in many small racecourses.  Some of those racecourses are small and they have received a lot of grant funding over the last number of years.  I can mention Sligo and Roscommon, which have had significant capital investment. </p> <p>  Mr. Morris has already explained that this is not money we are taking from the racecourses.  This is funding that we were entitled to for the fixtures.  It is the person who is buying the rights who determines what value that is.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the HRI negotiated a fee or fixture charge, which is well in excess of what the market value of the data rights would be if one were to sell them.  Money got off the likes of the Sports Information Services, SIS, in one area means less money for the other area.  Am I correct that HRI has negotiated a bigger part of the pie for itself by using the fixture-charge approach?  In fact, the HRI gets about 16% of the total pie instead of 7% in the past.  Even if it is a bigger pie, as has been pointed out, the smaller racecourses get less as a proportion which, in turn, puts pressure on them to match funding for development and they feel a chilling effect.  Some of them feel that if they complain about this, then HRI is the entity that decides whether they will get the capital money they might come looking for.  Is that not the case? </p></speech>

Wheresoever there is a potential conflict of interest, external eyes to look at what is going on are needed.  Will the chief executive commit to conducting an independent review of what is going on?  Is she willing to commission an independent review of the distribution of the media rights moneys?  A review was promised by the HRI when it dealt with the Association of Irish Racecourses in 2016.  I have a letter to that effect, which confirms that in a meeting with HRI, the authority was willing to commission an independent review on the distribution of the cake.

I am aware there are some discussions in the background in making sure of the project and the funding.  The Irish Equine Centre is an independent body and it must look into some of the legalities of funding the project.  It has kind of stalled a bit.  The work is done and they know what they want to do, but in the context of knowing exactly how much funding we have to play with, that bit has stalled.  The Department is working on that to see if a mechanism can be found to make that right.</p></speech>

They have been granted once-off funding of &euro;1.7 million, which is allowed, but they have not accessed any of this funding yet.</p></speech>

I have one question about which small breeders have been on to me.  I will put on the record that I too have one brood mare, so I know what these people are on about.  The question relates to the five-day notice.  Has Horse Racing Ireland had any communication with the Department on this?  The five-day notice must be given to the Department vet if one is bringing a mare to be covered in the UK.  This is becoming a little bit of a nightmare, as Ms Eade can appreciate, and as Mr. Osborne will certainly appreciate.  When a mare is in season, she is in season.  Before this, one would have been able to just put her in the horse box, go to the ferry and go over to get her covered.  If a horse is going over to race we know well in advance of five days and we can put all the information in place and have the Department vet out and so on.  Has Horse Racing Ireland had any communication with the Department on this?  I have contacted the Department and raised the issue but I do not seem to be making much progress.  Is there any way around that for the purposes of breeding alone?  We are dealing with nature here.</p></speech>

There are a number of headaches; there is a paperwork headache and a cost headache with shipping to and from.  These things are under review.  I am not sure how much wriggle room there is.  We know it is complicated.  As the Senator has said, a five-day notice period is impossible to comply with in the breeding season for mares in cycle, and so on.  It radically needs a good examination and a solution needs to be found for it.   I am not sure what that solution can be given the complex Brexit situation.</p></speech>

Has HRI taken this up on behalf of the breeders?</p></speech>

There is another point, and I do not want to be negative about what is a positive, but will Horse Racing Ireland thread out a little bit more about the support for breeders and the IRE incentive?  Again, going back to the small breeders, if one wins the &euro;10,000 voucher it is used at the sale and that money will filter down to the breeder.  If a bred horse has won a race, the value of the horse goes up and the prize money goes up, and the winner gets the &euro;10,000.  If a person is a less successful breeder, which I am very familiar with, and finishes fourth in the same race, it has cost the breeder as much to get there but he or she is getting none of the above.  The breeder is out of the prize money, does not have the &euro;10,000 and the horse has not increased that much in value.  If that is the quality of horse one is breeding, and if that is the sort of luck one is in, then it is probably not going be the horse that the fella with the &euro;10,000 voucher is going to buy at the sale.  Has HRI looked at any way it could be spread out a little bit more to get down to the smaller breeder who would use - for want of a better word - the lesser quality stallion, who may not be winning the races or winning the vouchers, and who may not have a horse that will catch they eye of the person with the voucher in the sales?  It is still costing them as much to get to the sale or to the racetrack, as it does the successful one.  This is a long-winded way of explaining it but can HRI spread the butter a bit thinner across the sector?</p></speech>

Mr. Morris will know more about this.  Second, we can actually target the bonuses to a specific sector of races.  We have specifically gone for median auction, two-year-old races, and fillies' maidens.  These are places where the commercial stock are most likely to be participating.  The winner of those races, therefore, who gets the &euro;10,000 is most likely a person who is going to spend that money back into the same sector of the commercial end of the market.</p> <p>  The third plus of the scheme is that it multiplies the spend.  When the winner with the &euro;10,000 to spend, in the form of a voucher, has to buy a horse, we have seen that it is at least a four-fold increase because that person must put some of his or her own money with it.  This raises the market.  Obviously, a rising tide lifts all boats, but there are specifics to it.  I suppose the challenge for the breeding sector is to present animals that the market wants to buy.  As the Senator will be aware, this does not always work but in general terms it is a very good scheme for spreading it as wide as we can in the circumstances of the amount of money available to us.</p></speech>

I see its merits.  I am not being flippant but one man said to me that under the circumstances at the minute he needs a dig out, and the last thing he needs is a voucher to go to the sales to buy another horse.  He told me that he wants to be getting rid of horses.</p></speech>

One could also argue for &euro;5,000 and spread it twice as wide.  Then, however, the &euro;5,000 is less impactful.  In England we are counteracting the great British bonus, GBB, scheme, which was devised pre-Brexit and was specifically targeted at counteracting the success of the Irish breeding industry.  There is no question about it.  That scheme attached a &pound;20,000 bonus to it.  It would have looked very mealy-mouthed of us to go with a scheme that was not at least up into the five figures.  It was a balancing act to come up with a scheme that has maximum impact and bearing in mind the limited resources.</p></speech>

I believe it has been touted and looked at by the Department.  Has HRI had any involvement in those negotiations and would it be confident that the equine sector may be included in the TAMS?</p></speech>

We have had feedback from the Department.  This is a big plank of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, policy.  I think everyone is agreed that it never really made sense that horse production was excluded from TAMS in the first place.  I would be very confident.  Obviously, it would have to go through the hoops and be specific, targeted expenditure.  We would be very expectant that horse production could be included in TAMS.</p></speech>

HRI had to run an extra meeting recently in Punchestown to facilitate low-handicapped and low-quality horses that were getting balloted out.  Will HRI be adjusting its fixture list to allow for that going forward or is it just a spike in numbers at the minute?  I am involved in a syndicate and we were balloted out four times.  It was frustrating for some of the lads who might not understand the whole system as well as I do.</p><p>In fairness, HRI ran that card in Punchestown.  Even having to run it is an admission that the programme does not sufficiently facilitate every type of horse.  Will that be examined?  Will it be changing?  How can that problem within the calendar be overcome?</p></speech>

In 2022, we specifically reserved three of those fixtures.  We only published 387 on the original list and kept three in reserve as floating fixtures specifically for the purpose of catering for the demands of the horse population when we saw those spikes.  We try to balance the fixture list in light of historical trends for different times of the year but there will always be different trends and peak points each year.  By keeping those three fixtures in reserve, one of which was run in Punchestown, we could cater for the maiden hurdles and the low-grade handicap horses.  We put on three races and divided them.  It served as a pressure valve and we were able to release that pressure.  That is something the fixtures committee introduced this year to give us more flexibility to respond-----</p></speech>

I thought it was a bit of an issue at the time.  While I am not going to put a gun to anyone's head here, as the witnesses will know, we have had many meetings with regard to doping.  Within our deliberations during those meetings, there was a lot of talk about structure, although it was more about the structure of the IHRB than that of HRI.  Will the witnesses comment on the relationship between HRI and the IHRB?  It is hard to explain to laypeople who are not into racing that the IHRB is almost a subcommittee of HRI.  Why is it not all the one body?  Should it be one body?  Should it be two completely separate entities?  I will not hold anyone to their answer in the future.  There was a lot of debate about the structure, the relationship and the links, or the lack thereof, between the two bodies.</p></speech>

That can have a very good purpose.  The two executive teams are working together closely to see how we can get better together.  We cannot do well without a strong IHRB and it cannot do a great job without a strong HRI.  The focus of recent work between the two executives has been on what is working, what is not working and how to make things better.  There are areas in which there could be synergies between the two organisations.  I am very supportive of that.  The change in the IHRB makes me believe it is open to looking at some things very differently.  An area in which HRI and the IHRB need to get stronger together is the area of technology.  A great deal needs to be spent in this area.  I refer to spending on cybersecurity and how we go to market.  There is an opportunity for us to be better in that area.  We are very dependent on the fact that there is very significant volunteer element to the IHRB.  I am not 100% sure whether that could fit into a semi-State set-up.  I would definitely like to have a better understanding of that.  The creation of a board that is distinct from the club is good.  Independent members are now going to be brought onto that board which will bring about a bit of diversity.  That should help.  There is no doubt that the two organisations work very well in a crisis.  We want to get better at working together on an ongoing basis and on information exchange.  Those are all areas in which we will work jointly to improve.</p></speech>

They are facing questions on a diverse range of issues.  To return to what HRI said it was willing to facilitate, I put it to the witnesses that there is a bit of a PR problem at some of the smaller racecourses and that there is an expectation that they should not be aggrieved in a situation like this.  Can we get some action on HRI and AIR working on a review of the data rights element of the package, how it is negotiated and how the media rights moneys are distributed among the racecourses?  Is HRI open to acting on that and pushing ahead?</p></speech>

It would be helpful if there were some action on that.  There is something bothering me.  Ms Eade acknowledged the progress that has been made and spoke about HRI's synergies and work with the IHRB.  She praised the proposed changes to its board.  HRI is the funding organisation for the IHRB.  It remains the case that it is a closed shop in respect of appointments to the board.  As has been ventilated at length and reflected to some degree in the previous report of this committee, best practice would be for a majority of members of the board of the IHRB to be people who have no hand, act or part in the owning, breeding or selling of horses.  It needs to be truly independent both to ensure serious integrity and for there to be the perception that the board is serious about integrity.  HRI seems to be waiting to see IHRB is going to do and seems happy enough if it adds in a woman or two to increase gender diversity along with one or two people from the outside.  Is it not starting from the wrong place there, however?  Should HRI not be insisting that, by a given deadline, the majority of members of the board would be completely neutral and independent so that it is no longer the fiefdom of the Turf Club that it currently is?</p></speech>

Of course, the reality is that action has been taken when jockeys were convicted for cocaine offences and so on.  My problem is that when a very prominent racing trainer was pictured sitting up on a dead horse - an issue which, while not nice, did not involve the abuse of an animal - I understand that the IHRB acted but when a trainer was convicted for mistreating an animal, that person was back on a racecourse within a relatively short period of time and the IHRB took no action.  Does it bother Ms Eade that the IHRB does not seem to automatically take action in cases of infractions involving animal welfare?</p></speech>

I put it to Mr. Osborne that it would not be enough to say the IHRB is independent and HRI cannot tell it too much about how it does its job.

As regards the system used for the cattle around the country, if I want to know where a tag number of an animal is at this minute, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can provide that information through the animal identification and movement, AIM, system.  In fairness to the Department, it is one of the best systems in the world.  Is it a priority for Ms Eade to make sure we have a system, from birth to death, to allow us to know where a horse is at any time, either based on or the same as the AIM system?</p></speech>

Officials from the Department appeared before the committee about six months ago and we were told they were working on the system last year.  We are now halfway through 2022.  What stage it is at?

We are working with Weatherbys on a traceability system.  As I said, there is full traceability once a horse is racing.

Obviously, that is something on which we would like to work in tandem with the centre.  We would provide the land and it would provide the funding for the development.

Racing directly or indirectly supports 2,500 jobs in the county which the Chairman and I represent and brings in it &euro;400 million county-wide.  As such, any proposed developments, and the all-weather track in particular, are more than welcome.</p> <p>  I heard part of the discussion earlier on point-to-point racing.  What concerns do our guests have in respect of the long-term viability of both formats?  Reference was made to insurance.  Is it the biggest worry in the context of point-to-point racing and smaller events?</p></speech>

There is more of an onus hitting the IHRB in terms of insurance for participation risk as well.  That was the biggest issue we faced coming into the current year.  Obviously, Covid was also tough for the organisers as they could not run point-to-point races and then had to catch up.  They held some events on the track.  This year, they are kind of back on track.</p></speech>

That number may go up next year.  We met the registrar a couple of times in respect of insurance.  That is the sort of support we gave them.  We have committed to helping pony racing in terms of insurance costs again this year.  We gave them 50% last year and this year we are staying close to them.  As we were coming in here today, they did not have a deal in place.  I am waiting to hear if they will get a deal.  HRI will help out in that way.</p></speech>

When the IHRB and HRI attended the committee at the start of May, concerns were raised by many members in respect of the pace at which the recommendations of the committee were being rolled out.  At that meeting, Mr. Osborne stated he was satisfied that progress was being made on all fronts.  It was clear, however, that it was not as cut and dried as was being made out at that stage.  One of the delays related to the provision of CCTV cameras in stable yards.  We were told that was due to arrive in autumn.  Is that still the position of HRI?  At what stage is the process now compared with the situation at the start of the month, for example?  Are our guests still happy that, come autumn, the likes of CCTV cameras and all that will be in stable yards?</p></speech>

We had to conduct a full European tender which began in the middle of 2021.  Believe it or not, we had to employ experts in this field.  There are no CCTV experts employed in HRI or the IHRB.  It was full procurement.  We had 11 companies tender for it and we had to work through those that qualified.  Coming into this year, we had a challenge so we had to extend the period.  I know the frameworks are all in place and the start of the CCTV was to commence this week.  I am confident that we will meet the timeframe committed to by the IHRB when it was last in with the committee, subject to any infrastructural issues that we might stumble across.  We should not encounter such issues but they would be the only thing that would stop us getting on with that.  I appreciate the frustration of the committee.  We, too, are frustrated by how long this process has taken.  Again, it was far more complex than expected in the context of dealing with all 25 racecourses or whatever that will have this CCTV.  I apologise on behalf of the HRI.</p></speech>

We have been unaffected this year.  Are numbers up compared with 2019?  Is there any indication of whether the numbers will be up?  Will it level itself out?</p></speech>

There is significant consumption of our product in terms of streaming going on around the country and people watching our racing.  We just have not yet got everyone off the sofa and back to racing.  That is a priority for HRI's marking team in the context of working with the racecourses to create events that make people want to come back.  I expect to see some good numbers over the next few weeks when there will be music alongside racing.  The Galway racing festival will be a litmus test of where people are in terms of coming back post Covid.</p></speech>

This year, the rate of growth has not been maintained.  We have seen growth in categories where there are multiple ownerships, such as partnerships, syndicates and clubs.  They are strong, which is great because it gives people a cheaper way to participate, get a feel for the industry and progress if they feel they can.  It is working.  Syndicates are a huge part of successful racing in Australia, for example.  The model is taking hold here and we have seen some really good winners recently involving multiple ownership, which is probably a much more fun way to enjoy racing.</p></speech>

However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room and environs should continue to wash their hands properly and often, avail of sanitisers, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  As they are well aware, if members are participating remotely they are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  The only apologies we have received so far are from Senators Garvey and Gavan, and Senator Gavan intends to join later; he is running late.</p> <p>  Today we are discussing offshore and renewable energy with Wind Energy Ireland.  The importance of wind and offshore energy has only grown with time.  It is vital that we harness these sources in the right way.  The climate action plan sets out a target of 5,000 MW of offshore wind electricity by 2030.  Events in recent years and months, such as the war in Ukraine and climate change, have highlighted the importance of utilising these sources of energy.  Ireland is particularly well placed, especially around the west coast, to avail of wind energy, and we need to take this opportunity so we can have a real and positive impact in achieving our climate action goals.  Job creation in this area is something we hope to see grow and prosper and I hope the witnesses can inform the committee about this.</p> <p>  I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider the matter further with the following representatives.  I welcome from Wind Energy Ireland Mr. Noel Cunniffe, CEO, and Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs.  I welcome Ms Vanessa O'Connell, head of Inis Offshore Wind and vice-chairperson of the offshore supply chain working group.  From Green Rebel I welcome Mr. Kieran Ivers, CEO.</p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. Cunniffe to make opening remarks on behalf of Wind Energy Ireland.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs; Ms Vanessa O&rsquo;Connell, head of Inis Offshore Wind and vice-chairperson of our offshore supply chain working group; and Mr. Kieran Ivers, CEO of Green Rebel.  Wind Energy Ireland represents the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential part of our low carbon energy future.  It is important to emphasise that we represent the whole supply chain.  As might be expected, our members manufacture turbines, develop projects and operate wind farms.  They also include Irish engineering, transport, surveying and planning companies.  Together, our industry employs approximately 6,000 people.  For us, it is not enough that we develop the 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy set out in the climate action plan and the even greater potential in the deeper waters off our south and west coasts.  We want to see Irish wind farms creating jobs in Ireland, supporting Irish businesses, providing training and education opportunities for Irish workers, and growing a thriving new industry.</p> <p>  I would like to begin by briefly telling the committee the story of two countries, Ireland and Scotland.  Ireland&rsquo;s only existing offshore wind farm, Arklow Bank, became operational in 2004, nearly two decades ago.  It consists of seven wind turbines and, at the time, it was one of the largest offshore wind farms in Europe.  It was the first time a wind turbine with a generating capacity of 3 MW was ever installed anywhere in the world and it is still operating today.  I would ask members to consider this for a moment; at one time Ireland was at the cutting edge of offshore wind energy and then we stopped.  It was a full three more years before the first Scottish offshore wind farm started generating electricity but Scotland did not stop.  As of 2019 there were 4,700 people employed in Scotland&rsquo;s offshore wind sector and it contributed nearly &pound;1 billion to the Scottish economy.  Today, there is almost 2,000 MW of offshore wind operational in Scotland and another 8,400 MW in construction or advanced development.  It is no surprise that in 2020 renewable energy provided 97% of Scotland&rsquo;s power.  Put simply, in the 2000s we did not take advantage of an enormous opportunity and I am here today to ask for the support of committee members to ensure we do not make the same mistake again.</p> <p>  With climate change and the crisis in Ukraine there is an even more urgent responsibility to transform our energy system to one that is clean, secure and equitable, while protecting our marine environment and securing the confidence of fishing and coastal communities.  Offshore wind will deliver greater energy security; it is the key to our energy independence.  With the right approach - with Government, industry and coastal communities working together - we can build a new industrial sector, supporting regional development, creating thousands of jobs and driving sustainable growth.  Other European countries, like Poland and Britain, have put in place an industrial strategy and a sector deal between the domestic offshore industry and those Governments.  These bring together the offshore renewables industry and the relevant state agencies and Government departments to maximise the value of the industry domestically for clean growth, which includes a strong focus on building the domestic supply chain.  We want a sector deal for Ireland but first we need to ensure our port infrastructure is ready.</p><p> In May 2020, we published an analysis called Harnessing our Potential.  It was produced by the Carbon Trust, which is a leading UK-based consultancy.  Harnessing our Potential is still the most comprehensive analysis to date of Ireland's offshore supply-chain potential.  It included a thorough examination of Irish ports and harbours.  Ports have two key roles in supporting offshore wind energy.  They can serve as an operations and maintenance base for an offshore wind farm.  Larger ports with extensive infrastructure can provide construction or marshalling services.  Several Irish harbours are suitable as operations and maintenance bases.  Members of this committee may be aware that two of our members, namely, Codling Wind Park and SSE with its Arklow Bank Wind Park, have already announced that if their projects are successful that they will use Wicklow and Arklow harbours, respectively, as their bases.</p><p> Each base translates to approximately 80 full-time jobs.  Each base is normally accompanied by extensive investment in local services and port infrastructure.  However, when it comes to construction and marshalling services, at present the only port on the island of Ireland can do this, which is Belfast Harbour.  The facilities at Belfast are first class but we will need much more.  We cannot deliver our offshore energy ambitions from a single port.</p><p> It is important that members appreciate that if projects cannot find suitable available ports in Ireland, they can, and will, build from ports on the west coast of Britain, from France and even from the Netherlands.  Some of these ports already engage with our projects.  Irish wind farms could create jobs in Cherbourg and support businesses in Rotterdam.  As we stated in May 2020, strategic investment must be directed urgently into Irish ports to enable them to build the infrastructure needed to support the construction of offshore wind energy.  We are currently carrying out a new analysis of existing port infrastructure and the expansion plans to meet the needs of offshore renewables that a number of these ports are bringing forward.  We will complete this analysis over the summer and I look forward to sharing it with the committee then.</p><p> As well as an infrastructure gap, we face a skills gap.  For example, we will need hundreds of new wind-turbine technicians.  Right now, with the support of Skillnet Ireland, we train between ten to 20 people every year with our partners in Green Tech Skillnet.   In addition, a turbine technician apprenticeship programme in Kerry awaits validation but these initiatives will not be enough.  Already we have seen our members and State bodies struggle to recruit ecologists, marine biologists and planners.  We will literally need thousands of civil, electrical and marine engineers.</p><p> I spoke to colleagues from the British and Scottish offshore wind energy industry at an Enterprise Ireland event last week.  I was struck by how they too have identified a shortage in skills and personnel as one of their most significant challenges.  Last year, the expert group on future skills needs published the Skills for  Zero Carbon report and I will highlight a small number of its recommendations.  The report recommended co-ordinated planning for training within the renewable energy sector through partnerships between Government, industry and training providers, the prioritising of training for jobs in renewable energy that are set to be in high demand, including marine planners, turbine technicians, hydrogen specialists and other technical roles, the expansion of existing maritime training to meet demand from the offshore energy sector and engagement with the fishing community to give people with experience working at sea the option to transfer into the offshore wind sector.  The report concluded by noting "Given the urgency of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s climate action goals, it is crucial that ... these recommendations are prioritised ... and are centrally driven by Government ... working in close collaboration with industry and the education and training system."  We fully endorse the report and urge the committee to support the establishment of this implementation group, as quickly as possible.</p><p> It is important to acknowledge several significant recent positive initiatives that have been taken by the Government.  Late last year, the Department of Transport published an updated policy statement that set out a strategy for commercial ports to facilitate offshore renewable energy.  The Department also worked successfully with other EU member states to amend the Connecting Europe Facility criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for offshore wind.  This initiative has enabled some Irish ports to apply for that funding to expand for servicing offshore wind energy but not all.   The Department has also established a port co-ordination group to discuss issues around port </p><p> We would like to welcome the establishment of the cross-departmental offshore wind delivery task force, which will include a focus on supply-chain issues.  Our industry would welcome the opportunity to join the task force and work together to ensure that there is a determined focus on maximising the economic benefits of offshore wind energy to Ireland.  Finally, I commend the efforts of Enterprise Ireland in particular, which last week launched an Irish offshore wind supply-chain cluster called the Gael Offshore Network.  The network consists of more than 65 Irish companies, including many of our members.</p><p> Irish businesses are already getting ready for Ireland's offshore renewable energy potential and some are starting to compete internationally.  We have enough offshore wind power to power this country and export energy as both electricity and green hydrogen.  The need is there and the potential is there.  If Irish ports and businesses are not able to take advantage of this opportunity, then there is no doubt that others will step in.  The chance to develop a skills base and an industry that can compete internationally in a rapidly growing global renewable energy market will be lost.  This is the time for Ireland to seize the opportunity, and bring together industry, policymakers and communities to ensure these multi-billion euro investments in zero-carbon generation create thousands of skilled jobs at home, and regenerate coastal communities right around the island.  We need to unite industry, Government, the relevant State agencies, and our fishing and coastal communities behind a shared vision for true energy independence and the creation of a thriving offshore renewable energy industry.</p></speech>

Interestingly, it seems that Ireland's potential for offshore energy generation is envied by a lot of Europe but we are just not quite there.</p> <p>  On floating offshore energy generation, I understand the ESB has stated "Ireland needs a ring-fenced auction for 1 GW of floating offshore wind" to begin to harness the potential of the seas off our southern and western coasts and to meet a 2030 target but also that the Government has no plans for floating offshore until after 2030.  Please explain, as those two comments do not make sense to me and I believe that one must be part of the other.</p></speech>

I am happy to share a copy of the report with members after the meeting.  We represent a large number of members with commercial interest in floating wind energy projects.  Many of these projects are developing to compete for 2030 and deliver as part of the phase 2 process for Government.  Phase 1 will be an initial phase of offshore wind energy development, which will include five projects located off the east coast and one project off the west coast.</p> <p>  Floating wind energy is a huge opportunity for Ireland's south and west coasts.  We believe that in order for floating wind energy to develop during this decade then there will need to be specific pot within the second renewable electricity support scheme auction for offshore renewables.  At the moment this has not yet been decided upon.  There was a Government consultation on that a few months and we expect to hear the results very soon.  The reason that this sector will need its own pot in the middle of the decade is that floating wind energy this decade will not be able to compete directly on price with fixed-bottom offshore wind energy, which will be the predominant technology that will be developed off our coasts this decade.  We believe that despite not being able to compete economically just yet, they will become economically competitive in the 2030s.  For Ireland, particularly off our west coast, there is an enormous potential for floating offshore wind energy as we transition to overall energy independence.  So we feel that it would be a worthwhile investment by the State to invest and allow some floating offshore wind energy projects to connect by 2030 in order that we can take those learnings and start to bring in the supply chain and develop that within Ireland.  While this is nascent technology in many countries around Europe, the supply chain is not yet there so we have not lost that opportunity yet.</p></speech>

Why?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022061500002#B00500"><p>It is primarily based on the geography of Ireland.  Fixed-bottom turbine technology is deployable in water depths of up to about 60 m.  Off the west coast and for parts of the south coast the water tends to get very steep very quickly so one needs to move into floating offshore energy for that as it can be deployed up to depths of almost 1 km, in some cases.  For the west coast potential, generally speaking there are limited areas that are suitable for the development of fixed-bottom turbines so it will be floating offshore wind off our west coast.  Off the south coast, there will be some fixed-bottom turbines but there will be a lot of floating technology.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022061500002#B00600"><p>I wish to talk specifically about the east coast.</p><p>Some people say that fixed-bottom technology is available and cheaper and that the east coast is not suitable for anything other than fixed-bottom wind farms.  They also say that fixed-bottom wind farms have to be closer to shore and floating ones can be farther out, which is a point on which I would like Mr. Cunniffe to comment.  He will understand that people on the coast have an interest in how close a wind farm will be to them.  It is my understanding that fixed-bottom wind farms can be located so far out that they will not impinge on the view, but there is also a belief that, since they have to be closer in than floating wind farms, it would be better to wait until the floating technology was ready.  I do not agree, as the time for this is now, but the view has been expressed to me that we should perhaps wait until the floating technology is a little more developed.  Is it correct to say that fixed-bottom technology is fairly developed, is in place elsewhere and can be located far offshore?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022061500002#C00200"><p>Exactly.  There are approximately 25 GW of offshore wind energy deployed in the world right now, and almost all of it is fixed-bottom.  There are other countries in Europe that can deploy fixed-bottom technology farther out to sea, but that is because they have much shallower waters close to their coastlines.  Even off the east coast, Irish waters get very deep very quickly.  As such, deploying fixed-bottom technology is the right approach to take.</p> <p>  We represent floating wind energy members as well as fixed-bottom wind energy members.  The floating wind energy community says that we need to establish a supply chain in Ireland and get offshore wind going right now so as to harness and take advantage of the floating wind energy opportunity fully.  In order for us to do that, we need to deploy fixed-bottom technology as soon as possible this decade.</p></speech>

That will be a missed opportunity.</p> <p>  The port co-ordination group does not include representatives of the offshore wind energy industry.  Does Mr. Cunniffe have any idea as to why that is the case?  Has the industry been given a reason for being left out of the group?</p></speech>

It brings together parts of that Department, the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, and a number of ports.  We include a number of Irish ports among our membership.  The group is concerned with trying to find ways of building port infrastructure and readiness for offshore renewable energy and is a good initiative.  The challenge is that it is our members that are developers rather than our members that are ports that will be setting out the specifications for what they would like to see in a port, for example, pier length and water depth.  There is something that we can bring to the table in terms of discussing our needs and readiness, which is one of the reasons that we commissioned the report that Mr. Cunniffe mentioned in his opening statement.  In that all-island report, we identified 13 ports north and south of the Border and investigated what port infrastructure existed right now to construct and marshal an offshore wind farm.  It also considered what could be in place in two or three years' time if ports like Rosslare and Shannon Foynes delivered on their infrastructural development plans.  We have been happy to support those plans in terms of their applications to the Connecting Europe Facility.  I hope that, when we bring the report to members of this committee, we will have a much clearer understanding of what is in place and what needs to be in place.  Fixed-bottom and floating requirements are a little different, so we need to prepare not just for what can be done today, but what can be done in the late 2020s and 2030s.  When we finish the report, we hope that it will be taken seriously by the Department and will inform the thinking of the Department and members of this committee.</p></speech>

What is the scope for jobs?  Mr. Cunniffe will not be able to give us the exact numbers, but will he give us an idea of the potential and what we might be missing out on if we do not have a supply chain of apprenticeships?  I have met members of the Connect Trade Union who are anxious to be involved in this area.  It is new technology and they have an interest in ensuring that the jobs being created are not just jobs for the sake of jobs but are instead good union jobs with set minimum rates of pay and everything else that we associate with the trades.  We can see where the 80 jobs will be but we cannot see where the benefits for the community will be as clearly.  Will Mr. Cunniffe discuss this matter?  What could we miss out on if we do not get the apprenticeship approvals in place and start that pipeline?  It is proving difficult to attract workers because we are in the midst of an accommodation crisis, which presents challenges, so our best chance of progressing this work is to educate people who are already in Ireland.  What could we miss out on if we were slow to get everything up and running?</p></speech>

They are not just people who are installing the turbines, but also planners, hauliers and the entire supply chain, including people working in financial institutions across the country.  We have commissioned a report, entitled "Harnessing our potential: Investment and jobs in Ireland's offshore wind energy", which I referenced in my opening statement.  It examined Ireland's old target for offshore renewable energy, which was 3.5 GW.  We have since increased that to 5 GW.  The report identified that, between 2020 and 2030, approximately 2,500 jobs would have been created by the offshore wind energy sector deploying the 3.5 GW.  Scotland already has 4,700 people employed.</p> <p>  The potential for jobs in our industry is as limited as Ireland makes it.  Ireland has an enormous marine area and we are the envy of Europe.  We can become not just energy independent, but a significant exporter of energy.  To do that, though, we will need the right types of skill, training and facilities.  That is why having a task force that devises an action plan for developing the right jobs, the right training facilities and the right collaboration with third level institutes will be vital.</p> <p>  A sector deal was put in place in Britain.  Ms O'Connell was central to that, so I will pass over to her to discuss that experience.</p></speech>

I was involved in development, construction and operations.  Something that I saw that was a success and that has since become a platform for growth of offshore wind and ensured that the benefits of offshore wind energy are harvested for the UK was a sector deal that was signed in 2019.  Effectively, it was a partnership between the British Government and industry.  It was a handshake whereby industry and the British Government were committing to actions in terms of delivering offshore wind energy in the UK.  At the time, the target was to deliver 30 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.  That target has since been accelerated to 50 GW.  In terms of the industry, part of that was to be 60% local content.  This was not a mandatory target, but a vision that the industry committed to working towards together.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity in Ireland that is not just about the green electrons, but about creating a whole new industry that can benefit the people of Ireland and generate many jobs.  We have some work to do to figure out what that means in terms of tangible numbers.  The UK had a target of 30,000 jobs in the industry by 2030 and has already smashed that target.  According to a report it has released, there are now 30,000 people working in the industry.  The UK envisages that that figure will be 100,000 by 2030.</p> <p>  The scale of the opportunity is probably more than we understand today.  That is why we are here.  There is a significant opportunity, so let the Government, industry and communities sit down and figure out what is right for Ireland, what our ambition should be and how we will work towards it together.  In terms of working together, we welcome the offshore wind energy task force that has been established by the Government, but let us bring the industry to the table and work together in collaboration more frequently.  Under the offshore wind sector deal, the UK set up the Offshore Wind Industry Council, through which the industry and the British Government work together, set an action plan and work through it over time.</p> <p>  It is great for us to attend this meeting to discuss what we want, but this is a matter of us continuing to work together on delivering for Ireland.  The reason I came home to Ireland was my excitement about this opportunity.  Now that I am here, I can see the market beginning to move.  There is much that we can do by working together.</p></speech>

We are not here to say we can do it all by ourselves but Green Rebel is certainly an example of a company with a lead time whereby it can deliver not just for offshore in a DevEx phase but actually deliver competency that can compete on a global level.  Up to last week, we had a trade delegation in from Norway representing over 250 companies with over 10,000 employees, many of which are diversifying from oil and gas.  If Ireland does not move quickly, they are the skills and services that will be imported into Ireland.</p> <p>  We mentioned floating offshore.  It depends on the context of our ambition.  If our ambition is just to service our own needs then the jobs created will be designed to service Ireland only.  When we look at innovations like floating offshore and the opportunity this presents to Ireland given the west coast of Ireland, it is a basis for innovation.  Ireland has an opportunity to more than export energy to other markets.  It has an opportunity to deliver expertise and competency and develop intellectual property in Ireland that we can export all over the world.  If we can develop a platform where Government, officials and industry can come together and plan that, we will see maximum effect regarding the employment created.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the witnesses are carrying out analysis of port infrastructure so they may not be able to answer this specifically but perhaps they can offer some level of detail regarding the level of investment that is required to sufficiently address the infrastructure needs at our ports and the sort of timeframe they believe that would take.</p></speech>

Some ports have different levels of infrastructure.  In the past 12 months, we have seen developments like the Doyle Shipping Group facility at the port of Cork and developments in Rosslare and Shannon Foynes and there is a proposal to build a new port in Bremore in north County Dublin.  They are all coming forward with proposals, ideas and plans and the cost of each of them will vary because some ports have different levels of infrastructure in place.  In terms of a ball park figure, we are talking about tens of millions of euro but the actual figure will vary from project to port to port.  They have also applied for funding to the Connecting Europe facility so their hope is that they would be able to draw down funding from Europe that would enable them to carry out those investments and put in place the infrastructure that is needed.</p> <p>  The last point raised by the Senator is the critical one.  It concerns the timing of this and how quickly we can get those ports ready.  If we are looking at our phase one projects, those five ports on the east coast and one off the coast of the Senator's home county of Galway near Rossaveel, we are looking at projects in respect of which we hope to apply for planning permission next year.  We hope to start construction in 2025 or 2026 at the outside so the question for us is whether ports other than Belfast will be ready then for those projects.  Belfast will be able to take some of that work.  It is a first-class facility but it cannot build six Irish offshore wind farms at the same time.  If those ports are not ready, those projects will be looking to other ports and other infrastructure opportunities to provide the construction marshalling services.  This is why it is not just important that the investment is there but that the investment comes through quickly and the ports are helped to get through the planning process to put in place the infrastructure they need.</p></speech>

To put that in context, any one of these projects that are being developed around our coast line will be investing between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion - &euro;1,000 million and &euro;2,000 million.  When we talk about a &euro;100 million investment in a port, it might sound like a lot of money but these ports will be servicing these projects that involve multiples of that figure.  They will benefit from that for years to come.</p></speech>

It is already a key part of the port infrastructure that supports the development of onshore wind energy because many of the turbines that are used for onshore wind farms in the west of Ireland come through the Port of Galway.  They are landed there and taken to the wind farms.</p> <p>  We are not here to pick a port winner.  There will be enough work in the development of offshore wind energy in Ireland to provide opportunities for every significant port in this country.  Even for some smaller ports and harbours, there are opportunities for them to be operations and maintenance bases.  When we look at the west coast in particular, and as the Senator noted, the wind speeds out there are fantastic, it is not just about the opportunity to construct, marshal, operate and maintain those projects.  We can be innovators and leaders out there because we will be developing offshore wind energy in some of the windiest parts and deepest waters of the world and we can take the skills we develop there, and I do not know if Mr. Ivers would like to come in on this because I know it is an area in which Green Rebel has worked, and take them around the world and compete internationally.  One of the things we want to get across here is that if we can build an Irish supply chain to support Irish offshore wind farms, there is no reason those Irish companies will not be building wind farms off the coast of China, the US or Africa in 15 or 20 years time or less.</p></speech>

We have people who have literally written books about the continental shelf and Ireland and they will identify the west coast as our basin for innovation.  The context of ports will be different given the water depths off those ports and the types of structures that will be deployed off the coast line on the west versus the east.  We would identify Galway and Rossaveel in particular as bases where innovation and centres of excellence can be created and where robotics can be deployed.  The west coast of Ireland has deeper water and harsher conditions than anywhere on the planet.  It is virtually impossible to simulate that in any environment other than the real thing.  Given the opportunity for innovation presented by the west coast of Ireland, it will surely present an opportunity for exporting that level of expertise but that is not being done in the world at the moment.</p></speech>

We are not aware if this has been established yet.  We would like to see that established as soon as possible.  It was referenced by Deputy O'Reilly, who asked what type of skills were in short supply.  We are already experiencing across the industry a shortage of planners, marine biologists, ecologists and tradespeople.  We need to see apprenticeships begun immediately and partnerships with technological universities and third-level institutions around Ireland and to do that, we need that action plan to be brought together so that we can come at it as a country rather than each individual college, some of which have stepped forward on their own volition to try to develop apprenticeship and third-level programmes to service the needs of the industry.  We need to see co-ordinated action and for that reason, we need that implementation to be established as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The development has been completed at Belfast Port, whereas we are waiting for our ports to be ready.  If Shannon Foynes Port was ready, could two or three platforms be developed at once or would they have to be done one at a time?</p></speech>

The period of construction for an offshore wind farm is two to three years.  There could be a situation where different pieces of work for perhaps two wind farms are coming out of the same port at the same time.  There could be a situation where a main port is being used for marshalling services and a nearby port is also involved in taking on some of that work.  There can be multi-port opportunities.  The facility at Belfast Port is fantastic.  If the committee members ever get the chance to visit it, I highly recommend it.  It is an example of what first-class facilities for construction and marshalling look like.  With the best will in the world, you cannot build 5,000 MW of offshore wind simultaneously in five different projects from that facility.  Either you put them in a queue, basically, and do them as quickly as possible to get through the work, or you find other port facilities or infrastructure.  With Shannon Foynes, there is enormous potential for the port to be a hub not just for the construction of offshore wind farms but as a place where we can bring power onshore and create green hydrogen, which is one of the real exciting export opportunities for Ireland.  There is also an opportunity to take that green hydrogen and decarbonise some the sectors of our own economy that are quite difficult to decarbonise, such as heating, transport and electricity.</p></speech>

We are now aiming for an 80% renewable figure.  It is important to put the issue in context and it is worth saying that Scotland is different.  That brings me to the following question.  With capital and construction capacity scarce for public investment in Ireland, the organisations represented today are urging the Government to do more and to put more of its money into accelerating offshore wind beyond what it is already anticipating.  I want to tease that out.  Are the organisations' higher ambitions conditional on export?  Is that really the context, rather than greening our existing grid?  Will it require additional interconnection and the development of the green hydrogen sector?  There are obviously different phases to the work, and different elements have higher priority at a time of constrained resources, a housing crisis and all of the other issues.  The challenge facing the Government is choosing which of these things are most urgent.  How do the organisations represented assess that urgency in the context of other issues, as well as the fact that it requires the development of a hydrogen sector that is still relatively underutilised?  There needs to be a hydrogen strategy here that gives us a context for that.</p> <p>  The witnesses have stated that there the water off the west coast is extraordinarily  deep, conditions are harsh, and will still be difficult to work in.  Should this be more of a European infrastructural play than simply an Irish play?  Should we be looking to the longer-term global context in which the Atlantic resource will be tapped into?  Does that alter the view of the witnesses on how this opportunity should be developed?</p> <p>  I am also interested to know what the successful elements of the Scottish strategy were, and what mistakes were made so that we can perhaps learn from them.  I know that the Scottish project is different.  Scotland has a bigger connection and a bigger demand source on its doorstep.  Those are my questions.  </p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that the target that we have to deliver 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030 is extremely ambitious.  We definitely think it is deliverable but in order for that to happen, a lot of things need to fall into place in terms of our planning system, our grid system and our route to market.  We appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action a few months ago.  We stated that we have a 50:50 chance of achieving the 5 GW the target for offshore wind energy specifically.  We are not here to say that we need a higher target for offshore wind.  We are saying that we really need to double down and focus on delivering that 5 GW of offshore wind energy.  That said, we want the highlight the opportunity that that target presents for the domestic supply chain.  It is true that capital and resources are scarce but those projects will be built.  The question that we would like to highlight today is whether they will be built from Irish ports and by Irish companies.  That is why the establishment of a delivery task force on supply chain to try to produce an action plan is critical, so that as much of that potential and investment that we are going to see to deliver our 2030 targets remains within Ireland.</p> <p>  On whether the potential we are talking about is really for the export opportunity, we will need an enormous amount of electricity to service Ireland as we go towards 2050 and towards becoming a climate-neutral country.  We did some analysis with UCC's MaREI centre looking at a zero-carbon economy for Ireland.  It showed that electricity demand will triple between now and 2050, predominantly as we electrify heat and transport.  We are going to need around 25 GW of offshore wind energy purely for our own domestic purposes before we even contemplate the export potential opportunity that we have off our west coast, which we believe to be equivalent to around 70 GW to 80 GW of capacity.  The establishment of a hydrogen supply chain will be very important to that over time.  We are not talking about purely direct electrification for everything.  The electricity grid that we currently have is not capable of managing the level of energy that I have just spoken about.  We will need hydrogen in order to decarbonise heat and transport, but the source and the base of that will be offshore wind energy.  The more that we can establish our own supply chain, the better.</p> <p>  On the European side of things, currently, countries across Europe are trying to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible, following the crisis in Ukraine.  We are seeing countries right across Europe increasing their targets for offshore wind energy every week.  Two years ago, the 2030 offshore wind target in Europe was 60 GW.  Just two weeks ago there was an announcement that Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands will be developing 65 GW by themselves between now and 2030.  Right across Europe, we are hearing that supply chain constraints are a big challenge.  All the countries will need to pool together their resources and supply chains if we are to have any chance of meeting Europe's target.  I will refer to my colleague, Ms O'Connell, to respond to the Deputy's question on Scotland.  </p></speech>

When the sector deal was signed, it was looking at offshore wind in the whole of the UK.  As it has developed, Scotland has started to focus on what Scotland can do itself, rather than with England and Wales.  Looking at the whole of the UK, one of the lessons learned is thinking about what the different parts of the country need.  Originally, there was the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which was for the whole of the UK.  Now, Scotland has its own Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council.  It is looking at what Scotland needs, rather than what the rest of the UK needs.  That is one of the lessons learned.</p><p>It has also been a focus in the UK.  The benefits of offshore wind are not concentrated within one area.  The wind farms are all around the coast.  We need therefore to look to understand where we can develop clusters for innovation for the development of the supply chain.  That is in around areas such as Cork, the west, Foynes and the east.  That cluster effect is important for having a national strategy, as well as for thinking about what we need in different parts of the country.  That is one key lesson that has been learned.  It is also safe to say that the UK and Scotland are still on the journey in offshore wind.  They have been successful to date, but they still have much work to do.  We are also facing some of the challenges they are facing.  There are lessons to learned by working together.  Some of those challenges, particularly for Scotland, relate to grid infrastructure.</p><p> The Deputy raised the point of export opportunity around interconnection.  That is also a challenge for Scotland.  We must understand that they are nearly at 100% renewables on their system.  They are already exporting their energy to England.  They are looking to see where they can export it abroad.  System integration is a challenge.  Resourcing is also a challenge.  That is a key challenge for Ireland.  It is a matter of resourcing within the industry as well as across the industry, for example with the likes of EirGrid, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the environmental organisations.  This comes back to our point that it is important that we come together to learn the lessons from other markets.  Those primarily come from the industries.  It is a matter of many international players coming to Ireland and people like myself coming back to Ireland.  We can share the lessons we have learned.  We can ask what is right for Ireland.  We can ask what we want the vision to be.  Then we can work towards that.</p></speech>

When a witness comes before an Oireachtas committee, they usually have an ask.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; top three asks of us as members of the enterprise committee?  We are focusing on business, enterprise and trade.  What would the witnesses like us to do?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

That task force is up and running.  It does not have industry representation on it at the moment.  We do not know what topics it is covering.  We believe the supply chain is part of the task force&rsquo;s remit.  We want to be at the table to try to explain the opportunities we have seen in other jurisdictions, as Ms O&rsquo;Connell outlined.</p> <p>  The second ask is for more investment and strategic investment into port infrastructure.  As we have said this morning, port opportunities are being developed across Ireland in many of our ports.  However, in order for them to be ready to help to deliver for 2030, they need investment now.</p> <p>  The final ask relates to the Skills for Zero Carbon report we referenced earlier.  We need to see an implementation group set up so that there is a co-ordinated response right across government and across all Departments as we develop the people, the training and the skill sets to be able to deliver on the opportunity.</p></speech>

It is seen as something that that Department does.  If there is a wind farm, an offshore wind farm or anything to do with climate or decarbonisation, that is considered a matter for Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  Absolutely, they are the people we deal with most on a day-to-day basis and the people we engage with.  However, jobs, trade and employment are matters for this committee and this Department.</p> <p>  I want to stress that we welcome the offshore wind delivery task force as an initiative because it will get us to the ambitious targets that Deputy Bruton mentioned.  There is a group of people that is working through its agenda and to-do list.  They are trying to sort out the planning system and they are trying to sort out the grid infrastructure.  If the supply chain is the eighth or ninth item on its list before any other business, it is often the item it spends the least amount of time focused on.  What we want to see from the Department or the committee is that somebody will take responsibility for the jobs opportunity that offshore wind energy will bring.</p></speech>

We have seen reports across the board about how costs have gone up dramatically.  There are supply cost issues, supply chain issues and so forth.  The costs of the material have gone up.  Mariupol had the biggest steel plant in Europe.  That is kaput now; it is not producing anymore.  What impact will that have on the witnesses&rsquo; levelised cost of electricity projections that they cite in the Revolution report?  They talk about the flow costs per megawatt in 2021 being &euro;135 and how they will go down to &euro;40 in 2050.  Do they think that when the war finishes, the costs will level off again?  Can they talk about the costs, in the context of the impact that the changed world will have on them, since the Revolution report was actually commissioned?</p></speech>

We have just come out of the more recent renewable electricity support scheme auction for onshore renewables.  It gives us a clear example where there have been increased costs relating to materials for onshore wind energy and for solar energy.  That is not the only reason costs are going up.  There are still many uncertainties in terms of policies related to grid infrastructure and planning systems.  These are being baked into driving up costs.  When it comes to costs specifically for offshore wind and for floating offshore wind energy, we do not yet have a good example in Europe for what the costs of developing floating offshore wind energy for commercial-scale projects will be.  Britain and France are both in the process of developing and running auctions specifically for floating wind energy.  In the next six to 12 months we should have a good idea of what the real commercial costs will be for developing floating offshore wind energy.  We will be happy to share that with the committee whenever that comes to light.</p> <p>  There is concern among the development community for offshore wind projects for this decade about how they will source those materials, the right supply chain and the right ships.  We mentioned that every country right around Europe right now is looking at how to increase its renewable energy targets.  Right now, the European supply chain is just not capable of keeping up with it.  That is why it is important that we get on board and we start contributing to that.</p></speech>

It was put to me recently that Scotland is moving ahead.  It has connectors to Northern Ireland and across here.  If we do not move here, could we end up importing offshore wind-generated electricity from Scotland rather than producing our own?  Is that a risk?</p></speech>

They have huge ambitions for developing offshore wind energy in Great Britain.  They have a target of 50 GW, compared to our 5 GW.  We believe that our 5 GW target will supply 30% to 40% of our electricity demand by 2030.  When you couple that with the onshore wind energy sector, which is continuing to grow in Ireland, and with solar energy, we should be able to hit the target of having 80% of our own electricity from renewables by 2030.  Our goal as a country should be to try to achieve net zero-carbon electricity by 2035.  We have the resources there.  That is not up for debate.  What is up for debate is how cheaply we can deliver that, how efficiently and how much of that investment we can keep within Ireland.</p></speech>

This is really exciting and far-seeing.  How far away are we from that happening?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.321" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022061500002#F01200"><p>Earlier this year, we published a report on hydrogen and wind energy which looked at the policy asks we would have as a renewable industry to get hydrogen up and running in Ireland.  We can share that with committee members afterwards if that would be useful.  There are two key issues to highlight.  We need a hydrogen strategy for Ireland.  Such a strategy is in the process of being developed, but we do not have it yet.  We understand the consultation for that will be published shortly.  As a country, we need to stimulate not just the supply of hydrogen, which is where the renewable energy comes in, but also the demand for hydrogen.  How are we going to shift industries which are currently using oil and gas in particular to try to move them towards hydrogen?</p> <p>  The other point I would make, and the report called it out, is that what will drive the cost of hydrogen is the cost of the renewables that we are developing.  The more certainty that we can provide to the development community for renewable electricity through having a planning system, a grid system and a supply chain that works, the cheaper we can produce renewable power and the cheaper we can transition to hydrogen.  There are projects involving the development of hydrogen at the moment around Ireland.  We think that will play a big role towards the end of the decade and into the 2030s.</p></speech>

It is to be located in my part of the country.  It has caused a certain amount of angst among some residents.  There is the whole issue of the grid upgrade.  We hear of more pylons being spoken about.  I am sure Mr. Cunniffe has been down that route as well and has heard about it.  If we need more pylons to upgrade the grid but people do not want them near their houses, or anywhere near them, how do we get over that issue?  They get very emotional and very angry about them.  Can the witnesses speak to that point, please?</p></speech>

We developed our electricity grid substantially in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s.  We have been benefiting from the capacity that was created in that grid for the past two decades, and it has helped to drive much of the economic growth and employment we have seen in Ireland.  We are starting to reach a point where our electricity grid will need further levels of reinforcement, along the coasts in particular, to deliver offshore wind energy and, in the midlands and other parts of the country, to deliver onshore renewables as well.  We are going to need political and public support for our grid infrastructure if we are to have any chance of meeting our decarbonisation targets.  We will need more pylons, more underground cables and more substations.  We cannot do this if we do not have them.</p></speech>

We do not need to wait until 2030 to say that either.  Either the grid infrastructure will be there and we will achieve the target, or it will not and we will not.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

I have met Mr. Cunniffe and Mr. Moran at exhibitions and so on and we have engaged.  I have a specific concern, as I have highlighted to them, about the potential for wind energy off the south-east coast, not least in the Copper Coast area, and the potential for damage to amenities.  It is important that this committee has an ongoing engagement with the wider wind energy sector, but I would support our guests' call for at least a sector deal and for a representative from the offshore industry to sit on the co-ordination group.  Perhaps that is something the committee can speak about in private session.</p> <p>  As I have said to our guests previously, I have concerns about a lack of State ownership in the wind energy sector as it develops, primarily because we do not have expertise and I can see that something similar to what happened with the oil industry is going to happen.  Ultimately, we will sell the licences, foreign players will come in and provide everything and we will ask what we really got out of it.   We might not even get a good rate of electricity charged to the State.</p> <p>  I am also worried about how the coastal communities will be looked after.  One issue I have previously raised relates to how a community dividend, which in general in the wind sector is looked at for about 15 years over the lifetime of a farm, should be paid every year.  If a turbine turns at sea or on land, a community needs to be resourced from that.  I am worried not only about amenities in tourism but also about the fishing industry.  Ms O&rsquo;Connell might speak about Scotland in a moment.  Some of the largest spawning grounds in Europe are to be found off the south coast of Ireland, so she might comment on the effects of talking about putting wind infrastructure out there.</p> <p>  Is any potential tie-up being signalled for people who are coming in to invest in wind infrastructure whereby they would also tie in hydrogen development?  Rather than say we are going to create wind farms and then talk about creating hydrogen plants, are any conglomerates interested in coming with that package and saying that as part of their wind farm licence, they would be prepared to invest in hydrogen development onshore?  In the south east, we have one of the most significant gateways to composite developments in the form of turbine manufacture.  Mr. Cunniffe referred to a course starting in Kerry, but we need very significant academic linkage and his organisation mentioned it was hoping to engage with higher education.</p> <p>  We are at an early stage, but I would like to see a sectoral deal done, with our guests getting representation and with us, as a committee, engaging with them twice a year.  It would be good to get committee members out - visits to Belfast, Scotland or wherever were mentioned - to understand where this wind generation deal is going.  There is no doubt there is opportunity in this for Ireland, but I very much fear it is going to pass us by.  I fear that foreign players will dominate the space and that we may not see much out of it other than, as I said, a not very competitive tariff on wind.</p></speech>

In regard to the State ownership question, there are many active State-owned companies in the energy sector in Ireland right now.  Everyone will be familiar with the ESB, one of the largest owners of onshore wind energy in Ireland.  Through a partnership between the ESB and Coillte, Future Energy Ireland has been established as a State company developing onshore wind energy and Bord na M&oacute;na is very much established as an onshore wind energy and solar developer as well.  There is a great deal of State involvement in that.  Moreover, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is one of the main investors in Ms O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s Inis Offshore Wind.  We will see investment from the State in that.</p> <p>  Any offshore wind farm that is developed around Ireland will also pay a seabed lease, so revenue for the State will be generated from every offshore wind farm that is developed.  We are also seeing considerable levels of investment in, as I mentioned, many ports throughout the country, which are putting up their hands and saying they want to invest here and to keep as much money in Ireland as they can.  We have seen those announcements in Arklow and Wicklow from maintenance and operations bases being set up.</p> <p>  My one concern, as has been suggested by a number of groups previously, is that if we were to take a step back and to establish a State body to develop offshore wind energy, it would take a very long time to resource that and to establish both it and a regulator.  We would not develop a single offshore wind turbine for the next ten to 15 years if we were to do that.  Many of the projects around our coasts have been in development for years or, in some cases, decades, and those projects need to proceed and we need to be able to establish that.  There is a significant role for the State in resourcing Departments.  We need a functional State Department, through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to be able to deliver the full potential for this industry in order that we can get a return for the people.</p></speech>

It is always a challenge because it involves putting infrastructure in an area that may be fished, so we need to find a way to resolve that.  In the UK, some lessons have been learned relating to coexistence and compensation, and we have looked at opportunities to get the fishing industry involved in the offshore wind industry as guard vessels and in construction and operations.  Nevertheless, it is important that when we come back to Ireland, we understand the concerns of the fishing industry here and how we can solve those problems.  Some lessons will be learned, but Ireland is unique and the fishing industry is really important to the country.   For us at Inis Offshore Wind, it is the number one stakeholder we have.  Very early on, we engaged with it to understand its concerns and how we could mitigate its concerns whether through the wind farm design or by finding ways to coexist.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Moran to discuss the initiative going on within Wind Energy Ireland, specifically as it relates to the fishing industry and the groups that have been formed.  I was very happy to hear the Deputy welcome the sector deal.  It is something we can take away to contacts we have who are involved in the UK sector deal because I think they would be more than happy to help.  A number of people within the UK industry are also looking to Ireland.  They would be more than happy to welcome us over there, perhaps to visit a wind farm to understand what is going on.  That is something we can take away.</p></speech>

It relates to community benefit and to ensuring that will be spread over the lifetime of the project.  It is something we would like to see as well and we would expect to see it from our members, but the community benefit fund as a requirement of the contract an offshore wind farm will get is related to the duration of the contract.  We will clearly say to our members that just because the contract is running out, that does not mean they get to close shop and go away.  They will still need to support those local communities but the contract will run out after 15 or 16 years.</p> <p>  As for our engagement with the fishing community, we both do that at a project level, whereby officers talk to fishermen on specific piers and around harbours.  We are also increasingly doing it on a national level with the existing fishing organisations.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently appointed a chairperson for what is called the seafood offshore renewable energy working group, which will bring together about 11 or 12 fishing organisations and us, representing the offshore wind sector, but also - this is important - the Departments and State agencies that are relevant to this, such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These people have been put together to sit around the table and ensure that when we develop these wind farms, we will be conscious of the impact they may have on marine biodiversity and the environment and, in particular, on the coastal and fishing communities that depend on those waters for their livelihoods and to pay rent and send their kids to college.</p><p>Not only should these wind farms not be an impediment to them, there is an opportunity here.  I might bring Mr. Ivers in to talk about this in a moment.  There is enormous opportunity here for people with marine skills and there are very few people in Ireland with more marine skills than fishermen.  They would be able to work and be part of the development of offshore renewable energy.  It would also be useful to hear from Mr. Ivers about getting Irish companies into the supply chain.  We want Irish companies, whether semi-State bodies or private sector companies, to get into the Irish supply chain.  Green Rebel is one of the leaders in that at the moment.</p></speech>

We are well aware that the bounty achieved in Cork from the Kinsale gas field was the contract for catering.  That needs to be reversed.  We cannot make the same mistakes again.  Ireland has a poor history in the context of benefiting from our own natural resources.  A sectoral deal is not an off-the-shelf solution.  It can only be achieved with collaboration between the Government, industry and officials.  The by-product of that type of collaboration is a sectoral deal that is bespoke to Ireland and that we can benefit from.  That should encourage the development of an indigenous supply chain, as well as foreign direct investment into Ireland.  We cannot do it all ourselves but we can encourage investment and make provisions so those who want to do business in Ireland have to invest in Ireland and not just create a postcode.  Deputy Bruton spoke about dipping into Ireland's coffers.  In Scotland, the industry stimulus that was provided, from the developer's pocket, as a result of that collaboration has been critically important.</p> <p>  Collaboration between entities will also help the Government identify some of the surmountable challenges the industry is facing right now.  One example in Green Rebel's world is this issue around licensing and foreshore licences.  Right now we have a buoy, a floating LiDAR innovation, which is best in class globally and was developed in Ireland specifically to target floating offshore wind.  We are having to send it to Rotterdam, and will continue to do so over the next two years, investing north of &euro;3 million, in order to get its certification because we cannot get licensing here.  We are not talking about the licensing of an offshore wind farm.  This is a tiny piece but these are surmountable challenges that can only be brought to this type of forum.  This opportunity for Ireland, including the economic opportunity, cannot be lost.  That is what we are passionate about.</p></speech>

That comes across from the witnesses' passion.  I ask Mr. Ivers and Ms O'Connell to tell us a little about their companies, what they do and what their ambition is.  I would like to give them the opportunity while they are here, if the Chair does not mind, to give an idea of what they do.  Mr. Ivers said he has feet on the ground.

We were formed over two years ago by the Temporis Aurora fund.  One of our key investors is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  The core purpose of Inis Offshore Wind is to develop offshore wind in Ireland for the people of Ireland.  The Irish people have a direct stake in our success through our backers but as a company we are also committed to ensuring the benefits of offshore wind come to the people of Ireland.  I worked in the UK for ten years and I have the experience of seeing the growth of an industry.  It was exciting to be there and I had a great career, but there was always something calling me back to Ireland.  It is so windy in Ireland, and we have huge opportunities here.  Now I have the opportunity to head up a company that is looking to do that.  I am personally very vested in what we are doing.</p> <p>  Specifically, we are a developer.  We have five projects all around the coast of Ireland and are looking at another project with a capacity of up to 4 GW.  We have two projects in the east, one in the south and two in the west.  Our interest is in the potential in all of Ireland.  We want all parts of Ireland to develop from a supply chain perspective.  It is not just about the jobs.  If we think about the interest of a developer, having a local supply chain makes sense from a cost perspective but also from a resilience perspective.  We talked about the global challenges in the supply chain.  I had the same conversations as Mr. Cunniffe at the Enterprise Ireland event last week.  Everyone was talking about the global challenges in the supply chain and the market.  Ireland is a new market.  We need to work together to attract the supply chain and tell people Ireland is open for business.  We have this vision and the targets but there is more we can do to show we are really open for business and are going to deliver.  That will help the supply chain come.  It is important that we develop Irish companies but as Mr. Ivers was saying, we also need foreign direct investment and to make sure that when companies do invest, it is long-term investment that creates jobs here for the long term.  We have our projects and we are in the early development phases.  We are looking to get foreshore licences in order that we can go out and survey the seabed, but, ultimately, we have a long pipeline to deliver projects up to 2030 and beyond.</p></speech>

We are a marine services company.  We acquire data for developers that help inform them through the consent process as they apply for planning permission.  Those data are designed to inform them on how to minimise the ecological impact of offshore wind farms and maximise the efficiency.  We have invested significant capital in the acquisition of aircraft to run baseline ecology surveys, tracking bird and mammal migration patterns and densities to ensure we are ecologically sound.  We have invested in a fleet of marine craft.  It is like cutting the lawn at home where you go up and down in lines.  We do the same on the investigation areas, identifying the seabed and its nuances in order to inform ecological and engineering requirements.  We acquired a company last year, IDS Monitoring in Limerick, which makes up our MetOcean team.  That team has developed the innovations I described to Deputy Shanahan and measures wind density and velocity.  Those are the bankable data offshore wind farm developers need to release capital to develop these projects.  It is a critical component of what they do.  This is a real example of "Ireland can".  In the space of two years we have gone from an idea to 75 employees, with ambition to grow well beyond 100 by the end of the this year.  We have received extraordinary support from Government agencies like Enterprise Ireland, which are helping accelerate what we do in markets as far away as Australia.  Ireland is the accelerator for Green Rebel but it is also the brake for our supply chain in the instances I explained to Deputy Shanahan.  We will continue to invest in Ireland and use Ireland as our proof of concept in many cases.  We will use it as a trampoline, for want of a better word, to show Ireland can compete and be a world leader in this industry.</p></speech>

Ms O'Connell mentioned clusters earlier.  Having clusters of excellence is an important part of this.  Looking at Green Rebel based in Cork and the infrastructure of wind energy companies that are there at the moment, they are also coming around Cork's youth.  Irish companies like DP Energy and Simply Blue are focused on floating wind energy and are building things, employing people and putting infrastructure in place.  Some of the biggest global developers, like &Oslash;rsted and Statkraft, are also based there.  Other companies in the supply chain, such as the Doyle Shipping Group, are looking at the Port of Cork facility as an opportunity.  Mr. Cunniffe and I often joke that we will have to open up our own office in Cork-----</p></speech>

That is an example of how, when there is that critical mass of companies focused on an area, it just grows and grows.  If we can do that in Cork, we can do it in Shannon Foynes on the west coast or in Galway.  Those clusters can expand from there and create jobs in the decarbonisation of our economy, which has to be one of the top priorities for Ireland over the next 20 years.</p></speech>

Is this an internal cross-Government group or does it have a lot of outside sectoral players?  One of the central concerns seems to be that some of the knowledge within the sector is not being brought to bear on those framing the policy.</p><p> My second question is for my own understanding.  We have regional enterprise strategies that are drawn up on a three- or four-year cycle.  We also have regional skills fora.  It seems to me that if you are talking about a number of clusters in Ireland, these might be the vehicle for developing the thinking, as well as for preparing the universities, the colleges of education and the education and training boards, ETBs, for the opportunity.  This would also embed within Government thinking where this opportunity could flow further.  To what extent have the witnesses sought to embed this into these emerging regional enterprise strategies and skills fora that are run regionally?  It seems to me that that is the way to get clusters to work.  It will not be by going to Kildare Street or Merrion Street and by getting someone to call the shots.  It may be the case that a bottom-up, as well as a top-down strategy might be good.  </p></speech>

His first question relates to who exactly is on the taskforce.  It is our understanding that the taskforce has recently been established and is cross-departmental.  It also has inputs from the likes of Enterprise Ireland and others.  There is no industry representative on it at the moment.  We believe that we can bring the experience to the table.  Ms O'Connell and others, are bringing that back to Ireland having spent years in other jurisdictions in developing offshore wind energy and learning through its peaks and troughs.  They may have learned lessons in other countries that can help deliver it here.</p> <p>  Earlier, Ms O'Connell mentioned the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which has been established in the UK.  It has considerable industry, Government and State buy-in to develop something similar to this.  The Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council has something similar too.  There was a Norwegian delegation in Wexford last week.  They also mentioned that there is industry involvement in their establishment.  Their partnership is not quite a sector deal, but people are coming together to deliver this.  We are asking for the best practices that have been put in place in other jurisdictions to establish global leaders in offshore wind industry-----</p></speech>

I may bring Ms O&rsquo;Connell in to speak to that point.  We recognise that it is not appropriate for us to be at every table, but we believe that we should be at many of them.  We have much to add.  Does Ms O&rsquo;Connell want to comment?</p></speech>

We would have to figure out exactly how it would work in Ireland.  It could probably be an offshoot of the offshore wind industry taskforce.  The industry and the Government would be involved.  It would then be a matter of figuring out what the focus areas should be.  Today, we are very focused on the supply chain.  When you look at the sector deals in the UK, Poland and elsewhere, supply chain is a key focus.  Other elements that are focused on include the points around system integration and resourcing.</p> <p>  One issue I have not mentioned today, which is extremely important, is the environment.  There is now a big focus on having a net-positive effect on the environment from offshore wind.  We can only get that by working together.  As it currently stands, offshore wind farms will do their own environmental assessments on a project-by-project basis.  The environment is much broader than that.  There is much work now ongoing in talking about some sort of strategic compensation and looking across the board.  We would have to work together to figure out how the implementation would work.  The Government needs to do its business, but there needs to be collaboration.  We must figure out where it makes sense to do it.  </p></speech>

At the moment, a number of our members in those areas are engaging with those regional economic strategies.  They are engaging particularly with councils, for example, on their plans for developing.  They are looking at how wind energy can be part of that.  We are also finding a real enthusiasm from the regional economic groups, regional assemblies and county councils who want to be involved in it.  We are not encountering resistance there.  It is an open door.  They see the potential that will be in their geographic locations.</p> <p>  That is driven more by groups of members in various areas, rather than by Wind Energy Ireland.  To be honest, from our perspective, that is a capacity issue.  We would love to be more involved in that, but we are focused on the national view.  Our members are focused very much on areas such as Shannon, Cork and Wexford, where companies are coming together to work with existing regional local apparatuses.  This is to see if, for example, there is to be port in Rosslare, what benefits will come out of that for all of the enterprise opportunities in Wexford and in the south east.  Members are actively involved in doing that.  </p></speech>

If they sign off on a sectoral opportunity being the priority to be developed for the next four years or ten years, suddenly everyone will be pushing in the same direction.  The councils are great.  They have a strategic role in planning, in environmental control and so on.  However, these are bigger forums.  They are certainly worth the witnesses&rsquo; while.</p></speech>

It is enormous.  We have already mentioned several delegations.  In the past week, we have had delegations from Norway and from France.  I have been with delegations from the Netherlands, Belgium and Great Britain.  We have had contact from as far away as Brazil to try to bring their supply chain here.  They see the opportunity that Ireland can provide in this decade, as well as the growth that it can provide.  We would like to ensure that while we are delivering this industry we have that domestic supply chain in place to capture as much of that as possible.  Therefore, in years to come, we will be able to send delegations to other countries.  Mr. Ivers already spoke about some of the great work that Enterprise Ireland is doing in that regard.  We have an established, world-leading onshore wind sector here.  Let us take those skills and develop them nto an offshore wind sector we can be proud of and can export.</p></speech>

As nobody else wants to come in and everybody is happy enough, I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  It was an important and informative session.  It will not end there.  We will discuss further in private session ourselves how we can progress this.  I take on board what Deputy Shanahan said about having the witnesses before the committee again in near future.  We will visit Belfast and maybe Scotland as well, but definitely Belfast.  We will be in touch with the witnesses.</p></speech>

I welcome the ambassador and his colleagues to this meeting today and look forward to the engagement.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I am looking at Deputy Harkin there.  The train is not on the complex yet.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask members partaking by MS teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call on the ambassador to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I had the chance to meet many of the members before becoming French ambassador in October 2020.  Every day I am enjoying tremendously this function.  Now that France is nearing the end of its Presidency, I thought it would be useful to exchange with the committee about and look back at the five, soon six, months of our Presidency.  I am delighted to be with the Deputies and Senators.  I will make an introductory statement and be glad to answer any question afterwards.</p> <p>  As the committee members well know, the French Presidency of the Council of the EU started on 1 January and will end on 30 June.  France took the baton from Slovenia and will hand it over to the Czechia.  We are part of a so-called trio with Czechia and Sweden.</p> <p>  As the committee well knows, holding the Council Presidency is a tremendous responsibility for any member state, including for France.  In my own career, I have had the chance to follow this in 1995, 2000 and 2008.  It has been 14 years since we last held the Presidency.</p> <p>  As the committee well knows, France sees its destiny very much in the EU and wants the European Union to grow as a political union based on democracy and the rule of law ensuring peace and prosperity to its 450 million citizens.</p><p>That is why France had an ambitious agenda for this Presidency, focusing on three key objectives, namely, recovery, strength and sense of belonging.  </p><p> We believe the recovery chapter of the Presidency remains essential after two years of duress due to the Covid pandemic.  We also believe that the EU has taken up the challenge by adopting and rolling out an historical recovery package of more than &euro;800 billion and by co-ordinating the response against the pandemic, on vaccines in particular.  As the committee well knows, where there is very little on health in the EU treaties except from a product quality or consumer protection point of view for pharmaceuticals, we have seen a remarkable political mobilisation around, first, vaccines, with procurement, but also with market authorisation and distribution to developing countries.  The committee will remember that the EU has been not only ensuring a high degree of vaccination of its own population but it also has been the biggest donor worldwide.  In addition, there has been co-ordination around free movement of people and as little limitation as possible to the free movement within the EU for sanitary reasons.  On both accounts we believe the EU did well.  Certainly, before the French Presidency, but including in the past months.  </p><p> Second, high on our agenda, as kind of a catchword, is strength.  It is vocabulary which was not necessarily very associated with the EU before, but we believe that this was very much needed.  War is very sadly back on the European Continent and the threats are many.  Against this background, the European Union has been remarkably united, swift and resolute in front of the Russian aggression on Ukraine by imposing unprecedented sanctions on the decision-makers in Russia, by supporting Ukraine militarily with a &euro;2 billion military aid package and by extending up to &euro;9 billion in financial and macro-financial aid for the years to come.  The EU also has made a leap forward by adopting the so-called EU strategic compass back in March, which is a roadmap to beef up the European defence with as many as 72 concrete projects to be implemented in the three years to come, based on a common strategic threat analysis.  </p><p> The EU is also affirming its strategic thinking by reinforcing its dialogue in co-operation with Africa.  A summit between the European Union and the African Union took place in Paris in February to intensify co-operation across the board with Africa as a whole as a political organisation.  </p><p> A ministerial conference between the EU and European ministers from the so-called Indo-Pacific region took place in March to share analysis and reaffirm the opinion and interest in the Indo-Pacific region, which is a region that is strategically so important for peace and prosperity in Europe.</p><p> After recover and strength, our third kind of catchword, if I may call it such, is the sense of belonging.  The European Union, as the committee well knows, is a political union designed to serve its citizens, not against their wish and will, but with their democratic support.  In this respect, the French Presidency has launched several cultural initiatives, with writers, thinkers and youths to nurture the human dimension of the European project, based on diversity, pluralism and multilingualism.  I will name two initiatives.  We invited, for example, two pupils from each and every member state, certainly also including from Ireland, to go to Strasbourg, spend a few days there and share their expectation on education and Europe's future.  We also invited academics from all EU member states to share their thinking about Europe&rsquo;s future.  For Ireland, it was the provost of Trinity College.  Also, the Conference on the Future of Europe, which was concluded on 9 May, certainly was a unique opportunity to let European citizens express directly their expectations and aspirations about Europe.  </p><p> Beyond these key political objectives, the French Presidency was also about pushing the ambitious European legislative agenda built around climate and digital transition.  Just perhaps to remind members, as they probably well know, at a given day in Europe, there are as many as 200 or more legislative texts in the legislative pipeline.  Therefore, when we started our Presidency on 1 January, we knew that we would not be able to, of course, adopt all the 200 texts, because the legislative process in Europe takes more than six months between the Commission proposal, the First Reading by the Council, the First Reading by the Parliament and, if necessary, a trilogue and Second Reading.  We wanted and were determined to push certain agenda, certainly on climate and digital transition.  We believe that the result now, close to six months later, is pretty impressive, because many landmark items of legislation have been adopted or have been subject to political agreements between Council and European Parliament.  Again, just to name a few, on climate action, there were as many as 13 texts to translate legally the so-called Fit for 55 agenda.  We are pushing this across the board.  We also achieved a political agreement on the establishment of a so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism, which will create a level playing field between businesses established in the EU and subject to carbon pricing on the one hand and those located outside the EU that are currently not subject to the same rules and climate-friendly measures on the other.  There was a political agreement on this, even though of course this text also now will be considered within the larger package of climate change legislation, particularly what we call the emission trading system, ETS, for buildings and transport.</p><p> On trade, the EU has added a so-called anti-coercion mechanism to its toolbox and will have greater leverage to get access to international public procurement markets.  This was much needed to restore a level playing field between, in particular, Europe on the one hand, but also the US and China on the other where, as the committee knows, our companies had no access to public procurement in those two big trade partners, but asymmetrically, American and Chinese companies had full access to our public procurement.  Public procurement in Europe is a multibillion euro market.  </p><p> On digital, the political agreement on the so-called Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, two key pieces of legislation to ensure fair competition in the digital industry and increase accountability of large players on harmful content, were very important decisions which will not only better protect European citizens and competition in Europe, but also set benchmarks globally.  Agreements were also found on the establishment of a minimum wage around the same principle in all EU member states.  This measure is socially progressive and will prevent a race to the bottom at European level when it comes to salaries.  Anecdotally, even though it is probably important also in the long term for citizens and consumers, an agreement was found on a universal charging cable.  This is also a decision that will prove that the EU is delivering for citizens and setting global standards.  </p><p> More generally, and I will conclude with this, the French Presidency was the occasion, thanks also to the receding pandemic, to organise hundreds of meetings in France at Head of State and Government level, ministerial level and high official levels to share analysis, compare approaches and set common objectives.  This is what ultimately the EU is about on a daily basis for decision-makers and officials.</p><p>The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and many members of the Irish Cabinet participated in these events organised throughout France.  Ireland's point of view and contribution are much sought after and important in the decision-making process.  Ireland's testimony after 50 years of EU membership is a superb illustration of what EU belonging can do best.</p><p> Here in Ireland, the French Embassy co-ordinated the work of EU member state embassies around three kinds of activities.  First, at ambassadorial level I had the privilege to chair meetings twice per month with high-level guests.  We invited the T&aacute;naiste and several Cabinet Ministers, including Deputies Eamon Ryan, Paschal Donohoe, Michael McGrath and Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  We also involved other political figures, the chairwoman of Sinn F&eacute;in and high-ranking officials like the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p> These were closed-door meetings between ambassadors and guests but we also had events for members of academia.  We held a conference on plurilingualism in March, introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and one on how to feel European while having national and local identities.  This conference was held in Galway with guest speakers from Galway, the west of Ireland, Brittany and Galicia in Spain.</p><p> We had a few events for a broader public.  On 9 May, Europe Day, the screening of so-called short shorts took place online and physically in Dublin and Cork.  Those short films were directed by various European directors.  On the same day, it was an honour and privilege for me and my fellow European ambassadors to join Cabinet Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Michael McGrath, in Cork and visit some schools.  Our message to the pupils was simple: Europe is a project of peace and prosperity, based on values.  In the current global context, our message was to say we are stronger together.  </p><p> I thank members for their kind attention, belatedly congratulate Ireland for 50 years of membership and, with my national hat on again, say how pleased we are to be Ireland's closest EU neighbour.  </p></speech>

I think they have possibly been our closest European neighbour since 1798 but we can discuss that again.  I will not mention the protocol because I am sure the many experts on it in attendance will mention it.</p><p>I will come back to the themes of the Presidency - recovery, strength and belonging.  They were the themes on 1 January and today Europe is in a very different place.  What are the lessons to be learned from how Europe allowed itself to become so dependent on Russia that we are now struggling and our people are paying an enormous price, and will pay a bigger one in the coming months to take ourselves away from that, economically and politically?</p><p>The ambassador mentioned that the threats are many.  The biggest threat at the moment to European solidarity and unity is economic.  What are the lessons from the Presidency?  What is the view, as France begins to move on from the Presidency, of how that will be managed?  The ambassador mentioned European unity and since the invasion it has been superb.  Before the invasion, I criticised it and felt the Commission and President were <i>laissez-faire</i>and there could have been far more intervention at an earlier stage.  Since the end of February there has been an excellent response.  Does the ambassador feel that will continue as the pressures grow and we go into a winter where our dependence on energy, in particular, will be tested?  What is the view of the French Government regarding lessons to be learned?</p></speech>

Mr.  Vincent Gu&eacute;rend" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022061500002#E00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for those important and difficult questions.  When we prepared for the Presidency in my previous job - until summer 2020 I was chief of staff of the French Minister for European affairs so was part of the preparation - we were heading towards Covid and so on.  It was the French Presidency's agenda that we had to reconcile Europe even more with its citizens.  In Ireland, you do very well; in France, we do less well, hence the agenda of belonging and connecting with citizens.  That was one challenge and the other one was to assert Europe more at international level and beef up European tools against a more and more challenging, not to say hostile, environment, including the close environment.  As the Deputy said, events in the Ukraine have made this much worse than we anticipated.<br/><br/>On dependency, I believe there are two kinds of dependency.  The dependency of some European countries is not really a choice but is inherited from the past.  I think particularly of all the eastern EU member states, which inherited gas, oil and coal supplies from their old connection with the former Soviet Union and which have been slow in transforming this, even though the climate change agenda was a driver of change.  This was not really their choice and now they face an extremely difficult timeline in which to transform this.  We see that some for political reasons have been very swift, like Poland and the Baltic states.  Others, like Hungary, consider it is too quick and difficult.<br/><br/>The other category of countries, in particular Germany and Italy, for political reasons which are perfectly legitimate but are now showing their limitations, believe that engagement with Russia was the right way to ultimately find a shared prosperity agenda on the European Continent.  Speaking about Germany, it dates back to the early 1970s.  For Italy, it is probably an even older agenda if you look at all the industrial joint ventures between Italy and Russia in the 1960s in the automotive and other sectors.<br/><br/>This agenda has blatantly shown its strong limitation and it is extremely painful for all European countries, and those in particular, to be faced with this limitation.  It is difficult to blame them because the whole EU and the whole world had the same agenda with regard to China.  In the 1990s and 2000s - and it continues to a lesser extent - we engaged heavily with China, considering that shared prosperity and globalisation was, as our Chinese friends would say, a win-win and would create a <i>de facto </i>solidarity which would prevent war, etc.</p><p> When considering what we have done with Russia, mainly on energy but also in the context of other kinds of commodities, we should not forget that we do the same with China on a broader range of products.  Against this background, we will have to respond rapidly and strongly to the challenges of climate transition and the transition in our energy supply.  There is, therefore, the double challenge of accelerating peace.  It is also an opportunity, even though we know there are bottlenecks in terms of being able to equip ourselves with wind turbines, solar panels and this and that.  In a way, it strongly reinforces the call for renewable energy sources and energy autonomy in Europe.  We in France believe this has strongly reinforced our agenda of energy autonomy with nuclear energy.  It has more generally reinforced our agenda for the so-called strategic autonomy of the EU.</p><p> I will say clearly that this is not about building a fortress Europe or an autocratic Single Market cut off from the rest of the world.  It is not at all about that.  France is a big exporter of goods and services.  We need trade on goods and services and there is no intention whatsoever to close this exchange with the rest of the world.  There is, however, an intention to say that on certain critical commodities and products, we can no longer just believe that our trade partners will respect their contracts.  Remember the kind of extremely dramatic scenes we saw relating to the supply of masks two years ago.  It became a terrible race to get a supply of masks, etc.  It does not mean necessarily that we need enormous production of masks but we must think more strategically about what is critical for business continuity in Europe and where we have to act more strategically without being overly dependent on supplies from overseas.</p><p> The war in Ukraine is far from over.  It has taught us that we can be united and should remain so.  European strength is based on values.  We have the financial and legal tools to remain united.  Economically and in terms of defence, we want to beef up capacity.  We have a roadmap now and it is important to roll it out.  There are 72 measures included in the strategic compass, 48 of which are to be rolled out in 2022 and 2023.  It is now about implementation based on a shared analysis and the best analysis of the need of the day.  It is now about implementation.</p></speech>

I apologise for being a couple of minutes late in attending.  I was listening to the meeting on my way in.  I had to deal with logistics relating to children this morning.</p> <p>  Many of us would say that if we were dealing with the European question during the financial crisis, we would not necessarily have got support on the street for the European project due to the conditions at the time.  I ask Mr. Gu&eacute;rend for a comment on the present circumstances.  There has been solidarity across Europe which to a degree has been unexpected.  The old argument that was always made was to ask what would happen when German carmakers or French winemakers wanted to sell into Britain but we have seen the colour of the European Union's money in that regard.  We are dealing with Boris Johnson, who increasingly appears almost to fall into the category occupied by Recep Tayyip Erdoan, Viktor Orb&aacute;n and others.  I ask Mr. Gu&eacute;rend for a comment on where Boris Johnson stands at the moment.  We are all guessing as to whether he is serious or not.  The European Union has probably set out a slightly more robust response.</p> <p>  It is not only a matter of solidarity around Brexit.  How we dealt with the pandemic and the response to the war in Ukraine showed a level of co-operation and cohesion that was higher than people may have expected, particularly, I imagine, Vladimir Putin.  We have also shown that as difficult as it is, we can come to agreements, including an element of opt-in co-operation.  Deputy Richmond and I, among others, were involved with the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The timescale was a bit restricted.  The French presidency was somewhat chaotic in the beginning.  It fell into a better structure as it went along.  Some citizens came up with some very innovative suggestions but at times possibly fell into a need for greater context in respect of the European institutions.  Beyond that, there was almost expert testimony on particular niche issues.  Due to the difficulties with the likes of Hungary, there was a focus on qualified majority voting versus unanimity.  I am asking Mr. Gu&eacute;rend for a view.  We have shown how opt-ins work.  We know that this is to go somewhere and that there are varying views.  I am asking for the French view.</p> <p>  There has been certain commentary about it taking 20 years for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union, which probably make people ill at ease.  That notion existed previously and I can understand some of the reasoning behind it.  Where does France stand on a two-speed Europe?</p> <p>  Mr. Gu&eacute;rend said we are dealing with the particular crisis in Ukraine but we know we are also dealing with impending issues relating to climate change and all the rest of it.  Supply chain planning is something that must happen without Europe becoming a protectionist bloc.  The one thing the pandemic showed was that the State is required to do the heavy lifting if we are going to make real change.  We have seen in French politics that if people do not buy into the necessary moves on climate change, the door will be left open for certain non-progressive people and space is allowed in that regard.  It is vital that we bring people along.  Some of that will involve considering fiscal constraints and understanding that the constraints are greater now.  When I am talking about supply chain planning, I am also talking about energy, food and all those other issues.  I think that is a sufficient amount of questions to put in front of Mr. Gu&eacute;rend.  It will probably take the rest of the meeting for him to respond.</p></speech>

He asked about the relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom and the latest announcement by the British Government concerning the protocol and this draft law.</p><p>There was a public reaction from the EU institutions and the vice-president of the European Commission, Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  There have also been reactions from many European governments, including the French Government, in full support both of what Mr. &Scaron;efovi said and the Irish Government's concerns.  There is strong unity regarding those concerns and a strong sense that what the British Government is now tabling is in full contradiction of its own commitment to the signing and ratification of the protocol two and a half years ago.  Again, we are fully supportive of the efforts of the Commission and in full solidarity with Ireland on this very important subject.  I think that is clear enough.  There is no ambiguity in respect of that.</p><p> When it comes more generally to the Conference on the Future of Europe and how we want the debate to continue, I realise the timescale was very packed initially.  The pandemic and virtual meetings probably did not help either, including with national debates, but ultimately we believe it was a useful exercise.  The point was not to again open the Pandora's box of the institutional debate in Europe, even though it was an expectation, particularly in respect of the European Parliament, to move the lines with this right of initiative, which France supports.  We believe Europe has to work and function.  We do not have to fix something that is not broken.  We never said that Europe has a broken engine but in view of the extremely fast developments we mentioned previously, nobody should be complacent and should consider that just because it works and broadly delivers a good service to European citizens, Europe should just stand as it is in light of the upcoming enlargements.  In this context, the French President made a speech on 9 May in Strasbourg at the close of the conference, where he called on European citizens and institutions to see how best to serve the European citizen with no taboo on institutions.  Even though it is certainly not the priority of the day to have a new institutional debate, it should not be a red line either.</p><p> When it comes to EU enlargement, it is about what we said on the French side before the presidency and now that we have it.  In 2019, before France held the presidency, I was part of the decision-making, or at least the thinking on this on the French side.  The accession procedure that had been developed in the 1990s and early 2000s, before a large number of central and eastern European countries joined, was no longer fit for purpose for the new applicants, including the current applicant in the western Balkans.  As we can see, the negotiating process with the western Balkans is, in a way, stalled because of the many challenges faced by these countries but also because the process is just too heavy and not political enough, in a way.  As members will probably well know, the process is based on 35 chapters with many sub-groups and sub-meetings, which I should certainly not criticise as being too bureaucratic.  I am a bureaucrat myself and, at the end of the day, papers and analysis etc. are needed.  It is just a very heavy process because, ultimately, the applicant countries have the impression of being drawn into procedures about internal markets, the Single Market, and the TETRA project, without having a political vision.  The process then stalls.</p><p> We wanted to propose in this new scheme for accession negotiations, which was partly taken over by the Commission, the ability to propose to these countries a mechanism of better and stronger political dialogue with the EU on foreign policy issues, values and the way the EU works on the one side, and keep a certain track on technicalities that are ultimately key.  If these countries want to be member states, they have to have policies on transport, social issues and the environment that fit and match with EU standards and, generally, keep to this double track.  In a way, by extension, what the French President proposed on 9 May to Ukraine, but also to non-EU countries such as Norway, Switzerland and, why not, the UK, was a little the same.  We need a basis of political dialogue with these countries, including Ukraine, on foreign policy, where we have shared interests.  This includes the UK where we have a shared foreign policy interest to have the UK be part of continental foreign policy and security thinking, and also in respect of values and the fact that on the European Continent we all share the same democratic values - at least we hope so - on the rule of law and are part of the Council of Europe.  I exclude Russia, of course.  This is one political platform.</p><p> When it comes to Ukraine, we will have to continue to see when and if we start negotiations for accession.  On the French side, we really believe it would be deceiving to let the Ukrainian people believe Ukraine will be a member in five or ten years' time.  We consider this not to be the case, not because we do not want it but because Ukraine is not ready for it.  Look at the extremely high standards we Europeans have on everything.  We have the highest standards in the world.  How do we want a country, which has a GDP of probably not even &euro;1,000 per head, to comply with this?  It is just not realistic.  We certainly have to find a mechanism to bring Ukraine closer to Europe on everything, including on political and foreign policy issues in particular, but the shortest way for this is not EU accession.</p><p> On supply chains, as I mentioned previously, as Europe is a major powerhouse at global level, it should remain the case our own interests are completely plugged into global supply chains.  I am not sharing a scoop here, but when we see that close to 90% of the supply of microchips comes from Taiwan, the risk that is can be measured.  The fact is the EU is correct to now develop a strategy on microchips.  It cannot be that we are so over-reliant on one single site of production that is marred, whether we like it or not, by some risks.</p></speech>

I congratulate the French Republic on its presidency.  It has driven the EU forward with very ambitious plans, many of which are being realised.  I also acknowledge the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, is giving real leadership to the EU at this time.</p> <p> I have two questions following on from my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  What are France's plans, or aims and objectives, for the post-conference scenario?  In particular, given the ambitions of the French Republic for the EU, I am especially interested in the issue of unanimous decision-making.  Treaty change is linked to that.  As the witnesses will know, we have unanimity on a number of issues, including taxation, accession and defence, which is a national competence.  We have unanimous decision-making in a number of areas.</p><p>What is France's ambition now that the 49 proposals have been presented and the conference has concluded with 300 concrete measures?</p><p> My second question is about the war in Ukraine.  We are told that the French President is in communication with Putin regarding a negotiated settlement.  What is the policy objective of France in that regard and its strategy in dealing with Putin?  We are told the Baltic states are not happy with the constant communication involving France, Germany and Italy in particular.  What is Emmanuel Macron's strategy regarding his communications with Putin and bringing this war to an end or bringing about a negotiated settlement?</p></speech>

Mr. Vincent Gu&eacute;rend" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022061500002#H00200"><p>On the Deputy's first point about the Conference on the Future of Europe, the conference has published a report.  Now the ball is back in the court of the various European institutions to see how to bring this forward.  As for the substance, it is true, as the Deputy mentioned, that the French President, in his speech on 9 May, endorsed pretty strongly many of the proposals, including probably the most innovative, which would see the European Parliament having a right of initiative.  He has also said very strongly, however, in his national capacity that he believes we should generalise qualified majority voting, including in areas where there is still unanimity voting, including on foreign policy, which until now has not at all been the French line.  Yes, he has made pretty remarkable moves compared with the traditional French position on this within the context of an EU which he believes needs to adapt to the challenges of the day and which is delivering, as I said and as we have seen, but also facing too many obstacles, including generally with some member states.  Frankly speaking, the difficulties we have with Poland and Hungary in particular not only on some human rights issues but also on some policy issues - energy and other things - are a real obstacle to swift decision-making.  Yes, the French President has been pretty clear on this.  He now wants this agenda to be moved forward by the EU institutions.</p> <p>  When it comes to Ukraine, the French strategy with Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, certainly since the 2000s, has not changed.  It is a strategy based on engagement and shared interests in the sense that we have an interest in seeing Russia being as close as possible to Europe.  There is also, however, a lot of realism.  We have been constantly criticising, condemning and sanctioning Russia since 2008, after the aggression involving Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, etc.  Now, since January, in a way the three objectives are similar.  We want to stop this war and want the conflict to stop.  We want to see a negotiated solution but not on the backs of Ukrainians.  It is for Ukraine to decide whatever it wants to settle with Russia or otherwise.  This is not just the starting point.  We will not compromise on the full territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of Ukraine.</p> <p>  Ultimately, we also believe that we will need, at a certain stage, a channel of communication open with Mr. Putin himself, not just his foreign minister or some other decision maker in Russia, because he is probably the only one in Russia who decides.  Why should we now break this communication, which is already so challenging, only to resume it with even more difficulty in three months, six months or five years?  We need that channel of communication open, as difficult and as frustrating as it is because we realise very much that he has been, frankly speaking, lying to us over the past six months.  We believe, however, that it is important to keep that channel of communication open.  Ultimately, one day, be it in five years, ten years or 15 years from now, it is our strong conviction that we will need to find, as difficult as it is, a security architecture with Russia.  We have to find a way to bring Russia back to the various treaties on non-proliferation, conventional forces in Europe and non-aggression, which Russia has been either violating or quitting over recent years.  We must have such a long-term perspective.  We certainly do not want to compromise anything at the expense of Ukraine.</p> <p>  In the meantime, we have to pass strong messages.  We also pushed very hard for the Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Guterres, to go to Russia.  It took a long time for him to go there.  He went there only in early April just because the Russians did not want him to come.  We had insisted with other Security Council members that he go there.  Again, as frustrating and as unfruitful as it was, it was important.  That is why we also considered that it is important to keep a channel of communication open with Mr. Putin.</p></speech>

I would just like commentary on that.  Does it mean that Crimea will <i>de facto</i>remain Russian?  It was Russian until 1954.  Are we talking about requiring Russia to evacuate all of the eastern region it now controls?  Is that what humiliation involves?  I am not being in any way dismissive of what is being said, but if we are to have a pragmatic solution and say Putin is not to be humiliated, what does that imply?

When the President said that, it was in reaction to many remarks and comments made, particularly in the United States three weeks or a month ago, when things were looking a little better for the Ukrainian army than they do now.  There was a sense that a victory for Ukraine was within reach pretty soon and that we should teach Russia a lesson once and for all in order that Russia should not be tempted anytime soon to cross the line again.  There were some very high-level US decision makers making such remarks.  We still believe not only that those remarks are slightly dangerous but also that the idea of teaching Russia lessons is dangerous.  That is not because we believe that what Russia has done over the past six months is permissible or admissible but, rather, because the history of the European Continent over centuries, certainly over the past 100 years, has taught us very painfully that if one teaches a country a lesson for having invaded a neighbour, it bounces back very strongly a generation later.</p><p> Just look at the First World War in this respect.  Looking at the Franco-German conflicts, there was a war in 1870 in which the Germans humiliated us and we fought hard to recover the province we had ceded.  The idea of teaching one's neighbour a lesson is very dangerous.  As much as we support sanctions and strongly consider that the full territorial integrity of Ukraine should be restored, including Ukraine, as well as that of Georgia, with the provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia at the same time, we believe it is dangerous, when speaking about Russia, though not Mr. Putin, to engage in a narrative and strategy with an objective of humiliating a country.  We would then, in one generation's time, see serious consequences.  We have to defeat Russia.  We want Ukraine to win.  We have to put all efforts possible towards the objective of Ukraine winning this war and seeing Russia lose it, but with no humiliation.</p></speech>

I agree with his comments about having a bigger picture, longer term view.  We should apply the same thinking to Brexit and not rise to the bait.  The EU has to be the adult in the room.  Matters are playing out domestically in the UK.  One could be forgiven for wanting to throw in the towel, because it is challenging.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has done a good job.  He has been patient, as has the EU, as have we in Ireland.  We have to find a way forward that is agreeable to the UK as well as the EU, so that nobody feels like they have won or lost.  There are concerns in some quarters in Ireland that there is such growing frustration on the Continent that there is a temptation to retaliate or to regress from our adult-like position.  We should be conscious to not do that, as tempting as it might be.  That is my only comment on Brexit.  It has been dealt with well.  We are on the same page with regard to our views on that legislation.</p><p>It is unbelievable and remarkable that we are discussing the UK breaching international law.  I agree that the legislation published does exactly that.  No matter how it is spun or interpreted on the other side, it is disappointing, to say the least, that the dispute resolution mechanisms within the withdrawal agreement and treaty are not utilised, because they were intended to deal with these conflicts and disagreements, which were expected to take place.  We knew we would have disagreements and we will again at some point in the future.  It is important to use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the agreement to deal with those so that no side goes off to do its own thing, for want of a better phrase.</p><p>We had reports in our country discussing the docking of two Russian ships in our ports to deliver grain and fertiliser under a derogation of the sanctions, which are supposed to not allow these ships to dock, but we can use those derogations where there is a necessity under the principle that we should not seek to do more harm to ourselves than we are doing to Russia, which I understand.  It brings into question the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The intention behind the CAP was to have a level of self-sufficiency and to have access to good quality, sustainably produced food that is as carbon neutral as possible.  It suggests we have not done a great job on that front if we find that we still have to import grain and fertiliser because of our over-reliance on Ukraine and Russia.  I am not disagreeing with the ships coming in.  It was a necessity to not create bigger problems for ourselves further down the track.  We need to have a conversation at EU level about the Common Agricultural Policy and what we need to change to encourage our farmers, which we are trying to do domestically.  Our Minister announced &euro;56 million to deal with that issue, to try to encourage farmers to grow more grain.  That needs to happen across the Continent.  The CAP is the way to achieve it.  I would welcome the ambassador's comments on that.  It is the same as the problem with microchips, but with a different product that is even more vital.  Food is a necessity.</p><p>I am probably straying a little.  I think this issue concerns Ireland because we all share the same values of human rights, protection of refugees, how we treat them and the dignity that we treat human beings with.  What are the ambassador's views on the UK's policy on Rwanda?  My view is that it is disgusting, disgraceful and abhorrent.  It breaches the European Convention on Human Rights.  It flies in the face of human decency and dignity.  It clearly breaches the UN Refugee Convention.  There have been allegations in the UK, some quite direct and other more nuanced, that the French are to blame.  They say people are travelling from France to the UK and ask what the French authorities are doing about it.  I do not agree with that narrative.  That is clever spin they are putting on it to sell it domestically and say that whatever problems are happening domestically, somebody else is creating them.  The latter seems to be the <i>modus operandi</i>of the UK Government.  It is deeply concerning to all who hold those values close that the intention is to put people on planes and send them to Africa to be dealt with.  It is a disgraceful policy.  I welcome the ambassador's comments on how France is dealing with that and about his engagements with the UK.  Does he see a path to address that from an EU and from a French perspective?</p></speech>

On the matter of the CAP and ships, I do not have specific information on those ships, but some exceptions are provided for in the sanction regime, and I am sure it is all legal.  From a French point of view, we believe that after 60 or 70 years of the CAP, it has been a huge success, even though it has to be changed to be more friendly to the climate, environment and biodiversity.  We are fortunate to have developed this policy for the past 50 or so years.  As the Senator probably knows, the EU is a strong net exporter of food and agri-products.  We are able not only to feed our population but to export, which is good.  We may need to import certain products.  We are a bigger importer of sunflower oil and maize, which Ukraine is a significant producer of in the world.</p> <p>  We need to remain open to exports and imports of food products.  It is in our own interest as a net exporter.  From a French point of view, we want to put an emphasis on not being too lenient towards big exporters which are not complying with the Paris Agreement requirements relating to climate change and are pushing deforestation or are exporting products which do not match our sanitary standards.  We need to import some grain or some fertiliser and I believe that will remain a necessity.</p> <p>  I have a couple of remarks on migration and the recent developments in the UK.  The EU in general, the UN agencies and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have stated clearly what they think of this policy.  We strongly disagree with the policy.  As has been said, it is probably in breach of several conventions.</p><p>Certainly it is not in the spirit of the way we in the EU want to deal with illegal migrants.  Within the EU, as the Senator knows, over the last number of years there has been a new proposal on the table called a migratory pact.  It is made of various subtexts of regulation on asylum, legal migration and how to fight illegal migration.  There has been some progress, by the way, under the French Presidency, even though we have not been able to push this through completely because they are extremely politically sensitive documents.  However, we have made some progress.  Ultimately, we on the French side strongly believe that first, Europe needs migrants in the long run because of our demographics, second, that we must manage this migration and remain a Continent that provides asylum for asylum seekers for the values we mentioned before and third, this has to organised, managed and with some solidarity mechanism within the EU between the front-line countries and those that are less on the front line.  There is a financial burden etc., so there has to be a mechanism or at least redistribution solidarity.</p><p> This being said, when it comes more precisely to the UK and France and also the situation in the Channel, and with Calais and Dover, this is not new.  We have had these problems for at least 20 years or more.  It is true co-operation with the UK was always difficult and it has become really difficult since Brexit, basically, and particularly over the last two to three years with the new British Government.  We believe that we are a little bit too easy to use as a scapegoat of some of the difficulties it may have.  The co-operation on a practical, daily basis is less smooth than it used to be.  The British Government is also now indulging in some practices we believe are in breach of international law, the law of the sea, rescuing people at sea etc.  In certain cases - we have seen this even with the Ukrainians - some of the basic factors like accepting families to reunite and others have not necessarily been swiftly followed by the British.</p><p> At the same time, we see our responsibility as a kind of last point before the UK on the Continent and we are working closely with our other European partners and neighbours like the Benelux countries, Germany and others to see how to reform this because ultimately, the whole system has to be reformed.  You have some of the asylum seekers who ask for asylum in Germany, let us say they are from Afghanistan or another country, they stay in Germany for a couple of months or years then are for different reasons denied asylum in Germany.  Then they move to the next country and then through to France, whereas they should stay in Germany and be deported.  Then in France they ask for another one and then they try to go to the UK.  This mechanism needs the full co-operation of the UK within the EU.  Even though Brexit has occurred it should still, in its own interest, remain at the table and it is not at the table.  It does not want to address this very complex and very humane situation with us and I mean humane in the sense that we are talking about people here.  The situation means there are often very tragic cases, so the UK should remain at the table and it has not and that makes it extremely difficult.</p><p> In short, we need more co-operation on this from the UK and over the last couple of years, we have seen a lack of co-operation.</p></speech>

The Senator has covered a very broad agenda, one probably well beyond the scope we have asked the ambassador here to discuss.  I am probably going to add to that.  I have three questions.  My first builds on the initial commentary by Deputy Calleary.  He talked about a sense of a lack of cohesion, if you like, on the day France took over, though it was not France's fault.  Since then, because of events, the degree of focus, determination and solidarity has astounded even ourselves.  There has been the focus on the vaccines, on our response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and indeed on solidarity with Ireland in the context of the protocol.  The French Presidency coincided with the French election cycle and there was a real battle, if you like, over what the outcome would be and a belief in and significant vote for those who want to withdraw from the European Union itself.  This is an organisation Ireland has been a member of for 50 years and has invested so much in.  I cannot think of any parallel organisation that is so fundamental to our well-being to which there is periodically an existential threat.  I do not know whether the ambassador has a view on that.  It cannot be that an institution that is so structurally important to us in Europe can be undermined by a particular election cycle at any event.  Is that to be a permanent feature of the Union?  Is there a thought on that?</p> <p>  My second question is related to that.  I wish to amplify a question Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked because I am not clear on the vision of France in relation to how it envisages connecting non-EU core members to Europe.  The phrase used as shorthand is "two-tier" Europe.  Is it a bilateral relationship on an individual country basis that is different in each case and unique in each case?  How does France see the deepening of the core members and how a relationship with non-core members might be developed in the future?  I just am not clear on the French vision on that.</p> <p>  My final question is on Africa.  The ambassador talked about the dialogue that was very important between the EU and Africa.  What was the outcome of that in terms of the normal declarations and so on?  Is there a real strategy to ensure Europe is as competitive in Africa for the hearts and souls of people as China clearly is at present?  We have been talking for a very long time about the migration issue and the solution being an investment in Africa and the European neighbourhood such that there is not an economic imperative on people to migrate to Europe because there is an economic future for them at home.  What is the ambassador's view on that?</p></speech>

I would probably need another hour to answer all those very important points.  On the first point on a lack of cohesion and what was mentioned before by Deputy Calleary, I am not sure precisely what the Deputy referred to.  Was is a lack of cohesion within France and other member states or within the EU group?</p></speech>

We were all looking at the Conference on the Future of Europe debate in the context of whether the fundamental principles of Europe were being abided by and whether we could do something about that.  Then, suddenly, we were almost in lockstep on the critical issues, which was heartening for us all.</p></speech>

In the EU institutions, the Commission and so on, the various legal proceedings against Hungary are still running and we have not put that aside just because of the difficult hour of the day due to the war in Ukraine and so on.</p><p>There is no compromising on values, human rights and rule of law in Poland and Hungary, because of our concern about Russia and energy supply and the need to have both Poland and Hungary on board.  When Commission President von der Leyen visited Warsaw very recently, she again stressed that the share Poland should receive from the recovery package was still conditional on reforms to its justice system.</p><p> Cohesion within the EU is still strong.  Yes, we have difficult debates with Hungary on sanctions in terms of various aspects or individuals.  The Deputy will recall that Hungary has asked that the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church be excluded from the sanctions.  It has also asked that sanctions not go to 100%, but to 90%, on fuel supply etc.  Hungary is a difficult partner but it is still around the table and, ultimately, it is still supportive of the general move.  When one looks back, the cohesion of the group is still remarkable and the reaction was very swift and united, all in all.</p><p> When it comes to the French Presidency and its cycle and, more generally, I felt the heat in respect of how great the hazard was that the whole EU, which is such an important project, could be jeopardised by a few million voters in France or elsewhere.  I see what the Deputy means.  I can only speak for France here but I guess it is the same in other member states.  Time and again, we have to make clear that the EU delivers, is close to the citizen and, ultimately, is the best answer to the problems and not the root of the problem.  I confess this is especially challenging to make clear in France, for many reasons.  The only heartening lesson in France over the past couple of years is that even Ms Le Pen is no longer talking about exiting the EU or the euro.  She is now just talking about reforming the EU.  The so-called Frexit is no longer an issue in France.</p><p> One may say that, on the left side, Mr. M&eacute;lenchon is basically openly calling, not to leave the EU, but to disobey the rules and to become rogue when it comes to the EU institutional framework.  He does not have the majority of the vote in France and is still far from a majority.  If one combines the left and extreme left or the right and the extreme right, it is true that they add up to quite a significant number of French voters but, if one looks at the presidential election, even though many voters did not show up, a strong majority was for a very pro-European president.  I see that the ice is sometimes thin but the agenda of the French President has been remarkably constant in continuing to push EU integration and the EU agenda, rather than weakening it.</p><p> I see the broader perspective and the points of view of Ireland and other member states that our prosperity is shared and of the risk it can be jeopardised by one member state.  We have to continue to make sure that policy delivers and that the citizens feel part of the debate and that, with all its limitations, was very much what the French President tried to do.  Of course it was a kind of a bet to have the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the same time as our electoral cycle.  The President won that bet and he will win again on Sunday.  Being pro-European remains a winning ticket in France.  He also wanted to consolidate this EU anchor in France by having the two coincide this semester.</p><p> When it comes to a two-speed Europe or core members and others, we all know that all member states want to be in the core.  Nobody wants to be on the fringe.  Those who are on the fringe are gradually coming to the core.  I am thinking of Denmark in terms of defence and Croatia, which will soon join the euro.  Some member states are still not willing to join the euro.  Czechia and Sweden are part of the trio.  When France presented this Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, a couple of years ago, all but one member state joined.  Ireland also joined.  We see that everybody wants to be in the first league and not the second, which is reassuring.  </p><p> However, it is true that the more the EU evolves and the more member states there are, the more it will be difficult to keep the same pace for all.  We believe the answers to that are more qualified majority voting or, indeed, depending on the policies and the agreement of all, structured co-operation in certain cases.  When it comes to European non-EU member states, such as our Swiss and Norwegian friends and maybe, one day, the Ukrainians, we will have to see other mechanisms of co-operation.</p><p> The French Government over the past 30 years, basically since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the early discussion on EU accession enlargement in the early 1990s, has been invoking a two-speed Europe.  It has not done so as a threat to all those who are less convinced by deeper integration, but an appeal to the need for further integration and not to necessarily just adopt the pace of the slow ones.</p><p> Maybe I was a bit short on Africa in my introductory remarks.  Within the EU and, certainly, in France, the feeling is that for the 20 years and more to come, the importance of Africa is such that we cannot devolve enough resources to it, because of its size, proximity and the many challenges it faces.  Moreover, all the efforts made over the past 50 or 60 years have been very important but probably not sufficient to address these challenges and that the format of the previous EU-Africa summits were not necessarily delivering in terms of substance and dynamics.</p><p> This time, we decided not to have all African heads of state.  There were also, in fairness, issues as a result of coups etc.  We wanted to concentrate on the institution of the African Union, which is also a very good dialogue partner.  We also wanted to focus more on civil society because in many African countries where states' institutions are weak, there is a very vibrant civil society in business, culture, education and youth.  There was a whole forum on civil society.</p><p>Ultimately, we wanted the delegation led by the European Commission to be a little less dominated by development issues, although they are important, and more driven by a political agenda, where we really address political and security issues of these countries.  I do not say this is a magic wand and there is a magical way to complete the relationship in the 20 years to come.  The strong attempt was to establish a more political dialogue with the African Union and help it even more in being the kind of driving force for the continent.</p></speech>

The ambassador has been very kind and generous in giving full answers and I will not ask anything new.  I just wanted to pick up on two matters and ask two supplementary questions to the comments already made by the ambassador.</p> <p>  In his first intervention the ambassador referred to the strategic compass, the 72 projects and 48 of those in the short term.  There was a huge discussion during the course of the French Presidency at Versailles on the future of security arrangements in the Union.  That issue is becoming ever more apparent as a result of the war in Ukraine and everything else.  Beyond the strategic compass and in the longer term, what is the ambition of France as we go through the next decade of greater European co-operation?  Where could Ireland play a role, taking into account our constraints?</p> <p>  Senator Chambers referred to the understandable reaction to the nonsense, for want of a better word, going on in London currently.  The response of the European Commission is to be expected if it potentially unpauses legal action and commences new legal action, depending on how this legislation progresses.  What is the feeling of the French Government, with the ambassador as its representative, about this Commission action?  How supportive of it will the French Government be and how fast should it occur?</p></speech>

We are very happy with this outcome.  Again, it is based on shared analysis and it is a roadmap with very concrete steps to move forward.  On this basis, Europe should first continue to have a shared analysis of its environment.  It is not just about the French with the Sahel, the Greeks with Turkey and the Poles with Ukraine; it should be a process that we enter together.  That is happening now.</p> <p>  We should have the proper tools, specifically the proper defence equipment.  There is even more thinking and money going into the European Defence Agency and, as members know, more money coming from the EU budget to research into defence in order to increase our European capacities.  We should use these rapid deployment elements to be able to act on the ground with military troops whenever that is needed.  Much progress has been made on this over the past 20 years but we are not completely there yet in terms of the ability to intervene.  It is fair to say the extreme difficulty we had in Kabul in August in evacuating our staff was a big wake-up call.</p> <p>  That is the direction of travel.  All member states that are willing to participate are, of course, very much welcome.  Ireland has so far been an active contributor, with limited caveats expressed in the declaration and through the Lisbon treaty accession.  As I keep saying, it is really for the Irish debate to take place at its own pace on whether the country should see an evolution of its neutrality stance when it comes to the certain limitations in the engagement with EU defence.  The more this is integrated and the more members will fully participate, the better.</p> <p>  On the UK and the very regrettable developments of the past couple of days, as I have said we are fully behind the Commission.  Senator Chambers also mentioned the need to have a strategic approach to the UK, which is a close neighbour and important player.  It is a country with which we want to have the best relationship.  We did not want Brexit, as members have repeated.  We want the best relationship possible with Britain, and that is important, but we cannot just let one partner violate the rules without any consequence.  We will have to see what occurs as this draft law progresses in the British Parliament, ultimately becoming law, how we can raise our concern, our voice and ultimately take some action to draw a line.  Again, we fully support the Commission and in solidarity with Ireland on this.  We very much follow Ireland on this and we are liaising very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach on it.</p></speech>

He has communicated clearly, including when over a year ago he wrote an excellent piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>setting out the new opportunities.</p><p>No opportunity should be lost to say the Good Friday Agreement, as we all know, has saved a countless number of lives.  It is a precious peace.  I know I am preaching to the converted but I cannot emphasise enough how much umbrage many people in Ireland have taken that this amazing, historic and solemn peace agreement has been bandied around and it is somehow purportedly being used as an excuse or a justification to proceed to breach international law.  It is reprehensible.  There are certain non-party political agreements that are so solemn and precious, we do not mess around or play politics with them.</p><p>We are now at our most vulnerable stage since the Good Friday Agreement.  France is an old friend of Ireland and we go back way beyond what is now called the European Union.  Ireland has taken its place in Europe for over 1,500 years, having much of an input into culture, heritage and security.  We have a special relationship with America but, relatively speaking, it is only a couple of hundred years old.  The French and Irish go back longer than that.  If I am put to the pin of my collar, I cannot think of a country that Ireland has closer links to over centuries.  France came to our aid and it is a bulwark of democracy.  It is a pivotal part of the EU and we need the French voice and continued support like never before at this defining and precious point.  I ask the ambassador to use the influence of his office.</p><p> The other question that has not been answered is whether this section of unionism wants the internal UK market.  Have unionist leaders explained to their people that if they exclusively want the internal market and to ditch the protocol - as some do, although moderates want to amend it - that they will lose out on the EU market, the Single Market?  I do not know if that has been communicated to their supporters.  Doing so might help them see sense and see that this is a wonderful opportunity.  I cannot say this often enough and have I said it in the Seanad.  The Alliance Party in Northern Ireland is constitutionally agnostic.  A lady who won a seat for that party, Sorcha Eastwood, was asked after she won the seat if the protocol came up on the doorsteps when she was canvassing.  She said it came up twice.  There is another narrative that is not getting out there.  The Green Party is an all-Ireland party.  We canvassed in the North and it never came up.  There is something missing here.  We are not putting people before politics.</p><p> France is very influential in the European project.  Ukraine will be demoralised and devastated if it is told it has to wait ten, 20 or 30 years.  That is not what it wants to hear now.  France has articulated a two-speed approach.  I hope there is some good news in the post for Ukraine because it is clinging to hope.  It wants to take its place among the nations of Europe like France and Ireland.  France has huge influence in making that happen.  It has been reported in the media that Germany and France are a bit nervous about it, for obvious reasons.  There are very strict criteria.  That said, surely in a time of emergency some preliminary and concrete steps can be taken on that road to European membership.  I would ask France to please give Ukraine something concrete in the next few days through the mechanisms and workings of the European Union, of which it is a central part.</p></speech>

We believe, for the reasons I explained, that full membership is probably not the best answer to the problems Ukraine is sadly facing.  Its legislation is very far from being able to comply with everything.</p> <p>  I have already responded to the points on Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  Regarding the resilience and recovery package for Poland, we have the full support of the Commission and for any restrictions that may be put on the payment of this fund to Poland as long as the situation with the judicial system remains unsatisfactory.  On Ukraine again, it is good to see so much solidarity here in Ireland and in many other member states.  In France we have close to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and we are ready to host more if needed.</p> <p>  I extend my heartfelt thanks to the committee and the Chair for their interest.  I stand with my colleagues and my capital willing and ready to share analysis and documents.  I would also be more than happy if the committee were to visit its counterpart in the French Parliament, where we also have an EU affairs committee.  The role of Parliament in the EU institution, and of national parliaments, is extremely important, as members well know.  It was good to be here today.  I remain open to all engagement.  I am just next door in Merrion Square if any bilateral context is needed and to pursue the discussion.</p></speech>

The European Committee of the Regions has three political priorities: bringing Europe closer to the people; managing fundamental societal transformations; and cohesion, our fundamental value.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative that he or she comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Tzitzikostas to make his presentation.</p></speech>

I also thank my colleagues, the members of the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions, which is one of the strongest and most active delegations of our house and whose dedication and hard work both on the ground and in our committee have been so important and valuable during these very challenging times.</p> <p>  Just take a moment to think about what we have been through in the past two and a half years.  The crises we have gone through have turned our longer term challenges into urgent priorities.  Digitalisation has made a difference between having students attend their classes and not, and having companies survive and not.  Energy transition and building a sustainable green Europe are no longer only an environmental challenge but a geopolitical necessity.</p> <p>  All this time, from the utmost horror of the war in Ukraine and the ongoing suffering of Covid to the impact of Brexit, and from the ultimate threat of climate change to Europe's unhealthy dependence on Russian gas and crude oil, European regions and cities have been on the front line.  During these historic crises, they have been protecting citizens, delivering vital services, accelerating green and digital transitions, diversifying energy sources, saving businesses and jobs and, of course, providing help and shelter to the millions of Ukrainians who have fled their country because of the war.  It is regional and local leaders in Europe who have, right from the start of the attack against Ukraine, organised humanitarian aid and welcomed refugees in the regions bordering Ukraine and in every other corner of Europe.  At the same time, the European Committee of the Regions has swiftly created and put in place a web-based Ukraine info-support hub, a platform that can be visited on our website and that matches needs in Ukraine and its bordering regions with offers for help.  We have called for an improvement in access to emergency EU funding to make it easier and faster for regions to access it and to provide rapid support and manage the humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>  We have also introduced an important initiative to host children from Ukraine in summer camps across Europe.  Now we are building a big European alliance of cities and regions for the reconstruction of Ukraine, linking local and regional authorities in Europe in order to co-ordinate and facilitate contacts and co-operation with the Ukrainian local and regional authorities, following the proposal of President Zelenskyy and the support of President Michel.  My call to the Irish regions and cities today is to join this alliance and our initiatives for the children and the reconstruction of Ukraine.</p> <p>  All these consecutive and parallel crises have shown that no matter one&rsquo;s size, strength and power, no one alone can deal with the challenges and meet the real needs of the people.  This is how the European Committee of the Regions sees our European house of democracy: the EU being the protective roof; the member states, the strong walls; and the regions and cities, the solid foundations.  All levels of government must work together to bring results.  There is no other way to work.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that, with the Irish programme for Government, there is for the first time a clear commitment to regional development as a policy implementation objective.  I trust that the role of regional and local administrations will be enhanced to deal with the huge challenges all across Europe, including the access to affordable housing and the crisis of the rise of the cost of living. </p> <p>  At the same time, I have to admit that I deeply regret that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement lacks "territorial depth" and does not duly recognise the role of local and regional authorities in the EU-UK relationship.  As I understand it, internal political matters are the reason the United Kingdom failed to assure a local democratic voice in the EU-UK partnership council.  Moreover, we support a joint and responsible approach to the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol, and respect for the level playing field.  For this reason, I am deeply worried about the unilateral interpretation by London of the protocol, which could turn into a de facto hard Brexit, a disruption of the UK-EU trade with very strong repercussions for Ireland and risking the jeopardising of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  For us, one thing is clear.  There are many regions in Ireland and all over the rest of Europe that are so heavily impacted and so heavily invested in partnerships with UK devolved nations and local governments, so there are so many untapped opportunities in areas of mutual interest &mdash; such as providing humanitarian assistance and managing sustainably the North Sea, the Channel and the Irish Sea, as well as fighting against climate change and implementing the sustainable development goals &mdash; that the role of regional and local authorities is irreplaceable.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that our Union can survive and move forward only if our citizens care about it and believe in it.  More than ever before, we must build a bottom-up future for Europe with more democratic representation of the people's vote and less institutional complexity.  We must win back the trust of the citizens.  This involves their trust in all three levels of government and the three levels of elected politicians - European, national and regional and local.  These three levels of trust are interconnected and can only succeed if they reinforce each other.  If one of these levels is missing, the whole European house of democracy collapses.  To put it in simple words, we need a lively parliamentary democracy with a stronger European Parliament, stronger national parliaments and the European Committee of the Regions, as well as Europe's 240 regions and 90,000 municipalities, at its core.  This is how we view the future of democracy in Europe and the future of Europe.  </p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee for facilitating and hosting us this morning.  It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here.  As head of the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions, CoR, I am delighted to give a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to my dear friend President Tzitzikostas and to thank him for taking the time to visit Ireland.  From the outset, I reiterate his call for a reformed Europe built from the bottom-up on a model of a European house of democracy.  I thank him for his words of solidarity on this week's worrying developments regarding the Northern Ireland protocol.  I want to be very clear on my behalf and that of the Irish delegation to the CoR and put on record our complete opposition to the decision taken by the UK to table legislation disapplying core elements of the protocol.  As stated by Vice President &Scaron;efovi, unilateral action damages mutual trust.  The Irish delegation to the CoR calls for a calm and measured joint approach to addressing any outstanding issues with the protocol.  Protecting peace on this island is paramount.</p> <p>  In the CoR, I sit alongside President Tzitzikostas in the European People's Party Group, which is the largest political group in the CoR.  President Tzitzikostas often reminds us of the following and I must reiterate it here now.  Local and regional authorities implement 70% of all EU legislation and represent half of public employment, more than a half of public investment and a third of public spending.  The CoR is the EU institution that is closest to European citizens.  Sometimes it is forgotten that we are the second of only two EU institutions with elected members so we have clear democratic legitimacy.  </p> <p>   Since the start of this mandate in February 2020, I have had the privilege to lead the work of one of the legislative committees of the CoR as the chair of the economic policy commission.  The European Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON, has examined legislative proposals from the European Commission on the implementation of free trade agreements, the Brexit adjustment reserve, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, to mention a few of our reports, and has sent them on to the co-legislators to influence colleagues and impact laws that take account of regional and local assets and challenges.  As an example, I highlight the work of a recently adopted opinion for which I was rapporteur entitled "Strengthening the EU-UK relationship at subnational level and remedying the territorial impact of the UK's withdrawal from the EU".  There was much concern from local authorities across Europe about how the UK exit from the EU would impact their regions.  On the UK side, I did not find the same tired political rhetoric we hear day and night from Westminster, rather the opposite.  UK local and regional authorities have genuine concerns about the future relationship and have a real desire to work with Irish and EU local and regional authorities to ensure the smoothest and safest transition for their regions.  I have copies of this opinion with me and would be delighted to take the committee through it bilaterally.  I think my colleagues have copies.   </p> <p>  There are significant opportunities for Ireland - for our communities and our citizens - but we need support for local authorities.  We are very lucky to have the Irish regions European office in Brussels, which acts as a bridge between Irish local and regional government and the EU explaining and guiding its stakeholders through the Brussels scene and promoting Irish interests and best practices at the European level.  This includes strong networks - place-based networks with regional offices representing large swathes of Europe - that often have legislative powers and fiscal autonomy for certain areas of competence.  </p> <p>  I believe more can be done at local level.  We all know the benefits of having a European officer in each local and regional authority.  An example of what can happen when supports are given is the Chairman's own constituency of Donegal.  Donegal County Council has installed a full-time European office.  The same can be said for Cork City Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I call on the committee to support the allocation of funding for European officers in local and regional authorities across the country.  It is no surprise that it is those local authorities that have a full-time EU affairs officer that are the ones best positioned to access the great opportunities that exist at European level.  </p> <p>  Before handing over to my colleague Councillor Kate Feeney, who will outline in more detail the work of the Irish delegation, I will conclude by paying tribute to my CoR colleagues - the members and alternates in the Irish delegation to the CoR.  It is a genuine pleasure to lead this group of dedicated public representatives, who are working tirelessly in Brussels on behalf of local communities of Ireland.  I invite the joint committee to Brussels to see at first hand the work of the Irish delegation in the CoR.     </p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to appear before them this afternoon. I also welcome President Tzitzikostas to Dublin and thank him for bringing the sunshine with him from Greece.  I hope he leaves it behind when he goes back home.</p> <p>  As members of the CoR - and I see Deputy Richmond, a former member, is here - we are in a unique position to see the workings and interactions of the EU institutions up close but we also have an opportunity to see how they impact local communities at home and across the EU.  This is something that not all local representatives are exposed to.</p><p>Because of this, two weeks ago, when the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, Party conference took place in Dublin, we decided to bring together local councillors from throughout Ireland to discuss how to bring Europe closer to the local community.  I moderated the session and one point that was raised repeatedly related to the need for all levels of governance, European, national, regional and local, to work better together.  This is a point Mr. Tzitzikostas raised previously during European Committee of the Regions debates and again today with his apt analogy of building a house and ensuring all the parts support one another.</p><p> The model of a two-dimensional Europe based simply on the European institutions and national governments has shown its limitations.  Citizens who are passionate about Europe, and who like all of us in this room want to see the European project succeed, are rejecting the model we have had to date.  Citizens from community groups to small business owners, farmers and, in particular, young people have voiced their desire to be part of Europe, of the decisions that are made and of drafting policy priorities and, importantly, of defining Europe's identity on the world stage.  All of this starts by making Europe accessible to people at a local level.</p><p> This is all the more relevant when we consider that this month marks six years since the Brexit vote.  Brexit rightly continues to occupy much of our time and discourse in Ireland as we try to minimise its impact, but that can make it difficult to take time to stop and find learnings from it.  If Brexit has taught us anything, it is the need for citizens to understand what Europe is doing for them.  This means bridging the gap between Brussels and communities, moving beyond the bubble, acronyms, lingo and jargon and, if I can be bold, moving beyond rooms such as this one.  It is about making Europe available and visible to everyone, in every community on our island, and about giving those communities a sense of ownership of Europe, and the key is accessibility.  This point about making Europe more accessible was raised during the Conference on the Future of Europe, and it is about doing so at a local level.</p><p> We in the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions are playing our part in doing this.  We play a leading role in the work of the European Committee of the Regions by influencing EU policies on citizens' dialogues; the Conference on the Future of Europe; free trade agreements, which Councillor Murphy mentioned; the New European Bauhaus; UK-EU relations; digital education; the inclusion of cities in COP27, small urban areas for a just transition; and, in my own work, building a Europe of equality and protecting LGBTIQ+ rights throughout Europe.  Our delegation chose and championed these issues because we know how important they are to people at home.  I am proud of the work we do as a team but, unfortunately, the lack of supports and frameworks available to our local councils mean we are not fully participating in the programmes and initiatives of the EU.  We are not maximising the benefits of this work for the communities we represent.</p><p> Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU since 2013, but even as net contributors, we supported a larger budget for the European Union.  We do this because, as An Taoiseach told the European Parliament last week, we have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact membership has delivered for all dimensions of our society, and because our membership has been an historic enabler of sustained progress for Ireland.  Again, however, when it comes to supports and partnerships for our local communities, there is much more we can do and get.</p><p> This is my key point, which Councillor Murphy also made.  Our local councils need to be empowered to work not only vertically but also horizontally.  They need to be empowered such that when they are faced with challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and smaller challenges such as managing libraries and parks, they can access wealth, knowledge and resources from other councils in Europe just like our own that are facing similar issues, but to do this we need proper supports, resources and frameworks, which are currently lacking.  I ask, therefore, that the committee support our local councils, work with us and help us develop the tools and networks we need in order that our councils and communities can access Europe and feel truly part of the European project.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022061500002#Q00300"><p>My first question relates to the post-Brexit scenario.  When I was a member of the European Committee of the Regions, there was significant input from members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and councillors from Northern Ireland to our work and it was very important in the build-up to Brexit to hear those voices, whether unionist, nationalist or other, ringing in about how it would impact on the ground in terms of local application, bearing in mind the level of devolved responsibilities to the Executive and the Assembly for implementing the protocol.  A proposal at European Parliament level, suggested by Barry Andrews MEP, was that observer status be given to representatives from Northern Ireland.  Is that something the European Committee of the Regions could do?  Could it be pushed for across political parties?</p> <p>  All three of our guests referred to the Conference on the Future of Europe, which I attended with Mr. Tzitzikostas, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Councillor McCarthy.  I recall that some of Mr. Tzitzikostas's interventions were very similar to points made by Councillor Feeney.  Many of the suggestions we received from citizens related to actions the EU was already taking, although perhaps it was not doing them well enough or perhaps it simply was not telling people about them.  One point I have been making long term in regard to the European Union and all the institutions in its collective is that it is great at telling people how they can give out about the European Union but it is not great at telling people how they can benefit from it.  This relates to citizens as well as elected representatives, and it is clear that in our local authorities, a dearth of information and resources is available to officials to ensure they can draw down enough funding and work with other local and regional authorities throughout the European Union.  Both Councillor Feeney and Councillor Murphy have made a fairly direct challenge to the members of this committee, but the challenge in reverse relates to what the European Union and its institutions - whether the European Committee of the Regions, the Commission, the Parliament, the Council or the European Economic and Social Committee, our guests' co-tenants - are going to do.  How can we ensure they will also seek to burst the bubble in Brussels, Strasbourg or wherever it may be?</p> <p>  I thank all our guests for attending.  We had a great meeting in the previous term with one of Mr. Tzitzikostas's predecessors, Mr. Markku Markkula.  Now that Covid has lifted to an extent, being able to have these meetings in person and not over Zoom is a very welcome change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022061500002#Q00400"><p>I might take the first question.  Like Councillor Feeney, I acknowledge the Deputy is a former member of the European Committee of the Regions and a former head of the Irish delegation.  He asked specifically about the newly established Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, PPA, which has met for the first time.  I mentioned the opinion on which I worked on behalf of the European Committee of the Regions, which was adopted unanimously, strengthening the EU-UK relationship at a sub-national level.  During the course of the drafting and adoption of that opinion, I worked closely with the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, COSLA, the Welsh Local Government Association and the Welsh senate, and the UK Local Government Association.</p> <p>  One of the key conclusions of the opinion relates to a strong willingness at local and regional level to work closely to strengthen co-operation at a local and regional level.  The narrative at the local and regional level is completely different from the rhetoric coming from Westminster, and we in the European Committee of the Regions are working closely with local government associations throughout the United Kingdom.  One issue on which we worked very closely related to obtaining observer status at the PPA and, thankfully, that was a big win for us.  The European Committee of the Regions has observer status at the Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.</p><p>The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have observer status at the Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, PPA.  Regrettably, the UK has decided not to include its local government associations or give speaking time to local and regional government at meetings of the PPA.  Following on from the PPA's first meeting, though, I hope that the UK's local and regional government will have speaking time, and there are sounds coming from the PPA's administration that it will get speaking time.  It is crucial for the implementation and governance of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement that local and regional government have some input.  Local and regional government in the EU is represented at the PPA by the Committee of the Regions, but local and regional government on the UK side not being involved is a decision for the UK.</p><p> The narrative at local and regional level across the UK is different from the narrative at Westminster.  Local and regional government there wants to co-operate further, particularly on matters that know no boundaries, for example, climate change and protecting the environment, tourism, security and energy.  They are beating that drum, so it is regrettable that the UK has decided to stop participating in territorial co-operation programmes, which are at the heart of the EU project.  The macro issues must be sorted out, but if we move beyond those, perhaps we can revisit territorial co-operation.</p><p> That addresses the PPA element of the question.  Perhaps Ms Feeney wishes to address the question's two other elements.</p></speech>

Regarding what the institutions are doing, breaking the bubble is a major challenge.  National and local politicians in Ireland have a tendency to take credit when Europe does something well and to blame it when things go wrong.  This does not help when we are trying to communicate Europe's message.  With the help of the Irish Regions European Office, we ran a series of seminars over the past 12 months on communicating Europe across each of the regional assembly areas.  We have also partaken in a number of citizens' dialogues.  Indeed, we are taking part in another tomorrow.</p> <p>  Undoubtedly, trying to make the benefits of EU membership tangible for people on the ground is a challenge.  For instance, many do not know that the Erasmus+ programme or the free Interrail passes that are handed out to 18-year-olds across the Union are connected to the European project.  This is about reinforcing such messages.</p> <p>  The Committee of the Regions is seeking an expanded budget from the Commission.  Something we would like to do with that budget is to set up satellite hubs across the Union.  They would be similar to the offices that the European Parliament has in various capital cities, but we would like to have ours out in the regions.  We could use them as hubs from which to communicate our message.</p> <p>  Communicating the message is a challenge for each of us.  Every person in this room must take on that challenge and check our language and messaging when communicating matters concerning Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Apostolos Tzitzikostas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022061500002#R00300"><p>I will add some ideas about the future of Europe.  Last month, the Conference on the Future of Europe ended.  It was an interesting discussion in which Deputy Richmond and other Irish Members were active.  However, a significant question has arisen since the end of the conference, and that is, what now?  For a year plus some months, citizens, organisations, societies and teams of people across Europe gave us their ideas and voiced their concerns.  After all of that, if Europe ends the discussion at this point and does nothing, it will be a disaster.  It is clear, not only to those of us who participated in the conference but to all citizens of Europe, that Europe's last chance might be now.  Now that the conference has concluded, we must realise that we have no more time to lose.  Europe must change now.  This is the only way to stop the anti-European sentiment that we are seeing across Europe, for example, Brexit, the French presidential election and yesterday's parliamentary elections in France.  We see anti-European voices rising in most of the 27 member states.  Why is this the case?  It is simply because citizens &ndash; the people &ndash; feel left out of the process that is happening in Strasbourg and Brussels.  We need to build a more open, more democratic and more transparent Europe and bring our citizens on board.</p> <p>  How do we do this?  It is not possible for more than 400 million citizens to be involved in a process.  That is why we are here.  We represent 240 regions, 90,000 municipalities and 1.2 million elected politicians at regional and local levels in Europe.  We can be the actors who help to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe.  Let them understand, and give them the feeling that they are part of, the decision-making process.</p> <p>  We made specific amendments to the final conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe, which were included in the final draft.  They deal with the need to change and upgrade the strength and role of the European Committee of the Regions, which not only includes regions, but also cities.  It is not a committee, but an assembly.  We are the only chamber outside the European Parliament that is directly elected by the citizens.  We are divided into political groups, have 329 members and function just as a parliament.  However, we do not have decisive powers.  We can only advise the European Parliament.  We are asking for a more decisive role, especially when it comes to issues that have territorial aspects.  In this way, not only will citizens feel more involved, but cities and regions will be able to tell Europe the best way to provide solutions to real problems.  Regions and cities have the most proximity to the lives of citizens.  As such, we have a deep knowledge of what the real issues and problems are and what the solutions to them should be.</p> <p>  We support the idea of a convention in Europe that will open some of the treaties and see what can be changed in order to make our Europe more democratic, more open and better functioning.  In this new era, the European Committee of the Regions and, therefore, the cities and regions of Europe want their role to be understood as one that can not only help to bring Europe closer to the citizens in the regions and cities, but can also make citizens believe and trust in this European vision again.</p></speech>

I believe this may be the largest delegation we have ever had at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Maybe some of the online meetings during lockdown were bigger but they were different.  It is important to have this dialogue.  I thank the president of the European Committee of the Regions, Mr. Tzitzikostas, for his presentation and kindness in not pointing out the weakness of Ireland's local government system, which is the weakest in Europe.  We need to do something about that.  Mr. Tzitzikostas made the point, perhaps as a result of his natural diplomacy, that we must strengthen the European Parliament, national parliaments and local government.  In truth, we need to rebalance the functionality of each of these and that is a job of work for us in Ireland, in particular.  Those of us who served in Government bear responsibility for the weakness of local government in Ireland.</p> <p>  Members of the committee engage all the time on Europe and I was taken by the point on communicating the vision and principles of Europe to the citizenry.  Everyone has a solution when they appear before us to discuss this.  I wonder how many people in Wexford would know what the Committee of the Regions is if I stopped and asked some of them.  If I were to ring around the councils, how many councillors would be able to answer that question?  That is a very profound issue for those involved to answer.  The committee is an intrinsic and fundamental part of the European democratic structure and we need to do something about that collectively as well.  Perhaps this dialogue is the start so that those of us interested in European affairs are not in little echo chambers talking about grandiose notions.  Even when we go on roadshows on Europe, how many people come to the seminars apart from those who are interested and knowledgeable from the start?  There are fundamental issues in that regard.</p> <p>  I have another point to raise before I ask a question.  It was said that empowering local authorities is the way to deepen appreciation of Europe and combat growing nationalism or xenophobia.  There are an awful lot of elected councillors across Europe who are xenophobic and are sending a different message out.  The solution is more complex than that.</p> <p>  From an Irish perspective, I thank the Committee of the Regions for the solidarity shown on Brexit.  Many people believed there would not be solidarity from across the Union on the unique requirements of Ireland and did not expect the ongoing expression of solidarity we heard today.  We have a very intimate parliamentary system because, as everyone knows, Irish Members of Parliament are very close to the ground.  We provide clinics all the time and hear people in a way that is not replicated in every European country.  How do parliamentarians link in better with what is happening at European level in terms of the Committee of the Regions to advocate for the sort of direct contact between people, which it has been said is so important?</p></speech>

I am glad he raised the subsidiarity issues because I was certainly not going to mention the war.  A joke is often made that we are probably sitting in the biggest county council in the country here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is something we need to address when talking about the rebalancing of powers.  The Deputy is right.  If you speak to county councillors in any part of the country, you will find councillors who do not know what the Committee of the Regions is.  We have reporting structures but we are sitting in committee rooms such as this.  We report to our regional assemblies.  It does not trickle down to our council chambers and that is a problem.  We have newsletters that go out to councillors who have signed up to them.  We are relying on people to sign up for the newsletter and then relying on them to open it once it lands in their inbox.  We are trying to find ways around that.</p> <p>  The Deputy Howlin raised the issue of trying to use local and regional authorities to fight xenophobia in cities.  It is a message we in the Committee of the Regions champion.  Of course, there are local representatives who do not sign up to that message in the same way that there are national representatives who do not, and they can be found in every member state.  It is, however, a message we try to champion.  This year, the president, Mr. Tzitzikostas, awarded the first Pawe Adamowicz award.  Pawe Adamowicz was a mayor who was a strong supporter of LGBTQI rights and was murdered in his home city.  The award was given to Ms Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne, who was the target of a xenophobic attack that nearly took her life on the eve of her election.  She was elected while she was in a coma.  She was the first recipient of the award.  We use our position and committee to champion those ideals and award those who sign up to them.</p> <p>  On how we can further the dialogue at home, meetings like this are important.  We should hold them more often.  We should get them out of rooms like this and engage with people who are not always engaged in the conversation.  That may be done by choosing subject matter.  I know when Councillor Fintan Phelan in Carlow held a local dialogue meeting he chose a local issue to discuss, which meant people who would not normally care about the EU came along and learned about it as a result.  We have to find better ways of doing it but today is a good start. </p></speech>

If I were to walk down the streets of Clonmel and told citizens that I am a member of the European Committee of the Regions, they would ask what that is about.  One could say that about a lot of institutions at European, regional or national level.  The reason we are here today is try to communicate our work in Europe at a local level.  We do that through different mediums.  We communicate our work to the regional assemblies.  We also talk to local authority members.  We publish and distribute newsletters.  It is a real challenge, however.</p> <p>  I return to the concept of having a European affairs officer in every local authority.  That would be very important.  I would love for the Joint Committee on European Affairs to invite in the County and City Management Association, CCMA, for example, and ask what the local authority chief executives are doing.  I will give a different analogy.  The appointment of a broadband officer in every local authority was a new initiative introduced some years ago.  I cannot emphasis enough how successful that was and we could do the same by having an EU affairs officer in every local authority.</p> <p>  I continuously make the point that all the citizens we represent are concerned with what they perceive to be national issues, such as infrastructural deficits.  The irony is that Europe is playing a key role in delivering on those challenges.  LEADER funding is spent at local level but local authorities do not communicate that this money comes from Europe.  I think members understand the point I am making.  It is a real challenge.  We are trying and doing our best, which is why we are here today and taking a number of different steps.  There is real engagement between the Irish Regions European Office and local authorities on creating awareness.  If I have one message I would like delivered today, it is about the work this committee can do in delivering EU affairs officers to each local authority.</p></speech>

If we broaden it out a little, things are not getting any better if we think about it.  Does the Deputy think the average European citizen knows his or her Commissioner, and there is only one Commissioner for each member state?  I doubt it.  Does he think the average citizen knows his or her country's Members of the European Parliament?  I doubt it.  Very few do.  Some will know their members of national parliaments if they are vocal.  However, does the Deputy know who they certainly do know?  They know their mayors.  They know the presidents of regions.  They deal with them every day.  The regional local governments in most European member states engage not only in words but in actions.  We implement many public works today using European funding.  We transform anonymous European funds to life-changing public works for the citizens in their citizen regions.  This is exactly why I said I believe citizen regions can play this role - because of our proximity to the citizens and their issues and the fact we are using all this European funding, especially Cohesion Funds, to build schools, hospitals and roads, to support SMEs and people in difficulty, to create environmental works and to carry out transport, culture, education and tourism projects.  We are able to show the average citizen what Europe is all about and how it influences his or her everyday life, and that the notion Europe is something distant that does not affect us is wrong.</p></speech>

It is great to have this interaction.  In fairness, Deputy Howlin probably dealt with the first issue I was going to deal with, which is the weakness of our local government.  Certain powers lie with us or with the Executive, and not with local representatives.  Beyond that, there is a general under-resourcing of those areas for which there is a responsibility.</p> <p>  Solidarity for the Northern Ireland protocol has been stated and I add my voice to that.  </p> <p>  We need to follow up on Councillor Murphy&rsquo;s proposal to have an EU affairs officer at each local authority.  If we need to bring in representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, or of some other body, perhaps that is a job of work we should consider doing.  What have been the advantages where such an officer has been in place?  </p> <p>  To follow up on the conversation we have had previously on the distance from politics felt by the people, it is not only at a European level.  That distance is major at this point in time and it has left a vast vacuum.  I would say we, and that includes all of us, were not the most representative group of people in the room at the Conference on the Future of Europe.  If public meetings were held anywhere across Ireland, and I imagine throughout Europe, a range of issues would have come to the fore that did not come to the fore at that forum.  I refer specifically to the drugs issue, drug addiction and crime.  I can point to the number of times those issues are spoken about in these Houses and at local level.  What item of work can be done from the point of view of bridging that gap?  Europe has sold itself to the vast majority of us - particularly those of us here who may have had a difficulty with it at the time of the financial crash - in dealing with the pandemic, the Ukrainian crisis and, hopefully, the cost-of-living crisis and what mitigations Europe can provide in that context.  What item of work can we do to bridge that gap with people?  We have skirted around some of that issue.  I acknowledge it is not the simplest of questions to answer.</p></speech>

This engagement has been very informative regarding the work of the Committee of the Regions.  I thank the president of the committee for his comments on the protocol and the solidarity he has shown to us.  I also acknowledge the comment he made about the challenges with regard to the Ukrainian refugees, and children in particular, and the work he is doing there.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time factor and I have only two questions.  The first one is for the president.  He spoke about the need to bring Europe closer to the citizens, how that can be done and the role of the Committee of the Regions in that regard.  I wish to expand on that with regard to geopolitics generally.  President Biden has spoken about the battle between democracy and autocracy throughout the world.  We have some experience of that manifesting itself in Europe with respect to rule of law issues and the Brexit vote in 2016.  I refer to the battle between internationalism and unilateralism and the need for a rules-based international order.  The president spoke about bringing Europe closer to the citizens.  Does he envisage the Committee of the Regions having a role to play in that wider debate between autocracy and democracy?  Are the two concepts related?  </p> <p>  With regard to Councillor Murphy and Councillor Feeney, we have touched on the issue of local government reform.  We are in the presence of a former Minister with responsibility for local government.  We realise we have a very centralised form of government in Ireland.  Does the Irish delegation of the Committee of the Regions have a view on having a directly elected mayor for Dublin or any other local authority?  Perhaps there is considerable division among the delegation about that.  I do not mean this in a condescending way but have the councillors made a submission to the Citizens' Assembly on having a directly elected mayor?</p></speech>

I am delighted they came before us and made presentations.  One of the first issues I spoke about when I became a member of this committee was having a bottom-up approach when it comes to Europe.  I have very much advocated for a European strategic policy committee, SPC, for every local authority, which is important, and for there to be a European department in every local authority in the country.  The top-down approach does not work.  It does not provide for engaging with the citizen as much.  That should happen locally.  I come from a local government background and I know how distant the gap is from local government to European affairs.  It is all very well for us to haul in before this committee the Minister with responsibility for local government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Byrne, but the money has to come from somewhere for funding SPCs.  Some counties already have a European affairs department.  They have not only a European affairs officer but also a department.  Some councils are doing it really well.  What would the delegates' message be today for other councils, and for the Minister with responsibility for European Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister with responsibility for local government, as to how best they can work with them to have a bottom-up approach to Europe that is not there currently?</p></speech>

We have been set a challenge and, in fairness to Senator Keogan, she was the first to advocate for having European affairs officers.</p><p>We have been set a challenge.  In fairness to Senator Keogan, she was first regarding the EU officers.  It would be a wonderful way to mark Ireland's 50th anniversary as an EU member if every local authority had a fully-funded EU officer.  I was struck when attending an event recently, hosted by the Bonniconlon Irish Countrywomen's Association to mark Ireland's 50 years of membership.  It was the biggest event in an Irish town I had seen for a European event.  It was not put as some sort of technical lecture about the EU.  On the day, people were encouraged to provide their memories of the referendum, those who were around at the time of the referendum, and their memories of the debate.  Yes, there were the usual inputs from the bubble, as Councillor Feeney said, about how great we are and how great we have become because of the EU.  It was, however, the personal inputs and the personal stories and reflections on the difference that EU membership has made to families and to farms that had resonance on the day.</p><p> As a committee we must take the challenge.  I was particularly struck by the warnings in Mr. Tzitzikostas' final remarks.  As we get into our 50th year let it not be a year of ribbon-cutting and patting ourselves on the back.  Let us actually leave something behind.  Moving forward with the EU officers might be some way to do that.  Mr. Tzitzikostas used the phrase "anonymous European funds".  They have become more anonymous here since we have become, as Councillor Feeney remarked, a net contributor.  We no longer seem to want to realise that EU funds, including the LEADER fund and the European Social Fund, fund much of our third and fourth level education.  This has made the disconnect worse.  Obviously there is the EU officers' role, but what other initiatives could we take to address this disconnect?</p><p> Councillor Murphy was at pains to emphasise that the narrative at local level across the UK was different from that in Westminster.  They were also told this before Brexit.  We were told this before the referendum, and that the vote was not going the way the media saw it.  The regions that benefited most in financial investment by those anonymous EU funds voted to leave in the biggest numbers.  I am referring to the fishing regions and the port regions.  Holyhead, for example, had massive investment in its port from those anonymous EU funds, yet the region had one of the biggest leave votes.  How are we going to correct that disconnect?</p><p> On a completely unrelated question, one of the biggest consequences of the war in Ukraine is the number of local representatives who have been kidnapped or murdered just because they were local representatives and had a mandate.  This question is for the president or the delegation.  What role has the council taken in highlighting this since 24 February, in keeping attention on that?  They are like you and they are like all of us here.  They are local representatives.  Some of them have paid with their freedom and some have paid with their lives because they are local representatives. </p></speech>

I have listened intently to all of the conversations.  I agree wholeheartedly that there is a disconnect between the people on the ground and the EU, even among local representatives.  I am chairman of the regional assembly in Waterford.  The question we are often asked is: "What are you crowd doing down there?"  The point that has not come up today is the fact that a massive Covid recovery fund has been handed from the EU to Ireland, which at the moment is being distributed and orchestrated.  This is more than &euro;500 million.  This is real money coming from the EU but as some members have stated, we do not have a full-time EU officer in all of the councils.  I believe there are only three or four currently.  It is very necessary because the paperwork is complex.  It would not be complex to a person who was full time at it.  As Mr. Tzitzikostas said, we need real connectedness between the EU and the people on the ground.</p> <p>  In most of the EU regions, 40% of control is devolved to the local councils, but in Ireland it is less than 9%.  That is something we must balance a bit.  We do need a bit more control from the ground up to give people the connection they need.  The EU has been very good to Ireland and I believe we can give something back.  We are a very democratic society.  Ireland is probably one of the longest lasting democracies, excepting that we have a problem with our Border at the moment.  As the Chairman knows, this has the potential to implode badly if we do not bite the bullet on this.</p></speech>

I will just touch briefly on Deputy Haughey's question on the directly elected mayor, as he is the only Dublin-based Oireachtas Member present, while I acknowledge the presence of the sitting Lord Mayor of Dublin.</p> <p>  As a delegation we would struggle to come to a defined consensus and make a joint submission on this.  We are 18 members in total with nine full members and nine alternate members.  All political parties are represented and we have Independent members in the group too.  While we wear the green jersey and speak with one voice when we are in Brussels, the debates are a little more interesting when we are at home and we would struggle to find a common message on that.  I am glad the assembly has brought in mayors from different cities, and mayors with different structures and different executive powers.  The way the assembly is being run is very good.  Personally, I will make a submission but a joint submission will not be coming from the delegation in that regard.</p></speech>

The Borough of Clonmel was granted by royal charter in 1608.  It is something we held on to, despite our famed resistance to Oliver Cromwell in 1650.  If there is anything the committee can do to restore that and give independence back to Clonmel,  I would be very grateful.</p> <p>  In my introductory speech I gave the example of Cork city, represented here by Councillor Kieran McCarthy, and Cork county, Donegal and Limerick, all of which have full-time EU affairs officers.  My local authority in Tipperary had such an officer but for whatever reason of staffing challenges and so on it just petered out.  The local authorities with full-time EU affairs officers are accessing EU funds.  Cork city is one of 100 cities, along with Dublin, that will be a climate-neutral city under the Horizon Europe funds.  These are pots of money.  Notwithstanding the networking opportunities, it is complex to access them.  This is why we need these EU affairs officers.  Ms Teresa Lennon and Mr. Tadgh Browne are here representing the Irish Regions European Office.  It is a resource for the Irish authorities to engage with, but it is very important that we would have EU affairs officers who can connect with the Irish Regions European Office, which can guide the officers and help them through the complex processes involved.</p> <p>  I work in the private sector and I am a full-time public representative.  I work also with the European Committee of the Regions.  I see that local authorities can get a lot of things wrong, but they can also get a lot of things right.  I was very proud of the way my local authority responded to the Covid-19 pandemic, with precision and in a timely manner.  All the other local authorities were the same.  They were at the epicentre of the Covid-19 recovery and response.  I will give the recovery and resilience instrument as an example.</p><p>It was a big pot of money that came from Europe.  Regrettably, local authorities in Ireland were not consulted to a great extent on the preparation of the recovery and resilience facility.  It was really just a box-ticking exercise.  They certainly were not involved in its implementation.  Local authorities cannot simply be executors.  If the Minister was here, I would deliver a simple message to him.  Let us empower local authorities.  Let us have cross-party and cross-departmental support to empower local authorities because they can deliver.</p></speech>

I have a few words to say concerning Ukraine and the atrocities happening there.  It is not that the Russian regime abducted mayors in Ukraine.  It also killed some of them.  It is true this is a human tragedy that we never thought could happen in the 21st century within Europe and right at the border of the European Union.  From the very first minute, we did all in our power to convey the message that this needs to stop immediately.  I personally visited the border between the European Union and Ukraine and saw the struggles of the people.  I saw millions of people fleeing from Ukraine trying to find shelter.  I saw the difficulty encountered by but also the vision and will of regional and local leaders of European regions and cities at the border with Ukraine, and how they were trying to help with all the resources, in order to strengthen these people during this humanitarian disaster.</p> <p>  The Ukrainian situation and Russian war were the main topic of our previous plenary.  We had the chance to discuss this with several mayors of Ukraine who were online.  They described the situation, the atrocities happening in Ukraine and the need for support.  What we have done, as I said, is create this platform in order to help.  Cities and regions throughout Europe have been sending humanitarian aid.  We did something to convey a strong political message as well.  After consulting our colleagues, I have given honorary membership to the Mayor of Kyiv and president of the municipalities of Ukraine, Mr. Vitali Klitschko.  He is now an honorary member of the Committee of Regions, which is a strong political move.  We will not stop here.</p> <p>  As I said, the discussions about the reconstruction phase are under way.  Cities and regions are getting involved in this project and alliance.  We will be able to help with technocrats, engineers, mechanics and others.  Help has developed in cities and regions and we will use that for Ukraine as well.  Cities and regions will be involved.  I already discussed this matter with President Zelenskyy.  With the support of the European Commission and the Council of Europe, we will go forward and help these people who have been suffering.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair and dear members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It has been a privilege and an honour for me to be here today.  Being from Greece, the other end of the European Union, I know how you feel being located here.  I know how it is to sometimes feel like things are happening far away.  I believe in Ireland.  I see people with vision here.  I see a great country with great prospects.  I admit that I see a lot of things in common between the Greek and Irish people even though we are miles apart.  Ireland can count on one more friend and ally from now on.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation and congratulate our great members of the European Committee of Regions who have been of tremendous help throughout these past two and a half years, holding different positions of interest in the committee, and helped to achieve all the goals we set from the beginning.</p></speech>

Today was much more than just a conversation.  It was more than politicians telling one and other how great a job they are doing.  A number of challenges came from both sides and that is healthy and refreshing.</p> <p>  We will follow up on the matter raised about the sitting of the committee.  We always meet in the committee rooms.  Formally, we have to meet in the precincts of Leinster House but we may have a conversation in private session about visiting Tipperary, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown or Sligo.  Maybe Councillor Blaney will have us in Donegal with his big connections up there.  We will leave that decision to the delegates.  Members of the committee would be happy to meet them formally or informally.  That would be very refreshing.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alison Gilliland, and all the councillors from the different regions in the Public Gallery, including Councillor Pip Breen for his intervention.  There was no shyness from the Wexford man intervening from the Gallery.  Ar son an choiste, gu&iacute;m gach rath ar na finn&eacute;ithe leis an obair th&aacute;bhachtach seo.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022061500002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today and I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss the Civil Service secondment policy and related matters with the committee.  In this context, it is important that the committee is aware that the secondment circular issued by my Department last year is for the Civil Service.  I will comment on certain other secondments but my Department&rsquo;s role in sanctioning secondments under this policy is only within the Civil Service.</p> <p>  In relation to secondment, the Civil Service secondment policy and associated terms were introduced in December 2021.  They were designed to complement the Civil Service mobility scheme, which is for permanent moves between Civil Service organisations, in that it enables the filling of positions concurrent with a strategic project/placement that require specialist knowledge and skill sets for a defined period.  The policy recognises that a number of administrative arrangements had evolved across the Civil Service over time and was not intended to replace such sector-specific arrangements. </p> <p>  Secondments facilitate the release and movement of staff and may provide opportunities for staff to broaden their skills and continue their professional and personal development while retaining the right to return to their substantive or equivalent position.  It is a valuable arrangement that facilitates shared learning, good practice and new ideas.</p> <p>  Currently there are 17 staff of my Department that are seconded in from the civil or public service and there are 19 staff of my Department that are seconded out to the civil or public service.  Included in these numbers are two staff members who are seconded out to administrative roles in the third level sector.  One member of staff is seconded to Dublin City University and the other is seconded to the Technological Higher Education Association.</p> <p>  Also included is one staff member who is seconded in to my Department from National University of Ireland, Galway as a researcher as part of the Science Foundation Ireland programme.  </p> <p>  While the policy applies for secondments in the Civil Service, the policy also provides that the same principles should apply to secondment arrangements between a parent Department and a non-Civil Service body.  It is not a requirement for public service bodies, as distinct from Civil Service organisations, to seek sanction from my Department to fill a position through secondment.  That is a matter between the public service body and its parent Department.</p> <p>  Correspondence from the committee referred to recent secondments to third level institutions.  In respect of the recent secondments of two former Secretaries General to posts in third-level institutions, on the expiry of his term as Secretary General, Dr. Fergal Lynch moved on secondment to NUI Galway.  On the expiry of Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;&rsquo;s term as Secretary General he moved on secondment to NUI Maynooth.</p> <p>  These appointments were in line with Government decisions dating from October 2011 regarding the offer of an alternative position in the civil or public service or an international institution at a salary equivalent to Secretary General until preserved pension age and that retirement before that age would not be the norm.  These terms are reflected in the advertisement booklets for Secretary General posts.  Both secondments are time-limited, for periods less than five years.</p> <p>  Responsibility for third level institutions is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation, and Science in the first instance.  More generally however, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is involved in a number of ongoing cross-sectoral initiatives that aim to strengthen links between the Civil Service and the university sector in the area of public policy development.  In this regard, I draw the joint committee&rsquo;s attention to a number of such initiatives being pursued by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  IGEES operates under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its collaboration with academia is facilitated through the IGEES external advisory group, which consists of representatives from universities, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI.</p><p>IGEES seeks to further foster knowledge transfers and skills development of IGEES policy analysis by building more extensive networks across academia, through collaborative research, a research fund and various different events.<br/><br/>The secondments of Dr. Lynch and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; support, <i>inter alia</i>, progressing the work programme in this policy area, including links to the work being carried out under the Civil Service Renewal 2030 Strategy, led by my Department, and the recently established joint initiative of the Department of An Taoiseach and my Department, Strengthening Policy Development and Strategic Foresight in the Irish Public Service, which is a project being supported by the OECD.<br/><br/>Previous correspondence of the committee also referred to the proposed secondment of the Chief Medical Officer.  On this matter, my Department received a sanction request from the Department of Health on 31 March.  As part of this request, the Department of Health indicated the outgoing CMO would be moving to Trinity College Dublin to take up a professorship on a long-term secondment at the end of June and that it was expected that the secondment would continue until his retirement.  No further detail or material was provided in relation to that secondment.  As is usual with such requests, there was subsequent engagement at official level between my Department and the Department of Health in relation to it, and in relation to the funding aspects of it.  Following the announcement of the CMO of his intention to retire in July, the proposed secondment and associated arrangements were not of relevance to the sanction request for a replacement CMO and a letter of sanction for the post of the CMO issued from my Department on 21 April.  The subsequent report prepared by the Department of Health acknowledges that elements of the arrangements were not communicated well.  The independent review commissioned by the Minister for Health into the process related to the proposed secondment is ongoing and is a matter for that Department.<br/><br/>I trust this is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Moloney for coming in front of the committee to discuss this topic.  To start off on secondments, the crux of the issue that people have been querying over the last number of weeks and months is in relation to a temporary nature of a secondment.  If we look at the HR section on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website, it states that a secondment is a temporary arrangement that facilitates the release and movement of staff members for a specified period of time in a way which does not affect their employment status.  It goes on to note that the maximum time period for this temporary arrangement is five years.  The circular Mr. Moloney referenced was published on the 31 December 2021.  Does this differ from previous circulars in relation to secondments because I, and people generally, would understand that a secondment is of a temporary nature?  Can Mr. Moloney comment on that?  Does he see a secondment as a temporary situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022061500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The purpose of trying to formalise the secondment policy in the circular, which is, I think, the first time it was done, was to try to clarify some of the issues that arose over time, where secondments were conducted in a variety of different ways.  In effect, many secondments became permanent by being rolled over on a continual basis.  The Civil Service mobility scheme, which was introduced and now covers all general service grades between clerical officer and assistant secretary, formalises the process of permanently transferring staff between Departments in the Civil Service.  Therefore, the remaining bit for secondment policy to do, outside of niche areas, specialist expertise or long-standing arrangements that are in place, is to try to regularise how temporary secondments take place.</p> <p>  There is a further complication in that where we second from the Civil Service to an outside body, the terms and conditions such as pension and other entitlements sometimes need to be maintained through a secondment arrangement and in some cases - for example, the two cases of Secretaries General I mentioned - that would make the secondment time limited but there is not an anticipation return to the Department.</p></speech>

Is it a technical matter?  Is that what Mr. Moloney is saying? Sometimes secondments are forever.  Does Mr. Moloney think there is a concern in relation to that?  Does he think there needs to be further clarity to make it very clear how secondments work if they are to an external body, as mentioned, and if they are basically long term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022061500002#B00700"><p>Yes.  This is our first attempt to try to bring clarity to this, just within the Civil Service.  Many of the issues that have arisen are in relation to proposed secondments between the Civil Service and the wider public service.  That is an area we can certainly look at.  The one thing I would say is that there is a huge number of secondments, they are really valuable to the system and they occur in a huge variety of different circumstances.  They occur in many different ways - for example, with international institutions, with the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service, the Attorney General's office and the Central Statistics Office.  Experts are seconded for periods of time into Government offices.  On occasion, those experts become quite imbedded in those Government offices and the secondment evolves in a way that makes it permanent.  What we are trying to do is to twin mobility and secondment policy.  We are trying to make all of that more transparent and make the conditions under which that could happen clearer.  The mobility policy is preferred as the vehicle to achieve permanent transfers and secondment policy, by and large, is there to facilitate temporary transfers.</p></speech>

Would I be taking on the duties and responsibilities but not the actual role?</p></speech>

Some of the questions have already been answered but in relation to the secondments Mr. Moloney mentioned to Maynooth University and the National University of Ireland, Galway, these are secondments that have been raised with us and people have asked serious enough questions.  It is easier to be frank and honest with Mr. Moloney and to ask these questions.  Concerns have been raised that the job descriptions for the work being carried out in both of these roles are very similar and both reference, as was said, the Civil Service renewal strategy, furthering public policy and so on.  What appears to be the case, or at least publicly - maybe Mr. Moloney has other information - is that there is a question on what actual research they are carrying out.  I know some academics and different people working in the field have been asking that same question.  To be fair, it is a valid question.  Would I be right in saying the two individuals would be too young to have full pension rights?</p><p>I do not mean to reflect badly on anyone or anything like that but the following question has been raised.  Are the secondments being used to allow early-retiring senior officials who do not have full pension rights a way of maintaining their incomes?  As I said, this is not to reflect on either of the two people; I would just like to hear Mr. Moloney's thoughts and views on that because it is something that is being raised with us and this point needs to be addressed frankly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022061500002#C00200"><p>I will take the last point first.  The Government decision in 2011 was a clear one.  It said that when a retiring Secretary General reaches the end of their term and has not yet reached preserved pension age, the minimum pension age, the Government may offer them an alternative position.  In the case of the two Secretaries General we are talking about, the Government made the decision late last year to do that.  It is a term and condition of the appointment of Secretaries General since 2011.  It is detailed in the Public Appointments Service, PAS, booklets on those competitions that at the end of their term, if they have not reached full retirement age, the Government can choose to offer them a post in the Civil Service, the public service or an international institution.  That is the policy that has been in place since 2011.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that concerns have been raised about the similarity of the roles and there is a similarity.  Having decided to offer these two people a post, the Government took the opportunity to further one of the Civil Service renewal actions in public policy and improving public policy and particularly in terms of developing communities of practice that link in the academic sector with our work in the Civil Service and with Enterprise Ireland and other researchers.  We do part of that through IGEES but we want to do more of it under the banner of Civil Service and public service reform.  This was an opportunity to place them in universities and develop those networks.  Within my Department they are both involved in public service reform and there are slightly different public service reform aspects to this work.  One of the retired Secretaries General is involved in the organisational capability reviews and is chairing the group of Secretaries General who drive and oversee the organisational capability reviews.  For example one such review has been done in the Department of Defence and one has been done in the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The other retired Secretary General is more involved in a specific OECD project on strategic foresight, evidence-based policies and the structure and hierarchy of the Civil Service.  Both jobs are a mixture of a role within the university, networking and an attempt to build a greater community partnership within academia and the Civil Service and public service.  The elements of reform involved in each post are slightly different, as I have described.</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney is saying he is fully confident that they have a great job of work there and about the research they are carrying out.  In fairness Mr. Moloney has given more detail on that there but sometimes we need to be honest about these things because we have unfortunately had a history in this State of a huge lack of transparency in appointments to roles.  It would be beneficial for that information on the research they are carrying out to be provided in a more open and transparent way.  This matter has been raised with us in the committee by certain people as they have not been able to get that information.  It is important that this information be readily available to people.</p> <p>  That rule on Secretaries General is quite interesting and I would say that a lot of people watching on would say that it is not a bad gig if you can get it.  It is good that you have provided that clarity on the work that is being done.  I thank Mr. Moloney.</p></speech>

I agree with him when he says there are benefits to secondments in staff being able to broaden their skills and continue their professional and personal development.  Would I be correct in saying that we have an issue in Ireland with retired Secretaries General and what to do with them when their seven years are up and they have not reached retirement age?</p></speech>

We have a policy in place on that since 2011.  The December 2011 decision on this sets out what to do with retired Secretaries General and it offers a number of options.  In practice the option to extend the term of Secretaries General has often been taken.  There is the option of reassigning them within the Civil Service and public service and the option of seconding them to another position in the Civil Service, in the public service or in an international institution is also there.  The 2011 decision is clear that the object is not to make the retirement of Secretaries General at the end of their terms before preserved pension age the standard and usual practice.  I understand the question but I see it slightly differently, in terms of it being part of the terms and conditions under which the posts are advertised.  There is a clear understanding that at the end of your term, these different options exist to take you up to preserved pension age, which is what both of the cases we discussed today involve.  In explaining that policy, that is seen in an overall context where it would potentially be difficult to recruit people into those roles if they did not have a path at the end of their terms.  That is something the performance review group has identified as an issue.  It is also something the de Buitl&eacute;ir group that the Government has recently established to review senior public service recruitment and pay processes is looking at.  The treatment of Secretaries General at end of term in this context is one of the issues the group will look at, among the gamut of processes around the appointment of and remuneration for Secretaries General.</p></speech>

The Secretaries General referred to in Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s submission to the committee have gone on into third level institutions.  All of them are highly qualified and talented people but the impression I get as a Deputy is that suitable jobs are being looked for to see what we can do with this talented person whose seven years is up and where can that policy go.  Are the options that are available to retired Secretaries General getting broader?</p></speech>

The 2011 policy was created in the context that people were not happy that people before preserved retirement age were immediately put into significant pensions.  The policy decision was taken that instead of giving added years, alternative posts would be offered up to pension age.  That is why it might appear to be more frequent; this policy is only in place since 2011.</p></speech>

They may be notified internally in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I can understand why they would not be advertised.  In respect of someone who is going into an academic institution, the policy issue or the public concern voiced by many Members of the House of the Oireachtas was that if a Secretary General, or a very high-ranking civil servant, was going to go into a third level academic institution, that is all well and proper but there should be an opportunity for others to apply for the position being filled.

The Government decision means someone can be offered a post to the end of their term and the subsequent Government decision agreed that with the two individuals involved.  In a sense and in general terms, the policy of advertisement and competition for posts is absolutely correct policy but in specific terms, the 2011 decision creates a policy framework where retiring Secretaries General, before preserved pension age, may be offered a position.</p></speech>

I wish to point out that I probably have a different view from other people on this issue.  The people who have served their full-time, or not yet served their full-time, in the public service, may still have something to offer and it should not be lost.  Their experience and their ability should not be consigned to the waste.  They still have a lot to offer and while secondment may be an emotive issue, it does not take away from the fact that as, I think, Galbraith used to say, members of the older generation still have a lot to offer and although they may require longer holidays, they still could offer a great deal in terms of experience that should remain available to the public sector in the event that the public sector was of a mind to accept it.</p> <p>  There is a possibility that we have become "soundbite-ist", for want of a better description, in terms of our reaction as public representatives.  I do not contribute to that at all.  There was a situation in the military sector once upon a time where an army officer or anybody serving in the army would, after 21 years, avail of a full pension and go elsewhere.  That had the double effect of renewing the membership of the Defence Forces on a regular basis.  Without any particular intervention, people went elsewhere.  People, however, decided to change that and said it was not fair that some people were offered this concession, despite the fact that the original intention was to achieve the result of getting people to retire from the Defence Forces and giving them an incentive to do so.</p> <p>  I refer to taking the soundbites, the emotionalism and the populism out of it.  Everybody will oppose somebody getting something they think they should not get.  I know we have to protect ourselves and the integrity of the public sector but at the same time, we should keep in mind that the people retiring may still have something to offer.  The best way to utilise or to harness that energy, experience and enthusiasm, or whatever, needs to be found.  We have not always found it.  There are particular options open to some people, such as the Secretaries General referred to, in some Departments, but we need to look further and see how we can utilise those people's services to a greater extent.</p></speech>

A lot has been asked so I am not going to go over old ground in relation to this but I have one or two questions that I would like to ask on the secondment policy within the public service.  We have looked at and discussed the recent circular stating that secondments are not supposed to be for more than five years.  If he has not already done so, can Mr. Moloney tell the committee how many secondments of over five years are in existence in the public sector?</p></speech>

That is only since the end of last year.  We do not have a role in secondment in the wider public sector generally and we do not have the data on it.  Secondments are, as I said, very commonly used in order to generate knowledge and broaden experience.  I am afraid I do not have the numbers.</p></speech>

Does the Department have any insight into what is happening in terms of secondments within the public sector?  Obviously, the title of the Department includes reform so is there any way for the committee to find out whether there is 5,000, 10,000 or 50,000 secondments or whether 8,000 of them have been for a duration of nine years?  Are there people who have been seconded and have been forgotten all about?  The committee would like to know some of this data.  Is it possible to have it collated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022061500002#D02100"><p>The Deputy is quite right.  The Department has an interest in public service reform, end to end, right across the public service.  Our responsibilities as an employer are related to the Civil Service so when we talk about having information on the Civil Service it is because we are the employer of the civil servants.  Whereas in the wider public sector, you are probably the employer of the board of your particular part of the public sector.  The HSE board is probably the employer for a lot of the HSE.  The Department does not have the HR data outside of the Civil Service.  In terms of whether it could be collected, it is certainly an issue we could discuss, for example, at the public service leadership board.  Again, there is a very wide variety of public service organisations across 360,000 people so it is quite a data exercise.  We could look to see what insights might be gleaned and it might, in fact, be a natural next step to the review of the secondment policy that we are due to do after six months - in effect, starting next month in any case.</p></speech>

As parliamentarians, we can table questions to every Department and agency and ask them how many secondments they have but I expect it would be better if that was collated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and presented to the committee rather than us doing it individually, which we can do and I might do that.  It is important to get a sense of where we are at and, in particular, whether there are long-term secondments that should no longer be secondments, whereby people probably have been in those roles for so long that those positions should be permanent.  With permanency comes particular conditions.  Has Mr. Moloney found that to be the case in the Civil Service and in the public sector or has he got an insight into any of this?</p></speech>

With the development of a mobility policy for all grades between clerical officer and assistant secretary, we would like that to be the mechanism within the Civil Service that is used for permanent assignments because we think that is much more open, transparent and clearer.  We would like secondments to be predominantly temporary, although we recognise there is a great variety of secondments and they have different characteristics, and we set out some exceptions in the guidance.  The difference between seconding somebody and permanently moving somebody is sometimes to do with the different terms and conditions that can occur.  For example, we only have a mobility policy for the general grade civil servants.  We do not yet have a mobility policy for the professional and technical grades.  For particular areas of specialism, there would be worries for people involved about how much they carried their existing terms and conditions with them but that is all there to be worked through and we are working through it for the technical professional grades for the Civil Service.  Certainly, those lessons can be taken on board in our review and in how we might progress that for the wider public sector.</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney can correct me if I am wrong but my understanding is a teacher - not to pick on teachers as my three sisters and my wife are teachers - could be elected as a Member of the Oireachtas and 25 years later, having lost the job, that person could return to teaching as the position would have been kept open for that person.

It is quite a big step to be a teacher, then get elected as a public representative for four years and not to have a permanent job to which to return.  It is not that the teaching job is not filled.  It is filled and when one is prepared to go back to being a teacher again, an available teaching job will be allocated to the person.  It Is not that the job the person left 40 years ago is still there waiting for that person.  It is that the person has an entitlement to come back to a teaching post or an equivalent post.</p></speech>

The person who backfills it is not given permanency and that is a problem.  There is an issue in terms of workers&rsquo; rights.</p></speech>

The professional can return to that role when the secondment finishes.  I know of cases where five or six years later, a professional backfilling that position is still temporary.  The consequences of that are significant.  If a person want to get a mortgage, he or she will not get one on having a non-secure employment position.  People are seconded for long durations over a five-year period and the backfilling of those positions is still temporary.  Is that fair in this day and age in terms of the public sector and those publicly funded institutions such as our hospitals?  It is no wonder people are seeking more permanency and travelling across the water in some cases.</p></speech>

Sometimes it means the person returning to a position faces a delay or has to go into a different but equivalent job.  Even in terms of the relevant legal provisions, maintaining somebody on a temporary basis but really permanently is undesirable and questionable.  That certainly is not the intention of the Civil Service policy.</p></speech>

Let us have a bird&rsquo;s eye view of where we are at with secondments, which is an important role in the transferring of experience and so on.  I would like to know if there are people who have been seconded for ten years and if so, perhaps those should be permanent positions now.  I know of a case of a former Deputy who was a member of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s party and who used to be my headmaster.  The person who replaced him in the school was temporary.  That is happening in the public sector.  People with professional degrees in our health sector, having been five or six years in the position, are not able to get a permanent contract because the position they are filling was vacated by somebody who was seconded to another position.  Two jobs of work need to be done.  We need to get an idea of where we are at with secondments and with the backfilling of roles.  We also need to apply the same principles Mr. Moloney mentioned that apply to the Civil Service to the public sector and those publicly funded bodies.  That would be helpful in recruiting and retaining some of those key personnel we need.  I thank Mr. Moloney for that.</p></speech>

What is the process for ensuring there is a similar type of policy shared by the public sector?</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform really is the employer of civil servants.  Public servants are employed by the governing body of whatever organisations they are in, by the board generally.  What we try to do through the public service reform and through the public service leadership board is to articulate and consult on the policies being developed for civil servants and encourage public service bodies to adopt like policies.</p></speech>

In terms of the circular letter that was issued, it is interesting to hear the explanation being offered that it applied only to civil servants and, therefore, the public service was left to one side.</p><p>That is not good practice.  If we are expecting one policy to be followed by a civil servant, any agency that comes under a Department should at least share, in a general way, that Civil Service policy.  Otherwise, a completely different approach is adopted to different actions that might be taken, be it secondment or whatever it might be.  Relative to the current issue of the Secretaries General where one was to be seconded and the other who was seconded, it appears now that circular does not cover them.  Is that right?</p></speech>

First, the secondment policy is one for the Civil Service because in terms of our governance and legislative function, that is what our function is.  On the other hand, the policy contains within it the hope, exactly as the Chairman said, that the public service bodies would follow the lead of that policy.  That is very much the framework we use.</p></speech>

The circular applied to a civil servant but it does not apply to a body that is part of the public service.  What process is in place to make sure the hope Mr. Moloney has that the public service will follow the line of the Civil Service in respect of the policy, and the letter that was issued in 2021, will be followed, adhered to or, in general, be the guideline for what the public service will do?</p></speech>

In terms of the public service and it following the policy, this is a policy that has been approved by the Civil Service Management Board and the Secretary General of each Department is in a position to encourage the bodies under its aegis to use it.  We do that with quite a number policies in terms of general standards and guidelines.  However, we must respect the fact that the legislation gives the HSE board governance responsibilities over the HSE.  We have many different avenues to push out these guidelines and encourage bodies to align with them.  Broadly speaking, within the particular context, bodies are happy to do that.  The blended working framework is one of the more recent examples.</p></speech>

Both are involved in the civil and public service reform process in the ways I described earlier.  Both are involved with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in trying to create this community of practice about which I spoke earlier.  Our hope is that during their period of secondment, and they are senior leaders in their field, they will feed into the public sector reform process and into greater engagement between academia and the public service generally.</p></speech>

Secondments have gone on for so many years and involved so many people.  Deputy Doherty is trying to get to the bottom of that in terms of how many there are.  Are they still there?  Who is paying them?  What knowledge did they bring back?  I have not seen a great deal of reform in the Civil Service which suggests to me that some magnificent piece of information came back that caused reform to happen.</p></speech>

Of course, we are continuing a process of public sector reform and transformation.  Where we are with ICT and digital, skills development, staff, managerial expertise, shared knowledge and back office function has changed very significantly over that period.</p></speech>

It has a particular focus on equality, diversion and inclusion, EDI, initiatives across the public service, for example, and developing a toolkit for organisations with which they can address EDI policies.  It has only been established since 2018 or 2019.  It is a forum in which we hope to drive many of the things the Chairman talked about such as good practice and shared learning throughout the civil and public service.</p></speech>

There are not many jobs like that are there?  For example, if you are given a seven-year term as a Secretary General and if you reach the end of that seven years before retirement, that is generally it in the private sector.  You can then get a job with the experience of your previous seven years or get an extension of seven years.  Is it not better to promote the extension?  Deputy Durkan made the point - and I agree with him - that we are losing good people from many positions because there is some notional retirement age.  These people could still do the job, and some of them want to do it.  Is it not time to review that?</p></speech>

The security of tenure is one of the characteristics of Civil Service jobs that is part of the terms and conditions generally and that is reflected in the various ways of calculating the benefits and attractiveness of the job to prospective applicants.  That has been an issue.  Those are all within the ambit of the independent review panel and can be examined.</p></speech>

The independent review panel will do that for senior public service posts and to be fair to the Public Appointments Service, it is constantly looking at new ways of recruiting people, and is aware, particularly in the current labour market, of the need to get people in.  Many of our processes are driven by the need to be meticulously fair, to follow the Commission for Public Service Appointments guidelines.  Sometimes they can be perceived to be slow and people might go off and get other jobs, which is a particular challenge in the current environment where people have such choice.</p></speech>

Is that to do with salaries or is it to do with them going off and getting different jobs while they are waiting, as Mr. Moloney said, for decisions to be made?  What can we do to make it more attractive to those outside to come in and bring in some fresh thinking or new direction if it is needed?  Is there anything obvious that Mr. Moloney thinks should be done?</p></speech>

We have seen the progression of some of those people up to and including Secretary General level.  What is sometimes talked about is bringing people in directly at assistant secretary or Secretary General level.  The general view is that the level of applications and interest we get in those has not yielded in the last two years.</p></speech>

However, Deputy Doherty made an interesting reference to the teachers who become Deputies or Senators.  It could be significant in their pension entitlements in the event that they serve one term or a short term of office in the Oireachtas and then find themselves with insufficient pension entitlements.  They might go back to the public service in teaching positions and they may have several years to go, a short number of years to go or insufficient years to go to achieve a full pension.  They could well find themselves at a distinct disadvantage.  My humble suggestion would be that those who are replacements should be able to go forward on the basis that they could achieve permanency after a short number of years and acquire full pension entitlements.  That is one of the things that needs to be looked at and done.</p><p>I am sure the Chairman already knows the following.  I made reference to the Defence Forces and much is made today of the fact that it is difficult to recruit and retain people there.  It is difficult because the Oireachtas took away those entitlements they had where the person who had entered the Defence Forces spent 21 years there and walked away with a full pension.  This person could take a part-time job or a smaller job that was sufficient to meet their requirements and that may have been in line with their needs to do less work and so on.  We have taken that away and it creates an obstacle to recruitment in the Defence Forces.</p><p>The following matter also needs to be borne in mind.  There is a system in the Defence Forces involving individuals who suffered personal injuries and who claimed and obtained compensation, be it 20 years ago, 30 years ago or whatever.  In those cases, assuming the person has been discharged from the Defence Forces as being unfit to serve due to their injuries, they then qualify for a pension.  In the course of the payment of that pension, a sum is deducted on a monthly basis to recover the payment made in respect of compensation, which is an appalling decision and this measure is regularly enforced.  The phrase in the Army Pensions Act 1927 states that &quot;The Minister may&quot; recover all or part of the amount of the previous award in determining the amount of pension the person may get.  It is an appalling thing to do to people who have served the country and who have been injured to the extent that they were no longer able to serve in the Defence Forces.  The Act says &quot;The Minister may&quot;; it does not say &quot;The Minister shall&quot; but we know all about that phrase over the years, what it means and the implications for the public service.  That is another matter that needs to be looked at in order to be fair to people who work in the public service and the private sector and who have reason to change over.</p><p>Those two issues need to be looked at.  Deputy Doherty is right regarding the point relating to teachers.  I would like to see a major change on the issue I referred to in respect of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

That is fine.  It was agreed.  How it was agreed is a little bit disserving.  Because of that arrangement, is it time to look at individual Departments and to offer more to one departmental Secretary General than another because of the volume of work, the extent of the Department or the budget it has?</p></speech>

We have in place a three-tier structure but we also seen very significant movements in departmental responsibilities over time.  That impacts on how one might access a three-tier structure.  That is one of the issues we have asked the Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir group to look at and make recommendations on.  Certainly the Minister is conscious of the concerns that have been raised about how salaries are set and has explained to the committee and others, in great detail, the evolution from the former review body on higher education, moving into pay cuts and the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation reductions and restoration to our now emerging into a different phase.  Therefore, it is appropriate to consider how we might look at pay determination into the future.</p></speech>

Because we do not have a review body or a mechanism for setting and establishing what the correct rate is, the Government sees a need for the setting of a rate.  The Minister has no choice but to make that decision based on the Government&rsquo;s assessment of what is needed in respect of a particular post.  As the Chairman will know, that has happened in a small number of instances.</p></speech>

It is simply not good practice.</p> <p>  In terms of the performance of Secretaries General, there is the leadership board but I was a bit taken aback to find out during the course of our engagement with Mr. Fraser, when he was in before us, that there is no single boss.  To whom are the Secretaries General answerable?</p></speech>

I always thought Mr. Fraser would have been the all-powerful Secretary General who would control the other Secretaries General or tick them off or praise them, as needs be, but he said that is not the case.  Does Mr. Moloney think there is a need for perhaps an all-powerful Secretary General who would have as part of his or her remit the types of tools needed to manage a group of important people such as those or does he think it works okay the way it is because Governments come and go?</p></speech>

It is a complicated question.  As I set out in the piece we gave the committee on the Government's accountability thesis, Secretaries General are generally Accounting Officers in their own right.</p><p>As the Chairman will know, the legislation and rules about that are very specific.  They are not updatable.  Under the Public Service Management Act 1997, Secretaries General are given, in their own right, responsibility for the day-to-day management of Departments so that Ministers do not have to be called to account any time somebody breaks their arm in a Government building.  There are ranges of responsibility that are not communal but that are held solely by the Secretaries General.  As the head of the office or Department, the Secretary General has those responsibilities.</p><p> With regard to the collective responsibilities, that is really a matter for Government.  It is not the only way it could be done but it is the situation as it now stands.  I have not seen a clearly articulated alternative vision.</p></speech>

Sometimes, when you look at the issue, that may not be appropriate.  Secretaries General are held to account by the Committee of Public Accounts but that is about it.  I do not see anything else.  The Committee of Public Accounts is still in business.  If everything was functioning the way it should, that committee would not be in business because everything would be running so well.</p> <p>  In my time here, I have seen the same types of mistakes repeated over and over again.  That raises a question as to the response of public sector leadership and the Secretaries General as a collective to Departments overspending or causing a negative perception of themselves to develop.  Someone has to take responsibility for that.  If you look at the jobs Ministers are involved in nowadays, between Brussels and dealing with world affairs and home affairs, you will see that they are kept quite busy.  I presume they expect their Departments to take on the challenge of dealing with shortcomings.  That is where I am coming from with regard to sanctions, conditions of employment, accountability and transparency.  We all have to be accountable.  I believe that any Secretary General asked to come before a committee should do so.  That is my view.  Although the work of other committees should not be duplicated, they should come before the various committees of these Houses.  Until such time as there is change in respect of accountability and transparency, it is my view that Secretaries Generals should have to make themselves available.  The Secretaries General across the Departments should be making great efforts to ensure that issues that arise in the context of the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General are dealt with.  I am just giving Mr. Moloney my tuppence worth on the matter but I would like to see substantial change in that area.</p> <p>  We have come to the end of our discussion on this.  It has been worthwhile and informative.  I thank Mr. Moloney and his two colleagues for their time.</p></speech>

As was mentioned, I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Muiris O&rsquo;Connor and Ms Sarah Treleaven.</p> <p>  As committee members will be aware, last week, the Minister for Health published the 2022 action plan, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023, which sets out the ongoing priorities to improve our health and social care services.  This report contains many different elements, but this year, the main focus of the reform involves addressing waiting lists and the very significant waiting list plan that we discussed on the previous occasion.  It is now being implemented across different aspects of the service.  It also includes further developments in shifting care to the community through our enhanced community care programme, significant recruitment and establishment of various teams in providing care outside of a hospital setting, which is a key element of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  There is also further investment in innovation and enhanced capacity in terms of additional employees into the service, as well as additional beds and access to care.  Implementing digitally held solutions aligns with the Government's recently published strategy.  It also introduces the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.</p><p>In this respect, we hope to engage with the representative bodies over the next week or so on finalising the new contract.  We are focused on progressing the national elective ambulatory strategy through the provision of new elective capacity in Cork, Dublin and Galway, which is important for increasing the overall capacity of the system to provide more elective procedures for our citizens.  We are also focused on the realignment of acute and community services via regional health areas, RHAs, which we discussed at our previous meeting.  We can briefly set out the progress in this programme.</p><p> The 2022 waiting list action plan was launched on 25 February.  The plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and details 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists.  The immediate focus of the plan is to reduce active waiting lists for acute scheduled care by 18% this year.  If we can meet this projection, it will bring the number of people waiting to its lowest point in five years.</p><p> A waiting list task force has been established and is chaired by Mr. Reid and me.  We meet fortnightly.  A working group, comprising colleagues from the Department, the NTPF and the HSE, meets weekly to monitor progress and variance against waiting list plans, consider actions and identify issues to be elevated to the task force.</p><p> Overall, waiting lists are performing slightly ahead of the targets set out in the waiting action plan.  The first three or four months of the year were difficult due to Covid, the impact of which on the system was profound and reduced the amount of care that could be provided.  As of the end of April, both the outpatient and gastrointestinal, GI, scope waiting lists were performing ahead of target while inpatient day case waiting lists were marginally ahead.</p><p> We are maintaining the momentum behind the development and roll-out of the enhanced community care programme.  Mr. Reid will touch on this in some detail.  I will list the key achievements: 81 of 96 community health networks, CHNs, are now established; 21 of the 30 planned community specialist teams, CSTs, for older persons are established; 11 of the 30 CSTs for chronic disease management are established; 21 community intervention teams are now operational, with national coverage secured for the first time; and 139,000 diagnostic scans of various modalities were provided last year.  Regarding that last, significant progress has been made this year, with more than 75,000 scans by the end of April and a further 20,000 or so by the end of May.  We are on target for providing many more diagnostics in the community than we did last year, with a likely total of 200,000.  More than 1,200 whole-time equivalent staff have commenced their roles and a further 650 are at an advanced stage of recruitment.</p><p> The significant advance in GP access to diagnostics is an impressive performance from a standing start.  Every week, large numbers of people who would have turned up for hospital appointments are now receiving that care in the community setting through our older persons and chronic disease pathways.  This is real reform happening in practice on the ground for patients.</p><p> An individual population health profile has been created for each of the 96 CHNs, each containing standardised data on the demographics and health status of the relevant CHN.  This supports the identification of service needs down to a local level.  This profiling is an ongoing process and will lead to much better planning.  Initial external evaluations of the nine learning sites have highlighted a significant appetite for change among staff as well as positive feedback, particularly about the role played by GPs.</p><p> The Department of Health is progressing RHA implementation in partnership with the HSE and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We are designing six regions around the country where, rather than the system being funded on a siloed basis that separates community care and hospital care, health services will be co-ordinated around the needs of patients across all care settings.  This means that RHAs will serve one population in one region with one budget.  By aligning the services that we provide in each region, we will have the ability to see more clearly how a patient moves through our system from GP to hospital and back again.</p><p> The Government decision on RHA implementation, approved on 5 April, provides policy direction and a clear mandate for the RHA work programme.  Given that stakeholder consultation is critical for the success of this reform, regional workshops and other engagements are planned to input into the development of the implementation plan.  As was mentioned at our previous meeting, we are interested in receiving input from this committee and anyone else who wants to engage in the process.  We have an open mind about where we are going with the design.  There are many questions and we do not have a fixed view on them.  With our colleagues in the HSE and elsewhere, we are trying to figure out exactly how to implement the plan.</p><p> The Government remains committed to introducing the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract to hospital consultants as soon as possible.  The contract remains the subject of engagement with consultants' representative bodies.</p><p> The Government decision in December to implement a national strategy of elective care centres was shared with the hospital groups and individual hospitals and a programme business case has been developed for the elective centres in line with it.  The Government decision is to progress development of dedicated elective centres in Cork, Galway and Dublin and will provide elective care services for all of the population of Ireland.  Work has been continuing on the development of project-level preliminary business cases for Cork and Galway, including public spending code compliant analysis, to support the delivery of care centres in an agile manner.  These are expected to be finalised first, with the Dublin project business case being progressed in parallel.</p><p> The Department will continue to engage with the public and a range of stakeholders to further the goals of Sl&aacute;intecare in building a better, more equal healthcare system for our citizens.  These reforms build on one another and are progressing in tandem.  I am happy to engage with committee members on this matter.</p></speech>

I wish to provide the committee with a summary update on three of the areas that we are progressing in Sl&aacute;intecare's implementation: RHAs; scheduled care; and the enhanced community care programme.</p> <p>  Since the last committee meeting on Sl&aacute;intecare, the Department of Health and the HSE have continued to progress the implementation of RHAs actively.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has also been involved in this work.  The detailed system and RHA design and the associated implementation plan, which sets out the key enabling work streams, and their objectives, milestones, activities and risks are being developed between the HSE and the Department of Health.  In addition to fortnightly meetings between the Department and the HSE, working groups have been established to examine  clinical corporate governance and accountability; finance, including population-based resource allocation; digital and capital infrastructure; people and development; change, communications and culture; and programme co-ordination.  Six different stakeholder engagements have already taken place, with further engagements planned.  In July, there will be further workshops with a wide range of stakeholders across the system at national, regional and local levels.  Before the end of July, regional workshops are planned for engaging with managers, clinicians and local leadership teams.</p> <p>  Tackling waiting lists is a key priority for the HSE and is included as one of six key priorities in the HSE Corporate Plan 2021-2024.  The corporate plan commits to delivering significant reductions in waiting lists and waiting times, working towards achieving the following Sl&aacute;intecare maximum waiting time targets by 2026: ten weeks for a first outpatient appointment; 12 weeks for an inpatient or day case procedure; ten weeks for a GI scope; and ten days for diagnostics.  The 2022 waiting list action plan has been jointly developed by the Department, the HSE and the NTPF and is being overseen by a waiting list task force, which is co-chaired by Mr. Watt and me.  The action plan sets out the following December 2022 maximum waiting time targets to ensure progress towards the Sl&aacute;intecare targets: 98% of patients waiting for their first outpatient appointments will be seen within 18 months and 100% will be seen within 36 months; 98% of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure will be treated within 12 months and 100% will be treated within 24 months; and 100% of patients waiting for GI scopes will be treated within 12 months.</p> <p>  The action plan is supported by dedicated funding of &euro;350 million, including &euro;150 million allocated to the NTPF and &euro;200 million allocated to the HSE.  The plan focuses on delivering significant additional activity in 2022 and building capacity within the system to address recurrent capacity gaps sustainably.  The plan commits to delivering 100,000 additional outpatient department appointments, 28,000 additional inpatient or day case procedures, 8,000 additional GI scopes and 30,000 additional diagnostics.  Detailed plans to deliver this activity have been developed.</p> <p>  Engagement continues across the delivery system, including with the NTPF, to identify all opportunities to deliver additional activity in 2022.  The plan seeks to progress longer term reform in order to address sustainably the recurrent capacity gaps that were identified in 2021 through a comprehensive waiting list demand and capacity analysis.  Significant planning has been undertaken to develop solutions and outline the requirements necessary to address the capacity gaps.</p> <p>  Investments in the healthcare budget for strategic reform initiatives such as enhanced community care are having a significant impact.  The programme was allocated &euro;240 million for the establishment of 96 CHNs, including 30 CSTs for older people and another 30 for people with chronic diseases, to provide integrated services for people nearer to home.  To date, more than 2,000 staff have been recruited or are at an advanced stage of recruitment, with more than 1,700 additional posts to be recruited for in 2022.  Eighty-one of the planned 96 CHNs, 21 of the CSTs for older persons and 11 chronic disease teams have been established to date.</p><p>From 2019 to 2022, an investment of &euro;210 million has been made available through the GP agreement to support eHealth and other modernisation initiatives and the roll-out of chronic disease management, CDM, programme to more than 430,000 people.  In early 2021, direct GP access to radiology services was implemented with five private providers, with approximately 140,000 radiology tests undertaken in 2021, which has assisted in reducing the demand on hospital services.  More than 94,000 scans have been carried out up to May 2022.  All of these developments in community services are being delivered with increased collaboration and partnership with voluntary providers.</p></speech>

We hope to start formal discussions next week, which I believe is the plan, and we hope to finish those up very quickly, if we can.  Obviously, any negotiation depends on the ability of the parties to reach agreement and that is always uncertain, but we hope to do this very quickly if we can.</p></speech>

The officials might outline what progress has been made on that matter.</p> <p>  The third issue is the elective hospital for Cork.  Where are we with that because my understanding was there was a detailed plan submitted to the Department in January and we are now six months on from that.  What is the timeframe?  When are we likely to have the site clearly identified and a work programme prepared?  I ask because tomorrow we are doing the opening of a new extension to Heather House in Cork.  In fairness to the HSE, that is a 60-bed extension and the turnaround time was 18 months.  The HSE started in November 2020, the site opened up in January 2021 and we have a finished building in 18 months.  Where are we with the elective hospital in Cork?  What is the timeframe and when are both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health going to sign off on it?</p></speech>

In the Cork-Kerry region there was a decrease in the number of people working for the HSE.  It went from 1,800 people about 15 to 18 months ago down to 1,400.  That is a drop of 400 people.  Where are we now with the numbers available to provide home care, particularly as we have a growing number who require it and increasing demands?  There is also the added issue of many people preferring not to have to go into nursing homes.  I understand there was a recruitment campaign organised in the Cork region and 96 were recruited, but that does not replace the number previously employed who have left the region.</p></speech>

People are being offered &pound;50 to recommend a place outside the jurisdiction.  In other words, they are referring people to Belfast for treatment.

Due to various shortages of equipment, there is a waiting time for it.  We need forward planning.  Can we set a timeline so that this will be up and running by the end of December?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right to say there have been some issues.  The Deputy referred to the cross-border directive scheme.  It makes much more sense for us to provide the service in Cork for the people in Munster, which would be our preference.  We will revert to the Deputy about timescales and specifics about capital funding.</p></speech>

I suggest to members that it is impossible for people coming in to have those answers.  There is a mechanism if members want to ask those questions.  We are not trying to trip anyone up.  It would be much simpler.  It is not satisfactory for members to ask questions and people not to have the answers.  People could maybe look at that mechanism for future Sl&aacute;intecare meetings.</p></speech>

As I have discussed with Mr. Reid in the past, I am a big supporter of regional health areas.  I see significant potential in them.  The logic of the policy to integrate primary, community and acute healthcare is strong and I support it.  We had some discussion at the last meeting of the different options that went to Cabinet.  I would have preferred a different option, probably a variant of options two and three, although that is obviously my own opinion.  Mr. Watt said we are setting a direction of travel, so all of these processes and structures which are put in place could evolve over time, which is fair enough.  I want to drill down into how that will work practically, because that is the substance of this meeting.  I have a question about Navan hospital, which relates to the regionalisation issue.  I see on the map for Sl&aacute;intecare that it will be area A, which would contain Monaghan, Cavan, Meath, Louth and Dublin north.  Part of the logic of regional health areas is alignment of primary, acute and community care, but also alignment of hospitals within those regional catchment areas.  What is the official HSE policy on the emergency department at Navan?  There is some confusion about it.</p></speech>

We would say that what is happening at Navan hospital overall is a realignment of the services, with proposals to redirect some services to other hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The rationale for that are serious patient safety risks which have been highlighted to me, the board of the HSE and the Department.  The risks identified include that there is no local emergency department governance in Navan hospital, no acute surgical service in place, and an agency registrar, not a specialist in an emergency department, provides care in Navan.  There are significant issues relating to one of the smallest ICUs in the country.  Those risks have been highlighted to me as being significant by the chief clinical officer of the HSE, the clinical lead for acute services nationally, the anaesthesia specialists in the local hospitals, surgical specialist physicians, non-consultant hospital doctors and nursing staff.  That has been highlighted to me, as CEO, the board of the HSE and the Department.  In my role as CEO of the HSE, I have to take those risks very seriously.  I take any risks associated with patient safety and saving patients' lives very seriously.</p></speech>

We have aligned ourselves with the Department to progress a number of actions to make that safer.

We are happy to and will continue to address those concerns that Ministers or a Minister of the Government may have.  We will address those concerns over the week.  We will address them in a manner that progresses safety in hospitals.  I cannot compromise safety.  I am advised by clinical specialists.  Obviously there are political concerns.  I live in the real world.  Local things are big issues for politicians nationally.  I understand that.  We will address those concerns.</p></speech>

The Minister says there are no such timeframes and he has not signed off on any.  There are comments from Ministers that they are not satisfied with responses from the HSE.  The public watching on and concerned people in Navan will see that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing or that, at the very least, there is tension between what the Government and politicians are saying on one hand, and what the HSE is saying on the other.  That needs to be clarified.  There needs to be a joined-up response to this.  I have my own views of what should happen at Navan hospital, but all of that uncertainty is causing real concerns.</p></speech>

We will address all the concerns that any Minister has over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>The initial meeting that was convened earlier this week was with all Oireachtas Members in those areas and was attended by all the senior clinical specialists in the areas.  They did highlight their concerns, including concerns about patient safety and lives.  I cannot and will not walk away from that but I will address Government and ministerial concerns.  </p></speech>

I am trying to understand how this could work at a local level.  I can understand how at a regional level, you have a single management tier, which makes sense.  You want to align your CHO services with acute hospitals.  For me, it has to be more than an administrative alignment.  It has to be clinical and be about patient pathways.  I will give an example in my own constituency, which is the easiest one I can relate to.  We have a CHO manager, a hospital manager and at least one building, if not more than one if you take mental health as well, which is located on the grounds of University Hospital Waterford.  We have what is called a Dunmore wing, which is a unit housing a palliative care unit and acute beds, but we have different management layers making different decisions.  It is the same across acute care, where hospital management can find it very frustrating to get step-down and recovery beds and home help packages.  There are different management layers and different structures.  Can the witnesses tell me how this will improve because that is crucial for me?  Regarding what is happening in emergency departments and reducing waiting lists, sometimes the focus is too much on what is happening in the hospitals where we have to take two steps back and look at primary and community care as much.  Could the witnesses give me some indication as to how that will work - not at a national level in terms of management but at a local level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#E00300"><p>I will invite Mr. Canavan and Ms Crehan-Roche to talk about their experience locally in the current set-up.  The Deputy certainly has described the issues we are trying to address, be they in respect of functional specialists or budget allocations, which do not benefit the patients in terms of the delivery of services.  All our focus in terms of looking at Sl&aacute;intecare and all the engagement we have had to date with all the stakeholders are on how this must be about the service.  It is not about structures.  It has to be an integrated service.  One issue we are seeing at local level even now is stronger integration between acute and primary services.  We have not worked through in detail what the design of that in the regions will look.  I will call on Mr. Canavan and Ms Crehan-Roche to give the Deputy some good examples of where it works and what we want to replicate from a service perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Crehan-Roche" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#E00400"><p>I will give an example because that is a good way of explaining something.  When we look at Sl&aacute;intecare in action, we are trying to ensure that people receive care as close to their home as possible to prevent them having to go into hospital and emergency departments.  The programme is around enhanced community care, which covers three chronic diseases - respiratory, cardiac and diabetes.  The integrated care programme for older persons, ICPOP, is about enabling older people to live within their communities.  I will give an example.  A gentleman aged 90 from east Galway, whose name is Ambrose, was not feeling well and was brought to a hospital just outside our region, which is Galway-Mayo-Roscommon.  He was sent to Tullamore.  The hospital discharged him because he needed medication and different follow up.  He was then seen by a consultant geriatrician.  He had a fall a few months later.  She met him in University Hospital Galway and out of that, he did not go into hospital but went to one of our community nursing units in Loughrea and got some respite, enhanced physiotherapy, occupational therapy and various clinical supports.  He was then discharged home, now has some home support and the nurses in the community look after him.  It is working really well.  We work very closely with the Saolta group in our community care centres as well.  Tomorrow we have what is called the joint enhanced community care governance group, which is co-chaired by Mr. Canavan and me.  There are various people on that, including clinicians.  We find out how we are doing regarding care.  For example, in April alone, the frailty at the front door programme saw 157 people.  We saved 375 bed days in April alone.  This stopped all those beds being taken up and these people were looked after in the community so it is working really well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Canavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#E00500"><p>It is fair to say that Ms Crehan-Roche and I have been working very closely on this for more than two years since both of us took up our posts because of the importance of integrating the services between the community and hospitals.  We have been trying to create the environment through which a enhanced community care programme can be rolled out successfully.  From a governance perspective, the key way we do it is, as Ms. Crehan-Roche pointed out, through the joint enhanced community care oversight group, which is jointly chaired by Ms. Crehan-Roche and me.  It has everybody you could imagine from the point of view of delivering services within and outside the hospital meeting in a forum.  It is quite a large and unwieldy forum but it is a great way for people to get to know each other and understand how their individual services work and how they can work together.  Ms Crehan-Roche has already given examples of how that is rolled out in real life.  We have other examples.  For example, we have good joint working arrangements in radiology.  Radiology is really important for a GP in determining whether a patient needs some further investigation or admission to hospital or otherwise.  If that can be ruled out, again, it avoids an unnecessary admission to hospital.  General X-Ray is available in the primary care centre in Castlebar.  It is a regular primary care centre with public health nurses and all the other staff you would expect to see in a primary care centre, along with GPs, but we also have a radiology facility there that allows for direct referral from GPs.  Patients are seen, have their images taken and a clinical decision can then be taken as to whether they need to be admitted to hospital or whether some other approach needs to be taken.  We are looking to roll that out in a number of other locations.  It is a key resource within the community.  If we can provide that kind of diagnostic capacity before the patient goes into hospital, it removes another reason for a patient to be sent to the emergency department.</p></speech>

Mr. Woods will play a leading role in this as well in terms of rolling out the regional health areas.  Obviously, I want to get it right.  I would imagine that every member of this committee wants to get it right so where there is good practice, we need to build that in across the health service.  Equally, we are seeing some good stuff in some emergency departments and some not-so-good stuff in other emergency departments so we need to learn from where there is good practice across the board.  I know a level of work is being done at a high level in terms of the management layers but I am more interested in how that will translate into the local areas.  If the witnesses could work with us on that over the next few months as it evolves, it would be helpful.</p></speech>

One possible suggestion is for us to provide the committee or any member with briefings separately where we can go through them.  Sometimes this format might not be the best format for going through things with PowerPoint presentations, setting out the overall and local sense of it and giving examples of how it will work locally and how it will be different with the regional health areas.  There is a lot of good practice but the question is how different will it be, and hopefully improved, with the regional health areas.  We could facilitate a private session or whatever the committee thinks would be best to go through it in detail.  Mr. O'Connor and Ms Treleaven are on the team and obviously Mr. Woods is now heavily involved in it.  They can set out matters in more detail.  There are many questions here and we are genuinely interested in hearing people's views about how we can make this better because we are going to make mistakes, which is fine because it is inevitable that we will make mistakes, but we will learn from them and through an iterative process, we will get there.  Perhaps some other way whereby we can have a different type of engagement might help to drill down into the detail of it.</p></speech>

The documentation provided by the witnesses is very good.  The challenge is translating that into actions and delivering.  I very much welcome the fact that Mr. Woods with all his experience and his seniority has been appointed to head up the regional health area implementation body.  Who else is involved?  What kind of team does Mr. Woods have?</p></speech>

We have the key leads in terms of acute and community care at Department and HSE level.</p><p>Separate to that I was very anxious to ensure, in the context of change management, that we have line ownership and line responsibility for the implementation of regions.  As was said, Mr. Woods is a very senior and respected official within the HSE.  Mr. Woods will be coming out to lead on the implementation.  On foot of Ms Anne O'Connor leaving, alongside Mr. Woods will be Mr. Damian McCallion, who will take up the interim role of chief operations officer.  That responsibility will, again, be within the line.  As we start to put the structures together, Mr. Woods will have a network of people across the regions and CHOs - as it is at the minute - and acute hospitals, for leads within each of the CHOs and hospital groups, to support him in the implementation.  We are working through a team that will support Mr. Woods.  Separate to that, within the agency we have a strategic team led by Mr. Dean Sullivan, which is looking at the wider aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation, not just the regions element.  There are a number of network leads across the country.</p></speech>

We recognise the huge importance of deep and comprehensive engagement with the staff of the service, with this committee, and with all interested parties.  It is our intention, with a view to having an implementation plan completed and submitted to the Government by December, to have a draft of that implementation plan ready in October or thereabouts in order that there would be comprehensive engagement and input taken on that plan at that point.</p></speech>

Clearly, the objective is to have integrated care but we know that traditionally, the hospital sector has had all of the muscle and the lion's share of funding.  There would be a downside for the hospitals if this is to be implemented in full.  How is the HSE handling that from the point of view of the hospitals and the existing hospital groups?  One main example of the integration is that there would no longer be the situation of delayed discharges with all of that expense being taken up with the hospital sector and no money in the community sector for home care.  That is the typical kind of problem with the lack of integrated care.  How is the HSE negotiating that at the moment?  Has the HSE started talks with the hospital groups and with the individual hospitals?</p></speech>

We had a very detailed engagement just last week with all the hospital groups, some hospital leads and clinical leads, some specialists and some heads of nursing.  It was a very significant engagement process to facilitate their feedback into the process.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that this is a massive change management issue.  Integrating nine CHO areas and six hospital groups is a very significant change management issue.  Yes, people will have a natural lens in terms of what it means for them.  It is a big change management issue and as Mr. O'Connor has said we will spend a lot of time engaging with staff.</p> <p>  Mr. Canavan and Ms Breda Crehan-Roche are here.  I believe that things are moving on very well.  People can really see the benefit of the investment in enhanced community care.  People are embracing the opportunity with step-down care beds, the new role for the National Ambulance Service, the pathfinder process, community intervention teams, older persons teams, and integrated care for older persons.  Ms Crehan-Roche gave a very live example in that regard.  I believe that things have moved on to where people can see it now in reality, as opposed to being on PowerPoint.  It is hard to find any upside to Covid but if there is any upside, it is that we implemented Sl&aacute;intecare at a rapid pace.  I have said this publicly before.  We took it off PowerPoint, we took it out of the spreadsheets, and the teams implemented it.  People can see the reality now, which is happening under the change management process.</p></speech>

That has been communicated.  Is everybody saying "This is the best thing that is ever going to happen"?  Probably not yet.  That is part of the dialogue and communications that we will be going with.  As Mr. Watt described it, that is the line of flight we are heading into.  There will be functional specialists within that, but it has to be a cross-cutting service.</p> <p>  One thing that I restate again and again in all of our workshops is that this is about the service to the patients and the users.  It is not about structures, although structures are the enabler.  Unless we are improving the services, it is not a corporate restructuring we should be on.</p></speech>

I have always felt that it did not make sense for Mr. Reid to be apologising and explaining for something that was happening in south Kerry or north-west Donegal or whatever.  There must be accountability at local level, both corporate and clinical.  I can see there being resistance to the clinical accountability principle.  Has the HSE started to look at that in any kind of detail and what kind of timeline are we talking about for having the legislation that would be required for that accountability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#F01100"><p>Perhaps Mr. Watt will talk about the legislation aspect.  I will make a couple of comments on accountability.  We are addressing this in a number of ways.  I have brought two papers to the board of the HSE about strengthening accountability in the HSE.  It is a factor and it comes up after every inquiry or every issue.  There are a number of things we will address, the first of which concerns the national incident reporting, NIR, process, which the committee will be familiar with.  When we carry out certain clinical reviews, and when we review cases that go wrong, we look at them and we tend to drift into describing what happened, and then we start a process of looking to see who did something that they should not have done.  This happens in sequence.  We are now making sure, because it is facilitated, that this is done in parallel.  It is not a "gotcha" process.  It is being done in a parallel process to see what happened, what went wrong, was someone accountable, or did somebody set out to do harm.  This will be run as a parallel process.</p> <p>  Separately, in the paper I brought to the board, we addressed the issue of accountability.  When we talk about accountability it is sometimes made very simple.  While I do not want to say it is complex, it is not that simple.  There are a number of factors around addressing accountability.  Clinical accountability is one factor, as is open transparency with the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.</p> <p>  Overall, we must look at performance management.  We are not strong enough in that area and it is not fully rolled out across the board.  We are in the process of rolling it out across the board.  There must be clear lines of responsibility.  We have delegated functions.  We need to make sure that in all of those delegated functions people are clear on what their role and responsibility is, and what they are delegated to do and not do.</p> <p>  We have brought a number of strands to this, including in the regulatory area to see what professions are regulated and what are not.  We are also looking to see what disciplinary process is in place.  Some of our disciplinary processes go back to the 1970s and they are not fit for purpose.  I would be open to challenge on that, but they are not.  Some people can vet who will oversee an investigation.  I do not believe this is right.  There are a number of strands we want to address in terms of accountability.  Perhaps Mr. Watt from the Department will address the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.</p></speech>

Clearly, there are a number of different aspects including a clear view on the lines of responsibility, better performance management, and clear delegation.  These are all of the different elements that make it up.  As Mr. Reid has set out, this is the direction of travel.  Work is going on that needs to be included as part of the implementation plan.  That is what we intend to do.</p></speech>

Is the legislation underpinning that?  When he was before this committee, Professor Tom Keane said that the single most important thing required is clinical accountability in the system.  Professor Keane told the committee about his annual performance management review in Canada.  They have very strong accountability legislation there.</p><p>Has preparation of that legislation commenced?  I can see there being difficulties there but it is essential.  Has a start been made on that legislation?</p></speech>

As we discussed at the previous meeting, the extent to which a legislative basis will be required is unclear.  It depends on how this advances.  Some of the elements on which Mr. Reid touched probably require legislative change.  That is certainly the case in respect of performance management and disciplinary processes because the legislative basis for identifying alleged misperformance or harm done to a person and the disciplinary action in that regard is old.  The procedures are old, time-consuming and chunky.  Obviously, I will not go into individual cases, but it takes many years and is very unsatisfactory.  We will have to look at the legislative underpinnings for some of those performance elements and bring forward legislative changes.  As ever, we want to try to do that as efficiently as possible on an administrative basis and only legislate where we absolutely have to do so.  Legislation will be required in respect of some of those elements but we have not bottomed that out yet.  We have not got a definitive view on it.</p></speech>

The report of Dr. Gabriel Scally on CervicalCheck set out several recommendations, separate from legislation, in respect of open disclosure and we have been rolling those out.  It is a mandatory training programme across the system.  That is rolling out quite well and has been embraced.  I will balance my earlier remarks by making the point that we need to create a culture in which people come forward when things go wrong and feel safe in so doing, rather than feeling closed off or hiding it away.  We have to find that balance of not having a "gotcha" culture but, equally, ensuring those who set out to do wrong are held accountable.</p></speech>

Regionalisation is a good thing but most of the people watching these proceedings want to know whether it will deliver in respect of community care, primary care and overall healthcare.  It is extremely important that delivery is at the heart of regionalisation.  Accountability and democratisation are very important in the context of healthcare.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Reid.  What difference will regionalisation make as compared with what we have now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.761" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#G01100"><p>This was asked earlier.  In terms of its core principles, the first is that there is an integrated service.  As Ms Crehan-Roche stated, it is that patients or users are getting care they need for their requirements closer to their home.  If they need different pathways, such as needing further care elsewhere having gone to a primary care centre, it is a more seamless process.  It is a handover rather than a hand-off experience for the patient.  There are many issues that have to be addressed to solve that but those are the core principles.</p> <p>  What will make the service better will be our continued investment in the community service to support acute services.  That does not mean there will not be investment in acute services.  We have to continue to increase bed capacity and put new pathways in emergency departments.  The improvement will relate to the enhancement of services such as primary care centres, for example.  Last week, I visited primary care centres with the teams of Ms Crehan-Roche and Mr. Canavan.  I saw an acute wing within a primary care centre where radiology services were taking place, with specialists from the acute services.  That was happening within the primary care centre.  Some of the referrals from that process happen within the primary care centre, such as in the context of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists or rehabilitation.  It is about that integrated service with fewer hand-offs, as well as an integrated management structure to ensure that is the way we operate.</p></speech>

Obviously, it will take years.  Is there a timeline for when regionalisation will have an impact on people's lives?</p></speech>

What is happing on the ground today is integration, co-ordination and patient care.  Ms Crehan-Roche and Mr. Canavan just gave examples of that.  For example, the National Ambulance Service has a new way of delivering care not just through emergency departments but in people's homes.  That is operating in Blanchardstown and will shortly go into Mr. Canavan's hospital in Galway.  Advanced paramedics and specialists in acute services are going out to treat people in their homes.  That is happening now.  We want to see it rolled out across the country.</p> <p>  The community intervention teams are in place, as are the integrated teams for older persons - we saw many of them last week - and the chronic disease management teams.  Community intervention teams are multidisciplinary teams.  While it may take us until 2024 to have a structure and an organisation and a population-based health allocation of budgets, we are not waiting until then.  Our enhanced community care programme is about doing this now.</p></speech>

I am guessing it will take several years, however, until the six regions and the 96 CHNs are up and running and fully functional.</p></speech>

All of the 21 community intervention teams are up and running already.  They are part of us building towards regions.  We are not waiting for 2024 for those to be in place.  As Ms Crehan-Roche mentioned in response to another Deputy, we had almost 140,000 cases last year in the context of community access to diagnostics,.  We have done almost 100,000 already this year.  Those are patients who would most likely have gone to an emergency department but are now not doing so and will probably not end up on a list.  That is a practical example of what we are doing now.</p></speech>

Obviously, nearly 1 million people awaiting procedures is just not acceptable.  I know there have been mitigating circumstances.  I understand that.  For a person awaiting an operation to be told he or she will be waiting four or five years for a procedure is just not acceptable.  Can the HSE, through regionalisation or whatever one wants to call it, alleviate the waiting time for those waiting years for a simple procedure for which, in another European country, they may have to wait less than six months?</p></speech>

In our hospital systems, people wait in emergency departments.  There are people waiting in emergency departments right now to be admitted to hospital.  I believe the enhanced community care programme that we are rolling out, along with the chronic disease management programme in communities and the regionalisation about which the Deputy has been asking, will directly impact on both the numbers of people waiting in emergency departments and the length of time they have to wait to be admitted.  Given the growth in activity in hospitals and the numbers of people attending, that is really important because this is not a fixed target; it is a growing one.  We will have to be better able to deal with these capacity issues as we go forward.  I believe the regional health areas give us a fighting chance of that.</p> <p>  The Deputy specifically asked about waiting lists for elective procedures.  I have no doubt that this approach will streamline our approach to the delivery of elective care.  It does require capacity both on the community side and the hospital side to be able to deliver on that, but regionalisation will allow us to consider the needs of our specific populations and direct the resources that are available either on the community side or the hospital side towards those services in order to ensure people are processed through the system quickly or, perhaps, processed through alternative sources of care, which are important.  The regional health areas make that happen.</p></speech>

It is happening; it is working.  With regard to the three chronic diseases, related to cardiology, diabetes and respiratory care, we have integrated care teams.  We now have appointed consultants who are 50% in the hospital and 50% in the community.  They are joint appointments.  Next week we are to have patient engagement and service user engagement for COPD, asthma, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  We want to hear from those affected and their carers how we can do things better and give them the best possible care.  There is an awful lot of joined-up work happening.  It is really working on the ground.  It is Sl&aacute;intecare in action.</p></speech>

It concerns several statements over the weekend by two unions, namely the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  Their statements were about the long working hours of their members.  They expressed concerns over overcrowding in accident and emergency units and safe working conditions, not only for the members but also for the public.  The IMO made the extraordinary statement that 97% of its junior doctor members will vote for possible strike action.  The European working time directive is being breached consistently and the doctors are working illegal hours.  It is unacceptable in a public health system that junior doctors who have gone through the procedure of becoming qualified are being subjected to this pretty awful situation.  When junior doctors get into the health system, they become so burnt out and disillusioned that they leave the country.  Why is it acceptable for a set of workers such as junior doctors to be subjected to these awful conditions?  If it were any other set of workers in the workforce, there would be absolute uproar.  I just do not understand why this cannot be solved, particularly by the HSE and Department of Health.</p></speech>

We continue to work with the trade unions on how to address, alleviate and mitigate some of the issues.</p> <p>  On junior doctors, Mr. Watt may want to comment  but I understand the Minister will set up a working group to examine some of the issues and determine how we can jointly address some of the concerns raised.</p> <p>  On the European working time directive, we have local oversight in respect of breaches or where things needed to be put in place to mitigate them.  We monitor and oversee these.  There has been significant progress over recent years in this regard but I accept there are breaches.</p> <p>  To give some context, one does not have to go too far in the EU or UK, or elsewhere throughout the world, to see the long-term impacts being experienced this year owing to Covid.  We are still experiencing these.  Right now, we have 477 Covid-positive patients in hospital.  We are still living with very real pressure on our healthcare system on top of the normal pressures we deal with.</p> <p>  Specifically on non-consultant hospital doctors, we are of course concerned about addressing the issues highlighted and committed to working jointly with them.  Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, do leave the country at various stages of their internship or postgraduate studies.  We have done some early analysis and found the vast majority stay.  A significant proportion of those who leave return after a short number of years.  There are issues.  People leave and return for different reasons, but we are anxious to address the concerns raised.  I am not sure if Mr. Watt wants to make any comments.</p></speech>

As always, I acknowledge the work they do continually on behalf of our health system.  Mr. Reid has just alluded to Covid.  It certainly has not gone away.  That nearly 500 people are Covid-positive in hospital all the time is very serious.  The public sometimes loses sight of that fact.  It is important that we continue to remind them that this pandemic is still very much among us.</p> <p>  On the regional structures, I agree the policy is correct.  I am glad we now have a clear timeline for their establishment and implementation but Joe Public would assume all this is happening anyway.  I am just looking for an example.  I welcome the fact that, as Mr. Reid has said, the process has already started and that we are not necessarily waiting until 2024.  On the discharge policy for discharging somebody from an acute hospital into a community structure, nursing home or whatever, how will today&rsquo;s protocols and policies differ from those under the regional structure when established?  What will be different?</p></speech>

We are already starting to see changes in the practice around discharging.  First of all, there will be a joint focus on the problems.  Therefore, if the problem is associated with accessing appropriate care in the appropriate location at the right time, it will be jointly focused on by teams working on the community side and also the hospital side.  It is not just a question of waiting until the patient is ready to be discharged and then looking to see where we can move the patient to; it is a matter of planning actively from the day of admission on both sides so we are not just dealing with the hospital care but the full pathway of care for the patient.</p></speech>

Individual patients often have very complex needs.  An elderly patient might require geriatric care but also might have an orthopaedic issue.  Providing care for both in one location is not always that simple.  While there is some joint working taking place, I believe the regional health areas essentially mandate that joint working such that we no longer see a split between a hospital problem and a community problem but a shared issue that we are in place to jointly manage.  One of the key differences is that there will be a cultural shift as well as a practical shift.</p></speech>

For example, they may be awaiting an X-ray or some such procedure.  Then there are many workarounds in place to have patients seen.  A GP might refer a patient to the hospital and he or she gets put on a waiting list while waiting for diagnostics.  The patient subsequently becomes more unwell and returns to the GP, so the GP sends him or her to the emergency department and the system becomes dysfunctional in that way.  If we can empower GPs by providing them with greater resources in the community and giving them direct access to those types of diagnostics, we avoid the situation where those workarounds take place.</p></speech>

While the average waiting time is 11 hours, in Limerick University Hospital it is 15 hours, which means people in Limerick must wait an extra 30% longer.  My question on elective hospitals is for Mr. Reid.  I note that Cork, Galway and Dublin have been identified as locations for elective hospitals.  Surely the demographics in the mid-west make the case for an elective hospital?  Why is an elective hospital not being considered for the mid-west?</p></speech>

From our perspective, the Government decision of last year was to move forward with the three business cases for Cork, Galway and Dublin.  That is the current policy.  The decision was based on population densities, demographics and the assessment of the elective needs.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Reid will share with us some of the findings or outline the briefings he has received.

There is, as the Senator said, a team working with Limerick University Hospital recently and we would be happy to share that review.  It is too early to name specific things that are happening.

Last night, after leaving the D&aacute;il, I took a train home and ended up having to go to the accident and emergency unit of University Hospital Limerick with a family member.  I will talk about some of my experiences.  The emergency department was extremely busy and there were some trolleys in corridors.  The place was not as chaotic as on other days but it was a very pressurised environment.  I am concerned that some of the people whom I met in the waiting area had decided to leave the emergency unit and go home because they felt it was not worthwhile waiting.  They decided to take their chance at home and come back the following day.  What would Mr. Reid say to those who believe UHL does not have the capacity to deal with their immediate needs and they would be better off going home and presenting again in the coming days if their circumstances worsen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.804" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#J02100"><p>We discussed with Senator Conway some of the initiatives we have which are looking at the whole organisation and flow of emergency departments across the board.  We have been under very significant pressures.  What I would say to all people who use our service is that they should use the emergency services when they need emergency care, which is exactly what they are for.  In some cases, people can use local injury units, which are in all areas, and also some primary care services.  However, people also need to go to emergency services.  We have been under extreme pressure since January across the board in our emergency departments.  We have a significant pressure in terms of presentations by older persons, which have required more multidisciplinary care.  In terms of discharges, we were significantly impacted between January and April by discharge processes for older persons into nursing homes and residential care settings because of outbreaks in nursing homes.  We have gone through an horrendous period.</p> <p>  As I mentioned to some previous speakers, while the public have moved on from Covid, and I understand that because we all should move on, we still have 477 patients with Covid.  This impacts the whole flow as dual pathways are still required in our emergency departments.  I would say to everybody who using emergency departments to bear with us.  Our staff are under extreme pressure.  We fully acknowledge that and the impact on the time it is taking people to get through.  I ask that people only use emergency care when they need it. </p></speech>

I am hugely grateful to the staff who are under savage pressure and are very good at their job.  I say that with huge sincerity.  I am grateful I have not experienced other accident and emergency departments.  It is by virtue of where I live that I have not been to other emergency departments.  It is struck me last night that the emergency department in UHL is not confined to the area behind its sliding doors.  There are trolleys and parts of the department located in other corridors.  One part stretches between 60 or 70 yards from the accident and emergency department.  This is further evidence that the mid-west region funnels all of its acute needs through one major hospital.  The answer lies in having an elective hospital, as my colleague noted a moment ago, and beefing up capacity in Ennis hospital, St. John's Hospital in Limerick and Nenagh General Hospital.  We cannot keep funnelling people through UHL, whether that is through its accident and emergency environment or for people with acute needs and even inpatient appointments.  Otherwise, the system will eventually cave in, as has already happened several times this year.  The hospital is far exceeding its capacity and is incessantly breaking all records.</p> <p>  I will press Senator Conway's point regarding an elective hospital.  We have approached this subject many times and the collective answer given by the witnesses, that a plan is being spoken about and there has been some chat or dialogue, is insufficient.  It is simply not good enough for the people in the mid-west and Members of the Oireachtas, as representatives of the region, to be told that something is being chatted about when, on the other hand, we hear that elective-only hospitals are planned for Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Will somebody own up or has some genius here decided that the mid-west, despite all of the pressures it faces, is not worthy of an elective hospital?</p><p>We need to hear it categorically and we need to hear it on record today.</p></speech>

First, and I say this publicly at every opportunity, I fully support management at hospital group level and at local level.  We have a good team at both clinical and management levels in UHL and they do a relentlessly challenging job, as do their teams.</p> <p>  Separately, with regard to UHL and the emergency pressures, we have a team in place and it is finalising a report on the overall capacity and utilising the other facilities in St. John's and Ennis to their best capacity.  The team will come back with a report and we will be happy to share that with the members.</p> <p>  Regarding the previous discussion we had about the three elective care centres, I merely restated what is the Government's policy.  It is three centres and that is exactly what the Department is bringing through in terms of a business case, so I was not trying-----</p></speech>

There is an expert committee that has advised the Government that there is a need for three, and that they should be in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  That is the nub of what I am asking.  Given all the pressures UHL and the surrounding counties are under, who has decided that it does not merit an elective-only hospital?  For three or four months I have been trying to get the answer to that.  That is the so-called expert advice on which the Government is acting and I want to know who within the ranks of the HSE has recommended that.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Watt to send that on to us and who reported that.  We need to know that.</p> <p>  I will move on.  Often before we meet the witnesses in this committee we get telephone calls from front-line people in the healthcare service.  I took a call this morning from one of these individuals when I was travelling up on the train.  I will leave it as vague as that.  He claimed one of the cruxes of the problem of integrated healthcare and Sl&aacute;intecare is the lack of information sharing.  We have a fascination with staffing and hospital structures, and I have been talking about that for the last few minutes, but he said the information sharing is chronic at times and that sometimes when referrals are made, dates of birth are missing or there is no knowledge of siblings.  He also told me, and this was news to me and I was shocked, that each hospital grouping operates its own discrete information system.  If a family with a history of public healthcare and going through the public system in Dublin moves from Dublin to the mid-west, there is not necessarily a transfer of files.  Could somebody explain if that is the case and, if so, what remedial action is being taken?</p> <p>  There is one example of somebody who came to my office.  The person went through a plethora of tests, everything from blood tests and blood pressure tests to angiograms and so forth, and on the day of discharge a doctor said to the person as the doctor was taking up the chart, "I did not realise until today that you also had cancer two years ago".  There is no information sharing.  Surely that is an easy thing to reconcile.  Staff and hospital buildings are difficult matters, but could somebody please answer on information sharing?</p></speech>

First, it is a hugely generalised statement to say that there is no information sharing.  There is very significant information sharing.  What we do not have in our health system is an electronic health record.  Many health systems have it.  The Government has decided-----</p></speech>

It was a Government decision to deploy the electronic health record, which is advancing, in Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  That is the start of the process, but we do not have the electronic health record and there is no point in me saying we have it.  However, there is very significant information sharing ongoing between the acute and community settings.  Some examples were expressed earlier, where a 91-year-old is getting his care in a co-ordinated way between the community services and the acute services.  Mr. Canavan has given some examples from the acute services as well.  However, we do not have an electronic health record, and that is a very significant gap in the delivery of healthcare in Ireland.</p> <p>  What we have done over the past couple of years is utilise the process of doing a vaccination programme to capture accurate information on the entire population to support us in that regard and for better information at an individual level.  It is the same with testing and tracing.  It is to build up our knowledge and data for individuals in terms of building that capacity in an electronic health record.  However, it is a gap, and a very significant one, in our health system.</p></speech>

I will conclude by asking the Chairman, the clerk and the team if we can schedule a full session on this issue of gathering information and storing it and sharing it, because it is essential.  We can only have an integrated health system when the information is integrated too.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

It is recognised by us.  To deliver integrated care, which is the core focus of Sl&aacute;intecare, we must have integrated data.  The Deputy said that hospital groups have information systems.  They do not.  The individual hospitals have different information systems of various quality, none of which is up to the best practice to which we aspire.  As Mr. Reid said, we learned enormously about the lessons of information in the roll-out of the vaccine programme and developed a very comprehensive national approach to the vaccine database.  The Minister for Health has secured Government approval to progress a health information Bill, building on the lessons of the vaccine programme, in particular, and supporting the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of integrated data for integrated care.  The legislation will propose the adoption of the personal public service number, PPSN, as the key identifier and will mandate a duty to share information to support the integration of care and the hand-offs that are there.</p></speech>

We need some standardised summary care records.  In other systems we are looking at in the context of developing regional health areas, such as Canada and New Zealand, even in paper the agreement of a standard cover piece of paper with core information about each patient at each hand-off between primary, acute and community care and those types of things can be very important building blocks for the electronic summary care records to which we all aspire.  The legislation will be very supportive of the type of information sharing that we recognise is imperative.</p></speech>

Regional health areas are extremely welcome.  It is very positive.  It promises to undo regional health inequalities by creating a central funding model based on population.  It is very welcome.  Will the provision of services in different RHAs be influenced by available demographic data?  For example, an RHA with a younger demographic profile might require more sexual and reproductive healthcare services than an area with an older population.  Could the witnesses say a little about that?</p></speech>

There is an intention that regional health areas and even the building blocks of regional health areas, CHNs, would have information on the demographics of their populations in order to best plan their services.  It is intended that by doing so we will address the health inequalities the Senator mentioned.</p><p>We recognise that different areas of the country need different service models or emphasis on particular aspects of service models.  We are hoping to empower RHAs to make those decisions based upon the available information they have about the demographics.  At the centre, the HSE would set some frameworks or guidance on the assessment of those demographics and RHAs would take that information and plan their services from there within their available budget.</p></speech>

However, it will need buy-in from healthcare workers.  Mr. Reid mentioned the trade unions.  I ask him to outline the consultation the HSE has had with various trade unions.</p></speech>

At this stage we have just worked through some of the hospital group teams, the CHO teams and some of the clinical specialists.  Trade unions will be a key part of the engagement both through their input into the design as well as the negotiations on the detailed structures that need to be put in place.  As I said earlier, some of them are already in place and have been the subject of negotiations, like the network managers and the community health network teams that are in place throughout the country.  There would have been very detailed discussions and dialogue with all the trade unions.  They are core stakeholders and we value their input.</p></speech>

One of the push factors causing them to leave and consider strike action is that they are being treated poorly by their employers.  They are struggling to get paid overtime for the hours they work and they report unpleasant experiences with administrators.  Will regionalisation produce a better employment relationship for these doctors?  How will that play out?</p></speech>

We are very anxious to work with the NCHDs through their representative body, the IMO, to address any of their concerns.  As Mr. Watt said earlier, the Minister is about to set up a working group to engage on those issues.  We will very gladly do that and embrace it.</p> <p>  The second part of the Senator's question is very valid.  One of the issues relating to the training pathways for NCHDs is they are assigned to different locations on a very short-term basis throughout their internship.  We are anxious to look at that so that they have a level of predictability.  Obviously, we also need to work with the colleges on that.  We will continue to monitor any of the issues raised by NCHDs.</p></speech>

I have said this publicly previously and I mean it in the best way.  The role of parliamentarians is key for us in attracting and retaining staff.  Today's discussion is very good on what is working, what is happening, what is not working and what we need to address.  Public messaging from politicians is critical for us retaining and recruiting staff.  The health service is a great place to work.  People working there are highly committed to people's lives.  Some of the clich&eacute;s that go around are not true and they impact our efforts to recruit people and get them to stay.  I do not mean that in any disparaging away; I mean it in a very true way.  What is said publicly here is what people might believe sometimes.  I will keep saying it: the health service is a great place to work.  We want to continue to retain the best people we have.  Politicians have a key role to help us in that.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid spoke about financing, including population-based resource allocation.  That always concerns me when it comes to smaller regional communities with dispersed populations.  They still have important facilities which need upgrading and ongoing staffing.  There are concerns about the plans for Clifden district hospital.  Ms Crehan-Roche is involved in reassuring people, but still the rumour mill runs.  I ask Mr. Reid about population and finance.</p></speech>

The approach is to design budget allocations based on demographic needs, acknowledging population densities and geography.  In the many different careers I have had in telecommunications, local government and the health service, I have seen the investment needed in rural areas.  As the previous Senator said, old people have different demands.  It is not just our older people who have significant needs.  Younger people have significant needs in terms of other services they need.  That is the core principle Ms Treleaven just outlined where we will look at the allocation of budgets based on the demographics, population needs and the issues around urban and rural environments.  Ireland has very different healthcare system requirements given the population dispersal across rural areas, and we need to look at it differently.</p></speech>

We also need to take cognisance of that.  I welcome the methodology and thinking behind the integration.</p> <p>  Many issues arise with people being sent from private nursing homes to emergency departments.  We need a greater focus on GPs, especially out of hours.  Could we do more in respect of nursing homes?  Obviously, nursing homes have an aged and vulnerable population who require a high level of healthcare.  At times they are being sent to emergency departments when they could be kept in the nursing homes.</p></speech>

Early pilots have proven that to be very beneficial and successful.  We see that as a core part of the health service through many different providers and certainly at primary care level.</p></speech>

Clearly some people need to be in hospital and that is fine.  However, we believe many people could be looked after in a nursing home with the right support.  We have the data and we are looking at parts of the country with a higher level of admission from nursing homes into emergency departments to see if we can do more outreaching to nursing homes, for example, through the ambulance service or some of our community teams.  We have integrated care teams in most areas now.  We are looking to use that to minimise the number of people who go in.  If people do not really need to be in hospital, it is very disruptive to them and their lives to be moved at that stage.</p></speech>

There have successes in various parts of the country with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The bigger picture here is the infrastructure.  I appreciate it is not all about buildings.  Some very important work needs to be done on discharge policy etc.  I am concerned the last winter plan for the Saolta hospital group did not include any acute beds.</p><p>From the comments of Mr. Woods, it appears it could be the same again for the coming winter.  It is a concern because we are told there is no physical space to build acute beds in Galway, which seems hard to believe in some ways.  Discharge policies must work in Galway because of the issues with the provision of acute beds.  Is that a fair point?</p></speech>

There are capacity limitations in Galway University Hospital, GUH, and with the site itself because it is so congested.  It is difficult to develop additional beds on the site.  We have plans to develop additional capacity on the site but because of the complexities, it will take time for us to deliver on that.  The plans include some additional bed capacity associated with the emergency department and women and children's block, which is moving quite well.  We also have plans on the development of a comprehensive cancer centre on the grounds of the hospital as well, which will also include additional bed capacity.  We are looking at interim plans to see if we can put some additional beds on the site while those developments are being progressed.  It is a very complex site and developing anything on it takes much time.</p></speech>

They are long-term projects and interim and short-term solutions are vital.  Surely there is somewhere we can provide beds.  Often there are issues with funding or staffing to make things hard.  To tell people in Galway there is no physical space to put a new building, even a temporary or modular building, is hard to fathom.  It is a concern.</p> <p>  Mr. Canavan has said the emergency department, and the maternity and paediatric developments are moving quite well but people in Galway would not agree because of the delays in the delivery of the project.  The last time Mr. Reid was here, I asked if a planning application would be lodged this year for that.  Could Mr. Canavan say a planning application will be lodged for an emergency department this year?</p></speech>

I can say that right now we have completed the strategic assessment review and the preliminary business case has also been completed in respect of the emergency department and the women and children's block.  We expect it will go to the HSE board this month and thereafter it will have to go to the Cabinet for a decision to move forward.  That development will bring some additional 40 beds.  As I said, we are looking interim bed development on the site as well because we are conscious there are a number of hurdles to be crossed in that and other long-term developments on the site.  We must have some bed capacity in the mean time.</p></speech>

The process after that is a detailed design business case and that must go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform through the Department and the Minister.  It is in the hundreds of millions of euro so it will need the approval of the Government to proceed.  We want to expedite this in the quickest possible timeframe with the available funding we have in our capital programmes.</p> <p>  I cannot commit right now that we will have the planning application in.  There must be pre-planning discussions, and these have been happening at the local level at which these happen.  Formal pre-planning must be engaged with before commencing the planning process.  We need to get the business case through Government approval.  That is the next step.</p></speech>

We are committed to the nursing unit there and we are reconfiguring 40 beds, as the Senator knows, with ten for respite care, ten for dementia care and 20 long-stay beds.  We will meet the Senator there.  We will look at integrated care programmes and we have X-ray there.  We work closely with colleagues in Saolta and we have step-down beds.</p> <p>  In talking about Galway, at the Merlin Park unit we have 13 short-stay beds and 13 respite beds.  There is much integrated work with step-down beds so there are beds in the community to support people.  It is about having services near to people.  We will meet the Senator shortly and speaking about our plans for older people, including what services can be there.  We have joint appointments now between Community Healthcare West and Saolta about consultant posts and there will be visiting and outreach clinics etc.  We will speak more and I look forward to meeting the Senator there.</p></speech>

It is something I have spoken about as far back as last November in the wake of what we had seen of Covid-19 at that stage.  I spoke particularly of the need to superimpose on the system a way of dealing with the health services generally similar to what we had done with Covid-19.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions I wish to put.  I will take written answers but I will require specific written answers in each case.  To what extent has a profile been created in respect of each region throughout the country, regardless of location, whether it takes in cities or rural areas?  That is important if we are in the business of providing services to suit the region.</p> <p>  To what extent has the Health Service Executive worked on the creation of acceptable working conditions?  Over the past couple of years we have had references again and again to unacceptable or unattractive working conditions.  How have we addressed that?  Have we addressed it satisfactorily or sufficiently?  Do we have the answers?</p> <p>  I will speak to waiting lists and times.  I realise that we are speaking about proposals to be implemented and put in place in approximately two years.  Do we have the capacity to clear our waiting lists in those two years?  Before Covid-19 we had a waiting list system and that is why we have a really huge waiting list now.  Those lists have got longer.  What have we done in the meantime to reduce those waiting lists completely by emergency measures if necessary and remove them altogether inside of those two years?  Is that part of the process and how will it manifest?</p> <p>  We have received numerous complaints about mental health services in all our constituencies, with no exceptions.  This takes in both residential and emergency services, accommodation and treatment, which is just appalling in some areas.  To what extent have we addressed that particular issue, particularly community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 in my area?  The Chairman mentioned we should not be specific to the areas I represent and I do not intend to do so.  In parliamentary questions I do not address issues from a local standpoint but in order to deal with matters, we must show progress in all the local areas at the same time.  Otherwise, we are putting ourselves at a distance.</p> <p>  People in the regions must know what is going on.  To what extent has the structure improved, particularly the linkages between the regions and the HSE?  How is the process working now?  It was not working for many years.</p><p>When is the board of the HSE alerted to the concerns, overcrowding and the other issues that members have brought up at these meetings and people have brought to its attention?<br/><br/>I digress for a second in relation to the need for changes and the waiting times on trolleys.  A waiting time on a trolley, no matter where the trolley is located is of no benefit.  There is no benefit for the patient because the patient is still waiting.  Waiting for what?  It is like <i>Waiting for Godot</i>.  We need to get ahead of it, be out front of it and to be putting down the markers now.  Related to that, I had occasion in the past couple of weeks to intervene in a couple of very similar cases that represented patients waiting on trolleys for one, two, three, four and even five days.  At the end of that, the patient had to be removed from the public system and go to a private system where within three or four hours they had a bed and a full-scale diagnosis.  Nothing got done in the public system.  In fact, the patient had a serious condition.  I could mention the areas but I am not going to do that.  It could be any area.  There are they same replies.</p></speech>

How is the HSE board alerted to conditions in all hospitals, accident and emergency departments and whatever in all parts of the regions?  In other words, is the chain of command working in two directions, from the ground up and from the top down, or is it just a wait-and-see situation?  As was referenced earlier, what happens when cases go wrong?  How often are cases going wrong and what are we learning from them?  Are we putting in place measures to ensure that they are minimised?  That is a separate question and answer as well.  I have one last question.  What process is in place to ensure we are doing an adequate job in recruiting GPs for the various areas throughout the country, regardless of which region it is?  Again, there are numerous cases where we have difficulty replacing GPs, many of whom are retired, but some have left the service and system as well.  Those are all of my questions and I need answers to them all.</p></speech>

I will try to answer them because written replies to all of those will have the team tied up for a long time.  </p> <p>  On acceptable work conditions, we are very anxious to improve and strengthen the work conditions.  It is obviously a very difficult environment.  We are under pressures, particularly in hospitals, at the moment.  We have put in a number of supports for staff throughout Covid around the promotion of staff well-being.  I have been involved in communications, as has all the management team, about strengthening processes and supports for people in terms of well-being at work, but also basic facilities such as the canteen, etc., that have been and will continue to be strengthened.  Obviously, issues around working time is a key issue.</p> <p>  On waiting times and lists, we have a very significant plan.  Mr. Watt and I referenced in the opening statement the around &euro;350 million in the access to care fund, &euro;150 million of which is allocated to the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, but in respect of the remaining &euro;200 million, we have put in place plans on recurring and non-recurring activity costs to help each of the hospital groups around addressing some of that.  Importantly, there are about 37 pathways to change how people get their services and move some of them move into the community to stop numbers coming onto the waiting lists in the manner in which they are.  It is a very significant plan that has been published and I am happy to share it.</p> <p>  I might just ask my colleague to comment on the mental health service in a moment.  </p> <p>  I just want to reassure the Deputy about our board.  We report to the board on a monthly basis.  We have what is called a scorecard, which goes onwards to the Minister after every board meeting.  That is a report on all aspects of our national service plan and performance against each of the targets in the plan.  That includes emergency departments and patient waiting times.  The performance delivery of our board is reviewed on a monthly basis by a subcommittee and it is reviewed by our full board.  There are very clear linkages between what happens on the ground and us providing assurances to our board, including on patient waiting times.</p> <p>  I will touch on the last couple questions.  GP recruitment is a difficult issue.  We are working with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, to strengthen the number of trainees coming through and the number of GP trainee posts over a three, four or five-year period.  I think this year we have about an extra 41 posts going through for GPs, which is a start.</p> <p>  I will take a final question on what happens when things go wrong.  We have a serious incident management process within the health service.  We have various processes, including NIR process as well, that looks at where harm is caused or something went wrong and sets out recommendations.  As I said earlier, we have certain ways of progressing both learning from it and addressing some of the issues that emerged.  I just wish to reassure the Deputy.  I hope we have saved my team a number of written reports on that for the next few weeks.  I know I have been brief in my answers but I am trying.</p> <p>  Perhaps my colleague, Ms O&rsquo;Connor, will speak on mental health services.</p></speech>

A couple of years ago we took an approach working with our population health colleagues and international deprivation modelling where we actually applied a resource allocation adjusted for deprivation and rurality to the mental health funding, which recognised the types of issues that the Deputy is pointing to.  For example, the Deputy&rsquo;s area of community healthcare organisation, CHO 7, would have had a huge population increase and some very specific deprivation-related increase need that resulted in increased allocation for mental health services in CHO 7.  We have done that over a number of years since 2015.  Where we receive new funding, we try to orient it towards what we know is imbalance in relation to population-based available services.  We try to raise all boats to the same level where we can and account for anomalies.  That has resulted in some particular additional funding for CHO 7 services within the available overall allocation that comes to us annually.</p></speech>

On the issue he started on of profiling, there is enormous work going on around profiling the demographics of each region so that we understand the nature of the care needs.  The thing is that the six regions are rather substantial, so there is work going on at community healthcare network, CHN, level, a more localised level, to understand the specific needs of each locality.  By the end of this summer we will have very comprehensive profiles of all of the regions, not just in terms of population demographics, but we are also looking at the health and social care staff across each region.  In addition, there are colleagues looking at the infrastructure and facilities in each region.  They will be completed towards the end of the summer and in quarter 3 we will make them publicly available.  I think we probably need a web resource perhaps with a bit of mapping going on.  That might be helpful alongside publications.  They are essential across the various work streams that are going on to support regional health areas, RHAs.  Ms Treleaven explained how important it would be for allocation of finances in a fair way.  The Deputy can see from what Ms O&rsquo;Neill said that we have experience in handling things such as rurality and deprivation.  We will borrow from other Departments where they have invested huge expertise in those areas.  It is a big part of our work and we look forward to sharing it as we progress.  Quarter 3 will definitely have all of these in the public domain.</p></speech>

It has a bearing on everything else.</p> <p>  I am not a critic of the health services.  As Mr. Reid stated, the way we deal with issues at this level has a bearing on the general picture of what the public can expect.  I have always been a supporter of the health services, but they need to be the best.  There is no use in having a half-hearted system that only works some of the time and where things go wrong and reflect poorly on the quality of the health services.  Many people are trying hard to make this work.  We need to ensure, and be assured at all times, that it is working.</p></speech>

We met Mr. Reid and others of the HSE's management on Monday.  Has any decision been made by the HSE to close the ICU and high-dependency unit, HDU, beds at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan?  Has any decision been made on closing the emergency department there?  Is Mr. Reid conscious of the concerns of the people of Navan and Meath more widely due to mixed messaging from the Minister and the HSE?  According to a briefing note we received on Monday, the final stages of stepping down will commence on 30 June.  Is that still going ahead or is it on hold?</p></speech>

We are working through what we need to address from the concerns that were raised on Monday by Oireachtas Members as well as the concerns raised by the Government.  To be clear, what is being done at Navan hospital is not a closing down of any aspect.  Rather, it is a realignment of the services and strengthening of many of their elements, particularly those where patient safety issues have been highlighted to us.  The Deputy attended the briefing.  The chief clinical officer of the HSE, the clinical lead for acute services nationally and the anaesthetists, physicians and surgeons at the local hospital have highlighted to us their concerns about patient safety.  As CEO of the HSE, I cannot ignore the risks that have been raised with us.  I have to implement mitigations to address them.  They are significant risks.  For example, there is no local emergency department governance or acute surgical service on site at Navan and it is not an accredited hospital for recruiting individuals with those skills.  We have to realign the services so that they provide the best safety and protect people's lives.</p> <p>  Regarding timelines, we are working on what steps need to be taken next.  We are working with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital on what capacity we will need to provide there.  I cannot give a definitive timeline for when that will be finished, but these are the actions we are taking now.</p> <p>  We fully respect the role of Oireachtas Members and the Government, and we will address the Government's concerns in the process, but I cannot walk away from the very real clinical risks that have been raised by consultants, clinicians and medical professionals.  I cannot compromise on those risks; I have to mitigate them.  We will work to a plan to address them.  I cannot give a timeframe for when it will all be done, but we expect it to be a number of weeks.  In that process, we will address everyone's concerns, including those raised by the Government and Members.</p></speech>

Regarding capacity at Drogheda, what will happen in terms of waiting times if a patient does not have a GP referral?  It already has thousands of self-admitted patients.  Was any consideration given to making Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, a fully functioning model 3 hospital?  Would that have been an option?  Was any consideration given to investing in the hospital and enhancing its existing services?  It was only ten years ago we were discussing building a new regional hospital in Navan.  If it was a good place for a regional hospital then, why is it not a good place to upgrade existing services now?</p></speech>

Navan hospital has 62 medical beds.  Any other model 3 or model 4 hospital has a minimum of 200 or 250 beds.  It is not an option to build Navan's number up.  While we all accept Meath has become more populated and that certain parts of the county are growing, many specialties do not exist in Navan &ndash; nephrology, neurology, infectious diseases and sufficient ICU cover.  The Deputy will know from the meeting that all of the emergency department consultant and ICU consultant cover is currently provided by Drogheda.  Navan hospital is not accredited by any of the colleges for training, so it is not an option to put trainees there.</p> <p>  It is not sustainable or safe to try to deliver every healthcare service everywhere.  Were we to have done that with the cancer control programme years ago, we would not have the cancer outcomes we have today.  This change will be difficult.</p> <p>  There has been significant investment in Navan.  We have put in place additional theatres and radiology services.  We are continuing to invest.  The integrated care teams we have been discussing at this meeting are working with Navan hospital.  We have put in place 84 beds at Our Lady of Lourdes in recognition of the need coming from Navan.  Forty of those beds were to compensate for the growing activity in the Drogheda area and 44 were to compensate for the reduction in admissions to Navan.  Something else the Deputy will know from Monday is that, in recognition of the growing demographics, we are putting in place a further ten medical beds in Drogheda.  The Deputy heard from the CEO of the RCSI Hospitals Group on Monday that he believed this was sufficient to compensate for any additional admissions through Drogheda's emergency department.  We are also putting in place two additional ICU beds and additional ambulance resources, all of which has been agreed and is in train.</p> <p>  Significant and detailed consideration has been given to the demands that will arise as a result of this change.  This is in the interests of people's health and lives.  On the basis of what I have just set out, we will not be able to sustain that service at Navan in the way described.</p></speech>

It is about realignment and enhancing quality patient safety.  As Ms O'Connor said, it is about protecting people's lives.  She listed some of the investments in Navan.  Those were not just made over many years but in recent years.  A new laboratory and radiology equipment were put in place in 2019.  There was theatre development in 2020 and 2021.  There is an expanded recovery room, a new day ward-minor procedure room, a new rehabilitation unit and a new psychiatric day hospital, and the extension of the outpatient department has been under development since 2021.  We will continue to invest in Navan hospital.  We will realign.  To set out the scale, approximately five or six patients will need to be transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital per day.</p> <p>  Some of the benefits, which have probably not been communicated well in recent days, include advanced surgical care and supports from the Mater hospital, which will see more surgeries and theatre utilisation at Navan by specialists from the Mater.  It will be a much-strengthened hospital.  I ask the Deputy to examine what has happened with other hospitals.  I acknowledge the political pressures on him, but those hospitals ended up being much safer and more enhanced for the communities they served.</p></speech>

The local injury unit does not require GP referral.  There is a concern about GP referrals to the MAU.  That said, I understand a local GP appeared on LMFM saying she believed this was in the interests of the local people.  There are many hurdles in this for everyone, but it will ultimately be a much stronger local service with the hospital doing what it was designed to do and the investment targeted at that.</p></speech>

Where I live in the north of the county, someone could be waiting 90 minutes for an ambulance.</p><p>If somebody has a heart attack, people there call the ambulance and the fire service because the latter will come in ten to 15 minutes.  That is the kind of service we have in the north of the county.</p><p> Will the HSE come back to Members before this is implemented with a date on which it will happen?  The Minister has said he is not happy and he needs all these assurances.  Will he get such assurances?  Will the HSE come back to us with dates for when this will happen, if it does? </p></speech>

That is the strategy that has been brought forward to us and we will continue to invest resources.  Specifically on this proposal, the National Ambulance Service and management teams have worked with us to put in place the required enhanced National Ambulance Service, including advanced paramedics, to support the investment for this realignment that will happen.</p> <p>  I will of course continue to engage, as will our teams, with the Oireachtas but I will restate that I cannot compromise.  I will not walk away from what I have on my table, and the Department has on its table, which it is working very closely with us on, namely, patient safety risks, patient lives and patient safety.  I will not walk away from that.  I have to progress the actions to strengthen Navan hospital to address some of those major risks we see.  We will come back and continue to engage through the Minister and the process but we cannot walk away, and I will not walk away, from what has to be done in that regard.</p></speech>

A number of committee members were contacted by, for example, Thrombosis Ireland representatives who raised the issue of people on anticoagulants.  They said 700 people are using self-test monitors, while almost 250,000 people throughout the State use warfarin.  The point they made was that quality of life would be improved and enhanced greatly, and future complications could potentially be avoided, with a minor enough outlay for self-testing in the same manner as people with diabetes.  The question they asked was whether there were any plans to increase the availability and use of CoaguChek meters and self-test strips for people who are on this drug.</p> <p>  This also raises another question relating to regionalisation.  Who makes a decision on that?  Could a region make a decision as regards a new technology or whatever?  Will there still be a centralised approach to that?  I am asking the question in general but, specifically on this issue, it seems a logical approach.  We are all aware of how this form of testing works for people with diabetes.  It seems a logical step forward to use these self-monitoring strips and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.883" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#P00400"><p>There was significant growth in respiratory self-monitoring in people's homes and in hospitals using digital solutions during the Covid pandemic.  There has been some growth in such monitoring.  In the area the Deputy referred to, clinical leads will often bring forward such technologies as potential care improvements.  Stroke and blood pressure monitoring, and monitoring in the area of coagulation the Deputy talked about, can come through a national clinical process.  It can come through cardiology, stroke leads nationally and local units, where there are clinical leaders. There are already some examples of that happening within the community.  As self-monitoring devices improve and are clinically acceptable in what they do, that can roll out further.</p> <p>  Some of that is happening within the primary care chronic condition management approach right now.  The effect of it is to allow people maintain lower levels of acuity or increased wellness, reduce the need for hospital beds and better service in the community.  That is happening.  Can it happen further?  Yes, it can.  Technology is developing all the time that is doing so.</p></speech>

It is 700 people when 250,000 use warfarin.  I am just teasing out the logic of it.  It would make sense on a preventative basis that the HSE would try to roll that out to that community.  Are there any plans to do that?</p></speech>

I will send the Chairman something specifically on cardiology.  He talked about warfarin and anticoagulant drugs.  We can send him a report specifically on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.886" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#P00700"><p>One of the worries I have, and we touched on it earlier, relates to the pilot programmes being put in place in different areas.  We rarely ever hear about the successful ones.  Scans in nursing homes were mentioned.  Some people are worried about regionalisation, going back to the old heath boards structure, and everyone working in silos apart from each other.  That is why I am concerned about where the decisions are made.</p> <p>  A number of programmes and projects are in place.  I will mention some of them because it is important we put a little balance into this morning's debate.  A number of projects and programmes have been used and tested as regards safety and effectiveness in reorienting acute care away from emergency departments, EDs.  I am aware of a couple of them.  The community paramedicine project is in operation in the Border region, where community paramedics provide care to ensure unnecessary ambulance journeys to EDs are reduced.  Apparently, research there has shown that 85% of all patients served did not have to go to an ED.  That is a major section of the patient group.</p> <p>  The pathfinder project is another.  It covers Beaumont Hospital in north County Dublin, which sees advanced paramedics, physical therapists and occupational therapists attend older, low acuity 999 callers in their homes to ensure they do not have to be transported to Beaumont accident and emergency.  In other cases, I am aware of paramedics calling to older people, where people are informed their mother or father would be better off staying at home.  Paramedics do that test.  A study of that project found that of 527 callers, 69% were supported to remain home and kept out of the ED.</p> <p>  The last project is the emergency department in the home service.  St. Vincent's University Hospital ambulance service allows patients referred to it by a GP or through a 999 call from a nursing home to be assessed by an ED doctor and an occupational therapist at home.  According to that project's figures, of 3,137 patients treated over the course of eight months in 2020, 2,909 remained in their homes, saving the hospital a massive 7.9 years of bed days.  That saves millions and creates capacity and efficient pathways of care.</p> <p>  What is the HSE view of these programmes?  We have heard about some of them this morning.  These programmes appear to be successful.  What plans are there to roll out those services?  We have regionalisation.  These are issues coming from different areas, including hospitals and whatever else.  How are these programmes rolled out, duplicated and made common practice?  One of the very important areas we do not focus enough on are the things we get right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.887" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#P00800"><p>I welcome the Chairman's comments about trying to bring some balance into it.  He is right there are great innovations, pilots and some further roll-outs throughout the country.  Some of them have been supported by the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund, which we have not spoken about today, where we pilot a number of initiatives and then, based on evaluation of their success, roll them out throughout the country.  It is difficult to get public interest through the media in some of these successes but they are there.  Of the ones the Deputy referenced, for example, the pathfinder project in place in Beaumont Hospital, there is an equivalent in St. Vincent's University Hospital and Mr. Canavan will start rolling out pathfinder in Galway.  They really do work.  We are trying to shift our investment and care because it is about hospital avoidance.</p> <p>  How we see that continue to happen is through our increased focus on enhanced community care.  A range of initiatives come under the umbrella of such care.  Yes, we will have to keep investing in our acute hospital services but we need a parallel stream to invest in community services, many of which the Deputy listed, including the one I mentioned earlier in respect of nursing homes.  Scanning equipment in nursing homes is the way to go.</p><p>We have to shift our services on an annual basis.  We cannot do it all together.</p></speech>

A similar piece of work has been done in Cork where there is up to 70% non-admission to hospital.  There are very successful pilots and we are reviewing and investing where we see they are working.  Community intervention teams are also expanding.  As part of our unscheduled care planning, which you can think about as protecting the front door of the ED, those sort of programmes are working well and, as part of our proposals for planning further over three years and for next year's estimate, we will go further with some of those.  I think they are already rolling out seven more sites within the resources we have this year.  We see those as essential to supporting care at or close to home, as Ms Crehan-Roche said.</p></speech>

They have been mainstreamed through HSE funding.  Another pot of money will similarly encourage integration of innovative projects to the tune of &euro;11 million.  Overall, the 123 projects from last year resulted in 15,000 reduced referrals, 18,000 acute bed days avoided and 8,200 patients off waiting lists.  There is a report, with which we can furnish the committee, with further details on that.</p></speech>

What is the timescale of these if something is working?  I remember making reference to a hospital I know where people in their late 70s were presenting with cocaine at the weekends.  This was a recurring thing.  The hospital came up with an initiative whereby they put someone in who was working with the local drug services.  It gave people who were clearly in addiction a pathway.  It is common sense but had not been done up to then.  I am not aware if that was rolled out anywhere else.  The frustration that everyone has is we do not hear the positive things happening in the health service but constantly hear the negative.  If something works, what is the timescale for pilots like this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.893" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#Q00600"><p>The resources that go in are a recurring requirement where they are working, so they are invested in for the medium term.  In terms of roll-out and expansion, the last two to three years have seen quite significant growth in community intervention teams, pathfinder and other initiatives.  Community paramedics, which the Chair mentioned, have a lot of capacity based on a review of what has happened in the north east of the country.  Sometimes that presents us with regulatory issues.  We may need to look at the role of practitioners in the community single-handed and that is happening alongside the potential expansion of community paramedics.</p> <p>  "Pilot" is a dangerous word in our environment.   "First instance" or "pioneering initiative" is better because pilots can crash and burn.  The Chair may be obliquely referring to that.  Where we see it working, we need to amplify it as quickly as we can.  Often local leadership, both clinical and managerial, is pushing these and they are promoted and driven in that way.  We evaluate and look across when we do our service plan to any area or areas where we can grow and encourage more.  The limiting factors are that many of these are therapy and clinical grades of staff and we have to recruit in to them, so that takes a bit of time, and having available resources.  We have significant resource to expand this year.</p></speech>

With all the projects I referenced and a number that are being discussed by HSE colleagues, they are in test for a year but are not put into that test unless there is a pathway for getting them into the Estimates cycle for the following year if they are deemed successful.  It is run for one year, with year 2 Estimates seeking mainstream funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.895" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#Q00800"><p>The key to this is the regionalisation of staff, resources, investment and services.  An audiology unit in Tallaght hospital, for instance, covers Wicklow and Kildare.  If you are living in Wicklow town and your child needs to get tested, Tallaght is not local, as such.  You could be waiting up to two years to get that child tested.  The resources needs to follow.  It is part of the challenge of regionalisation.  We are aware of the challenges in getting staff in particular areas.  We touched on that in relation to expert staff in Navan.  If we do not have all those pieces, regionalisation will not work.  That is the big worry people have.  We are changing things because they are not working but are we going to go back to the old health board stuff, which I am old enough to remember?  Some people look back on them fondly but most of us remember that they did not work.  Is this a poor replica of that?</p></speech>

Implementing regions to support and encourage that under a single budget and single management will help.  Some of the thinking that is national, particularly clinical leadership, can have a big influence across the country quickly and that is important.  It is important to maintain that for certain things but to encourage local initiatives.  The RHAs will do that.  That will be a major benefit of regionalisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.897" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022061500002#Q01000"><p>We should take up the offer that Mr. Watt made earlier of having a workshop on regionalisation with Mr. Woods, his team and the people who will be involved in that.  We can look at drilling down into some of these issues.  That would be useful, outside of a committee session in which is more difficult to tease out all of the issues.</p> <p>  I will ask a few questions to Mr. Reid on waiting lists and presentation of them, capture of data and reducing waiting lists.  At the moment, the National Treatment Purchase Fund only publishes acute waiting lists.  We have to go through parliamentary questions to get access to data on diagnostic waiting lists and CHO waiting lists.  Given that we will have an alignment of areas in acute hospitals, can it be looked at that we have better capture of that data rather than having to go through parliamentary questions?  Some of Mr. Reid's staff can be critical of us putting in too many parliamentary questions.  It would be better if we had access to information.  The NTPF data, when it is presented every couple of weeks, is very useful.  It shows what is going up and down and what is working and not working.  We do not have the same data for diagnostics and community.  Can that be looked at?</p> <p>  I got a parliamentary question response yesterday on the validation of acute hospital waiting lists, as opposed to people who are treated or seen.  I was not able to get the response on diagnostics or community because it is not captured but we were able to get the information on acute hospital waiting lists.  As far as I can see, 80,000 people were removed from the hospital waiting lists last year as a process of validation.  So far this year it is just over 30,000, if I am right.  I do not oppose that because the system needs to be brought up to date.  If there is a validation process that makes it more fit for purpose and we have real data, that is important.  However, in the presentation of the data, it is important we can see what is happening, who is being treated and seen and who is removed as a consequence of a validation.  We need to watch how we do that.  My understanding is letters are issued to patients as to whether or not they are still in need of healthcare.  However, sometimes people move addresses, there can be issues or complications where people do not respond to a letter and are then taken off a list.  We see it in housing and it becomes a particular challenge, as I am sure the Chair and other members of the committee will be aware.  I would not want to see it happen in healthcare unnecessarily that people fall off the list.  Can Mr. Reid confirm those figures on the validation process?</p><p>Also, can he answer the question as to whether it is something that can be improved upon in terms of the presentation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund figures, both in terms of community diagnostics and validation versus patients seen, because the more information we have the better for all of us?</p></speech>

Much of it is made available through the reports from the NTPF and we should look at that.  It is in everybody's interests that the data we have on this significant matter of public interest is put out there.  The Deputy should not have to be asking parliamentary questions of us.  It is time-consuming for the Deputies and for us.  This is not a complaint, because Deputies have the right to ask whatever they wish, but we got 15,000 parliamentary questions last year.  It is tying up a great deal of resources of staff who could be doing legislation, policy work and all the other things, which they want to do and which add more value.  Absolutely, we can look back at the Deputy's requests.  If that information is available now, what we should do is agree to put it up every week or every second week - whatever is practical - so that the Deputy could access the data.  That is something we can commit to doing.  I will talk to colleagues.</p> <p>  Mr. Reid may wish to answer some of the specific questions.  The numbers the Deputy quotes seem to be correct but Mr. Reid can confirm them.</p></speech>

We have what we call a high-performance visual platform, which, in essence, is a system and database that allows us to drill down at a better level - at a hospital level, at a consultant level and at a specialist level - around what is waiting, what is active and what was done last week.  There are a smaller number of hospitals for which we have to finalise the data to be able to put that up but we are getting to a much better place, even of the current data we have, to get better information on it.  Obviously, we want to publicly share that.</p> <p>  Within the current waiting lists, even as they are produced by the NTPF, there are some people who have received an appointment for the next six weeks.  In essence, they are not waiting.  They are on a list and they have an appointment.  There are some people who are attending a second appointment as part of their consultancy and they are in the service.  There are some people who are not available.  Even when one gets the big figure of approximately 800,000, when one drills down there are approximately 90,000 who are in those three categories.  There is the active waiting list and then one looks after that.</p> <p>  On the Deputies third question around community service waiting lists, that is a real issue for us, first of all, in capturing it because we do not have any level of equivalence on our community side of systems.  My understanding - Ms O'Connor could help qualify it - is even in what we have there is a legislative requirement for the NTPF to be able to publish community lists.  That is something that is needed in legislation.</p></speech>

It is not that we do not get them.  I understand that there is a better system of capturing data for acute hospitals.  I agree with Mr. Reid that how it is categorised could be a bit better as well, by the way, even from the HSE's perspective, to show when services are working better as opposed to that overall figure that people can see.  It is in everyone's interest that the data is presented in the best format possible.</p> <p>  There is data on community waiting lists.  We get them every month, but we have to go looking for them.  It is the same with diagnostics.  All I am saying is that whatever the data is, as imperfect as it might be, they should at least publish it.</p></speech>

In terms of the reporting that we ourselves have in place, it would be good to be able to capture it.  Initially, we had thought it would necessitate a change to the statutory instrument but I believe that is not the case.  There is a more substantial change required for the NTPF to be able to include community data but none of us would have an issue with that.  It would be good to standardise it.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor stated that there would be more detail available later in the year but if he could get me those headings, I would appreciate it.</p> <p>  On the question of elective hospitals, the Sl&aacute;intecare committee learned from the experience in National Health Service, NHS, Scotland and that is why we made that recommendation.  What had happened in Scotland was that NHS Scotland had bought a private hospital and used it as an elective hospital and then went on to build a second one.  I am wondering has any consideration been given to purchasing an existing private hospital.</p></speech>

I would agree with that but more than anything, the Government needs to give confidence to healthcare workers that it is serious about reform.  There are still big question marks about that.  Part of giving confidence is that there is a sense of urgency about recruitment.  It is all very well having reform programmes set down on paper but it will not happen unless we have the staff available to us and staying in this country.  That is why it is hard to understand that there has been such an inordinate delay in the consultant contract discussions.  We talked about this previously and Mr. Watt stated that there was not an intention to appoint a replacement chair.  I could not understand what that was about.  It is six months since there was a chair in place.  What exactly is happening about the consultant contract negotiations and when are they expected to get back up and running?</p></speech>

We have a chair appointed now.  There have been numerous engagements with representative bodies of an informal nature to discuss some of the issues and to understand that there is a basis for a more formal engagement, and we are hoping that this will start next week.  As I mentioned earlier, we are hoping to do this quickly but, as ever, it requires us to reach an agreement and the parties have different views on many questions.  We are hoping to do this before the summer and to finalise it before the summer because it has gone on too long.</p></speech>

There has been a loss of six months.  The six months' delay has been regrettable.  The health service will not work unless we have enough doctors and other staff in it.  I cannot understand why there was not an urgency about that.  What kind of timescale would the Department be working to with the new chair?</p></speech>

Mr. Reid seems to be making excuses about why people are going away.  There is an important piece of research that was done by Dr. Niamh Humphries on the exact reasons we cannot hold on to hospital doctors.  It is very informative.  I understand the Minister heard a presentation on it recently.  I do not know whether Mr. Reid has, but it is important that it would inform action in relation to the threatened strike.</p></speech>

In Q3, as part of that development of the implementation plan, there will be proposals around population weightings that will be most suitable and justifications around that.

It is a quite significant gap because legal deposit legislation only extends to physical materials.  It means that the published output of the nation online, which is where an enormous amount of our publishing is happening, is only being collected by us on a selective basis.  We have to do a lot of work to identify all the websites we might want to collect in a given year and then we have to approach all the website owners to ask them for permission to collect their work and there is a limit in terms of budget and resources to how many of those we can collect.  Once the legislation extends to digital materials we would then be able to do a complete domain crawl, we would collect all the websites in one go every year and then we would have everything.  Over the years then there would be quite a lot of work to do to figure out how we share that and do it in such a way that it does not interfere with proprietary or commercial rights.  As the Deputy can imagine, it is a huge gap.  Inside a year 50% of all websites are either changed completely or gone so if the National Library of Ireland does not collect them then the chances are they will be gone.</p></speech>

T&aacute; aithne agam ar leaid at&aacute; ina ch&oacute;na&iacute; in Inis a bh&iacute; ag obair ar <i>Moon Knight</i>.  T&aacute; tallann iontach le f&aacute;il anseo agus t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuilimid ag coth&uacute; na cruthaitheoir&iacute; anseo chun saothair ar n&oacute;s <i>Dog Man</i>, <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, <i>Phoebe and Her Unicorn</i>, agus <i>Bunny Vs. Monkey</i>a chuir ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge do dhaoine &oacute;ga.  As sin, b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeimid &aacute;balta greann&aacute;in a shindeac&aacute;iti&uacute; le haghaidh irisleabhair, nuacht&aacute;in, foilsitheoir&iacute; &uacute;rsc&eacute;alta grafacha n&oacute; iris&iacute; digiteacha i dteangacha eile.<br/><br/>T&aacute; orainn n&iacute;os m&oacute; ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge agus litearthacht chur chun cinn.  T&aacute; orainn ruda&iacute; a chruth&uacute; go minic tr&iacute;d irisleabhar n&oacute; &aacute;iteanna eile.  T&aacute; leabhair t&aacute;bhachtach agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeimid in ann baili&uacute;ch&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh den saothar i ndeireadh bliana.  &Uacute;s&aacute;ideann <i>Garfield</i>, <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, <i>Big Nate</i>, <i>Phoebe and Her Unicorn</i>, <i>Asterix</i>, <i>The Smurfs</i>agus roinnt greann&aacute;n eile an rogha seo.  M&aacute; bh&iacute;onn daoine ar a bhf&oacute;n go minic, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh go mbeadh g&aacute; le greann&aacute;in nua ar n&oacute;s Webtoons agus Tapas, aipeanna a l&eacute;ann daoine greann&aacute;in ar an bhf&oacute;n n&oacute; ar an t&aacute;ibl&eacute;ad.  Crutha&iacute;tear greann&aacute;in le dearadh tarraingteach orthu.  B&iacute;onn l&eacute;itheoir&iacute; ag scrollaigh s&iacute;os tr&iacute; sc&eacute;alta chun iad a l&eacute;amh.

Is do theaghlaigh, do dhaoine &oacute;ga, &aacute;bhair spraoi agus a leith&eacute;id&iacute; na h&aacute;bhair at&aacute; &aacute; bhfoilsi&uacute; againn.  Chomh maith leis sin, foils&iacute;mid cluich&iacute;.  Labhair an t-ionada&iacute; &oacute;n Leabharlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta faoi leabhair agus foilseach&aacute;in.  Labhair Aidan Courtney faoi grafaic agus coimic&iacute;.  Is i mbosca&iacute; seachas i bhfoirm leabhair a thagann cuid mhaith den stuif a dh&eacute;anaimid.  D&eacute;anaimid cluich&iacute; bunaithe ar &uacute;s&aacute;id fhocail, ar n&oacute;s Dingbats agus Puzzle as Gaeilge.  Le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas, thosaigh muid ag obair as Gaeilge ar na hainmneacha m&oacute;ra idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta cos&uacute;il le Scrabble, Cluedo agus Monopoly.  Rinneamar na cluich&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la sin faoi chead&uacute;nas &oacute; na h&uacute;in&eacute;ir&iacute;.  T&aacute; siad d&eacute;anta ar ardchaighde&aacute;n.

Thart ar 13 bhliain &oacute; shin nuair a bh&iacute;omar ag pl&eacute; le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; phobal ar fud fad na t&iacute;re ag iarraidh iad a spreagadh, mar is &eacute; an r&oacute;l at&aacute; ag Gl&oacute;r na nGael n&aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a spreagadh, thugamar faoi deara agus d&uacute;radh linn gan leithsc&eacute;al go raibh f&iacute;or-easpa &aacute;iseanna ann.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s a bp&aacute;ist&iacute; a thabhairt ar scoil ar maidin ach nuair a thiocfadh na p&aacute;ist&iacute; abhaile &oacute;n scoil tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na, is f&iacute;orbheag a bh&iacute; ar f&aacute;il ann d&oacute;ibh le spraoi a dh&eacute;anamh.  Nuair a chr&iacute;ochna&iacute;onn d&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; an scoil, ar&iacute;s, is &iacute; easpa spraoi agus an rud neamhfhoirmi&uacute;la seo a bh&iacute;onn ann.  Nuair a &eacute;ir&iacute;onn siad n&iacute;os sine, mar at&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in anois, is f&iacute;orbheag a bh&iacute;onn acu leis na tr&aacute;thn&oacute;nta agus na ho&iacute;cheanta a chuir isteach.</p> <p>  Don duine a phiocann nuacht&aacute;n suas ar maidin agus at&aacute; in ann crosfhocal a dh&eacute;anamh, seachas an nuacht&aacute;n seachtaini&uacute;il Gaeilge a fhoils&iacute;tear, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir leo &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh ar bhonn laeth&uacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Thosaigh Gl&oacute;r na nGael ag foilsi&uacute; leabhair chrosfhocail.  T&aacute; stair agam chuige sin.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh crosfhocail le breis agus 40 bliain, an chuid is m&oacute; acu tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; roinnt leabhar ar chrosfhocail foilsithe ag Gl&oacute;r na nGael.  Is fi&uacute; breathn&uacute; ar an gcine&aacute;l st&iacute;l a bh&iacute; i gceist againn.  Taobh istigh de leabhar amh&aacute;in, bh&iacute; cuardach focal againn leis na leideanna i bhfoirm phicti&uacute;ir a bh&iacute; ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar aois n&iacute;os &oacute;ige.</p><p>Ar an leathanach idir na cinn sin bh&iacute; crosfhocal ann do dhaoine f&aacute;sta.  Ar&iacute;s, bh&iacute; picti&uacute;ir ann ionas gur f&eacute;idir leis an fhoghlaimeoir f&aacute;sta leideanna n&oacute; nodanna a fh&aacute;il.  <i>Nodanna Don Eolach</i>an t-ainm a bh&iacute; ar an leabhar.

Is rud t&aacute;naisteach air sin &eacute; an fhoghlaim.  N&iacute;ltear ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an fhoghlaim.  Cuirfidh m&eacute; paca eile timpeall.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; mar an gc&eacute;anna.  T&aacute; tr&iacute; leagan &eacute;ags&uacute;il den rud seo ann.  Bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh teacht ar chluich&iacute; a bh&iacute; d&uacute;chasach agus &Eacute;ireannach ach gan a bheith ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an teanga mar an hook.  Bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a bhaint as cluiche Gaeilge ionas go mbeadh na daoine a bheadh ag imirt agus ag gabh&aacute;il p&aacute;irt sna cluich&iacute; ag foghlaim ach gan a bheith ag su&iacute; s&iacute;os chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Bheadh siad ag imirt na cluich&iacute; seo mar chuid den spraoi f&eacute;in, mar an gc&eacute;anna leis na crosfhocail agus leith&eacute;id&iacute; sin.<br/><br/>C&eacute;n cine&aacute;l forbairt air seo at&aacute; d&eacute;anta againn thar na blianta?  Le 13 bliain anuas, bh&iacute; sprioc againn a bheith &aacute;balta thart ar dh&aacute; &aacute;is, chluiche n&oacute; leabhar crosfhocal a thabhairt amach gach bliain.  Bh&iacute; blianta ann ina raibh s&eacute; an-deacair teacht suas leis na suimeanna airgid a bh&iacute; de dh&iacute;th, go h&aacute;irithe leis na cluich&iacute; m&oacute;ra leith&eacute;id&iacute; Monopoly, Scrabble agus Cluedo.  Chuir muid amach tr&iacute; leibh&eacute;al Scrabble.  Chuir muid amach Scrabble Junior, mar a dtugtar air i mB&eacute;arla.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; an-&oacute;ga.  Bh&iacute; ceann do dhaoine &oacute;ga agus an ceann clasaiceach a bhfeictear sa bhosca glas freisin.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le daoine dul isteach agus a r&aacute; go bhfuil siad chun cluiche ar leith a fhoilsi&uacute; gan acmhainn&iacute; a bheith acu leis an chead&uacute;nas a fh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; an cead&uacute;nas f&eacute;in an-chostasach.

Tuigimid an cheist sin.  T&aacute; an-leisce ag na comhlachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra 500 earra a th&aacute;irgeadh.  T&aacute;im ag caint faoin dreaded minimum order quantity, MOQ, a thagann ar ais chugat i gc&oacute;na&iacute; nuair at&aacute; t&uacute; ag iarraidh rud mar seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh &iacute;osmh&eacute;id de 3,000, 5,000 n&oacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute;.  Crutha&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin d&uacute;shl&aacute;n iontach m&oacute;r eile d'fhoilsitheoir&iacute; cos&uacute;il le Gl&oacute;r na nGael n&oacute; Cluiche.ie.

Uaireanta b&iacute;onn ort iad a st&oacute;r&aacute;il f&aacute; choinne tr&iacute;, ceithre n&oacute; c&uacute;ig bliana.  T&aacute; costas m&oacute;r leis sin.  Caithfidh siad a bheith st&oacute;r&aacute;ilte in &aacute;it at&aacute; s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte, sl&aacute;n agus tirim.  Chomh maith leis sin, caithfear a bheith foighneach toisc nach rachaidh na cluich&iacute; ar fad amach sa ch&eacute;ad bhliain tar &eacute;is a bhfoilsi&uacute;.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, n&iacute;l t&uacute; ag iarraidh ord&uacute; f&aacute; choinne 100 c&oacute;ip de chluiche a chur isteach a chosn&oacute;idh &euro;50 in aghaidh na c&oacute;ipe agus nach mbeidh custaim&eacute;ir ar bith &aacute;balta &iacute;oc as sin.

The field of Irish language publishing consists of a few small but active publishing houses.  Since Dalen joined these creative ranks in 2014, we have continually developed a range of works to delight and entertain a wide range of audiences and consumers.  Our own creative ecosystem focuses on developing exciting works of an international nature for the Irish language reader, concentrating on the quality of content and delivery, repackaging works for the benefit of audiences and working in fruitful partnerships with established and new artists and cultural organisations.</p> <p>  The nature of the small language environment in which we operate means we are, to a great degree, values led rather than finance driven.  While we acknowledge the commercial value of the skills, work and effort our commissions and titles entail, we are also aware the imperative is often a desire and willingness to make works happen, to create excellent interactions for audiences and to expect high-quality material in the Irish language because second best is not good enough.  Although to a great degree publicly funded, our works are produced within trade frameworks with professional rates of remuneration, commercial fees, contracts and costs.  Consequently, it is imperative our approach to works is commensurate with publishing industry standards.</p> <p>  As one of the few publishing houses regularly sourcing content and material from European markets, ours is a unique contribution to the Irish language publishing ecosystem, delivering such material in the language to consumers and bringing internationally acclaimed series to the Irish language market, which in turn raises the profile and perception of the language at home and abroad.  In bringing content from foreign cultures and markets, our role as repackagers and creators of this content in Irish is to use language, imagination and critical analysis to transform new and unfamiliar narratives into material that is culturally relevant to our audiences and which can be enjoyed and appreciated by them.  In this respect our texts can contribute to discourse and opinion surrounding linguistic and cultural perception and value, cultural self-identity and appreciation within an international context, and shaping literary, linguistic and cultural behaviour about the positioning of the Irish language and its sense of place within national and international contexts.</p><p> Our work brings together a group of new and experienced Irish language writers, translators and editors, giving them an opportunity to work on high-quality material in under-represented genres.  All of our titles require extensive consideration and revision to present the most creative and inventive Irish texts possible.  Literary translation is much more than transliteration of words from one language to another.  It is about reflecting the nuance of dialogue; introducing relevant, natural and original humour; cultural relevance and appropriation where justified; and creating text that can stand as proud as any other piece of original work.  Dalen has demonstrated its ability to achieve this within the works which now have a respected place in the Irish literary landscape.</p><p> At the core of our ambition is the aim of creating reading material that is attractive to those who may otherwise ignore literature, and Irish language literature in particular, appealing to sometimes underserved audiences, in particular teenagers and young adults, with a degree of emphasis on literarily and linguistically reluctant males.  Each of our titles has its own literary merit for its intended audience, ranging from the classically notable to the contemporarily trashy, from clever artistry and storytelling to engaging pseudo-history and unabashed mass audience entertainment.  The stories we bring to our audiences are selected for their discerned quality, potential attractiveness to readers, and unique potential in the Irish language book market.</p></speech>

B'fh&eacute;idir gur sin ceann de na molta&iacute; gur f&eacute;idir teacht as an gcoiste seo, gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an c&oacute;ras beag&aacute;in&iacute;n n&iacute;os fearr &oacute; thaobh d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le gn&eacute;ithe eile den l&eacute;itheoireacht agus den bhfoilsitheoireacht, nach d&iacute;reach gn&aacute;th t&eacute;acsleabhair, &uacute;rsc&eacute;alta n&oacute; a leith&eacute;id ar ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh cl&uacute;daithe ag cl&aacute;r na leabhar Gaeilge amach anseo.</p></speech>

In a way it is natural that a publisher needs to source the right kind of funding for the projects it may have.  If the cl&aacute;r na leabhar Gaeilge is concentrating more on original material, then it might not be the right source of funding for us.  Dalen is coming to Irish language publishing from the Welsh perspective, where the market is fairly strong and where there is essentially one funding organisation that assists publishers in so many different ways, from grant funding for publications to games funding and funding of staff in larger publishing houses.  If the Irish ecosystem could find some sort of similar way forward where an umbrella organisation could potentially direct publishers and producers to appropriate kinds of funding, then it might be easier to have a broader picture of what could be produced.  Having said that, the funding Dalen has received in recent years from the Arts Council, the Irish language publishing programme and COGG is extremely generous.  The funding available for what I assume is the right kind of programme and potential titles to be published in Ireland is very generous and goes a long way to help us produce material.</p></speech>

An t&eacute; nach bhfuil l&aacute;idir n&iacute; fol&aacute;ir d&oacute; bheith glic, agus caithfidh muidne teacht ar bheala&iacute; eile le ruda&iacute; a fhoilsi&uacute;.<br/><br/>Mar shampla, nuair a thosaigh an tr&eacute;imhse Covid dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; foireann againn de thart faoi 18 ag an am a bh&iacute; ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar obair phobal fud fad na t&iacute;re.  Beagnach thar o&iacute;che, taobh istigh de sheachtain, bh&iacute; cl&aacute;r oibre ioml&aacute;n nua leagtha amach againne nuair a bh&iacute;omar ag foilsi&uacute; cluich&iacute; ar l&iacute;ne.  Gach maidin bheadh duine &eacute;igin ag d&eacute;anamh acla&iacute;ochta tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus chuireamar liathr&oacute;id ar leith d&oacute;ibh sin a d'fhoilsigh muid.

N&iacute;l a fhios agam an bhfuil 400 rud &eacute;ags&uacute;la a crutha&iacute;odh taobh istigh den ch&eacute;ad s&eacute; mh&iacute; de Covid.

Ba mhaith linne go mbeadh ciste &eacute;igin a thabharfadh an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; riachtanach mar t&aacute;imid ag streachailt in aghaidh m&oacute;rmharga&iacute; B&eacute;arla.

T&uacute;s is a community work placement programme providing short-term working opportunities for unemployed people.  The rural social scheme is aimed at low-income farmers, fishermen and fisherwomen, particularly in rural Ireland.  The objective of the scheme is to provide supplementary income to low-income farmers, fishermen and fisherwomen who would be unable to make an adequate living otherwise.  The community employment, CE, scheme is an active market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with the opportunity to engage in useful work within their local communities on a temporary and fixed-term basis.  The benefits of all of these schemes for participants include stable income, better mental health and well-being and the promotion of safer working practices while also providing multiple benefits in their local communities by supporting voluntary, sporting and community organisations to improve amenities and deliver vital local services.</p> <p>  The final aspect of today's meeting concerns the operation of the carer's allowance.  This could not come at a more opportune time right in the middle of National Carer's Week.  Ireland has more than 500,000 family carers, or one in every three households.  They provide an essential service by allowing older people and people with disabilities to live in their own homes and communities.  While the pandemic has been incredibly difficult for family carers, it has also shown us how vital the care is to protect our most vulnerable citizens.  At present, 115,000 full-time carers in Ireland receive the carer's support grant.  Only 91,000 receive a carer's allowance in some form or other.  We have heard evidence that approximately 6,000 full-time carers who receive the carer's support grant did not qualify for the carer's allowance based on the means test.  Many more are in receipt of a reduced rate of payment due to spousal income.  Members of this committee and Members throughout the Oireachtas in Government and the Opposition are all of the opinion that we must work towards a financial support system for family carers that is designed around the care given and is not dependent on the bank account of the spouse of a full-time carer.  </p> <p>  I thank Deputy Cahill for requesting a meeting of this committee on subjects that forms an important part of our work programme.  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine are very welcome here today.  I welcome senior officials from the Department of Social Protection, namely, Ms Geraldine Hurley, assistant secretary with responsibility for employment services; Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession, assistant secretary; and Mr. Tony Kieran, principal officer, employment programmes.  We have been briefed by departmental officials that employment rates have recovered far faster than expected following the lifting of Covid restrictions, which is a very positive development.  More than 2.5 million people are now in employment.  The seasonally adjusted employment unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8% with just over 172,000 people on the live register at the start of June.  Post Covid, we have moved to a situation where labour supply is tight and some employers are reporting difficulties in recruitment.  I thank members of both joint committees for prioritising this issue on our work programme. I am also thankful for the briefing from the secretariat to members, particularly the briefing from Ms Hayley O'Shea, and the briefing from the Department.  </p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.</p><p>Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I call Ms Hurley to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession and Tony Kieran.  We provided the committee with a copy of this statement in advance of the meeting.  The committee has asked for an update on the operation of the rural social scheme, RSS, and its interaction with community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s and the operation of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.</p> <p>  It might be useful to first set out the current labour market context, which is as summarised by the Chairman.  Employment rates have recovered faster than expected following the lifting of Covid restrictions and over 2.5 million people are now in employment.  The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8%, with just over 172,000 people now on the live register.  Post-Covid, we have moved very quickly to a situation where labour supply is tight and with some employers reporting difficulties in recruitment.  As we continue to recover from Covid, this labour market environment sets the context in which employment schemes and programmes operate.</p> <p>  The Department operates community employment, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s.  There is commonality across all schemes in that they are delivered by the community and voluntary sector to provide placements for the long-term unemployed or, in the case of RSS, underemployed people.  CE and T&uacute;s  serve a dual purpose, first, to provide a stepping stone to employment for people who have had difficulty, over an extended period, in securing full-time employment, and, second, in doing this, to provide services in and for the local community.  There are currently over 19,000 participants on CE and just under 5,000 on T&uacute;s, with a further 2,890 on RSS.</p> <p>  Post-Covid, there are vacancies on schemes, which is posing challenges for some of them.  Recent positive employment trends, with the reduction in unemployment and in the number of long-term unemployed, do impact our schemes, just as they impact employers recruiting in the open labour market.  In many ways, this a positive development but it means there is a smaller pool of candidates, that the candidates who are available are more likely to face significant employment barriers and that, overall, it is more difficult to fill vacant places.</p> <p>  The Department continues to work closely with schemes to fill vacancies and to adapt terms and conditions to the prevailing labour market conditions.  The most recent reforms to the conditions governing the schemes were introduced by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, at the start of the year.  Prior to setting these out, I will briefly explain the three schemes.</p> <p>  As members are aware, CE is a long-standing scheme and was set up in 1994.  Participants gain work experience by providing a range of services of benefit to local communities, with the objective of assisting participants to find employment.  Examples of activities include amenities management, arts and culture, sports, Tidy Towns, meals on wheels, childcare and health-related services.  Currently, those who are unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment can participate in CE.  CE placements are generally between one and three years, with a lifetime maximum of six years.  Since the start of 2022, those who are over 60 years are exempt from these limits and can remain on their scheme until they reach pension age.  The State investment in CE is significant.  The budget for CE in 2022 is &euro;375 million, supporting over 840 schemes countrywide, and this can cover around 22,500 participant places.</p> <p>  The rural social scheme, which was introduced in 2004, is an income support initiative that provides part-time employment opportunities for farmers and fishermen.  Eligibility for participation in RSS largely derives from farm assist, with the farm assist means assessment applying to participants on the scheme.  Participants must continue to be actively farming or fishing.  The total budget in 2022 is significant at &euro;52 million and the scheme, which has sanction for 3,350 places, currently has some vacancies.  The type of work carried out by RSS participants in rural areas includes enhancing the local environment, energy conservation work and providing community care.  The RSS is delivered through local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p> <p>  T&uacute;s is an activation measure that commenced operation in 2011.  It provides one-year, quality work opportunities in the community and voluntary sectors for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  The scheme is delivered by local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Activities include village and countryside enhancement projects, social care and care for the elderly, preschool and after-school services.  The budget for T&uacute;s in 2022 is &euro;112.6 million.  The 2022 budget allocation can cover just under 7,000 participant places.</p> <p>  With regard to the conditions on the schemes, participants on all three schemes are contracted to work 19.5 hours per week and their rate of pay is based on their underlying social welfare payment plus an additional &euro;22.50 per week, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;230.50 per week.  Participants may also receive increases in respect of a qualified adult and child dependants and retain secondary benefits.</p> <p>  As with all other sectors of the economy and society, Covid-19 presented very real challenges for the operation of employment support programmes.  I am aware that many schemes played a key role in supporting communities during this period.  The Department put in place emergency measures to support schemes throughout the pandemic, in particular through extending participant contracts.  This occurred on a number of occasions, initially from March 2020 up to April 2022.  These extensions allowed participants to remain on CE and T&uacute;s schemes much longer than the one, three or six years normally permitted.  This provided schemes with certainty as regards their ability to deliver important local services, while ensuring that participants were able to complete work experience and training programmes impacted by shutdowns.  As with other Covid support measures, these are now being wound down.  Participants with Covid-related extended contracts started to leave schemes from early April 2022.  This will continue on a phased basis over a number of months, well into 2023.</p> <p>  As the economy and society emerged from Covid, it was clear, given the resurgence in open labour market employment, that some schemes were encountering difficulties maintaining services and that this could continue in 2022 and into 2023.  This derived from issues in regard to the filling of vacancies.  As a consequence, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, announced wide-ranging reforms to schemes last December.  These included permitting all persons over 60 years of age to stay on CE and RSS until reaching pension age; ensuring that CE participants whose contract term is coming to an end will be permitted to stay on CE until a replacement is found; and updating the baseline year to 2014 and ensuring time spent on CE before this baseline year does not count towards lifetime limits on CE.</p> <p>  In introducing reforms such as these, a careful balance needs to be maintained between providing employment support measures for the long-term unemployed or underemployed people, on the one hand, and delivering important local services, on the other, and, in doing this, to ensure participants are supported to  progress on to employment, in particular when there are large numbers of unfilled work opportunities available in the open labour market.  The Department is continuing to consider how terms and conditions can be modified to support the delivery of local community services in the current strong labour market environment, and some proposals are currently being considered by the Minister for submission to Government shortly.</p> <p>  The Department holds regular meetings with employment support schemes and their representatives for exchange of views and to work through operational issues.  For example, an operational forum covering all schemes meets three times each year.  The Minister for Social Protection and the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, regularly attend these meetings.  Ministers also visit and engage with schemes throughout the country.  Departmental staff, whether locally through the community development officers or otherwise, work closely with schemes on all aspects of their operation.  Centrally, there are also meetings with various groups and organisations involved on schemes, including the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and Pobal.</p> <p>  I will now address issues in relation to carers.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance is the primary income support through which the Department supports carers.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance is a payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness.  There are currently just under 91,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance.</p><p>This year the estimated expenditure on the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme is more than &euro;990 million.  As part of budget 2022, significant changes were made to the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test.  The capital and savings disregard was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 while the weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse or partner.  These changes came into effect on 2 June and many carers will now be brought into the carer's allowance system for the first time.  Along with the 2020 measure, increasing the number of hours a carer could work from 15 to 18.5 hours per week allows more carers who are in a position to work to have a higher household income.</p><p> As part of budget 2021, the carer&rsquo;s support grant was increased by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  It is automatically paid to recipients of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and domiciliary care allowance.  Carers who are not in receipt of one of these payments may also qualify for the grant.  On 2 June, this grant was paid to some 121,000 carers and their families.  The overall cost of the grant this year is &euro;262 million.</p><p> In conclusion, the Department values the very real contribution all employment schemes make to their communities and to the individual person participating in the schemes.  The Department is very aware of the challenges currently faced by CE, T&uacute;s and RSS.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State are currently examining a further set of proposals to support schemes by further improving the recruitment and referral process, extending eligibility to new cohorts and reducing the level of participant churn on some schemes.  This is with a view to bringing proposals on all three schemes to Government in the near future.  This underlines that the operation of these schemes and their interplay with other social welfare benefits, local communities and the wider labour market is kept under constant review with the aim of ensuring they continue to fulfil their remit and operate to the benefit of all stakeholders even as labour market conditions change.  I thank the Chair.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1057" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#E00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  We are in a completely different place now as regards community schemes.  Employers inform us that it is difficult to get people to fill any vacancies in the hospitality and farming sectors among others.  These schemes still have an important role to play because there are people who will not be able to take their place in the normal working environment of mainstream employment for whatever reasons.  For example, they may not be able for the pressures.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v would be more knowledgeable that I am about the rural social scheme because it was his brainchild.  The six-year rule means that eligibility for the scheme is based on farm income.  If eligibility criteria allow a person to qualify, I cannot understand why this rule is being imposing.  The scheme is working well and has great benefits for rural communities, similar to the CE scheme.  I acknowledge the fact that when people are near pension age they will not be taken off the scheme, which is an improvement.  However, in my constituency for example a young man in his forties is on a rural social scheme.  He is looking after two small villages in his locality, doing maintenance, cutting the grass in the GAA grounds and so forth, which is valuable work for the community.  He now faces the guillotine of being taken off the scheme in about six months.  He will never get a job in mainstream employment.  He is able to keep his farm ticking over with a little supervision and help with the paperwork but he is doing an excellent job in his community.  I urge the Department to review that six-year rule.  When a person continues to meet the criteria for the scheme, I cannot see the logic in having a termination date.  </p> <p>  The six-year rule is also an issue under the CE scheme.  I am told by Tidy Towns committees and GAA committees that they cannot do without their CE workers.  If the schemes are terminated after six years, there will not be replacements in the current employment environment.  This means we have people who are compatible with the scheme and who are not costing the Exchequer any significant amount because the top-up is not economically enticing.  These people are glad to do the work.  It is good for their mental health.  It gets them out of their home environment so that they meet people.  The benefits for the individuals cannot be overstated.  Communities and towns also benefit in different ways such as the tidy towns initiative.  For example the St. Mary's Eliogarty memorial committee in Thurles looks after an old church, started a Famine museum and a commemorative garden that is the envy of many other places.  Without the CE workers, they would not be able to maintain the standards.  That also needs to be looked at in the context of where we are in the employment cycle.  Villages will suffer without the people on CE schemes, of whom just a small percentage will enter mainstream employment.</p> <p>  The T&uacute;s scheme has a 12-month limit.  I met scheme supervisors in my constituency office recently.  For a person to be trained and ready to participate fully in the scheme, a term of 12 months is extremely short.  That should be examined with a view to extending it to two years.  There will be many benefits in that participants will hopefully enter mainstream employment but to expect T&uacute;s to achieve all its objectives for individuals, a 12-month period is too short.  A two-year programme would be more beneficial for the scheme and for participants.</p> <p>  Supervisors on T&uacute;s and rural social schemes believe that their working conditions have not been recognised.  Some improvements have been made for supervisors on CE schemes.  It is imperative that the same is done for the supervisors on T&uacute;s and rural social schemes.  Pension rights, pay and conditions for both schemes must be looked at seriously if we are going to keep these committed people on those schemes. </p> <p>  With regard to the carer's allowance, many farmers look after elderly relatives.  It is difficult for farmers to qualify for the allowance because of the way the hours are compiled.  In reality, a farmer is in and out constantly looking after the elderly person.</p><p>It is not practical for that farmer to try to calculate the number of hours he farms.  He is engaged full time in supervising the care of the elderly person in the house.  Whether he goes out to herd his animals or do other work, he is constantly supervising that person's care.  More sympathy needs to be shown for the calculation of those hours by a farmer who is seeking carer's allowance, given he is 24-7 on site and always available.  He will have to tend his animals and engage in farm activities at certain times of the day, but the reality is he is providing full-time care for that individual.  Recognition must be given to that in the way the hours are compiled in the context of a farmer's eligibility for carer's allowance.  Those are the points I would like to make on the scheme.  It plays an extremely important role for people who, for whatever reason, will never secure mainstream employment.  Some tweaks to it would make it far more suitable for the environment in which we are operating.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1060" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#F00300"><p>I will respond to some of those points and then hand over to my colleague to deal with some of the points on carers.  On the rural social scheme, we are aware of the concerns about the six-year rule.  It was introduced in 2017, so that rule will not start to apply until February of next year.  It will only start to apply to people as they come up to being six years on the scheme.  Therefore, it will not impact everybody in the scheme in February but we are very aware of the concerns.  We are also aware the circumstances in which the rule was introduced in 2017 have changed somewhat compared with now and as we move into 2023.  When that rule was introduced, additional places were assigned to the RSS.  Therefore, there were positive aspects to that reform.</p> <p>  Regarding CE schemes, it is a challenge to fill vacancies on them to ensure services continue to be delivered while making sure schemes are not competing with open labour market employers in the locality who will also want to recruit people, be it people coming to the end of their time on a CE scheme or people who would be eligible to participate in one.  I can assure the Deputy that, currently, if a replacement who would be ready to start cannot be found for a participant departing a scheme because his or her time has expired or his or her extended contract is expiring, the participant on it will not be required to leave it.  It is a challenge in the context of where we are at in the employment cycle and with jobs being available in the open labour market for people who are leaving CE or who, otherwise, are unemployed, including those who are long-term unemployed.  We must be conscious schemes are competing with local employers for participants.</p> <p>  On the 12-month limit applying to a placement on the T&uacute;s scheme, T&uacute;s was designed to be a shorter intervention than CE for people who are that bit more employment ready.  It does not have the same training requirements, but if participants on completion of a T&uacute;s placement still feel they need more support and intervention, they are eligible to move on to a CE scheme.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point concerning supervisors, we very much appreciate the work supervisors on all three schemes do countrywide.  The schemes would not be able to operate in terms of providing support, including training supports, to participants or in the provision of services locally.  Our local community development officers work closely with supervisors in delivering the schemes.  Regarding the differentiation in pay, CE supervisors have additional responsibilities over and above RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors with respect to training and development plans and other work they do.  Historically, that is the reason there was some differentiation in pay.</p> <p>  I think I have answered all the Deputy&rsquo;s points.  I will pass over to my colleague Mr. Hession to deal with the points the Deputy raised about carers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1061" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#F00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  On the carer&rsquo;s point, the carer&rsquo;s allowance payment is an income support for people who are providing full-time care and attention for a person for a period of longer than 12 months.  It is primarily to support those who, because of their caring responsibilities, are not able to make themselves available for employment, which they would otherwise do.  Within that, there is a balance and scope for carers to continue to work either to supplement their income or perhaps for those thinking ahead to when their caring role will stop, who will need to return to employment and who will need to keep that connection with the labour force.  There is a threshold of 18.5 hours' employment per week.  That was changed in budget 2020.  Prior to that, there had been a ten-hour employment limit, and that was increased to 15 hours in 2006.  It had been at that limit for a long time and we heard from carers for many years that limit was too restrictive and needed to be raised.  A few budgets ago the threshold was increased to 18.5 hours.  Last year the means test for the scheme was increased both for a single person and for a couple, where carers worked those extra hours, whether they were engaged in farming or in other employment that did not tip them over the threshold in terms of their means.  With these provisions, it is about striking a balance.  The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>for the carer&rsquo;s payment is to support people providing full-time care and attention for a person and balancing that with a recognition there are legitimate reasons, be it financial, personal or in context of longer term plans, a carer might also need to work.  The 18.5 hour threshold is in place to provide some flexibility around that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1062" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#F00500"><p>I thank all our guests for coming in and for their opening statement.  On the point made in the opening statement about community employment, in the first instance, providing a stepping stone to employment and, second, benefiting communities, that needs to be considered in the context of whether that is what community employment is.  For some, it may be a stepping stone into employment but for others it is not.  That needs to be acknowledged because no two jobseekers are the same and no two people on a CE scheme are the same.  I am not sure community employment should be viewed, to some degree, as a job activation scheme for many of the participants on it.  A number of issues were raised in the opening statement, which can be easily changed.  Little changes can be made to these schemes that will make a big difference.  We need to listen to the participants on schemes as they are best placed to advise us of the issues and, typically, to provide us with solutions to them.</p> <p>  The six-year rule applying to the RSS will be very problematic.  It is only a number of months before it will start to kick in.  It makes no sense to go ahead with the six-year rule.  There are 2,890 participants on the RSS today.  There are 460 vacancies on the scheme because it has a full national quota of 3,350 places.  We know more than 1,400 and just under 1,500 participants will be affected by the six-year rule.  Not only can the places available on the scheme today not be filled but nearly 1,500 participants, almost half the number on the scheme, will be taken off it next year.  That does not make sense.  I appreciate in some budgets additional places are announced and that is great, but additional places are no good when the existing places cannot be filled.  There is no way, not in a million years, the six-year rule should go ahead.</p> <p>  I attended a meeting held by Galway Rural Development in Athenry a few weeks ago.  It had a list of more than 170 organisations in County Galway that cannot get any support from the rural social scheme or T&uacute;s, or they have support but it is not enough, or they are about to lose support.  Some 170 organisations are crying out for support and cannot get it.</p><p>However, we will take 1,500 people out of the scheme next year in that context.  That is just bonkers.  I hope that aspect will be looked at.  I am concerned that the review of the RSS, which is important, and which I understand is, or should be taking place soon, was not referred to.  Mention was made at the end of the opening statement of some changes being considered, but the specific review of the RSS is extremely important.  It needs to be done, completed and finished by the end of this year and ahead of next year.  </p><p> Turning to the community employment scheme, in this context, I remember raising issues concerning vacancies and the number of jobs advertised when that figure reached 1,200 and 1,400.  Online today, more than 3,000 vacant jobs are being advertised in the context of the community employment scheme.  We are again going to take people off the scheme next year because they have done their six years, yet more than 3,000 jobs are advertised that cannot be filled.  This is not an issue that has just emerged on the back of Covid-19, albeit I understand that the pandemic has had an impact.  JobPath has been the greatest threat from day one, as referrals to it continue to increase and the CE and other schemes have suffered as a result.  This has been an issue for quite some time, and it is not new.  Alarm bells should be ringing because some 3,000 jobs are being advertised today.</p><p> Moving on to T&uacute;s, and this has been said already, I do not understand why people must be unemployed for a year before they can get onto this scheme.  A year is a long time to be unemployed.  I do not see why this is the case.  We now have an influx of Ukrainian refugees into communities, and especially into rural communities, across the State and these people can make great contributions to these communities.  Rules such as the one I referred to can make it difficult for these refugees and for others to get onto a scheme.  Why have this barrier there in the first place?  It is important to say as well that, in addition to the undoubted benefits these schemes bring to the communities, the participants themselves benefit too.  It gives people who are on their own a purpose and a reason to get up in the morning.  There are huge mental health benefits.  Again, all of this is why the six-year rule should be removed.</p><p> Regarding the RSS, the witnesses will know that issues have been raised regarding eligibility in this context and the need for this to be widened.  This facet was mentioned, and I hope it is something that will be considered.  The one year allowed on the T&uacute;s scheme is also problematic.  It is particularly the case for people seeking work but who have only one year of work experience.  That is problematic, and the time allowed should be increased to two years.  The witnesses will know that we had representatives involved with the schemes here some weeks ago, and they told us that their funding is reduced at the end of the year if they have not filled their places.  There are, though, obvious difficulties in filling those places.  Therefore, the loss of funding and the reduction in that context is not fair.</p><p> The opening statement referred to the Department holding regular meetings with the representatives of the employment support schemes.  When was the last regular meeting with the representatives of the employment support schemes, which schemes were they and when did that meeting take place?  On this side of things as well, there are also issues concerning pay and pensions.  There are growing tensions among T&uacute;s and RSS supervisors.  They are looking at their pay, which has not been increased in 14 years.  There is also a difference in pay in respect of T&uacute;s, the CE scheme and the RSS, which amounts to about 14% to 15%.  All those issues need to be examined.  The forum was mentioned in the opening statement, and it is welcome, but that has only been re-established and it needs to explore all these aspects.</p><p> On carers, as has been said by Deputy Cahill, the way that applications from farmers seeking carers allowance are processed is bizarre.  Someone behind a computer in the section will determine, based on the number of acres and the number of cattle and other livestock, that an applicant is doing under 18.5 hours.  I am not sure how that figure is calculated.  If we take a typical farmer, his or her land is near his or her home and he or she might be looking after his or her mother.  For someone who is a small farmer, once a day he or she will go out and feed and look after his or her animals.  That is it.  There are of course busier times of year, but I am unsure how this process works in respect of the calculation being made by someone behind a computer and the determination of the 18.5 hours in that context.</p><p> I also hope that the Department has looked at the carers and what three of those family carers had to say when they came before this committee some weeks ago.  I refer to the massive financial pressure they are under and the difficulties they face in accessing carer's allowance.  The means test in that regard needs to be looked at urgently.  Equally, the 18.5-hour rule should not be in place.  If a carer is caring for a loved one, then he or she is caring for a loved one.  Regarding how carers spend their time outside of those hours, I do not think it is fair to say that we will give them a payment that is below the poverty line anyway and that they will then work full time as carers and not do anything else outside the home for longer than 18.5 hours.  I do not think that is right.  It is a stipulation that should be reconsidered, rather than perhaps the idea of increasing these hours further.</p></speech>

Over time, it is very much true to say, the services delivered through those schemes have become increasingly important for the communities in which they are delivered.  The primary objective of the CE scheme, however, remains for it to act as a pathway to help people particularly disadvantaged when seeking employment on that road back to employment.  Over time, different rules have been applied and different adaptations have been made to the CE scheme to help this cohort of long-term unemployed people.  These are the people recognised internationally as facing the most acute problems in the labour market.  Even at times when there are high levels of employment, people in this position can face problems re-entering the labour markets, getting jobs in that open market and moving away from dependency on State supports.  That being said, we fully recognise that these services now being delivered, and that we all see, are extremely important and an important aspect of the CE scheme.  The balance we must maintain in this regard is to ensure that those dual objectives are supported as we move forward, while also ensuring that an eye is kept on overall cost issues in respect of the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Regarding the RSS six-year rule, the numbers of people that will be affected by it, starting in February 2023, are somewhat less than the Deputy mentioned, because, as she is probably aware, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, introduced a change in January 2022 that will remove anybody aged over 60 from the application of that rule.  Therefore, of the 1,400 people who started on the RSS after 2017, this rule will no longer apply to 400 of them.  This does still leave 1,000 people in this position.  Given that there are issues now in filling all the places on the RSS, this rule will pose challenges and we are very much aware of them.  This rule, however, will start to be applied from February 2023.  As I said, though, we are acutely aware of the challenges that will pose to some schemes and it is being kept under review.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the review of the RSS not being referred to.  That review came from an interdepartmental group report produced at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020.  One of the things the report requested was a review of the RSS that would look at the operational responsibility for the scheme and where it would lie.  That review has a wider focus than the six-year rule, but this is work that will commence soon.  Equally, however, it is the case that the environment has changed significantly since that report was produced and since that recommendation was made.  Therefore, we must also look at its relevance in a post-Covid-19, full employment environment in respect of the scope of that review, what aspects we need to examine and the dual balance in the context of schemes.</p> <p>  Turning to the vacancies on the CE schemes, those the Deputy referred to were probably advertised on JobsIreland.ie, and there are many advertisements for CE schemes on that platform now.  I assure Deputy Kerrane again, however, that people will not be required to leave a CE scheme, even when they come to the end of their contract or their extended contract, unless a replacement is in place to ensure that the service delivery aspect of the scheme can continue to be maintained and that the scheme remains viable.  I already mentioned a figure of 600 people who have had their contracts further extended since the beginning of April 2022 and this process will continue.  Additionally, regarding referrals from the Department onto schemes, we are doing a great deal of work there in respect of working with the schemes on how the referral process works, in respect of ensuring that people are referred in an efficient and timely manner, and also on ensuring that this system works for the benefit of the participants on the schemes.  This is being done in conjunction with our case officers in Intreo.  That work is ongoing.</p><p>The Deputy referenced JobPath.  Persons on JobPath are still fully eligible for community employment while they continue their work with JobPath.  I will ask Mr. Kieran to discuss eligibility for farm assist.</p></speech>

Changes to farm assist came into effect this month.  We have extended the disregard for many of the additional schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, such as the ash dieback scheme.  This should increase the availability of farm assist, which is a gateway to the rural social scheme for people who are farming.</p></speech>

I will go through the points raised.  On the 18.5 hours, I am open to correction but my understanding is that it is declared by the customer.  It is not that we assess how people's hours are spent on the farm.  The customer declares it to us with regard to the 18.5 hours for the carer's allowance.  It is the customer who tells us.</p> <p>  We certainly do listen to the proceedings of the committee.  We follow them with interest.  I have seen what the carers' associations have said.  We meet carers regularly.  We have an annual carers forum, which met approximately two weeks ago.  Importantly, we do not just hear from the representative organisations, which are very good at articulating issues among carers.  We also hear from carers.  Some of the same people who spoke to the committee spoke to us.  We have heard first-hand what their experience is.  It is a two-way engagement.  They make presentations to us.  We also have workshops with carers' groups and carers themselves.  Some of the changes I outlined with regard to the means test and the 18.5 hours emerged from previous carers forums where those ideas were generated.  We have very close engagement with the groups.  We have an annual carers forum and they are also engaged in our pre-budget forum.  The means test was increased in the previous budget, which was the first time there was an increase in 13 or 14 years.</p> <p>  In social welfare terms, the carer's allowance has the highest threshold for a means test.  The means test for a single person on carer's allowance is &euro;350.  For those on disability allowance, it is &euro;140.  The threshold is quite high in social welfare terms.  I take the point on the financial pressures that carers are under.  In discussions with us they have certainly highlighted that their position with regard to outgoings is very demanding and that the costs they bear have a material bearing on their household income.  I hope this answers the questions.</p></speech>

We meet them regularly at local level through community development officers.  During Covid we set up an overarching forum that met online.  It met three times in 2021.  It also met in February.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, attended.  We have met RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors and their unions.  We have constant engagement with the unions.  We met them several weeks ago on the <i>ex gratia</i>payment issue.  There are also meetings with the Irish Local Development Network and our colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development in various fora.  There is constant engagement.  I hope we will be able to get back to more in-person engagement.  Ministers have been able to visit schemes in person more frequently since the beginning of the year and that is very welcome.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked about Ukrainians.  As she is aware, under the EU directive, Ukrainians have the same right to access the labour market and labour market programmes as all other EU citizens.  The same rules will apply to them with regard to duration on jobseeker payments before they are eligible to participate in programmes.  We have been doing a lot of work with Ukrainians in terms of employment supports, ensuring they have information on employment opportunities and matching employment opportunities.  We have found that many people coming from Ukraine are highly skilled.  Some have language issues.  There are opportunities in the open labour market of which they can avail.</p></speech>

I welcome some of the recent changes.  They are definitely incremental steps in the right direction.  However, I will say, as would all my colleagues, that it is still probably too little.  The witnesses might be able to tell me how many people are long-term unemployed.  In other words, how many people have been on jobseeker's allowance for longer than one year?  It is fine to say the unemployment rate is 4.5% and that we have full unemployment but the subtext of this is that all of the commercially employable people are employed.  It does not mean there is not a large cohort of people who are long-term unemployed and that the system has said employers will not employ these people.  We need to look at this figure and then ask why there are vacancies on community employment schemes and T&uacute;s schemes.  Full employment is defined as 4.5% unemployment and many of these people are long-term unemployed.</p> <p>  I welcome the slight shift I have heard in the statement today.  I have been in politics since 1994.  Since the schemes were introduced, there has been an argument that they are purely activation schemes and the fact they provide a service to the community is an accidental incidental of temporary employment.  There are now two recognised aims of the schemes.  These are activation and providing vital services.  Many of the services provided in rural areas through community employment, T&uacute;s and rural social schemes are provided in cities by paid full-time employees, such as in public parks and public areas.</p> <p>  There should be three equal aims to the schemes.  One is activation and I have nothing against activation for community employment schemes and T&uacute;s but the rural social scheme is different.  The second aim is to provide services.  The third is to provide useful occupation from long-term unemployed people who are unlikely to get commercial employment but can make a contribution.  When I was in the Department, Dr. Clem Leech was its chief medical officer.  He gave me a simple one-page note that showed the devastating effect on people's health of unemployment and being unemployed.  It has an effect on morbidity and mortality.  They go to the doctor more frequently.  I would love to see a move whereby we recognise three equal aims to the schemes rather than them having the primary aim of activation, a subsidiary aim of services and no emphasis on the long-term unemployed.  This is where the issue of the cap on the number of years arises.</p> <p>  On a big policy level, does the Department wonder why community employment is there and why we have T&uacute;s?  Does it ever ask what is the purpose of it and why people can go straight from the live register to T&uacute;s and community employment?  Does it ever ask what this is all about?  Does it ask whether it is rational?  The structure of T&uacute;s schemes is the result of the insistence of the Department of Finance at the time.  They were not the creation of the Department with responsibility for social protection.  The idea put forward at the time was that people would go on a community employment scheme as a training activation scheme.  If people did not graduate from it, they would graduate to T&uacute;s and there would be no time limit.</p><p>I remember it was 2010.  The scheme was taken, as amended, in a crisis.  Does the Department accept it is time now to look at the big picture and to have a much more coherent policy such that there is intensive activation and so on and a lot of money is spent on training, but that if that does not work after, say, three years, the person is not thrown back onto the scheme he or she was on or kept in training?  Even if such people are unlikely to get employment, what they need is an employment scheme such that they graduate to that and there is no time limit.  This should be put into a totally rational picture.  Has there been any talk in the Department of looking at that?  If the Department digs out the files, it will find some interesting answers in them as to how this rather bizarre situation arose and how it did not arise because of the Department but, rather, arose in an absolute crisis.  We got the scheme with conditions, and the conditions the Department of Finance put on it at the time were totally irrational, but better half a loaf than no bread.  It is time now, however, after 12 years, to look at the scheme, to pause for a second and to ask if this was what it was designed to do or how this rather odd situation arose.</p><p> RSS is not an activation scheme because the people on RSS already have jobs.  They are farmers.  That is a condition of the scheme.  That leads to a number of questions.  Will the witnesses tell us in their reply how many people are on farm assist?  That is crucial because, as far as I know, it might be about 5,000.  It is certainly down on the figure during the economic crisis.  I do not believe there ever was a justification for the six-year cap.  The scheme was working fine without it.  Whatever justification there was for it at the time, if the Department were to make the scheme an on-demand scheme, and there are people on farm assist who will not go onto RSS for whatever reason, there will not be a flood of people into the scheme because they are just not on farm assist.  That is, I think, where 90% of the Department's RSS participants come from.  The six-year rule is not required anymore.  The scheme already has a number of vacancies.  It has 3,350 places; it has only 2,800 participants.  As Deputy Kerrane said, even allowing that 400 of them are over 60, that is still a difference of 1,000 people, and I do not know where the Department will find them.  The Department should forget about reviews.  Will somebody not make a decision without a big external review in some Department?  Can we not go back to the days when civil servants and their Ministers made decisions on the obvious and did not keep putting everything back into a review?  Can we not move on with that?</p><p> The next problem I wish to raise is a huge one.  If the Department were to look at the number of people with dependent children or adults on their farm assist payments going onto RSS as a percentage of the total available pool, I would say it would find it to be much smaller than the number of single people.  The reason for that is that if I am a single person, no matter what my farm income is, as long as I am eligible for &euro;1 of farm assist, I will get the full payment, including the top-up.  If, however, I have a dependent adult, all I get is &euro;22 or &euro;23 for 19.5 hours' work.  The rest is clawed back off my farm income.  Very few people would think it a great idea to work 19.5 hours for &euro;22.  That was another 2017 rule that came in.  The scheme was working attractively.</p><p> Somebody once described this syndrome as follows.  You sometimes meet people about whom it is said that if you were down in a hole, they would pull you out of it, but that if you started climbing a ladder, they would push you down again.  It seems to me there is a bit of that involved in the way this works in that if you are really down in the hole, yes, the Department of Social Protection tends to pull you out, but if you start climbing the ladder, between means-testing and the rule that the Department will give you &euro;22 if you give it 19.5 hours' work, the Department pushes you down again when you start getting on and might have a slightly better lifestyle.  It was attractive to couples with children to go onto the scheme because they could keep their farm income as long as it was not too big.  There was a limit on the income they could have.  They had to be eligible for farm assist.  When that was happening, small and medium-scale farmers found it possible to stay in full-time farming with the scheme and to put their children to school, to college and so on.  That was a major contribution to society.  I remember saying at the time that it was a much better focused expenditure of State money, of public money, because it helped that cohort of farmers, than all the grants they were getting because those are indiscriminate and give the multimillionaires the same amounts they give the people at the bottom.  Then we got mean and cut them.  Are there any thoughts on going back on that decision?</p><p> Ms Hurley said these schemes cost &euro;112 million, &euro;375 million and &euro;52 million.  Will she tell me how much it would cost if all these people went back onto their basic payments?  My memory is that between, say, a T&uacute;s and an RSS scheme, the difference is something like &euro;5,000 per participant.  Those schemes are in the Department of Social Protection, so if it were to scrap all the schemes, it would not save &euro;375 million, &euro;112 million and &euro;52 million because the costs of other schemes in the same Department would go up.  One of the reasons the schemes were put into the Department of Social Protection was that the internal argument between Departments would be ended and the Minister for Social Protection could go to the Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as he is now, and explain to him or her that an extra thousand places costs not a gross cost but only a net cost because 1,000 people will be lost from farm assist, jobseeker's allowance or whatever other payment they are on.  Again, maybe the witnesses could tell us the real, net cost of the schemes, not their gross cost.</p><p> Speaking of rationalisation, T&uacute;s and RSS work on the basis that there are, I think, 30-odd companies involved.  CE still operates on a much different basis in that every company is independent.  There are 800 companies, 800 audits and 800 supervisors with massive employment responsibilities that grow every day, all under voluntary committees, whereas T&uacute;s and RSS are managed centrally from the point of view of employment responsibility by the partnership companies, which are professional companies.  The wages are paid from Clifden by Pobal, and the local committee decides what work needs to be done and dusted.  That can involve day-to-day supervising or work in liaison with the sponsoring company to arrange that.  It seems to me to be a better arrangement.  It seems to me there could be significant exposure from those 800 companies all being independent.  Many of them have voluntary committees.  That is a huge and unnecessary burden on them.  It would be much better to have the employment arrangement of T&uacute;s and CE, whereby the heavy employment responsibilities are on a more central body and there are shared services for paying out the salaries.</p><p> I wish to speak about carer's allowance and the new approach to the hours for farmers.  I could say many things about carer's allowance but I will focus only on farmers.  Full-time care and attention is very hard to define.  For example, if you have an old person or a disabled child in your house, they may go to bed at 10 o'clock at night and not get up most days until 8 a.m., but you are tied to being there.  If they need to go to the toilet or need anything in the night, you have to be there.  There might be nights when they will not call you; there might be nights when they will.</p><p>Are they eligible hours?  Somebody else could go away for the weekend if they were not caring and leave an adult behind or whatever.  With a child who is not disabled, you could get an ordinary babysitter in, however, that is not possible with a disabled child.  Again, with the farmer, a similar thing happens.  Many elderly persons would not be able to go to the toilet on their own because physically they could not get out of the chair.  They could not perform other bodily functions, as they call them.  However, if often happens that a person like that might have their lunch and then go to the toilet or whatever, and you might be able to leave them.  You might be able to work by mobile phone and be able to leave them for an hour or two or three to go a few fields down, do your work and be on call.  However, you could not go off for the day or be at full-time employment, because you would have to be on call all the time.  Is that full-time care and attention?  Are they care hours?  On the forms at the moment it is not very clear if they are care hours.  We are trying to mathematise very human situations and box them out into very kind of fixed chunks when caring for somebody is not like that.  You are trying to make up these hours.  Would somebody write a little menu of the eligible hours?  I would imagine that if you are tied to and in the house and the person is asleep, you still have to be there if you are on call all night.  Whether they  do not get up, get up once or five times, you are still there.  I will eave it at that.</p></speech>

The first reason there are vacancies at the moment on CE and the other schemes is because of the positive labour market.  I have the figures here that the Deputy was looking for.  Of the 172,000 people on the live register, we would calculate around 45,000 are eligible for these schemes.  That is a subset of the long-term unemployed.  Approximately 70,000 or fewer are long-term unemployed, but some might be signing on for credit and things such as that as well.  We would estimate there are around 45,000 who would be eligible CE or T&uacute;s as well.  The point is well made in terms of matching that number of people to fill the vacancies that exist on the schemes as well.  That work is ongoing with our Intreo offices, our case officers, CDOs and with schemes as well.  Not everybody is interested in going on schemes, so our Intreo case officers are working with people on that as well.  In addition, there are issues around geographical location.  We are standardising and streamlining the referral process so that people who are eligible to go on schemes are being referred to schemes in the locality and other practical things as well.</p></speech>

As that has now come to the end from April, that means the churn, or the numbers leaving CE, is increasing month to month.  That creates additional vacancies, which is why we have put the arrangements in place so no one has to leave a scheme.  Even if a job is being advertised but there is no one suitable there to take up that position for whatever reason, the existing person can stay on that scheme as well.  That is adding to the number of vacancies.  However, there is an increased number of vacancies at the moment for that reason.</p> <p>  On the overall cost of schemes, when we are having discussions in the annual Estimates process with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the Deputy would be more than aware, it is looking at the gross cost of schemes.  That is what they ask us.  We obviously provide backup information on the costs of schemes.  This is across all our employment support schemes and not only on the ones for the long-term unemployed.  It is the gross cost that the Department very much looks at and looks for justification for.</p></speech>

We are showing that there is progression across the board.  In addition, from our general Intreo employment support services as well.</p> <p>  On how many people are on farm assist, the latest figures I have from May are 4,770, if I am correct.  Yes, that is correct.  That is the number on farm assist.  It is true that number has been reducing over the past number of years as well.</p> <p>  In terms of looking at the big picture, I suppose we are always looking at, across all our employment programmes or activation services, the work that Intreo does on the provision of employment, training, advice and guidance to unemployed people.  Pathways to Work is the Government&rsquo;s latest employment services strategy, which was launched last July.  We would also have the advice at our disposal of the Labour Market Advisory Council, which is looking at that big overall picture and advising the Ministers as well on the measures and mixture of measures that are available in the context of the current labour market environment.  There is a mix of representatives and experts on the Labour Market Advisory Council and they gave advice to the Minister during Covid, protections of the post-Covid response to the labour market and now, in the new context, I am sure they will be providing further advice on measures that are currently in place in this space, but also across the board as well.</p></speech>

I beg Ms Hurley's pardon.  She can check the record.  The reason it was introduced was the exact opposite.  It was as I outlined.  It was meant to be a follow-on permanent scheme to go onto.  It was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that changed and destroyed it.  Therefore, I wonder what the present rationale is.</p></speech>

It is a shorter intervention that will provide a quick stepping stone back to the labour market.</p> <p>  The Deputy had another question about the different organisational structures.  I take his point on them, where there is CE with the 840 schemes all responsible for the wide range of the organisational remit as well as the community remit, as well as delivering the services, and a different model for RSS and T&uacute;s.  I would imagine that is due to the time they started.  CE was probably largely before the partnership of the local development structure, which had not developed to the extent it was in place when the later schemes were introduced.  Is that something that is now still valid given that those structures are still in place?  That is a point that needs to be looked at again.</p> <p>  I think the Deputy had certain questions on carers.  I will pass over to my colleague.</p></speech>

His question was about the full-time care intention and how we come to that.  Broadly speaking, the rules are around 35 hours or more caring in a week and five days out of seven.  I do not know off the top of my head whether that is broken down and there are operational guidelines between night-time and daytime caring.</p><p>I expect someone providing the level of care being outlined by the Deputy - we all know people in our families doing it - would have around-the-clock and daytime care.  If it goes over 35 hours, the threshold would probably be met.</p></speech>

People may have to be there because the person being cared for has a dicky heart or is at risk from a brain haemorrhage.  The person may have advanced Alzheimer's disease and be at risk of going out the door.  I could, for example, be sitting down to watch a television programme with that person or get to go out, if I close and lock the door, to go to the farm for an hour or two.  Is that a caring period, for example?  It is causing absolute chaos with the formulation of the forms.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Ms Hurley, has said, there are approximately 4,700-odd on farm assist.  The qualified adults number 1,895 and there are approximately 2,800 qualified children on the full rate, with a further 850 on the half rate.  The total beneficiaries, including the primary recipients and dependants, number approximately 10,300.  The Deputy asked about those figures.</p></speech>

Nearly one from two on the farm assist programme has a dependant, whether adult or child.  Most of the people have a dependent adult and many of them would have children.  If I look at the people recruited since 2017, will I find that one in two will have dependants or will I find the vast majority are now singles going in?  For a participant with a partner or dependent child, the gain is &euro;22 per week.  That is the question.  We are losing a rich seam of families and my colleagues would share my view.  That must be addressed.  We must go back to the old way so if a person had a farm income, that person got the full personal rate of &euro;200.  There is the adult dependant allowance, the child dependant allowance and the farm income is the person's own.  It is not an awful lot to ask out of life.</p></speech>

If it is okay, I will start on the topic of carers.  I am aware that in the run-up to the increases in the means test on 1 June, many letters were sent to carers and those in receipt of the carer's allowance.  Does the Department have any idea of how many people lost out as a result of that review and how many people had reduced payments?  I know many people coming to my office were affected by the letters that went out and the reviews carried out.  I am interested to know if those figures are available.</p> <p>  It has been said that in social welfare terms, the means test is very high and nobody will dispute that.  I am sure the Department was listening and looking when we had some people in receipt of the carer's allowance before this committee.  We heard heartbreaking testimony on that occasion.  One of the issues they brought up was housing adaptation.  I know it is not under this Department's remit but I am asking the question because I am aware there is a review ongoing of the housing adaptation grant.  Has the Department of Social Protection had any consultation with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage about that?  It is very important that the review is carried out and that carers' voices are heard.  I am very interested in hearing if the Department has had any input into that.</p> <p>  In his opening remarks, the Chairman mentioned there are approximately 6,000 carers not getting the benefit of the carer's or domiciliary care allowance but who get the carer's support grant.  Does the Department have any figures on how much those people are above the means test as it stands?  What would it take, money-wise, to bring those people into getting the carer's allowance?  We know and have met many such people.  They are in need of a weekly payment but currently they are losing out, although they are getting the carer's support grant.  I would be very interested to hear if the Department has any idea about those approximately 6,000 families losing out because they are above the means test now.</p> <p>  With regard to the community employment and rural social schemes, I was very interested to hear the remark made that nobody will have to leave a community employment scheme unless a replacement is found.  Who determines that?  We are all aware of the great work that those individuals do on the ground, whether with the GAA club, the local community hall or wherever they work.  They have built years of experience in that regard.  What training will determine the person who is coming to replace them?  Are we looking at a position that if somebody becomes available, the person who has worked in a role for many years would be gone overnight because there is a person who can replace the person in question, even if that person is not trained?  It is a very important question and a very important point for community employment schemes.  It is one brought up with me continuously.  Some of the people coming may not be suitable or have the experience or training to fill that position.  It is something that needs to be answered.</p> <p>  One big question being raised about community employment schemes now is that sponsors have to raise funds for materials.  Are there plans to increase the material grants available under community employment schemes?  It is a major issue for those schemes.</p> <p>  The figures provided in the opening statement indicate there are 3,500 free community employment schemes given the money available now and up to 2,000 free rural social schemes.  The figures indicate there are 19,000 people on those and there could be 22,500 people on community employment schemes.  The question I asked on the previous day and the question I am asking today is what attempt the Department is making to encourage young people to take up such schemes.  We are all aware here of the age cohort of people on community employment and rural social schemes to the extent they can be on such schemes.  What attempts are being made to encourage young people to become involved with their communities?</p> <p>  With many of the communities I deal with, the persons involved are of an age where it is a worry as to whether they may be able to continue.  We need young people to get involved in the community.  Given the massive unemployment figures we have among our young people, is the Department aware of this?  What attempts are being made by the Department to ensure young people get involved?</p> <p>  My final question relates to the community employment scheme supervisor pension.  Could we get an update on where that stands?  Is the Department considering any pay increase because it has been so long since supervisors have had a pay increase?  A stakeholder forum was mentioned but when was the last time the Department met union representatives as part of that?  Is that to be part of the stakeholder forum?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1094" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#L01000"><p>I will answer some of those questions before passing over to my colleague, Mr. Kieran.  The Senator asked about finding replacements and we have a process in place that my colleague will outline.  Where a replacement has not been found, a contract would be extended.  We must remember the purpose of community employment and T&uacute;s is to train the long-term unemployed person.  The persons coming in require that support and training; it is the intervention from community employment.  They would not have the same skills as a person who is leaving because that person has had the benefit of that work experience, training and intervention.  Schemes are funded to upskill people and give them work experience.  There are challenges for schemes when new people come in but that is the purpose of schemes in going back to their original activation purpose.</p><p>During the pandemic, there was significant concern about the increase in unemployment among young people, given the potential long-term impact for people who are unemployed at crucial stages of their lives and careers.  Thankfully, unemployment levels among young people have dropped significantly.  The unemployment rate is now below 5% which is lower than before the pandemic.  It is crucial that every support is given to young people who are unemployed to ensure they do not become long-term unemployed.  The EU youth guarantee is in place in terms of the intervention.  Employment supports are provided by our Intreo offices ensuring that the range of suitable supports are available to young people.  Those supports include reskilling, any courses that are provided through the education and training boards, ETBs, or other sectors and our support programmes.  If people are still unemployed after 12 months, they can move into community employment schemes.  Our objective is to try to ensure that cohort in particular do not get into a situation whereby they move into long-term unemployment.  Many young people were employed in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic and unemployment in that group increased to well over 20% but thankfully has now come back to more normal levels.  They are a priority group across our employment support schemes.  There are specific commitments aimed at that group in Pathways for Work, as well as the EU youth guarantee.<br/><br/>At the end of last year, there was agreement between the Government and the unions representing CE supervisors and assistant supervisors on the long-standing issues arising from a Labour Court recommendation in 2008.  That was agreed at the end of December.  We are now putting in place the administrative arrangements to make a once-off <i>ex gratia</i>payment to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  Those are people who have retired since 2008 and, going forward, people will receive that amount on their retirement.  We had to put in place some administrative arrangements in that regard.  We will be sending out the application forms to the first group of people in the coming weeks.  Once we get those back, we hope to process them as quickly as possible and issue the payments.  The total package agreed will cost approximately &euro;24 million.  Approximately 2,500 supervisors and assistant supervisors will benefit, of whom 700 will benefit immediately and the others will benefit on retirement, if I have those figures correct.  That is progressing.  It is a priority for us to issue those payments.<br/><br/>The operational forum that met during the course of the pandemic was overarching across all three schemes.  It made sure that other schemes, such as drug schemes, were also represented.  Ministers attended the forum.  That was for an exchange of views on operational issues and did not deal with human resource or policy issues.  We are now engaging with sector-specific groups and will start to re-energise those discussions in the near future.  We met with unions representing the RSS and two supervisors in April.  We are now revising the terms of reference for those exchanges and will be doing the same on the CE side.  Work is ongoing with the unions as we look at the wider issues.  The point is that the State is not the employer of CE supervisors or any of the other supervisors so all those discussions are in that context.  We are not the employer.<br/><br/>I will pass to Mr. Kieran who will deal with issues relating to the material grant and training.</p></speech>

As we said earlier, roughly 600 extensions have been granted so far to allow people to stay on schemes.  Those extensions are granted on the basis that the sponsors have advertised the post because as Ms Hurley said, it is an effort to get long-term unemployed people back into activation and training.  When the new people come in, part of the role of the supervisor is to work out training and development plans with them.  I take the point the Senator made about losing people who are well trained up and skilled at what they are doing, and who know what they are doing, and their being replaced by people who do not know what they are doing.  That has always been the case and is a part of the progression.</p> <p>  On the training grants that are available, every scheme is given a grant of &euro;250 per participant.  As the committee knows, there are differences in that people over the age of 55 do not have to engage in training.  The full grant is available to the scheme to use for anybody who avails of it.  We encourage everybody to take up training opportunities.  Opportunities with the ETBs are also available.  Many of our schemes access training through the ETBs and other facilities that are out there.  There is flexibility in that regard.  There is enough money available to provide the training that needs to be done.</p> <p>  The Department makes a contribution towards the costs of materials for the schemes.  There is a variation in the rates, which has been raised at the committee in recent weeks.  There was some talk about standardising the rate.  There is rationale for the variation in rates.  Some of the sponsors are income-generating and do not apply for high levels of payment.  There are cases where the rates of payment are very low.  That is with the agreement of the sponsors because they are income-generating and do not need higher rates.  However, where a scheme or a sponsor has difficulty, we conduct a review in conjunction with the local community development officer and our central areas.  We will review and look at the rates.  We are conscious of some of the costs that are impacting people now.  I am sure the Senator is well aware of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1097" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#M00300"><p>I thank the Senator for the questions, one of which referred to the housing adaptation grant.  I am not aware that we have been consulted directly on that although my team on the disability policy side is engaged in a plethora of interdepartmental groups and the issue may well have arisen in one of those forums.  We certainly have membership of the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which is the main forum where stakeholders and other Departments do their discussions of business around disability.  One of my team is our lead representative and the matter may have come up in that forum but I am not aware of anything specific so I will not improvise in that regard.</p> <p>  The 6,000 people who get the carer's support grant but not carer's allowance do not have to report their income to us and we do not know what they are earning or what level would bring them in, which I think is the meaning behind the Senator's question.  We know there are approximately 8,000 people on carer's allowance who are getting a reduced rate.  These are people who have means to declare so they are above the threshold but the threshold tapers down to a particular point.  There are approximately 8,000 people on that rate.</p> <p>  I think I have responded to everything the Senator asked of me.  I will come back to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who asked earlier about statistics.  I will share those statistics so they are there for the record.  The Deputy asked about farm assist and said that fewer people on the farm assist payment have adult dependants and child dependants now than would have been the case previously.  That tells us something about their stage of life, that is, they are older, etc.  That appears to be the case.  In 2011, there were just over 5,000 adult dependants and just over 8,000 child dependants on farm assist.  In 2020, those figures were down to 2,200 adult dependants and 3,200 child dependants.  Those figures were included in our published annual statistics report, which is on our website.  There is a full breakdown for all the intervening years.  If there is any further detail required, we are certainly happy to provide it.</p></speech>

I have some very brief follow-ups.  In March, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, told me there were 2,969 people on the RSS, of whom 1,493 will not be impacted, which leaves 1,476 who will be.</p><p>Ms Hurley stated there are 2,890 on the rural social scheme, RSS.  For clarity, I ask her to confirm the number who will be impacted by the six-year rule from next year on.  Similarly, how many of the more than 19,000 people on the community employment, CE, scheme will be impacted by the six-year rule from next year?  </p><p> The review of the rural social scheme, which is important, is due to commence and be completed this year.  I am concerned in respect of the near future.  It is difficult to determine.  Will the review be carried out?  Will it be completed?  I acknowledge it is not a review of the six-year rule but, rather, the scheme itself.  However, as these changes, if they go ahead, will have a massive impact from next year, will the rural social scheme be reviewed this year?</p></speech>

I will revert to the Deputy to ensure there is no confusion in that regard.  Our figures are that approximately 400 people would benefit immediately.  Those are 400 people who are over 60 and to whom the 2017 rule would apply.  That reduced the numbers to whom it would apply.</p> <p>  I am not sure I understand the Deputy's question relating to CE figures.</p></speech>

If we know that 1,000 people, or whatever the figure is, who are on RSS now will be impacted by the six-year rule, how many people on CE will be impacted by it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-15a.1102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022061500002#N00400"><p>At the end of May, there were just over 19,000 people on CE.  The six-year rule applies there differently.  That is the lifetime limit on it.  I do not think we currently have a figure for how many people leave having reached that point but we can look for that figure.  I do not think we have it to hand today.  The big outflow at the moment is the people whose contracts were extended and who are now starting to leave.  They may have stayed on CE for longer than the normal limits.  The limit is normally three years.  A change was introduced last year whereby anybody over the age of 55 who started on the CE scheme before 2017 can stay on it.  That may be the provision to which the Deputy is referring.</p></speech>

As I stated, Ministers are looking generally at a range of proposals to deal with these issues relating to vacancies across all schemes.  The intention, in accordance with the recommendation of the report of the interdepartmental group, is to also look at wider issues relating to RSS.  I am not yet sure whether that review will be completed by the end of the year because there will be resource implications and there are other issues under consideration in that regard.  I cannot give that commitment but it is intended to get that work done, whether in the current structure or a different structure.</p></speech>

As Deputy Kerrane is aware, I have been significantly involved with communities for many years.</p> <p>  As regards the T&uacute;s scheme, there is a small cohort of people who, for whatever reason, cannot hold down a job that starts at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. and ends at 5 p.m.  I am not speaking about lazy people.  It might be for family reasons or due to anxiety.  One of the things I have noticed is that through the incredible work of supervisors, many of those people have had a life in recent years.  I am sure Deputy Kerrane would say the same thing.  Once they are trained in over the course of a couple of months - at times it is not simple to get people interested - they seem to take a significant interest in the work they are doing.  Whether it is Tidy Towns, helping with caring or whatever else, they really do a good job.  They would tell the committee that their life changes.  In that regard and in the context of unemployment, there is a small cohort of people I would not like to see left out just because they could not link into a job in a local shop or factory.  Are our guests conscious of that?  I am sure they are.  Can they understand from where I am coming?  I have seen this with my own eyes and heard it from people who have been employed on schemes.</p> <p>  The issue with T&uacute;s is that it is too short a scheme.  That issue has been raised already this morning.  As the supervisors would tell us, it takes up to three months to get people into a routine but then their time is up before they really start doing the work.  I would like that to be taken into account.  There should be an understanding that there is a small group of people who just cannot cope.  Sometimes it is down to family circumstances.  They may need to look after a parent, aunt, uncle, brother or sister and just cannot get away from their house.</p></speech>

I know I told the Chair I would not come in on this.  Is anyone being turned down for farm assist?  What wriggle room is there if a person is very close to qualifying for it?  If our guests do not have those figures today, I ask that they be sent on to me.  Ms Hurley stated there were 4,770 on the scheme.  Are there many people who are just outside the qualification lines falling by the wayside?</p></speech>

If anything, it is an existing cohort that has been ageing out over time.  It has become a smaller scheme over time.</p> <p>  The issue of certain Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine schemes that are not covered by the means test was raised earlier.  My colleague Mr. Kieran alluded to this.  In other words, applicants were being assessed in full, whereas the farm assist means test takes account of various agriculture schemes, as members are aware.  They are encompassed in the means test.  In the most recent budget, this was expanded significantly.  The main issue flagged to us previously was that people were missing out was because that list had not been updated.  We have done that now and that should catch those who have been drawn to our attention as being just beyond the threshold.  That should help in that regard.  I will find out the refusal rate.  We can feed that back through the clerk.</p></speech>

Much of the work we do with schemes relates to that and identifying people it would suit.  As regards those who, on completion of T&uacute;s, still find progressing onto open labour market opportunities to be a challenge and need further support, I go back to my earlier point that CE is an option for them.  The other supports that can be provided through Intreo services and our general employment supports are also available to them.  There are wider supports available to those people on completion of T&uacute;s.</p></speech>

I will come back to the issue of carer's allowance, in the context of national Carers Week and the request that we received from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the need for flexibility for farm participants in receipt of the allowance.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v put it quite well earlier regarding the availability of the farmer.  Usually, the farmer is taking care of an older person who is in the house with him or her.  The farmer is, at worst, farming in the vicinity of the home.</p> <p>  Surely, with the development of technology and the roll-out of 4G technology, which is pretty much universal throughout the country, it would be possible to have a situation in which, even when a farmer is away from the family home, he or she can still continue to monitor the older person and can be there within minutes should he or she fall or need to go to the bathroom.  Should we not, in circumstances such as that, use technology to provide that level of reassurance that the Department, quite rightly, requires in the provision of full-time care, while providing the flexibility that would assist smallholders, in particular?  That is usually who we are talking about in the context of the carer's allowance.</p> <p>  With regard to flexibility, an issue raised in evidence we received from Family Carers Ireland related to the number of full-time students who are being knocked off the carer's allowance.  Many of them were young carers who were caring, usually for a parent, while they were in second level.  However, once they register for a third level course, they are automatically knocked off.  Surely there could be some flexibility with hybrid learning.  My understanding, from the evidence that we received, is that not only are the teaching hours being calculated, the reading hours are also being calculated in meeting the 18-and-a-half-hour threshold.</p> <p>  The point Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made was that, in many instances, it is about having someone physically present in or close to the house.  A student can as easily read a book online or a hard copy at home in his or her own sitting room as in the library.  In fairness, most third level institutions will try to facilitate a young carer in every way they can and there is now an awful lot more adaptability with remote learning.  Surely, the Department should take a more flexible approach to that.  The point was made in evidence to us that the student could be at home reading an academic book and be denied the carer's allowance.  However, if the student is at home reading fiction, he or she is eligible for a carer's allowance.  That does not seem right.  I ask the Department representatives to address that.</p> <p>  What I will say about the 18-and-a-half-hour threshold will not come as a surprise to Mr. Hession, because I am blue in the face at this stage with regard to this.  We have a small cohort of people who are the life-carers of children with a disability who are either in an education or training centre during the day.  They can only work up to 18 and a half hours outside of the home.  We still have the income threshold, as a limiting factor in how much they can work, but there should be flexibility beyond those 18 and a half hours in those small number of instances where the person to whom they are providing care is not physically present in the house and is either in school or in a training centre, purely from the point of view of mental health and of being able to engage with a workforce, because, sadly, in many instances, they will have to re-engage with the workforce at some future date.  Those three anomalies, if addressed, would deal with a number of the grievances that we have heard in evidence over the past number of weeks.</p></speech>

The payment is there for people who are not able to work because of their caring responsibilities and to provide an income support in the absence of that ability to work.  Where a person is still able to work because of technology and their caring responsibilities do not prevent them from working, that is not really what the carer's allowance is there to do as an income support.  That is not to undervalue or downplay their caring responsibilities play in any way, but to explain that the carer's allowance is not a payment for caring, as such.  It is an income support that kicks in because people have a limited ability to take on full-time employment.  The income support is to recognise that such are their caring responsibilities that they are not able to avail of full-time work.  It slightly flips it a bit.  Rather than saying that technology has enabled them to manage both and therefore, they have been able to do more.</p> <p>  Under most of our schemes, people in full-time education are not eligible for income-support help, apart from some exceptions, of which the PUP was one.  We have had this discussion in our engagement with carers, through the carers forum, in terms of breaking down how people spend their time, travel to and from full-time education, study time and course work.  In running schemes, we have to try to set what we believe are reasonable boundaries.  We are always talking to carers about what is the lived reality.  Where a person is engaged in and has a full-time commitment to education, our scheme would say that means the person is not full-time available for caring.</p> <p>  However, I accept the Chair's point about young carers.  There is, in the discussion around carers, perhaps a belated recognition on our part about where young carers fit into that.  We have run a programme through the Dormant Accounts Fund over the past couple of years to fund some projects to help young carers.  We had to say to a group at a carers forum a couple of years ago that it was right, in that we tend to think of the carer being the same age or older than the person for whom he or she is caring.  Sometimes, one is a bit out of touch and needs to hear that.</p> <p>  In terms of flexibility for carers, where the arrangements for the person for whom he or she are caring are such that the carer has some time in the day to themselves, the move to 18 and a half hours was influenced to a degree by the arguments made by people such as those.  Some 18 and a half hours is a half-time pattern.  If someone was to do mornings only in the Civil Service, he or she would work 18 and a half hours.  It allows people that scope, where they have that time in which their caring responsibilities and the structure of their day have changed, as the person is in some other day arrangement such as employment, education or other activity.  That was the thinking behind it.  It is always a balance.</p><p>The move from 15 hours to 18.5 hours is the first time that was done in 15 years, so it is a case of "suck it and see".</p><p> The scheme fits into the wider architecture of the social welfare system.  Above that, different thresholds kick in for other schemes and there is a bit of dissonance between the schemes, for example, the working family payment.  We have to watch those.  We are trying to make the wider social welfare system coherent.  In recent years, we have tried to allow flexibilities through the means test, the change to 18.5 hours and the capital disregard.  We have also funded a few training programmes the carers' organisations are operating and which are delivering very good results for carers who are ready to go back to work or have been caring for a long time and whose confidence or skills need a boost.  It is not a "Yes" or "No" question or answer, if the Chairman knows what I mean, but something we try to keep under review in the context of the wider decisions we have to make about how schemes work.</p></speech>

I am sure this is an issue the committee will revisit.  Mr. Hession raised an issue I am going to raise with Ms Hurley.  Members may correct me but as far as I can recall, the CE supervisors, in their evidence to the committee, made a point in respect to training and the training allowance that participants could go on a training course that would assist with the managing of the scheme but supervisors could not get approval from the Department to go on a training course that would assist them in operating the CE schemes they were managing.  That seems to be a perverse situation.  The witness in question had never used the training allowance up to that point and was then refused by the Department access to a training allowance that would have helped that person to comply with the statutory requirements and the requirement laid down by the Department in operating the CE scheme.  The supervisor was refused access yet the participant being supervised was approved for access.  Surely there needs to be some flexibility?  We should not have situations where CE supervisors are refused access to a training course that is focused on the delivery of the programme they are operating.</p></speech>

It should not happen because, for the reasons the Chairman outlined, it does not make sense.  It is in the interest of the operation of the entirety of CE and other schemes that supervisors have the capacity to carry out their role as they are accountable for large amounts of State funding, and that they are supported in doing that.  One of the ways to do that is through training and development.  If someone was turned down for funding for a scheme like that even though the budget was available, I would be slightly surprised.  I am not saying it would not happen because, as the Chairman knows, there can sometimes be incidents where rules may not be applied in the manner expected.  I will be happy to look into that case.  I agree with the Chairman it makes no sense and it is not something I would stand over.</p></speech>

We will look at how we streamline all of those activities and if there are wrinkles, as somebody mentioned earlier, we will iron them out.  However, we are also looking at how we provide for skilling up the supervisor cohort because that is important.

We recently had productive meetings in the matter with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, the Minister of State at the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Hildegard Naughton.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Debbie Byrne, managing director of An Post Retail and Mr. Pat Watt, head of operations, An Post Retail.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore if their statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they be physically present in the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate when they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  Members attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Byrne to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

It is opportune with the recent announcement of the &euro;30 million funding programme for postmasters.  We have lodged our statement but I will touch on a few salient points and then take questions.</p> <p>  Throughout Covid-19 there were many examples of individuals and organisations that redefined the essence of public and community service.  Of particular note has been the contribution of An Post both with the post office network and our delivery infrastructure.  Throughout the pandemic, An Post kept its network of 920 post offices open.  At any one time two or three small offices were closed but reopened again within three or four days.  This was important in providing cash payments to citizens who still opted to have their social welfare payments paid through cash.  It was also important in terms of the continued distribution of cash to the economy.  We kept all our delivery routes open.  This was important in keeping Ireland trading during the lockdown and enabling SMEs to keep their doors open.  We welcome the recent announcement on the three-year funding package for postmasters in recognition of the real community value of post offices but also of the great public service. </p> <p>  In regard to An Post's own strategy, we take our lead from the Government's own programme for Government.</p><p>We are really well positioned to meet the Government objectives of keeping communities connected, protecting societal well-being, supporting the green economy and delivering accessible financial services for all.  The pandemic, however, has accelerated some of the headwinds facing the post office network.  It is important to recognise that today.  While the &euro;30 million in funding for payments to postmasters is very welcome, it should not detract from the job that remains to transform the post office, as I always explain to people, away from the old world of cash payments, BillPay, etc., and into a new world of financial services and e-commerce.  That is not to say the "old world" of cash payments is not important, but we know that it is a part of the business and a part of the income stream for postmasters that is declining.  Covid has accelerated some of these underlying trends.  The strategy we put in place in 2018 and 2019 is still very much robust and intact, but Covid has accelerated some of that decline.  The big one is social welfare.  Since 2019 we have seen about 5.5 million transactions come out of the network.  We very much welcomed the announcement from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, before Christmas on returning some jobseeker payments to the post office, but it remains the case that the number of those social welfare transactions in the network is way down on what we had envisaged.  We are working all the time.  Our big mantra for the team is to look constantly for new products and services that we can put through the network.  We are constantly looking to top up the leaky bucket, as I call it.  We are doing that based on four key pillars.</p><p> The first is community banking.  Community banking is absolutely key to the future of the post office network in the context of the retreat of the pillar banks from many of our towns.  An Post is now the sole provider of financial services in many parts of the country.  There are 540 post offices situated in parts of the country where there is no bank within a 5 km radius.  Our new partnership with Bank of Ireland, which began last year, is great, and we continue to work in partnership with AIB.  Our An Post Money goes from strength to strength.  The retreat of some of the big-name banks from the market in the next 12 to 18 months has created an opportunity for An Post.  Our current account is going from strength to strength.  That is up 77% year on year.  We are working very much in partnership with some of the exiting banks right down to branch level, where we are partnering the branch managers with the local postmasters and creating that warm transfer of customers.  With the current account we were at about a 50:50 split between account openings online and in the network.  That has now shifted, with about 65% of current account openings being in the network.  That shows the role of post offices working with the exiting banks to warm-transfer customers and to let them open accounts in a timely fashion, which is not the case with some other providers in the marketplace.  Then there is our NTMA business, which continues to go from strength to strength.</p><p> The second pillar is looking for new services.  There is our Green Hub and our partnership with SSE Airtricity.  That has kicked back in post pandemic and is starting to gain traction again.  I am really pleased to say that our technical development has now kicked off on Leap and we will be able to do Leap purchase and top-up in post offices across the country from quarter 1 of next year.  The one-stop shop for government services is still, I think, something we collectively need to crack.  The Government recently produced the digital Ireland framework and, within that, the Government's goal is to have 90% of services online by 2030.  It is really important that, over the next 18 months to two years, we work collectively.  In the past we have gone around various Government Departments piecemeal looking for extra government services.  We now need to stand back, take an all-government approach and ask how we can truly become the one-stop shop for the Government in support of the various Government policy documents that have been published, including the digital framework, rural development, etc., such that a citizen can go to the post office and avail of any government service, which may involve identity verification, planning applications or payment for government services.  We have the IT infrastructure.  Our IT infrastructure links in with the Department of Social Protection and Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank, which shows that it is state-of-the-art infrastructure.  Collectively, we need to find a way around this.  We look forward to working with the Government on that because three years will pass quickly, the payment to postmasters will run out and we need new services, including government services, coming in behind that.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

It is good to see the witnesses again.  I welcome that there has been some progress since we last met.</p> <p>  I will pick up on the last point Ms Byrne made about how An Post would like to see things unfold now in respect of engagement.  There is a process to work its way out in respect of the potential government services and a one-stop shop and what that might look like.  Are negotiations ongoing?  At every committee meeting I attend there is call for a whole-of-government approach.  The difficulty with whole-of-government approaches is that they are difficult.  I ask the witnesses to give me a sense of where we are at and the type of progress that is being made or not being made.  Do the witnesses feel there is a need for a different approach to the engagement in the first instance?  From their perspective, is the potential that is there for identification?  Is it less for social welfare or is it still for social welfare?  I would like just a sense of the types of services the witnesses see as a potential.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses expand on the point about the Green Hub?  I am my party's climate spokesperson.  There is a huge budget to go with the retrofitting programme.  SSE Airtricity, I think, is one of the five one-stop shops.  On a practical basis, what is the working relationship between An Post and SSE Airtricity?  How does that look, and what is the opportunity to penetrate into communities in a way in which online does not for the retrofitting programme?</p> <p>  I have a final question about the allocation of the new moneys.  What is the formula for that?  If there are postmasters around the country looking towards the end of this year, how do they ready themselves to be considered?</p></speech>

Our understanding from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is that that still has to go through a formal process in respect of state aid approval.  In parallel, however, we will kick off discussions in early July on the dispersal model.  We will parallel that in track.  That would be in partnership with An Post, the IPU and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I believe the Department of Finance wants to be involved as well.  We welcomed that the Minister and her officials were able to get to this stage so early in the year in the agreement on the funding.  We also now recognise there is an urgency in communicating the dispersal model.  It is fine that postmasters know there is &euro;30 million, but everybody wants to know what is in it for them.  I think I will be able to give a more precise answer once we have the first meeting at the beginning of July.  That is already in the diary.  It is a matter of not dragging this out until November.  People need to know-----</p></speech>

There was talk, I think, of somebody from the Department of Finance being there, but I have not seen the names.</p><p>I literally only got that into my inbox last night, so we can confirm that.</p><p> In terms of Government services, the outstanding memo still needs to be published out of the last round of engagement in terms of the old approach where all of the Secretaries General came together and looked at what their respective Departments could provide.  I have not seen that memo.  My understanding is that not too much has come out of it.  At the IPU conference two weeks ago, the Minister for Social Protection stated that she and her officials were looking at what social welfare services could be provided.  Anywhere there is paper, there must be a role for the post office.  For example, social welfare recipients must notify the Department of Social Protection when they go on holiday.  Why can this not be done at the post office counter?  The Minister is working with her officials to look at that.</p><p> On the new approach, the digital framework document has been published.  There is also a reference in the programme for Government to reform and local government.  Having got the funding piece over the line, my next step is to stand back and ask how we approach that.  We will need some kind of committee obviously with our own Department at the heart of it but also perhaps work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach because for something to be a whole-of-government approach, and the Deputy will know better than I do, those two Departments will probably have to have some skin in the game in terms of directing that because it crosses local government.  If you are doing something in post offices, you are replacing services provided elsewhere, etc.  My objective this summer is to plan the approach with a view to kicking it off in September.</p><p> When we launched the green hub in the October before the onset of Covid, we were ahead of the curve.  What consumers were telling us at the time was that it was all very complicated.  For example, if they wanted to do up their house, they had to go to the SEAI website and all the rest of it and bring all the information together themselves.  What we did was simplify the process and bring everything into the green hub, which is a portal on the An Post website.  We brought together and simplified some of the SEAI information.  We then plugged in SSE Airtricity as a provider.  Consumers can book an appointment where an SSE Airtricity evaluator will visit their home, assess it and see what jobs need to be done.  During Covid, we did some assessments remotely with an iPad, which worked quite well, so now we give people the option of availing of both routes.  Consumers get an estimate and a shopping list so they can decide to go the whole hog in terms of a deep retrofit or cherry pick off of that.  In conjunction with the European Investment Bank, we launched a green loan, which is still has the lowest rate in the marketplace for green financing.  We would like to scale that, and we have been talking to other providers about coming on board in order that we have partners in addition to SSE Airtricity.</p><p> The SEAI came out with its one-stop-shop arrangement at the beginning of the year.  We have had to stand back a bit and see where we can play a role.  It is a really good example where we invested a lot of time and energy.  We are very close to the consumer and are outside the tent on this, which is very frustrating because I think we could help Government accelerate that.  We are part of Government but we are not so I think we can do more in that space.  Again, I would ask that when policy things like this happen, people would ask about the position of An Post, because, for the minute, we probably have to re-evaluate our strategy in light of that.  We are in discussions with SEAI to see whether there is a role for us.  We have invested in the digital infrastructure and could be the front end of that and bring SSE Airtricity in through the Government route.  Why does the Government need to replicate and spend money again creating a digital front end for consumers?</p></speech>

I will start with the positives and then I might move to some constructive criticism.  I thank them for everything they did during Covid.  An Post was everywhere when much of society was not circulating.  It was brilliant.  I only found out the other day that PPE was being brought to home carers.  An Post had a partnership with Home Care Ireland that involved the company delivering PPE, including gloves and masks, free of charge to people who could not leave their homes to get it.  This was a small thing but, cumulatively, it was massive.  I thank An Post for that.</p> <p>  I will now move to constructive criticism.  We sat here about a week and a half ago and met with the IPU and Tom O'Callaghan from the Independent Postmasters Group.  We have been carrying out a body of work on this.  The Government has given &euro;10 million to support - not save - the network and give it some sustainability.  Is that not incongruent with An Post's rationalising?  An Post has a plan to streamline the network.  Rationalisation and streamlining mean closures.  Are the two aims not incongruent?</p></speech>

The size of the network is always a big debate.  My job is to grow the revenue.  If the cake is shrinking, the size of the slices must be reduced.  The objective must be to grow revenue.  That is the starting point of all of this.  It is why we are considering our relationship with Bank of Ireland and Leap.  We must ask if we can grow our partnership with SSE Airtricity and our green hub.  If we do not grow the revenue, we cannot sustain the base at the size it is.  That is just-----</p></speech>

We put in place a transformation policy in 2018 and 2019 and the fundamentals of that are still right.  It is about driving new products and services and driving co-location.  Covid obviously interrupted some of that and we are renewing the policy.  We are driving co-location and looking at new co-location partners.  Mr. Watt has come from a pharmacy background and we are looking to see are there new opportunities in that regard.  We are also considering if there is a role in some areas of Government service.  Could we co-locate an Intreo office in a post office?  We must look at the use of the footprint.</p></speech>

Some people are still on that contract.  Approximately one third of postmasters are on the old S52 contract.  If I have my figures correct, approximately two thirds have moved onto the new contract.  That new contract is largely unsustainable for the small rural post office.  There was a time when those post offices received transactional payments and there was positive discrimination so a comparative transaction in a large urban post office would net a certain amount of transaction money but I do not know the figure.  That approach was subventing the rural post office but it is gone now.  Government funding is good and we all welcome it.  However, this transformation which our guests see as a positive and which brings An Post into a positive revenue stream is a double-edged sword to someone like me in a rural constituency.  It means more post offices are being closed in Clare and the west of Ireland to get the entire network to a sustainable point.</p></speech>

They are essentially subvented.  An Post is subventing the deep rural post offices in addition to the new funding that will come from the Government.  In the past, there was a declining rate for the bigger post offices in the context of social welfare.  Ours is a commercial organisation.  This is a business like any other.  With the number of social welfare transactions declining, postmasters have to run their offices as businesses.  Gone are the days when you could wait for someone to come in, show their verification and collect their social welfare and then sell them a stamp.</p></speech>

It is like a squid game of the post office network.  One will survive while another across the road will fall.  There is a requirement for everyone to live within a 15 km radius of a post office, which might not sound like anything to someone in an urban constituency such as Dublin but in Clare, the situation on the ground is that if someone who is pushing on in years becomes unwell, they contact An Post and hand back the contract.  I know of someone whose son was unwell.  Those very sensitive issues become the catalyst for an overall post office closure.  That is how it is happening on the ground and the situation does not look very transformational to us.</p></speech>

They were never asked in the first place to move off that contract for exactly that reason.  Our whole mantra has been around protecting those smaller post offices.  There are fixed and transactional elements to that.  Many of the new services, including the current account offering, for example, are in addition.  That is an opportunity for those post offices to earn more.  We have never approached deep rural post offices and asked them to go onto the new contract.  There is a cohort that were never written to about the new contract for exactly that reason.</p> <p>  There is what we call the squeezed middle.  People who are in population areas that are not as big as some urban areas are more challenged.  That is absolutely the case.  We work with those postmasters to try to unlock cross-selling.  Mr. Watt is running a great programme called great conversations.</p></speech>

Some postmasters believe that is already happening with the advent of PostPoint.  One of the solutions of An Post comes up with in response to the closure of post offices is to suggest putting a PostPoint at the back of a Centra or Spar shop.  That is convenient from the point of view of a consumer who can get stamps when they get everything else.  The social interaction goes and everything else.  Is An Post considering an expansion of PostPoint?  Of course An Post wants PostPoint in more locations but that is not what I am asking.  Is An Post planning to put more services through the PostPoint server, system and robot to include things such as social welfare payments and an ATM of sorts so it becomes a multi-transaction facility?  There is a concern among the men and women who staff and run our post office network that slowly but surely, the automation of PostPoint and its spread will make many more of them redundant.  Perhaps Ms Byrne will expand on that point.</p></speech>

If a post office closes, continuity of service around core services is important to us.  Those services include mail services, the sale of stamps, e-commerce and click-and-collect for parcels.  The provision of social welfare and all of the security around that, which includes safes and all of that, is not provided through PostPoint.  If a post office closes, we now put in a new-looking PostPoint unit.  It is not self-service.  I think it is possible to weigh parcels but customers still need to interact with a member of staff.  We have in our own company offices some self-service units such as one would see in Marks and Spencer or a local supermarket.  That is the way of the world.  If a consumer comes in-----</p></speech>

It is important to note that two thirds of the core network is co-located.  In other words, the branch is in a retail outlet anyway.  There is nothing unusual in PostPoint when compared with a post office.  It is not robotic; it is the same terminal.  There is human interaction involved so that personal engagement remains.  We have a post office network and an extensive PostPoint network, as we always have, and one complements the other.  The PostPoint offering is very reduced relative to a full-service post office.  The intention is to fill in gaps where a post office would not be viable because the transaction levels would not be there but as part of broader retail offering, it makes sense.  If in certain locations we get to a point at which a post office is no longer viable, for whatever reason, PostPoint is a decent solution to provide continuity of service to those local citizens.  There are one or two options in that regard.  Either the business goes to the nearest local post office, which could be 5 km or 10 km away, or we put in a PostPoint, which is a reduced service offering but is still a person-to-person service.  It is still an assisted service.</p></speech>

His response was a bit reassuring.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, was before the committee, she talked about the &euro;10 million fund from the Government to be distributed by An Post.  We got locked into a discussion of how much each post office will get and we asked will An Post positively discriminate so that rural post offices get a little more funding and the urban post offices get a little less.  The Minister of State did not have that level of detail on the day and said that the matter remains to be worked out.</p><p>Dividing &euro;10 million among 900 post offices works out per post office at &euro;11,111, all the 1s.  We asked her if the GPO in Dublin would be availing of it.  It seems, given the way this will be devised, it will.  Will the GPO and the very large post offices take a <i>pro rata</i>share of this fund, or, as the helms body of the post office network, will An Post ensure the large ones above a certain threshold will not get anything, given the true wish of people is that the struggling rural post office network will be subvented?  Will An Post ensure that happens or will it take a slice of the fund for the larger post offices?</p></speech>

This is very much a work in progress.  We have not had the July meeting yet so we have not been able to take the lid off this yet.  Our going-in position was that the support would be balanced across the network.  We currently have a pyramid model.  In other words, more of the bottom of the network gets support relative to the top of it.  That reflects the fact that, for example, a larger post office has the local community business and footfall it needs to sustain itself and in a declining transaction scenario, it can take action such as reduce staff or hours within its business model.  Smaller post offices, particularly one- or two-person operations, would not have the same scope.  Our going-in position is it would be more of pyramid approach to the disbursement but we have not started those discussions yet.  We will start those in July.  We want to make sure there is equity in the distribution of that funding.</p></speech>

We had representatives of the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, in before us and an urgent issue they raised concerning the &euro;10 million package, or &euro;30 million over three years, which is very welcome, was that postmasters have to give six months' notice if they intend not to stay on and are retiring.  The end of June was a critical date because, I understand, the current pandemic payment ends at the end of December.  I am a little worried the meeting to deal with the construct of the &euro;10 million will not happen until mid-July.  There is concern there will still be a degree of uncertainty and many postmasters may be forced into a situation where they will give notice they will retire before the end of June.  I need clarity on that.  The key fundamental question raised was why it was so urgent that it would be announced.  What is the position on that, as people need to have some indication of the level of funding they will get?</p></speech>

To return to the previous speaker's question on whether it will be distributed on the basis of a pyramid model or more evenly distributed, I would flag since the announcement it is beginning to have the desired effect.</p></speech>

I took a very crude measure based on 833 postmasters, which works about at about &euro;12,000 per post office but a higher proportion of the fund would be skewed towards the post offices that are struggling.  As a Deputy based in Limerick city, I deal with post offices, both urban and rural, and many of them are under severe pressure.  There is great support for them on the ground.</p> <p>  Evolving to the services provided by the post offices, An Post is delivering a Government service in terms of disbursing social welfare payments.

In some communities, even in rural areas, there would be several, possibly three, post offices that would fit within those parameters.  Over time, the digital provision of social welfare services is accelerating.  I return to my original point around revenue.  The absolute goal has to be to drive revenue through the post office.</p></speech>

They are independent businesses so if they close, it is of their own volition.  We are doing everything we can to ensure every post office is viable by feeding into the system as many new products and services as possible.  If post offices make a local decision to close because they do not believe the business is viable, sometimes those decisions are very nuanced and specific to the individual postmaster.  For example, many have different types of arrangements around the property, whether they lease it or own it, the number of staff they have, etc.  They are very individualised and personalised decisions.  Sometimes it is also a retirement decision.  There are many nuances to this and we are certainly not driving a strategy to demand closures.</p></speech>

For me, the post office network is a hidden jewel.  The question then is what we can do with modern technology to build this network so that it can provide a role.  Post offices have private services with the banks but we can also look at State services as well as remote working and all of the discussion that entails in sustaining rural villages.  Mr. Watt is correct on that and I have seen urban and rural post offices of reasonable scale that are under pressure.  When I use the word &ldquo;struggling&rdquo; I am talking about the broader context but the rural post office is key, as is the urban one.</p></speech>

I had to attend a vote in the Seanad.  If I ask questions that were already asked, I apologise in advance.  I was tracking the meeting until I had to go off to vote.  I thank Ms Byrne for her opening statement.  I am conscious that this is our third engagement on the retail post office network in the past month or so.  We had the IPU appear before the committee and also had the Minister of State in on foot of the announcement of the funding programme, and so on.  There is probably some repetition of points we made previously but I want to hear An Post&rsquo;s perspective on them.</p> <p>  Ms Byrne referred to an investment by An Post of more than &euro;60 million to transform the post office network to build a sustainable business for postmasters.  Where did that &euro;60 million actually go and what did it do?</p> <p>  My next question may have already been touched on by the Chairman.  What formula was used in each of the three years?  The phrase used to describe this was the "dispersal" method or model.</p><p>It is to give it to those who need it most, not those who are already thriving without it and so on.  Where does Ms Byrne see the cash versus digital scenario going?  That genie is out of the bottle and people are now much more willing to tap than they ever were before.  They are much more willing and less reluctant to embrace technology.  There was this whole cash-only thing, which I would have seen happen in my own post office.  People used to go in to collect their pension and then paid their bills with the cash they got from the pension.  They would then walk across to the other side of the shop and spend the rest of it over the counter buying their groceries before they went home.  The cash kind of moved around within the building but never actually went anywhere.  That can now be done differently.</p><p> Obviously, broadband is part of this committee's remit as well.  The unintended consequences of improved broadband may mean that people will be able to access some of the services online that they cannot get at the moment because they do not have broadband and they will stop going to the post office for them.  Where does Ms Byrne see that going?</p><p> Has Ms Byrne an idea of the percentage of the population that engages with An Post on either a weekly or monthly basis?  I remember that Postbank kind of came and went.  There is another service available now, although I am not that familiar with the An Post current account.  Ms Byrne might enlighten me on that.</p><p> Ms Byrne made a reference to making online shopping easier, including by means of out-of-hours collections.  What is involved in that?  Obviously, people can still presumably top up their Leap cards at DART stations and on Luas platforms, but it is welcome that An Post also offers this service.  I was taken by Ms Byrne's phrase about the leaky bucket whereby stuff is coming in and going back out and we are always plugging holes.  The An Post brand is really important.  It is really trusted - possibly more than the pillar banks or the commercial financial services sector generally.  An Post should build on that and provide more services.  The in-person verification stuff is very useful.  I do not really understand why we set up a whole load of driving licence offices when we could possibly have done them through the post offices - not all 920 offices but perhaps 200 or 300 could have done it.</p></speech>

Postmasters had a fixed element for three years.  Every three years, we went back and looked at their actual transactions and the fixed amount for the next three years was calculated based on the level of transactions.  As I mentioned earlier, what we are seeing, and the Senator referenced some of the points, is the changing nature of the business.  At a top line, while we are trying to fill the bucket up all the time, transaction volumes and revenue are declining.  Covid-19 has accelerated some of that trend.  In the two years over Covid-19, 5.4 million transactions on welfare alone came out.</p></speech>

The Department shares our view around making sure money is dispersed in a way that really supports those who are most in need.  We recognise that the larger, more viable post offices have more options in terms of being able to take action where they are under, say, for example, business pressure on volumes.  They also benefit more from the footfall drivers we are putting in place like, for example, agency banking whereas a smaller post office or, indeed, a small urban post office may not benefit as much.

Annually, about 65% of people were using a post office, and I cannot recall the monthly figures off the top of my head.  Within the age profile, there was a shift, with younger people using the post office more frequently in the past three years, and I think the reasons for that are threefold.  First, online shopping, with people either collecting or returning a parcel, is driving in new footfall, which is why we have invested heavily in commercial training with postmasters.  If that footfall is driven in, postmasters and postmistresses then have to find a way to sell.  We have to move from being a purely service business - we are a service organisation - into having a commercial focus for postmasters while providing that good service.</p> <p>  Moreover, during the pandemic, there has been a significant boom in the younger population coming in, buying gift packaging and sending gifts.  We are still investing heavily in a campaign to encourage people to stay connected and send love.  We now hear people saying it was so nice to have received a thank-you card or whatever, and we would hope people will continue with that.</p></speech>

Ms Byrne might comment on An Post bank accounts and where broadband might leave the organisation.  This may not concern her section, but in less than two years' time, there will be local elections, and at some point there will be a general election.  I know a lot of people who would love if An Post could work out geofencing per local electoral area, LEA, whereby if someone were running for election in Stillorgan, D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Blackrock, he or she could pay An Post to drop a leaflet to every house in that area, including the ones that say "no junk mail".  I do not believe that facility exists whereby it is mapped by local electoral area.  If it were done, an awful lot of candidates and parties would be willing to sign up to a reputable leaflet company that would deliver per area, including to the houses that state "no junk mail".  In my opinion, a political leaflet, regardless of the party, is not junk mail but rather is a way of communicating with people and getting a message across.  It is almost impossible to get leaflets distributed in any other way and there is a massive market, with 949 local authority seats and probably quadruple that in terms of candidates.  An awful lot of people, if it were a competitively priced product, would be willing to pay An Post to know the leaflet would be dropped into every house in the area.  This might not be under Ms Byrne's control but she may wish to comment on it nonetheless.</p></speech>

It needs to be biased, therefore, and the model needs to be built towards those who most need it.  They comprise those not just at the bottom end of the network but also in the middle.  A mixture of rural and urban post offices are under pressure.  We have had one engagement with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, about this and we have also engaged with the Department regarding the philosophy and the ideology of how this would be distributed.  We will have a session in the second week of July at which we will bring to the table our respective positions on the design of that dispersal, so it has not yet been agreed.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, as I said earlier, we are seeking to balance between certainty, as in a fixed element that will provide certainty and comfort for those who most need it, and a commercial element that will ensure we do not lose our commercial focus.  One of the risks with funding is that we will lose our commercial focus, and we need to maintain that, so the variable element will be important.  I expect that as we move towards the more profitable end of the network, it will be more variable than fixed, whereas at the bottom of end of the network, it will be more fixed.</p> <p>  They are the broad brushstrokes but we have not yet designed it nor agreed a design with the Department or the IPU.</p></speech>

We are very much promoting cash and card, recognising that perhaps not everybody wants to use cash.  We are rebuilding that business and that is important.  Cash foreign exchange is a product all the banks have got out of.  Outside of paying an arm and a leg at the airport to get it, we are the only place to get it.  Furthermore, we have invested in a leaflet drop to 1.6 million households.  We are very much communicating about it to rebuild the business.</p></speech>

Where many of us come from is that the benefit of the post office network is evident.  There is a clear need, especially in parts of urban Ireland and not just rural Ireland, to have an available, accessible, modern post office network based on the needs of people.  I wish to play devil's advocate while also giving anecdotal evidence.  Where we have post offices not being reopened or retendered for, is there an approach that we are going to level out with a number of post offices and that will be it?  It will be like water finding its own level.</p></speech>

Our objective is always to try to fill the gap and maintain continuity of service.</p></speech>

In North America there is a huge issue around the post office system.</p> <p>  I thank the An Post officials for being here.  It is important we continue our engagement.  We are very fortunate our post office network that is still in existence is doing a tremendous job.  I thank the people who worked in An Post during the pandemic, and also before and after, for their ongoing commitment to serving in our communities.  The whole issue is around retail, commercial viability and ensuring we have a sustainable post office network.  I look forward to further engagement.</p></speech>

I compliment the staff of the post offices in Limerick, including Aengus Lafferty and others.  We have dealt with the staff and everybody wants the network to be sustainable.  The An Post officials are talking about expanding the service.  What is coming up all the time is the renting of good premises is a difficulty.  If the officials are looking for that range of services then they are looking for them to rent better premises in many cases.  It is something that will have to be factored into the discussions.  We are finding the rent of a new premises can be very high and that makes the model unsustainable under the new contracts.  Will the officials elaborate on that?

Therefore, we need more services to plug the gap but equally we need postmasters to be comfortable having the "and" conversation with you.  It is not just about the transaction.</p><p>We must make sure they are comfortable bringing up those conversations up with their local community and in offering those products and services.  There is a mixed bag in the level of confidence and the willingness to engage in that.  We will try to work with them and help with that in the coming months to make sure we can build that confidence because that is the only way to grow the business.  Equally, on agency banking, if you go to urban locations that might be benefiting from agency banking, they need to proactively reach out into that community and engage with the local manager of Ulster Bank, Bank of Ireland or wherever to make sure they capture that business coming in because once that business comes in, there is a cross-sale opportunity for the other products.</p></speech>

I want to finish on a productive note.  The discussions on the &euro;10 million must take place quickly and clarity must be brought.  We want to assist in expanding the range of services.  The following matter is the most important of all and I cannot overstate that it is hard to put an economic value on the network.  It is hard to quantify but once it is gone, it will be very difficult to replace.  An Post is not only a commercial service; there are other factors and the &euro;10 million coming from the Government, and &euro;30 million over three years, is a key element of it.</p></speech>

Postmasters are already doing ID verification and anti-money laundering checks for current accounts and social welfare so they could cut out the step with the Garda, check all the forms and make sure they are all properly signed so that when they go into the system they are correct the first time.

Rather than it being a general discussion I ask An Post to be quite specific on what it can do.  Anything that assists people with passports is helpful.  An Post is in the community and it is online.  This is something we would take up and follow up with the Department of Foreign Affairs as An Post falls directly under our line as a semi-State body.  An Post must put flesh on the bones of this.</p></speech>

We will take up anything that proactively assists people.  People are under such pressure with passports and Ms Byrne is correct that even when they apply online, they still have to get the consent form.</p></speech>

We have to retain the integrity of the passport application process.  These are the types of services that we have to look outside the box with.
