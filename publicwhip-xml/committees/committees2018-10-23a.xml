    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herlihy" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#D00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to present this opening statement to the joint committee.  Being the newly elected chairman of the authority, I welcome the opportunity to meet members on that basis, even though I have met many of them on a personal basis.</p> <p>  In the last 12 months we have witnessed some of the most severe weather events in living memory for the farming industry.  Teagasc has been centrally involved in supporting farmers through its lead role in the inter-agency fodder group that was established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  Even though we may hate to admit it, there is a possibility that weather events like this will occur in the future.  Teagasc is very conscious of the need to support the sector in the mitigation of greenhouse gases and its adaptation to climate change.  Maintaining this focus will be a key priority for the organisation in the future to ensure the sustainability of farming.</p> <p>  Teagasc has been in existence for 30 years.  Its remit is to conduct research into agricultural production and food processing and deliver advisory and education services to farmers.  Its mission statement is: "To support science-based innovation in the agri-food sector and wider bioeconomy so as to underpin profitability, competitiveness and sustainability".  As my children often say to me I am always talking about money, members will excuse me for embarking on that subject again.</p> <p>  Teagasc's current budget is &euro;187 million.  Teagasc is unique as a non-commercial body in having a relatively large proportion of non-grant-in-aid income, which amounted to &euro;56 million last year.  This non-grant-in-aid income is where Teagasc is successful in competing for a number of contracts for research and advisory funds at national and EU level.  It also includes advisory and education fees, income from farm profits, industry and professional levies.  Teagasc receives a further subvention of &euro;125 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which &euro;43 million is effectively a pension fund.  The &euro;43 million is money which comes in and goes out.  Our income comprises upwards of &euro;80 million by way of a direct subvention from the Department and a further &euro;56 million in fee-earned income last year.  It is there to fund our capital expenditure programme.</p> <p>  Teagasc has approximately 1,200 full-time staff, including contract staff.  In addition it has approximately 280 Walsh fellows, 260 at doctoral level and a further 20 undertaking a masters programme.  The people concerned are hugely important to fuel research and provide advice in the future.</p> <p>  Teagasc is probably best known for its advisory offices, of which it has 51.  A number of years back it had a number in the high 80s.  In addition, it has seven agricultural colleges, four of which are owned by it and three of which are privately owned and subvented by Teagasc.  Teagasc has seven research centres which cover diverse agricultural and food-related issues.</p> <p>  Teagasc has six operational programmes which are hugely important from a research, advisory and training perspective.  They cover animal grassland research and innovation; food research; crops, environment and land use - a smaller category; the rural economy and development; advisory work and associated work; and, importantly for young farmers, education and training.  Teagasc's aim is to drive productivity in the areas of dairy, beef, sheep and pig production without compromising sustainability, a point I would like to underline.  Despite the very difficult year we have had, the FoodHarvest target to increase milk production by 50% by 2020 will probably be met this year.  That has to be seen as very positive.  There are two central pillars to Teagasc's ruminant livestock programme - genetics and grassland improvement.  In the last two weeks Teagasc embraced the potential of digital technologies to transform pasture based agriculture through the recent launch of a &euro;40 million investment programme, VistaMilk.</p><p>That is hugely important because it was funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Science Foundation Ireland and the industry participants in the area of agriculture.  That cohesive tripartite involvement is very important.</p><p> Food is at the hub of what we do.  There is little point in just producing food.  We need to process it, but it is important to add value also.  In that area, it is vital that Teagasc, through its Moorepark technologies and innovation in which Teagasc is a 50% stakeholder, is investing &euro;10 million in Moorepark Technology Limited.  We have a further &euro;10 million earmarked for the area of food technology hub, which also will be based at Moorepark in Fermoy.  Within the past week, the Minister opened a prepared consumer food centre at Ashtown.  The purpose of that is to get the industry up and running in the event of a Brexit issue but we should be doing it anyway regardless of Brexit because it is all about adding value to the food chain.  In addition to that, we have received almost &euro;3 million from Enterprise Ireland to establish BIA, an innovation facility, at the Athenry campus, which will support small and artisan food producers in that area.</p><p> Another area of activity is crops environment and land use.  Members are well aware of the much publicised document, Food Wise 2025, to ensure that the delivery of that ambition can be achieved in terms of sustainability in both economic and environmental terms.  Key to achieving these objectives will be the redoubling of our efforts in the development of better varieties in the crops area and crops that are resistant to pesticides as various agri-chemicals will be withdrawn.</p><p> The promotion, in collaboration with the Department, of sustainable forestry expansion is hugely important for the future as we deal with the area of climate change.  It is particularly important that we include native woodlands on dairy farms in particular as we deal with the growth of dairy farms within the context of the climate change environment.</p><p> The rural economy is an important area.  The economy programme is focused to make sure we have sustainable agriculture in the broader sense but also in terms of quantifying the costs of climate change mitigation, the modelling of the economic impact of Brexit scenarios, taking into account the viability of small farms, and devising and tracking indicators of sustainability.  Agriculture and farming is a broad church, if members will excuse the term.  We need to be very conscious of our small farmers also from the point of view of the sustainability of rural Ireland.</p><p> On the advisory area, Teagasc provides an advisory service to its 44,000 paying clients but also information to our 130,000 farmers throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  In terms of our staff who interlink with those on a daily or weekly basis as is required, we have 240 advisory personnel, 87 of whom are allocated to our 18,000 dairy farmers, 131 to dry stock and the environment, but they are primarily beef farmers, and 11 to tillage, primarily in the tillage growing area.</p><p> Teagasc has and must continue to work very closely with Bord Bia in implementing its Origin Green at farm level through its unique carbon navigator programme.</p><p> It is important to point out to the members that Teagasc has recently begun collaboration with local authorities and the co-operatives, primarily with dairy processors, on a major programme to provide a free water quality improvement advisory service for farmers.  It is called the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, which is a bit of a tongue twister, or ASSAP.  What is important, however, is that it is a free educational programme that works in collaboration with local authorities, but primarily with dairy processors, to ensure that water quality is as it ought to be.</p><p> Education is hugely important because unless farming can attract young, highly qualified people, farming is going nowhere.  The education programme is at the hub of what Teagasc does and at the hub in terms of the future of agriculture.  In 2017, more than 7,000 learners participated in Teagasc school leaver programmes whether it be through adult education or Teagasc linked higher education courses.  We are now implementing three major initiatives stemming from the recent review of the programme, which is called the extension of education pathway.  That includes apprenticeships, promotion of teaching and learning practices and the development of continuous professional development courses, aimed primarily at farmers.</p><p> The members will have to excuse me.  I am chairman only a wet week, so to speak, but nevertheless there are areas I am concerned about from a Teagasc point of view.  Excuse me for talking about money for a start but there are three areas I would like to bring to their attention.  First, regarding capital requirements, in the absence of access to borrowing facilities, Teagasc faces significant challenges in funding its working capital requirements.  I am not saying Teagasc should be given a cheque book and be allowed to write cheques willy-nilly, but I am conscious that it does not have access to overdraft facilities or any borrowing facility to fund its research and educational infrastructure.  It would be fair to say that, in the past, much of the capital expenditure was funded either through the sale of assets, and we cannot continue to sell fields forever, or through once-off special capital grants from Government.  I believe neither of those is satisfactory from the point of view of the delivery of our objectives in the longer term.  I want to make it very clear that Teagasc should live within strict fiscal policies but not having the capacity to borrow money for even short-term purposes is an impediment in terms of the development of agriculture and the delivery of our objectives.</p><p> Regarding recruitment, which is another hobby horse of mine, Teagasc is an outstanding organisation, and I believe the members share my view.  It is a brand, but a brand is only as good as the people who are available to lead it.  We are known globally as an outstanding independent and recognised agricultural research entity which delivers research for farmers, food researchers, food processors and Government agencies as well.  However, we are facing severe challenges in recruiting and retaining high calibre staff.  We do not want an open cheque book to recruit anybody at any figure but a particular issue is the very low starting salaries we are obliged to offer young, highly qualified researchers in particular.  A slight tweaking of that entry level through recognition of their qualifications and work experience would be of enormous advantage to us.</p><p> Another area, and I touched on it earlier, is our educational programme for which there is a waiting list.</p><p>We also face a difficulty in facilitating the large number of students who are on a waiting list for part-time and distance education courses unless we are enabled to continue to recruit contract teaching staff.  I appreciate that we have had that facility in the past and we would certainly welcome if this facility was afforded to us in the future.  Very clearly, education is something that is hugely important to us but we need the appropriate funding to do it.  The reason I say this is twofold.  Successive Governments have been hugely supportive to agriculture from the point of view of the transfer of farms from one generation to the next in respect of stamp duty and the very generous capital tax allowances that are available.  In addition, we have a grant programme that offers a significant extra grant allocation to young qualified farmers where they make investments in respect of their farms such as a new milking parlour or making the farm more sustainable but we need young farmers who have the appropriate level of agricultural education to facilitate that.  It is in that context that I think it is so important that we accelerate our educational programme for our own young farmers to avail of the important facilities and schemes that have been put in place for them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. Herlihy and Professor Boyle for appearing before us today.  I wish Mr. Herlihy well in his role as incoming chairman of Teagasc.  It is an exciting but challenging time to come into the role.  I note that he outlined the various programmes.  In respect of the &euro;56 million that is non-grant aid income, from where does it mostly derive?  Is it from research projects undertaken by Teagasc or is it from collaboration with dairy co-operatives?  I think Teagasc is also involved in the agricultural farm in Kilkenny.  I raised a few issues about it, the new winter system and out-wintering dairy cows.  I have a concern about that.  I might as well be straight and honest.  I have been contacted in recent years by people who have concerns about it, particularly in the context of what Mr. Herlihy rightly identified as climate change issues.  Obviously, the objective is part of research.  I think it is being done in collaboration with the co-operatives.  It might be meritorious at the beginning but we differ somewhat from New Zealand and other places where this has been adopted.  I was told about the number of cattle lost.  I would like to see the number and the tags of all those lost animals made available because some of the information I got was worrying.  Teagasc is the research body and an arm of the State that aims to make sure all that can be done is done, so I hope for reassurance in that regard.  I accept that what occurred last February or March was unusual but now we are aware of it, we must be in anticipatory and precautionary mode to ensure that it does not happen again and that animals are not left in that position.  This will not be new to Professor Boyle.  I have raised this issue in this committee previously.  It is about ensuring we do everything we can.  I am not saying anyone does anything deliberately.</p> <p>  I come from this end of the spectrum.  Some of my colleagues from Teagasc are coming to the end of the road and will be part of the 43 million rather than at the other end where Teagasc is now rightly focusing.  The VistaMilk programme is excellent.  I think we will see benefits from that in terms of how to gain from our pasture-based agriculture and grassland.  I think that will be good even in terms of the infant formula market of which we have a disproportionate and positive share.  Well done to everybody involved in that, including Teagasc.  Moorepark is still in the vanguard of significant technological developments and long may that continue.  I cannot but acknowledge Grange and its work in the beef and dry stock sector.  I suppose it is nearer to Senator Paul Daly and to me.  I am very glad to see that John Heslin, one of the top ten footballers in the country, is doing a doctorate there.  I look forward to reading his output in due course.  </p> <p>  My next question might be one for Professor Boyle.  Could he give a broad outline of how he sees us fitting in following Brexit?  I know it is not fair because nobody knows.  We must assume a best case scenario but prepare for a worst case scenario.  How would a worst case scenario hit the very ambitious targets outlined in Food Wise 2025?</p> <p>  I am delighted to see Teagasc liaise with local authorities.  There was always a close relationship even at local level.  It was always there in Westmeath in any event but we now have a formalised programme in terms of improving water quality.  If we can work with Teagasc, local authorities and farming organisations in a collaborative and co-operative way, we can make a significant dent in that.  </p> <p>  How many of those 7,000 learners are going back to the home farms?  Thankfully, some people will be employed by Kerry Foods and we need them to be available in this regard.  I am delighted to see CPD for farmers, which is a novel concept, because it is important that farmers who are middle aged get an opportunity to participate in ongoing professional development so I am pleased about that.  </p> <p>  Regarding the capital requirements, how much land can Teagasc dispose of without impacting on its core key objects in terms of research and development and advisory services, which are key to the organisation?  How much more land is available for that?  In the absence of a sale of capital assets such as land or a direct capital subvention by way of a direct Vote from the Government - the Department's budget from the Government - how else will Teagasc raise money?  That is the key question.  Teagasc has a lot of objectives and there seem to be many innovations on its part.</p> <p>  Waiting lists for young people are a cause of concern.  The situation is better than it was.  Teagasc has done its best.  I see it has identified the reasons for waiting lists so that is a good start.  Normally, we would be querying Teagasc about the reasons.  Teagasc is saying it does not have enough people and that the salary on offer to young qualified researchers in particular is inadequate.  I would probably broadly agree with that.  Has Teagasc brought the issue to the attention of Government?  There is an incongruence between Government policy, which is to accelerate intergenerational transfers, and a situation where less than 1% of agricultural land is becoming available on the market every year to allow somebody new to enter the sector.  The problem is that it is very difficult to enter the sector.  A young person telephoned me this morning on my way here.  This person was ready to take on 150 acres and wanted to know whether I would speak to somebody in connection with the possibility of leasing that land.  As a committee, we make recommendations with regard to stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax.  These are all great policies but what happens if they cannot function because of the age limits and because Teagasc cannot get young people through and there is a logjam at its end?</p><p> Mr. Herlihy is saying we need additional resources to ensure that those online and distance education programmes, as well as direct courses, be made available in Mullingar, Ballyhaise, Athenry, Gurteen or wherever, because that is absolutely critical.  I support Teagasc's efforts in that regard.  We will have to tackle this head on, probably with the Minister, on Teagasc's behalf to ensure that additional resources are made available.  I note that full-time people will be needed in those roles; part-time work would be a sticking plaster solution that would cure the problem now only for it to accumulate again.  I support Mr. Herlihy and wish him well in his role as chairman with Professor Boyle, who has been there for a long time.  Both of them will do a good job and their role is pivotal to ensuring that agriculture is in a position to meet the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#G00200"><p>I welcome the new chairman and the director of Teagasc.  It is very important that the committee can discuss with the leading organisations of the agricultural community their vision for that community in a very challenging time, whether it is in respect of weather issues or the age profile of the farming community, which is probably a bigger issue for us.  They are issues that we really need to discuss.</p><p>On the age profile of Teagasc itself, how do Mr. Herlihy and Professor Boyle feel it is going to develop in the coming years?  The opening address stated that there was an issue with funding, bringing in graduates and people at that level.  My understanding of the organisation is that it has a very good, solid core of advisers but that they are of a certain demographic and age.  Somewhat like the farming issue itself, is there a fear that there could be a situation in five or ten years' time whereby Teagasc will have a cohort of people going into retirement and insufficient numbers being brought in at the other end?  Could that be an issue for the organisation?  What is the age profile of the organisation and what are the plans going forward in this respect?</p><p>The age profile of farming is probably the biggest issue in so many ways.  A study was produced a few years ago that said there were more farmers over 80 than under 35.  The way to deal with that is through education.  What are Teagasc's long-term plans to improve the education offering available to the agricultural community of whatever age or gender?  Could the witnesses elaborate on the success or, as some might say, failure of the discussion groups?  I was a member of one myself that was very successful but some would claim that under the new regime, discussion groups have not quite taken off, that in many ways the discussion groups are outside the Department led scheme and are being run by Teagasc still but in a kind of <i>ad hoc</i>way.  For the training of farmers and knowledge transfer, discussion groups are probably the key tool that will be used going forward.</p><p>Could the witnesses elaborate on the apprenticeships and training at levels 5 and 6?  An issue that has materialised in my part of the world - I suppose it could be any part of the world - is the level of training of the host farmers.  What audit system are we providing for them?  Do we have legacy host farmers who have been there for generations and have they moved with the system?  Has Teagasc reviewed that?  Will all host farmers in future have to measure grass or have the ability to do so?  If they do not have those or other technologies, how can they be the mentors who are required for the young recruits who are going to be a major part of our agriculture industry?  How are we going to ensure that host farmers have the ability to mentor their trainees in order that the entire agricultural community can gain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#G00300"><p>I welcome the new chairman of Teagasc and his chief executive.  The greatest challenge facing us at the moment is climate change, the targets and restrictions it will impose on us and how as an industry we are going to be able to adapt to them.  I would like the chairman to give an outline of Teagasc's plans.  The sustainability of food production is going to be the by-word for the next decade.  We see already that some of our continental colleagues are having quota restrictions put on them as regards production of phosphorous.  It is definitely a new quota being placed on them and it has implications for us on the pig industry side and particularly on the dairy side.  On the staff side of things, is a recruitment embargo still in place within Teagasc?</p> <p>  Three to four years have passed since the abolition of quotas.  As Mr. Herlihy showed in his slide, production has expanded rapidly.  Unfortunately I do not think the profit has marched with it but that is an argument for another forum.  Our green image is paramount to our sales in all our sectors.  We have to be careful with expansion that we do not lose that green image.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard referred to discussion groups.  I spoke to a discussion group a couple of weeks ago and by the time 10 p.m. came they were virtually all asleep in their chairs.  Just three or four years after the abolition of quotas, burnout is becoming an issue with dairy farmers.  There are labour shortages and pressures on the profitability of the sector and on cashflow.  Even the availability of qualified labour is an issue.  We were always told about New Zealand and the burnout that dairy farmers experienced there.  I see in my own locality that young fellows are going to become old men very fast and it is going to be a huge issue.  When I was wearing another hat, we talked about what was the most appropriate and economical herd size for a one-man unit, how many cows he could milk.  In my view that figure has shot upwards.  We are at the stage where he might have the number of cows he needs to make a viable income but whether it is the amount of work he can do is a different equation.  What are Teagasc's views on the optimum number of cows a one-man unit could handle and that should deliver a reasonable income for him?</p> <p>  The bioeconomy links into climate change and the research that has been done there.  What is Teagasc's input in that area?  The committee visited Professor Kevin O'Connor and his colleagues in UCD last June.  There is very valuable research going on there.  There was an open day in Lisheen last Friday and great strides are being made in that area on making food more sustainable.  Is Teagasc feeding into that research?  Has it an input into it?  I was often in the research centre in Moorepark and saw the great work that was done there in developing products for the market.  I have not been there for a number of years but I presume that work is going on apace.  Is Teagasc linked into the bioeconomy and that faculty in UCD?</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked how many of the young farmers Teagasc is training are going back to family farms.  There are issues regarding the availability of land for younger farmers and their ability to get access to it.</p><p>We have many different schemes in place but larger units of land are being leased and that is making it untenable for younger farmers to take out land as they are unable to compete with larger commercial outfits.  We can have the best educated young farmers but if we do not do something to give younger farmers access and availability to land, they will not achieve their potential.  That is certainly an issue in my part of the country where land lease prices have shot up and land is being leased in increasingly larger blocks, which is making it more difficult and in some cases virtually impossible for young farmers to get started.</p><p> Another issue of concern is the attitude of the banks and the availability of credit.  Those who do not need it are able to get access to low-cost credit while the man who is starting off and needs a helping hand might get credit but he gets it at a very high cost, which puts a significant burden on his investment.  Do the witnesses from Teagasc have a view on what we should do in terms of access to land and access to credit for younger farmers?</p></speech>

I also welcome the chief executive officer, Professor Gerry Boyle.  I have a few questions for Mr. Herlihy.</p> <p>  Following on what Deputy Cahill said about the climate change challenge and targets and the Food Wise 2025 targets, I am interested to hear about the juxtaposition of both of those targets and how Mr. Herlihy envisages the situation evolving.</p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Herlihy mentioned the difficulty in recruiting staff and the need to have additional flexibility and capacity to employ teaching staff as well.  He also referred to the waiting lists within Teagasc for part-time students.  That has been a particular issue for students in Donegal.  There is an exceptional college in Ballyhaise and there are also part-time courses available in Donegal.  Waiting lists are an issue in particular in the west and the north west.  Teagasc must be empowered to recruit additional staff.  Could Mr. Herlihy elaborate further on that?  The committee should support the recruitment objective and should try to ensure that the waiting lists can be addressed in order that there would not be significant waiting times for young people who want to do a course and to get into farming.</p> <p>  Teagasc has had a role in monitoring the fodder crisis.  The last month has been positive in that regard in terms of trying to address the gap.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Herlihy's perspective on the winter ahead and Teagasc's position in terms of that particular challenge in the months ahead.</p> <p>  My final question relates to Teagasc's capacity in terms of advisory staff.  A common theme coming from advisers is that in recent years they have been bogged down with the burden of assisting farmers with applications for various programmes, including the basic payment scheme, BPS, applications, returns and administration to the extent that many of them are under pressure in terms of being on the ground and offering advice to farmers.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Herlihy's perspective in that regard because ultimately a lot of the engagement farmers have is with the advisers.  Recently, there has been an increase in the number of private advisers.</p></speech>

I apologise if some of my questions repeat what others have asked.</p> <p>  I wish to ask specifically about climate change and Teagasc's role in that regard.  Much of the research on Teagasc's website appears to be at a very early stage in terms of establishing the extent of the problems.  What research does Teagasc intend to carry out on climate change mitigation measures?  We all know it is vitally important that the agriculture sector participates in whatever mitigation we can put in place, and that will be even more important in the years to come.  I would like to hear Mr. Herlihy's views in that regard and what he expects to happen.  Perhaps I am incorrect in my view of the extent of the current research being carried out by Teagasc.  I invite Mr. Herlihy to expand on that for me because it is very important.</p> <p>  I am interested in what Mr. Herlihy said about the capital requirements of Teagasc and how he expects them to be met.  I could be wrong, but from reading between the lines he is talking about private sector involvement, which would worry me because Teagasc should have an independent role.  How does he expect the issue to be addressed and does he envisage that it will be solely addressed by means of the public sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#H00500"><p>I wish Mr. Herlihy well in his new position.  I have a couple of questions.  Reference has been made to climate change.  When the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, was established some decades ago it was about quality, affordable, traceable food and now farmers and the agriculture sector must take on board environmental obligations as we learn more about science and the interaction of human beings with the environment.  There has been much talk about culling the national herd and extreme suggestions such as veganism, for example.  I wish to ground the debate a little.  Professor Boyle has been pretty upfront about the situation and our climate change targets in the context of agriculture.  Although great strides have been made since the early 1990s in reducing carbon emissions, and we are leaders in many respects, the national herd has increased with consequential difficulties.  People have spoken about reducing the national herd and planting land but at the end of the day we are talking about food.  I do not hear too much about where we are going to get protein or the suitability of crops.  I have not heard it said that we should plant edible beans.  My understanding is that it is a precarious endeavour, especially for food production in this country.  I do not think we have been given the full picture in the sense that the message has not gone out that we produce food in a carbon-efficient manner and for the alternatives to be outlined.  Taking food from some country in the tropics that happens to efficiently grow beans or other protein food crops also creates a significant carbon footprint.  If, for some reason, we got out of beef, some other country would move to fill the gap.  I would welcome some comments in that regard from Professor Boyle.  In some ways there is a lot of hysteria around climate change and we must deal with it, but we cannot crush people in the process.</p> <p>  Teagasc has been very proactive in the area of soil management and training farmers in how to get the most out of soil, and in particular maximising grassland production.  We have had what one could call extreme weather events in recent years and in general the weather seems to be a lot more precarious.  Does Teagasc chart a maximum stocking level for the fodder and grass we can produce and whether we have stocking levels in excess of that?  My point is not related to reducing carbon emissions but relates to the point at which we could not feed our own animals.  Has that point been established?  What studies have been undertaken in that regard?</p> <p>  I had the pleasure of attending a presentation ceremony in Mayo last Friday night for green certificates.</p><p>It was great to see there all the participants and their families and to learn of all the work done.  The participants were rightly very proud to receive their green certificates.</p><p> With regard to land mobility, how many students undertake farming courses with Teagasc but do not have land or are hoping to get land?  I am not talking about cases where a parent is going to leave one land but about people who are a step removed and just hoping to get land.  How many are doing the course and hoping to enter the food industry in some area as opposed to farming?  Could I have a breakdown of the figures?  How many people are actually waiting for land?  How many people with no farming background do the green certificate course?  It is mainly people from a farming tradition who go into agriculture.</p></speech>

We can have the representatives back in at a later stage, perhaps to discuss Teagasc's annual report, which will generate considerable discussion.  We are just dealing with one particular matter today.</p></speech>

I wish the best of luck to the chairman designate.  I would like to know his thoughts on the beef genomics scheme and on the stocking rate given the current position on beef.  What are his thoughts on the factory feed lots?  Is the market being distorted?  Teagasc does a lot of research and, in fairness to it, it is very good at it.  I have spoken to Professor Boyle numerous times.  The likes of FRS has been contracted by Teagasc to do GLAS plans and so on.  Teagasc had not the manpower itself because it lost staff.  Should the ACA or private planners not come together and tender in this regard?  Would there be an opportunity?</p> <p>  Teagasc is subsidised by the State.  Professor Boyle will have argued over the years that it was not getting enough.  The funding is for research and all the various programmes it puts together.  A planner wishing to use the carbon navigator or that type of service in a private capacity must pay a fee.  What are Teagasc&rsquo;s thoughts on that?</p> <p>  What are the delegates&rsquo; thoughts on willow and forestry?  Figures are coming out about willow.  We know of farmers in County Meath who have dug it up and said it is not effective.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  What are their views on young farmers?  A new scheme is being created for them at the moment.  What are their thoughts on the CAP?  What are their thoughts on factory feed lots and the distortion of the markets, especially in the beef sector?  What are their thoughts on the suckler herd and on how to make sure it is saved?</p> <p>  Consider what happens when we are selling ourselves abroad.  We rear a lot of our stock on grass but, to put it bluntly, questions are currently being asked in Europe about how we are rearing some of our beef stock.  Bearing in mind the CAP and nitrates requirements, do the delegates agree that, for every unit, we need an acre of green land?  </p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Herlihy will address some of the points addressed to him directly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herlihy" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#J00500"><p>I thank members for the questions.  They all mentioned climate change.  From my point of view and that of Teagasc, the train has left the station.  With regard to farming in the future, from both image and sustainability perspectives, we must realise climate change is here.  We also have Brexit to address.  Instead of cursing in the dark, it is important to embrace it from a positive perspective.</p> <p>  It was queried whether we have to decrease stocking figures to stay within the limits.  Agriculture has to be sustainable under three pillars: staying within the ambit of climate change requirements; staying within the ambit of sustainability, which covers water quality and the environment; and remaining profitable to ensure we have viable farm entities.  In ensuring all of these, what is the role of Teagasc?  It is very much in the area of mitigation and determining what to put in place to mitigate carbon emissions to ensure we have a vibrant agriculture sector for the future.</p> <p>  The major issue at the moment is the dairy sector.  I am from a dairy background.  It is important to recognise that the dairy sector is the sector that will be most challenged by virtue of the high stocking densities.  What are we doing in this regard?  The first options are the soft options.  One is milk recording.  Allied to that is the economic breeding index to ensure we have profitable and high-performing animals in the herd.  Equally, it is important that we encourage more forestry on farms, particularly in the dairying area.  We should also examine the replacement of fossil fuels from an energy-credit perspective.</p> <p>  I am conscious that our carbon emissions are lumped in with residential and transport emissions.  From an agriculture perspective, we have to be responsible for areas within our ambit.  A game-changer, if we are to make a very significant reduction is changing from the area of calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, to stabilised urea.  There is much scientific work being done on this.  We all grew up with the spreading of slurry using a slash-plate system.  We are now moving to the injector system or, more recently, the dribble bar.  This is a huge area.  We have got to be positive and proactive.  We must ensure we have vibrant agriculture and a vibrant sector that will feed off agriculture.  It is important that we achieve the growth targets set in Food Wise 2025.  The role of Teagasc, as a scientific, independent researcher, is to examine the mitigating effects.  We can have a two-pronged approach, involving our having vibrant agriculture while at the same time tackle carbon emissions from a positive perspective.  Climate change is upon us and we owe it to ourselves and the next generation to deal with it.</p> <p>  I will deal with issues in the order in which they were raised.  Deputy Penrose asked about the Kilkenny farm.  It involves a programme I have been very passionate about, having being chairman of Glanbia group.  I was its first chairman.  The initiative has three stakeholders.  It is important to remember Teagasc has done a splendid job there.  It is a research entity.  The lesson to be learned is that any mistakes made on the farm must not be replicated by the wider farming community.  To date, it has explained everything that is happening in detail, including in regard to the turnout date, the number of kilogrammes fed, etc. I appreciate there was an air of concern in regard to the bad weather, the snowy period, in the early spring.</p></speech>

I assure the committee that it is all under control.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the recently-launched milk centre.  This is hugely important, particularly for young farmers.  Given that we are in a digital age, we need to communicate appropriately with younger farmers.</p> <p>  Education was covered by a number of speakers.  I must be upfront and note to Deputy McConalogue that we appreciate that the waiting list is higher in his area than in others.  We are very conscious of and focused on addressing that matter.  I note upfront that we recognise the longer waiting list.  Many questions were asked about our &euro;56 million income.  I do not have all of that but we can get back to the committee and deal with it.  It is made up of a whole combination of issues.  The important thing is that it is there and, hopefully, growing.  We will certainly come back to the committee on that.</p></speech>

Glanbia is very involved in the very important bio-transformation project at Lisheen.  Glanbia and Enterprise Ireland are involved in that and in the area of science and development.</p> <p>  Many members referred to the staff embargo and future staffing needs and Senator Lombard queried age profiles.  That is the reason we need to be conscious of it.  The age profile of farmers is something we have always considered.  While that is something we cannot change, we can encourage young farmers and put a programme in place to educate them and ensure that they have the appropriate training to avail of the important stamp duty mitigation which is available, as well as the vital capital allowances relating to land transfers.  That is hugely important and has been made available and promoted by successive Governments.  From a Teagasc point of view, we must ensure that we have the appropriate staffing in order to make sure farmers have the necessary green certification to avail of those benefits.</p> <p>  A query was raised in respect of the number of people who go back to full-time farming.  I do not have the figure but it is something to which we can come return.  Not everybody must or should want to be a full-time farmer.  It will depend on location and farm size.  Whether they are full-time or part-time, what is hugely important is that farmers live in rural Ireland.  By having people living in rural Ireland, we will ensure we have a sustainable and vibrant rural community.  As chairman of Teagasc, I note that this is something of which we are hugely conscious.  Wearing a different hat, I note that in Glanbia, it was always said that every &euro;1 invested in a farm generated &euro;4 in the wider economy.  Agriculture is hugely important within the farm and outside the farm gate.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned factory feedlots.  Whether I like it or not, I am wearing a Teagasc hat today and Teagasc does not get involved in policy issues of that nature.  The Deputy made the point about my personal view on CAP.  CAP is hugely important to us.  I was aware personally in that I got a text on my mobile phone on 16 October to say the CAP payment was available in my bank account.  The committee can rest assured that I immediately checked my bank account and it was not there.  I checked again at midnight and it was still not there.  The important thing is that it arrived, safe and sound, at 9 a.m. the following day.  Irrespective of size or scale, CAP is hugely important, including from the perspective of the environmental behaviour of farmers.  It is important to ensure that all farmers farm within the code of practice as we ought to do.</p> <p>  On the suckler scheme and whether we should have 1 acre per livestock unit-----</p></speech>

We have a nitrates derogation currently, which is hugely important for the future of dairying in particular.  Other farmers do not have to avail of that level of derogation due to lower stocking intensities.  I am conscious of that.</p> <p>  There were many other questions.  There are two areas which are extremely important for me, as chairman of Teagasc.  I am very conscious of the fact that dairy farming is the engine of sustainable and profitable agriculture.  That can spread to other areas, whether it is tillage farmers assisting dairy farmers by growing animal feed crops or some of our existing beef farmers supporting dairy farmers by rearing heifers.  The focus of Teagasc must be on sustainable farming systems.  Not everyone will want to get up in the morning to milk cows, nor should that be the case.  Equally, however, farmers can tap into the dairying sector by helping to provide for its sustainable future.  That is what is important.</p> <p>  I am not exactly sure about willow farming.  However, I am aware that many schemes are driven by grants from Brussels.  I will have to kick to touch on that one because I do not want to speak about something I do not know about.  In any event, dairying is very important but Teagasc must be concerned about certain considerations.  If we speak about the sustainability of the maximum number of farmers, the low-level of profitability of beef farming is an issue of concern.  We need to be very conscious of this.  As the father of five children, one of whom is at home farming, I note that we must be conscious of the fact that a farmer who stays at home to farm on a full-time basis must have the very same opportunity to earn a viable livelihood as his or her siblings who have gone onto professional careers in other sectors.  That is something of which I am very conscious.</p> <p>  Education in farming is of major importance.  Teagasc must keep abreast of that.  This is why I am so conscious of the need to recruit the brightest and best and to endeavour to retain them.  While we cannot retain all of them, we live in a digital era and need young people who are capable of communicating with our younger farmers in particular.  Whereas the young adviser is the future of Teagasc, the young farmer is the future of agriculture.  Things are changing, including farming practices.</p><p>One of the members asked about the type of farmers who will emerge from the apprenticeship schemes we are about to embrace.  We need farmers who are high-spec and who embrace technology, whether it be in respect of grass measurement or whatever.  Interchanging, in a very important way, with the researchers at Moorepark, County Cork, has fed into the apprenticeship scheme.</p><p> Labour is extremely important on farms.  I think it was Deputy Cahill who made that point.  In terms of one-man units, it is not for me to say what the appropriate number of animals or cows is for a one person.  Often, the number is dictated by the level of borrowing relating to the farm or the level of off-farm income and whether a spouse works elsewhere.  No two farms are the same.  Labour and its availability is hugely important, particularly in an Irish context.  I have spent many years as chairman of Glanbia.  My wife and I did not have one of our children available to work our farm during that particular time but we were very fortunate to have good staff from Poland.  They are non-Irish people and they are still with us today.  In the context of non-nationals coming here to work, they are very important.  As we are all aware, and this is something that was mentioned to me quite recently, construction is about to take off again, which - as happened in the past - will take people out of agriculture.  Equally, it is important that labourers are well paid, well accommodated and well treated within the agriculture sector in order to ensure that we have a continuous supply of workers.</p></speech>

Very seriously, the amount of fodder depends on the area.  Let us not forget that no two farms are the same.  I live in one of the drier areas in the south.  In my area, what has happened with third-cut silage has been enormously important.  I have no doubt that there is still a fodder deficit in some areas.  During the key period of the good weather, Teagasc played a hugely important role.  Teagasc officials met farmers' groups, assisted with budgeting and dealt with the issue.  Teagasc has been exceptionally proactive and encouraged farmers to do their appropriate measurements and deal with the deficit.  There is still a fodder shortfall in some areas.  In many areas, however, an acceptable back-end has filled that gap enormously.</p> <p>  I come from the private sector so I am concerned with the capital budget.  Teagasc is unusual in not having access to additional funds.  I do not for a moment suggest that Teagasc should skip away from the ambit of strict and careful fiscal policy.  It should not.  Having said that, in the past we have sold sites or farms that were no longer needed, which were used to fund some of our very important capital projects.  Let me give an example. We have spoken about education, as have all of the members.  Education and dealing with the green certificate issue is extremely important.  I am glad to say that in the past the Government gave us the green light to recruit in excess of 40 staff members to deal with that very pressing issue.  We will consider the continuation of that.  It is vital to ensure that we can fulfil our educational needs and deal with the green certificate movement for a variety of reasons.</p> <p>  Not having access to an overdraft facility within the framework of strict fiscal governance is an impediment from the point of view of dealing with our objectives.  One of the very important objectives is climate change.  I refer to the latter as the new kid on the block.  We have got to operate within the sphere of climate change.  Rather than cursing the dark, we must deal with climate change mitigation from a positive and progressive perspective.  In order to do so, we need appropriately qualified scientists.</p></speech>

I am chairman of the authority but it is not for me to say that the issue can be resolved by doing A, B or C.  That is a matter for the director and his team.  Once I joined the board and sat down with the key people, namely, Professor Boyle and his team, I became aware that a blind person could have identified the capital requirement as an issue.  Teagasc must be a progressive entity.  It is no different from other commercial entities and must grow and be fit for purpose.  As I see it, the capital requirement is a very clear impediment for the future.  Coupled with that is the issue of retaining and recruiting key people.  Teagasc is an outstanding organisation but it is no different from any other entity in that it is only as good as the people who lead it at a particular time.  Teagasc must recruit really good people because they are the leaders of tomorrow.  The pay cap is an impediment.  However, it can be tweaked without creating an issue.  Often, one recruits a person for a key position who may be a future leader.  He or she may have completed his or her PhD or worked in the private sector so the pay cap makes no sense.  We simply cannot recruit talented young people at very low pay.  A degree of tweaking can be done without involving unions or overstepping the powers of area management.  If we are to attract key people for the future then the low entry level of pay is unsustainable and inappropriate for the future.</p></speech>

I was appointed chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board on 6 September 2018.  I am a solicitor by profession and I am currently the State solicitor for Cork city.  I am a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and an accredited mediator.  I have served as a vice chairman of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I am a member of the panel of chairpersons of the mental health tribunals and am also a statutory arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 23 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Bovine Tuberculosis) Regulations 2015.  I live in Mallow, County Cork, and am from Clonmel, County Tipperary.  I have served as president of the North and East Cork Bar Association, president of the Mallow Chamber of Commerce, president of the Rotary Club in Mallow and chairman of Mallow GAA club and Mallow rugby club. I remain chairman of the management committee of the Mallow GAA complex which remains the largest GAA complex constructed outside of Dublin.</p> <p>  My interest in greyhounds is primarily through my father, Sean Nyhan, and also due to the fact that I come from Clonmel, which regards itself as the true home of the greyhound industry in Ireland.  Ours was a traditional two greyhound family.  We raced our animals at the local Clonmel track, with very occasional trips further afield when merited.  At a later stage, I was a member of a syndicate which owned a number of greyhounds that raced, with very limited success, in Cork and Tralee.  I have served for the past three years as a member of the Irish Greyhound Board.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that the greyhound industry has experienced challenging times and continues to do so, but I am satisfied that we are making progress.  Greyhound racing has a long history and is part of the culture and social fabric of the entire community.  It has a strong rural base, particularly associated with the farming community, and also enjoys strong support from the urban areas where the stadia are located.  In 2017, the board, prompted by the committee, commissioned Jim Power Economics to undertake an assessment of the financial and economic impact of the Irish greyhound industry.  This study was a follow-up to the previous assessment undertaken by the same group in April 2011.  The published report demonstrates that while there has been a downturn in the overall industry since 2011, it remains a very significant and strong industry.  It supports over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs, has 7,313 owners and delivers an economic impact of the order of &euro;300 million to the national economy.  This level of impact cannot be underestimated, particularly in rural areas, and the industry remains an important contributor to sustained rural development, which is a stated objective for semi-State bodies.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will be aware that various studies have been undertaken on our industry in recent years culminating with the committee's report in January 2016.  Bord na gCon has addressed the cumulative recommendations of these reports and we have assigned the necessary resources for implementation.  I had the pleasure of appearing before the committee earlier this year, with Dr. Colm Gaynor, for the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Greyhound Industry Bill, which is currently before the Seanad.  It is clear that updating the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 is much needed in order to provide a modern legislative framework for the industry.  The Bill will strengthen proper governance and give statutory effect to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  It will give greater specificity and enhance the existing regulatory powers in the areas of sales, training and racing of greyhounds, with particular reference to doping.  It contains provisions to enable Bord na gCon to develop a real-time traceability system, either alone or in co-operation with others, for racing greyhounds in order to identify those in possession of greyhounds and attribute accountability to them.  The new Bill will also place the control committee and the appeals committee on a statutory basis and will include measures to improve enforcement of penalties.</p> <p>  During 2017, the board spent considerable time formulating a new strategic plan for the industry for the period from 2018 to 2022.  This plan was the subject of an industry-wide consultation process and also had regard to the studies already undertaken.  The plan focuses on seven key pillars of activity comprising three areas of growth: growing owners and breeders; growing tote and wagering activity; and growing attendances.  These three areas are underpinned by four foundation pillars, namely, integrity and regulation, high welfare standards, organisational structures and information technology.  This plan was approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, since its publication in March 2018, we have begun to progress the many actions required under it.  Provided we can achieve our funding targets annually, with the implementation of the initiatives set out in the strategic plan, we would be running a fair, transparent and highly-regulated sport and offering a top-class experience across all our stadia - supported by a single, committed and innovative Irish Greyhound Board team - where the greyhound will always come first.</p> <p>  The sale of the Harold's Cross greyhound stadium, which was finalised in May, has enabled the board to deal with long-term debt issues and, for the first time in many years, we have some funding for investment in track infrastructure and the wider industry.</p><p>This has enabled the board to deal with long-term debt issues and for the first time in many years we have some funding for investment in track infrastructure and the wider industry.  The surplus proceeds from the sale amounted to approximately &euro;6 million and these have been subject to a detailed business plan approved by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The plan provides for: a &euro;3 million investment in Shelbourne Park to bring the facility up to the expectation of modern users and customers; lesser sums to be expended on Curraheen Park and other stadia improvements; and a possible redevelopment in Kilkenny together with &euro;1 million for significant upgrades in information technology.</p><p> One of the key areas for attention within the strategic plan is a systematic review of the industry footprint.  The board is committed to conducting a strategic review of all stadia to determine the industry footprint for the future.  I am pleased to advise the committee that a tender process to appoint an independent party to undertake this review has commenced.  Of necessity the review will involve extensive consultation with stakeholders and we would expect a final report by March 2019.</p><p> Communication within and outside the industry has long been identified as a challenge for Bord na gCon.  The national greyhound consultative forum was established under my predecessor Phil Meaney in 2016 with the aim of engagement with representatives of the wider industry, and this forum now meets on a quarterly basis.  It provides an invaluable mechanism for the board to consult with stakeholders and to make proposals for change within the industry.  It also allows stakeholders to raise concerns directly with the board and the executive.  A range of issues has been dealt with through this forum to date, including the greyhound grading system, welfare issues and the fixture and events calendar.  The board has also put in place a communication arrangement with Oireachtas Members and briefings have taken place in November 2017 and in May of this year.  It is our intention to continue this information and dialogue.</p><p> We have recognised Brexit as a key challenge for us as the United Kingdom represents the principal market for greyhound sales.  There is also ongoing transportation of greyhounds to participate in competitions in the UK and UK based greyhounds to participate in competitions in Ireland.  As recently as 26 September 2018 we considered this issue in detail at the national greyhound consultant forum and we were fortunate to have a presentation from an officer of the Brexit section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Following from same, we will arrange for affected sections of our industry to engage with the Department so that the final shape of any Brexit arrangement can satisfactorily meet the needs in the industry.</p><p> I have some personal priorities for the next five years.  By the end of my term, I would expect that the Greyhound Racing Bill would be fully operational and that greyhound welfare would be a priority throughout the industry.  I also want to have improved the cohesion among the stakeholders so that attendances at all our stadia will have increased significantly.  A colleague recently reminded me of the words of Henry Ford: "Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success."</p><p> In conclusion, Chairman, I wish to acknowledge the work of this committee on matters relating to the Irish greyhound industry and its ongoing support in relation to resourcing and improving same.  I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend here today and I am happy to continue to work with this committee and its members in progressing and addressing the issues affecting the Irish greyhound industry.  I am now happy to deal as best I can with any questions that members might have.</p></speech>

I put on the record my appreciation of the work of the outgoing chairman, Phil Meaney, who steered the industry through a difficult period, and steered it very well.</p> <p>  I have a number of points I would like to make.  Our greyhound industry is under pressure, and there is no point in denying that.  Attendances are falling and dog numbers are falling.  We need to get more imaginative to try to keep the industry in place and in business.  I am a director of a privately owned greyhound track and I see at first hand how difficult it is for a track to break even and to stay in business.</p> <p>  In the previous presentation to the committee, we spoke about climate change.  Dog welfare is the elephant in the room.  The issue must be addressed satisfactorily if our industry is to prosper and survive.  When many dog owners talk about welfare, they think it is about the sand on the track and racing surface, but welfare goes a lot further than that.  It is also about the life of the greyhound after it finishes racing and the way it is going to be looked after.  With regard to the courses, I am on the track side and there are many issues that need to be addressed.  I appreciate the board has directed money towards dog welfare but more needs to be done.  We have to get the public to realise that the dogs are being looked after extremely well and are well cared for.  If our industry is to progress we have to win that battle.  At the moment we are definitely not winning it.  Dog welfare links into the whole issue of regulation and the enforcement of regulation.  Unfortunately the industry has got a name for malpractices and that even when a malpractice is found, the board is unable to enforce penalties and fines.  As we sit here, the new Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 is being discussed in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Hopefully, it will address these necessary issues.  There can be no place in our industry for people who break rules or who use banned substances.  It is absolutely essential we are seen as being an industry that does not tolerate any breaking of rules or regulations.  It has to be enforced.  Hopefully, this can be done with the new Bill.  I cannot stress enough to Mr. Nyhan the importance of winning this battle with regard to the public.  We have had too many headlines of dogs being found with substances in their systems, and no sanctions being enforced against the trainer.  We have had this on very high profile nights in the industry and it has done us a serious amount of harm.  We have to get beyond that.  In his term as chairman, I would stress to Mr. Nyhan that regulations in place are enforced.  It is absolutely paramount to restore public confidence that everything is above board in the industry.</p> <p>  With regard to the prize money that is available, we have to make prize money attractive.  Prize money must be in place so when owners or syndicates have a greyhound that wins a race or two, they can break even with the training fees in a calendar year.  We have to make it attractive.  A percentage of that prize money has to be available for trainers also.  The day of private trainers has definitely dwindled.  In his opening statement the chairman said that the greyhound industry is associated with the farming community, which is correct, but with the time pressures facing farmers and with different changes in society, it is more and more the case that the availability of labour on farms is greatly reduced.  The training of dogs has definitely become more of a professional operation.  It is essential that this is made an economically viable profession.  Giving trainers a share of increased prize money is the way to go.  It is important for owners and syndicates to see they have an opportunity to at least break even if they have reasonable success on the track.</p> <p>  I now turn to attendances and attracting people back through the turnstiles.  I would often take a walk to the Shelbourne Park track in the evening, especially during the summer months.  Summer evenings at the tracks, even here in the capital, are poorly attended.  We need to get people back in through the turnstiles.  I know that Mr. Nyhan will be giving this issue paramount attention but we need more imagination around the bets that are available on the tote.  A couple of years ago, the jackpot on a Saturday night in Shelbourne Park created great betting interest across the country on the tote.  That has evaporated.  We need something like that to attract punters in to invest in the Saturday night.  A big pot in place would attract the punter and get the tote punter back in.  The tote could be an attractive proposition for attendees at the tracks.  At the moment people have not been betting on the tote at rural tracks and in Dublin.  It is just not happening.  The pools or bets have not been catching the public imagination and it is absolutely essential that they do so.</p><p> I am also worried about on-track bookmakers, about whom some say I have a bee in my bonnet.  Their numbers have diminished significantly in the last couple of years.  I would say they are down by up to 80% over a ten-year period.  The proposition made in the budget that betting tax be increased from 1% to 2% is one I have raised at meetings of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party.  I hope we might be able to secure an exemption in the Finance Bill for on-track bookmakers.  It is a betting tax on turnover and I just do not think on-track bookmakers would be able to cover it.  We could see their complete extinction, even though they bring an atmosphere to race tracks, whether it be horse racing or dog racing.  They bring an atmosphere that is unique and it would be a huge loss.  I know that betting turnover in bookmakers has dropped significantly, but if we allow the demise of on-track bookmakers, we will live to regret it.</p><p> The chairman is coming in at a challenging time for the industry.  The sale of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium generated an awful lot of debate, a period during which the previous chairman suffered a lot.  It was the correct decision as it took away the debt that was hanging like a guillotine over the board.  However, that opportunity will not come again.  There will not be another asset like Harold's Cross greyhound stadium to sell.  Therefore, we have to ensure we drive forward from here and that the funds left over from the sale will be used as wisely as possible.  We need to regenerate the industry and Mr. Nyhan's term of office will be a determining factor in whether the industry survives.  It is under extreme pressure and we have to attract young people back to it.  The number of young people attending dog race meetings has dropped significantly.  Mr. Nyhan faces a lot of challenges, but he is extremely well qualified to hold the position in which tI wish him the best of luck.  I am involved in the industry which I would like to see doing well.  We face a lot of challenges that we cannot ignore.  I am not saying we cannot get it back to where it was, but we need imagination and to show a lot of initiative to do so.  I wish Mr. Nyhan well in his tenure.</p></speech>

There is no track close to my area.   The track in Lifford is the only one in County Donegal and I think it is in bother.  This might seem like a stupid question.  Mr. Nyhan talked about the crisis being at the level of the tracks, race meetings and stuff like that, but according to the annual reports for 2014 to 2017, inclusive, attendances per race meeting are actually very consistent.  The total figure goes from 644,000 in 2014 to 636,000 in 2016.  The figure for 2017 is a little different because of a dispute.  I do not know anything about it, but the number of race meetings seems to work out at about between 1,600 and 1,700, which seems to be a huge number.  Perhaps the idea should be to have fewer meetings but of better quality.  It works out at about 32 meetings per week.  Perhaps I am wrong and there is a reason for it.</p> <p>  Mr. Nyhan's term is five years.  I would flippantly say if he hopes to see the greyhound racing Bill implemented in that time, he is being a bit optimistic.</p></speech>

While the number of people attending has been static over a three-year period, it is not a sufficient number to sustain the industry.  The model requires a lot more to attend because the only way we can have more money for prize money - it is what funds the industry - is if more people attend and sponsor races.  We need to increase those figures in order that we can feed money back in.  The idea is that a person who owns one or two greyhounds should be able to run them without costing him money, but that is probably not the position.

A lot of what we asked for in terms of regulation has been included in the Bill.  The provisions will strengthen our hand and that of the various committees that will ultimately adjudicate in enforcing the regulations.  The Vice Chairman is absolutely correct when he says we have an unfortunate reputation, but really that is the perception, rather than being the actual problem.  The rate of adverse analytical findings is 0.45% out of approximately 5,000 tests.  In the last three years the rate has been 0.8%, just over 0.5% and 0.45%.  It is miniscule.  However, I accept fully what the Vice Chairman says.  </p> <p>  A question was asked about our procedures.  They were tested recently in an application before the High Court and, fortunately, held to be correct.  We hope that will continue to be the case.  </p> <p>  We have invested a lot of money in regulation.  In 2017 I think we spent &euro;2 million on various aspects.  We will have to continue to do so.  If we do not crack the problem, we will not be able to do all of the other things we need to do.</p></speech>

The committee is familiar with the background to the issue, but it is useful to restate the position to avoid confusion.  Therefore, my opening statement is intended to provide committee members with a broad overview of the aquaculture licensing system and how it operates; the key issues associated with the backlog which gave rise to the review; the key recommendations made in the review; and the progress made to date in their implementation.  I will be glad to take questions from them afterwards.</p> <p>  An aquaculture licence is required by law for the cultivation of finfish, shellfish and certain marine plants such as seaweed.  Some aquaculture takes place on land, but the vast majority of aquaculture activity takes place in the marine environment on the foreshore.  In Ireland almost all of the foreshore is in public ownership.  Therefore, aquaculture activity requires both an aquaculture licence to conduct operations and a companion foreshore licence to lawfully occupy the area of foreshore in question.  Even in the rare case of private ownership of foreshore, an aquaculture licence is required to engage in aquaculture activity.  The foreshore is measured from the high water mark out to 12 nautical miles and is approximately 39,000 square kilometres in overall size.  It is roughly equal in size to just over 50% of the land area of the State.  However, the areas suitable for aquaculture represent a small fraction of the foreshore and, in the case of finfish cultivation, are exclusively along the western seaboard. </p> <p>  My Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the following legislation: Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997; Foreshore Act 1933; EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC; EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC; Consolidated Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011/92/EU; and the public participation directive, otherwise known as the Aarhus Convention.  The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers, as well as various statutory consultees.  The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.  In addition to the legislation mentioned, my Department must adhere to a wide range of regulatory requirements and other legislation which impact on the licensing process.  The public participation directive has emerged as a crucial factor in the roll-out of the licensing system as it applies to individual cases.  The key aim of the directive is to grant the general public specific rights in gaining access to information in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and trans-boundary environment.  </p> <p>  The major complaint from aquaculture farmers about licensing relates to the backlog that has developed in the processing of licence applications.</p><p>The background to the backlog is that in 2007, the European Court of Justice issued a negative judgment against Ireland for breaches of the EU birds and habitats directives.  A large element of the judgment concerned a failure by the State to put in place a system for data collection, definition of scientific interests and adequate assessment of aquaculture licence applications in Natura 2000 areas.  At the time of the European Court of Justice case, national legislation was put in place to ensure that Irish aquaculture operations operating under pre-existing licences and that were seeking renewals could continue to operate under those licences until a determination could be made on their renewal applications in compliance with the Natura 2000 directives.</p><p> In the negotiations to address this European Court of Justice judgment and to enable aquaculture to continue in Natura 2000 areas in the interim, a process was agreed with the Directorate General for the Environment and this is being implemented.  The process includes data collection, the setting of conservation objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, identifying the scientific interests to be protected in the bays, the carrying out of appropriate assessments of the licence applications against those scientific interests and appropriate licensing, taking account of, among other things, Natura 2000 requirements.</p><p> The production of these appropriate assessments has been resource intensive and very time consuming, not least because of tidal cycles and seasonality issues relating to data gathering on bird migrations and other environmental phenomena.  In many cases multi-year time series data had to be collected.  In addition, the sea beds in Natura 2000 areas also had to be mapped to identify conservation interests.  For example, this work involved 123 survey events carried out by ten contractors.  In addition, profiling of aquaculture industry activities was carried out for all bays to define the likely interactions with conservation features of sites.  In many instances there were few data or little published literature on likely interactions between aquaculture activities and conservation features.  A number of targeted studies and reviews were commissioned to investigate responses of conservation features, for example, birds and-or habitats, to specific aquaculture and fisheries activities.  Many of these have subsequently been published in primary literature.  All of this preliminary work to prepare the groundwork for consideration of licensing went on from 2009 onwards.</p><p> I am glad to report that most of this data collection, definition of scientific interests and the appropriate assessment process itself is almost complete, and appropriate assessment reports have been received by my Department from the Marine Institute in respect of 29 bays.  These bays constitute the bulk of the aquaculture activity, and the work carried out since 2009 has permitted licensing in compliance with the Natura 2000 directives and the European Court of Justice judgment to commence.  Since licensing commenced under the new system, a little over 600 licensing decisions have been made on aquaculture sites around the coast up to the end of 2017.</p><p> Dealing with the Natura 2000 elements has been the major focus for all involved in the licensing process up to recently, but there are other issues, including legislative reform, the streamlining of procedures and the optimum use of technology associated with licensing, which also need to be addressed.  As a consequence of all these elements, I commissioned the independent review of aquaculture licensing in December 2016 and the report was delivered to me at the end of May 2017.  The review group carried out a detailed examination of the existing aquaculture licensing process, undertook comprehensive stakeholder consultation and looked at comparative national and international consent systems to determine best practice for managing a complex licensing process in a transparent, environmentally appropriate and legally robust manner.  The group&rsquo;s report is published and available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A total of 30 separate recommendations are contained in the report.</p><p> Since receiving the report of the review group, my Department has engaged in detailed consideration of the recommendations set out in the report with a view to their implementation, having regard to the legislative, environmental, technical and public interest issues that arise.  My Department has also engaged closely with industry representatives and relevant State agencies.  The core recommendation of the independent review was to deal with the backlog by the end of 2019.  In response to the priority given by stakeholders to the elimination of the licensing backlog, my Department has been actively working towards the achievement of 300 licence determinations this year with a further 300 projected for 2019.  I can confirm that the target of 300 licence determinations has been achieved two months ahead of schedule.  This is a very substantial achievement and gives a clear indication of my commitment and the commitment of my Department to dealing with this issue in a comprehensive manner.  I can further confirm that we are fully committed to achieving 300 further licence determinations in 2019 and that this will effectively eliminate the shellfish licensing backlog as an issue affecting the industry.  The elimination of the shellfish licensing backlog will be a game changer for the industry and will provide a solid footing for the industry, long demanded by industry representatives.</p><p> The bar chart that I have circulated with the script sets out clearly the dimensions of the change that has been brought about in 2018 and is projected for 2019.  Effectively, the rate of determinations of aquaculture licence applications this year is almost three times the level of decisions that were made in previous years.  Shellfish aquaculture represents by far the greatest number of operators who are also, in the main, small family-run businesses.  For this reason, and in conjunction with industry representatives, my Department has prioritised the elimination and reduction of the backlog in respect of shellfish aquaculture during 2018.  For 2019, it is expected that the backlog in shellfish aquaculture will be effectively eliminated.  Once shellfish farmers operating within Natura 2000 areas have been relicensed in compliance with the Natura 2000 directives, they can access development funding under our seafood development programme.</p><p> On finfish aquaculture, a focused modular approach towards addressing the backlog in finfish licensing will be accelerated.  The processing of applications for finfish licences in the marine environment is significantly more complex than the situation relating to shellfish aquaculture due to the requirement for operators to produce environmental impact statements and for my Department and relevant agencies to analyse these reports in detail.  My Department must then produce an environmental impact assessment for each application.  In addition, developments that apply generally to aquaculture licensing have a particular resonance for finfish licensing for the following reasons: a greater focus by environmental NGOs and the public on key EU legislation and heightened public awareness and concerns about aquaculture operations, mainly relating to salmon farming but also arising frequently in shellfish licensing.</p><p> There should be no doubt in anybody&rsquo;s mind that the core reason I established the independent aquaculture licensing review group was the need to address the licensing backlog arising from the European Court of Justice judgment.  This was the primary concern of industry stakeholders.  This core need is being actively and urgently addressed by my Department, and the first results of our efforts are discernible.  We have achieved 300 licence determinations to date this year.  I am confident that we will achieve a further 300 licence determinations next year.  The related recommendations are also being addressed and will be implemented as part of a larger reform of the regulatory process.  I have been very conscious, however, of the need to prioritise implementation in response to what the industry itself has pointed to as the most urgent issue, namely, the licensing backlog.  Once this has been eliminated for the bulk of operators, who are in the shellfish sector, they will be operating under ten-year licences and can access developmental funding and supports available from the State.</p><p> On finfish licensing, my Department is scheduled to request operators formally to submit environmental impact statements in respect of their licence renewal applications.  This request is scheduled to issue to all operators shortly and will specify the timeline for submission of the necessary documentation.  This process was commenced by my Department in 2014, but following strong representations from IFA aquaculture on behalf of the aquaculture industry, the matter was not advanced until additional guidelines and workshops on the issue were provided by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  In the context of the reference to the IFA, I pay tribute to the IFA aquaculture representative, Mr. Richie Flynn, who, sadly, passed away recently.  He had given many years of sterling service to the aquaculture sector, and his unfortunate and untimely passing is a great loss to the aquaculture sector and to everybody in the IFA.  I had the great privilege of working closely with him over many years, both as a Minister and also as an Opposition spokesperson.</p><p>He was always the most courteous of gentlemen to meet but he had a steely determination in respect of the sector he represented.  It would be remiss of me not to avail of the opportunity to acknowledge his role and his passing.</p><p> My Department indicated it would suspend its request in respect of this process until these workshops were complete.  This was without prejudice to any operator in the finfish industry who wished to submit a valid environmental impact statement in the interim.  The process will be renewed with requests for environmental impact statements before the end of the year.  This represents a significant response to the recommendations of the independent aquaculture licensing review group in the context of finfish aquaculture.  The provision of valid environmental impact statements in compliance with the guidelines prepared by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and given to applicants will enable my Department to advance these applications in line with the EU legal requirements.</p><p> An efficient and effective licensing system can be an important tool in the strategic direction of the aquaculture industry and can set the weather, so to speak, in terms of aquaculture development.  As indicated, my Department has delivered 300 aquaculture licence determinations this year, a trebling of the previous rate of determinations, and there is a commitment to deliver a further 300 next year with a view to clearing the backlog which built up due to the European Court of Justice judgment.  In addition, my Department is engaged in forward planning in conjunction with industry representatives and relevant agencies directly focused on the rapid reduction and elimination of the finfish licensing backlog.  A key part of this planning process is ensuring that the industry can continue to operate as normal in accordance with legislative requirements.  The legislative provisions that were put in place to enable operators to continue working, pending completion of the licensing process, in line with the EU Natura requirements have enabled all operators to continue their business.  This still applies.</p><p> It is important to note that while attention has been given to difficulties associated with licensing, this is in fact a buoyant industry with a good record of employment.  The 2018 BIM annual aquaculture survey indicates that Irish aquaculture output in 2017 increased to 47,147 tonnes of farm gate produce, worth &euro;208.4 million.  Production continued to expand in overall volume, which was up 7%, in value, which was up 24%, and in unit value from 2016.  The salmon sector was the major contributor to the increase in both overall volume and value, while oyster sector output continued to expand.  The unit value of both of these sectors continues to increase, as does the recognition of their product quality.  The bottom mussel sector continued to recover in 2017, although seed supply uncertainty remains a threat to this.  The overall industry employed almost 2,000 people directly on some 280 primary production units in 2017.</p><p> My Department has put in place substantial financial and other supports for the industry as a whole.  Financial support is supplied under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund operational programme and is directed towards three main areas: sustainable aquaculture production; knowledge, innovation and new technology; and more effective governance of marine planning.  In addition to the direct financial supports, BIM provides a range of technical supports to the aquaculture sector to assist in the development of existing businesses and to address industry-wide issues, such as disease management and the introduction of new technologies. </p><p> The steps that have been taken by me and my Department to establish the independent review and take forward the core recommendation on eliminating the backlog are bearing fruit.  We are well on the way to eliminating this historic issue and putting the industry on a sound footing going forward.  My Department will be glad to update the committee on progress in aquaculture licensing, as and when required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#S00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for the presentation and overview of the issue.  We had a very thorough session with the officials a number of months ago in regard to the aquaculture licensing report, which we went through in some detail.  They outlined to us a lot of what the Minister has outlined about what has come to pass and the background, the fact a prioritisation is being made in terms of dealing with the backlog in shellfish applications, and the 300 licence target for this year and next year.</p><p>During that session, we pressed the officials very significantly on the implementation of all of the recommendations from the aquaculture licensing review report.  The feedback we were getting in that session was that the prioritisation at this point was on the shellfish backlog and that the other recommendations would have to await progress being made and be dealt with subsequently.  As the Minister pointed out, there are 30 separate recommendations from the report.  After those 30 recommendations are outlined, the review committee goes on to make a point that I think it useful to quote:</p><blockquote>The Group undertook its review work in line with the Terms of Reference and acknowledges that implementation of the report is a matter for the Minister and the Department.  Implementation of all of the recommendations in this report will be challenging.  However the Group considers that it would be beneficial to set out an Implementation Strategy which would assign responsibility for recommendations, accountability and set milestones for delivery and identify the necessary resources to support the implementation process.</blockquote> <p>That summarises where the group is at and what it feels needs to happen with regard to the 30 recommendations it put forward.  The first two recommendations were that there should be a reasonable timescale for licence determinations and, as part of that, legislation should be developed to put in place a new licensing system.</p><p>When we discussed this with the officials the previous day, we were informed there had not been progress on that legislation and that it would have to take a back seat to the prioritisation of resources towards the shellfish licensing backlog.  While I acknowledge the important work of dealing with the shellfish backlog, I do not see a reason, almost a year and a half on from the publication of the licensing review, we do not yet have an implementation strategy.  Moreover, the Minister has published nothing dealing with the various recommendations, outlining to whom responsibility was assigned for implementing each of those recommendations or putting in place an implementation timeline for each of them.  I would have thought that was a minimum basic response to the report and a basic outline of how we would progress.  It is not acceptable that the Minister has not yet produced that or ensured his officials have produced it.  That is why, having discussed it here at committee, we decided it was important we engaged further with the Minister, as the political head of the Department, to tease out these issues and, in particular, to put the point to him in regard to getting that implementation plan in place and then looking to back it up with the necessary resources to make progress.</p><p>I want to touch on the issue of the finfish licensing backlog.  While the prioritisation has been on the shellfish licences, there is a very significant backlog which has not been addressed yet in regard to finfish, and we have to bear in mind that finfish make up 75% of the value of the aquaculture market overall.  The Minister will be aware of a company in my part of the world, Marine Harvest, which is by far the largest salmon producer in the country and works down the west coast as far as Cork, with its processing base in Fanad.  That processing base operates at something like 40% capacity despite having the capacity to process far more fish were they available, with the resulting employment that could create.  This is an area of north Donegal where employment options are few and far between.  I had a meeting with the company recently and looked at the list of licences it has on file that are awaiting decision.  Going back through the date of the renewal applications, it will be seen they are from 2005, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2015, with five from 2005, seven or eight that go back to 2011 and two from 2006.</p><p>It has three new live applications in place.  One commenced for the Shot Head in Bantry back in 2011, one was submitted for Waterfall in 2016 and another for Lough Swilly in 2014.  Those applications are not able to be progressed.  The company has indicated it is in a position to invest up to &euro;22 million if licences can be progressed through the system.  That could add another 250 jobs, many of them in north Donegal but also right along the west coast, including in the Minister's county.  That is an example in the finfish sector.  We are not on top of processing the applications and we do not have the resources or a streamlined licensing system to move them on.  We are not utilising and maximising the value and potential of our agriculture industry.  I refer in particular to finfish.</p><p> In 2003, salmon production was 23,000 tonnes whereas last year it was just under 19,500 tonnes.  If we compare that with other countries, in particular with Scotland, we see a scenario where licences can move from submission to conclusion and decision in a couple of years.  As a result, that sector is growing.  We have seen Marine Harvest pioneer organic salmon production in recent years.  That is meeting a strong need in the market, but because of the backlog and delay in processing licences, that increased demand is not being met.</p><p> Will the Minister respond to my points on the implementation plan, the legislation and specifically on finfish?  I refer to the backlogs we are experiencing and the need for a radical overhaul to put a new system in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#T00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his update on the licensing review procedure.  I have a number of questions on the process.  I understand why it is taking such time to carry it out.  There has been a backlog because testing had to be done.  I said to the Minister's predecessor that I understood this was preparation for the roll-out of an EU-wide system of licensing.  I was referring to this island being used as a kind of a testing model for an EU-wide body.  Will the Minister explain and expand on that for the committee?  It might have some implications for Scotland and other countries as well in respect of what can happen.  Alternatively, is this only an Irish system and is it being forced on us by the EU because we have to go along with a more rigorous licensing regime?</p> <p>  The 300 a year or whatever number of applications that have been granted have been in for an awfully long time because of the testing regime.  There has also been a big problem with the public.  I refer to when a bay gets approval.  Nothing will have happened with the licensing applications, some of them having been in for a number of years.  All of a sudden, the public are informed these licences have been granted and they wonder where they came from and what is happening.  The public are being left out as stakeholders in this process.  That is leading to much conflict and difficulty.  Whatever licensing regime is put in place has to be able to facilitate the public and allow them to have their role in it.</p> <p>  Is the Minister's Department the right body to be issuing the licences?  It is integral for funding aquaculture as well licensing and everything else.  I see from the Minister's overall response that the public does not get a mention or a look-in.  That is regrettable because many of the issues that can be dealt with would involve the public as well.  The Minister should be looking at the public as being a stakeholder as well.  There should be a requirement that they be contacted and talked to.</p> <p>  On the updating of information, a substantial amount has been gathered over recent years from all of the different bays.  It is important information but it will not be static forever.  It has to be updated.  Have systems been put in place to update that information?  When these renewal applications come up, whenever the ten-year licences expire, that information is going to have to be new and fresh again.  Are we going to end up in the same situation again when the new licenses are going to be reviewed?  That is going to be important so there is going to have to be a system to update this information constantly.  Will the Minister expand on that as well?</p></speech>

What we received was a summary document with no details and no recommendation-by-recommendation update.  That is what we asked for.  What we have here is not good enough.  It is similar with what the Minister has given us today.  I apologise for being late for the Minister's presentation, but if we look at progress to date on implementation, there are three paragraphs.  All they state is that the backlog of 300 applications in shellfish is going to be dealt with over the next two years.  That is not what we asked for.  We asked for the Minister and his officials to tell us what is being done to implement those 30 recommendations.  If the Minister is refusing to implement them, he should tell us.</p> <p>  We assume he is going to implement all 30 recommendations.  The Houses of the Oireachtas deserve to know, recommendation by recommendation, where the implementation is at.  That is not what we have here today.  It is not acceptable.  It is offensive to this committee that we have had this really poor report and now we have this presentation today.  Three paragraphs are dealing with 30 recommendations.  It is not acceptable.</p> <p>  The reason this Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine is so exercised is because of the stunning failure of this State to develop the salmon farming industry.  In 2018, Norway, a European country, is producing 1.278 million tonnes, Scotland is producing 174,000 tonnes and the Faroe Islands, which is five times the size of Achill Island, is producing 73,000 tonnes.  Ireland is producing 17,000 tonnes while 17 years ago we were producing 23,500 tonnes.  It is outrageous how a Department can strangle the potential of an industry that could create hundreds of jobs in rural coastal communities.</p> <p>  We had this independent report with 30 recommendations but we have had no update, either from officials of the Department or the Minister today, as to what is happening to deal with this crisis, this profound failure to develop the potential of this industry.  I visited Marine Harvest for the first time 16 years ago.  It is an important employer in rural north Donegal.  I could see then the potential of that industry.  Today, that industry's potential is being strangled.  It is shocking.  It has been 16 years, which is almost the entire length of my public service.  I have been a public representative for all of those years and it is just going backwards.  That is the urgency of the issue.  The salmon farming industry is 75% of aquaculture yet the Department focuses on shellfish.</p><p>That is low-hanging fruit.  The Department goes for 300 licences this year and 300 licences next year in the shellfish area.  The Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board is not adequately resourced.  These low-hanging fruits, applications in shellfish, are 25% of the overall industry and the aquacultural appeals licensing process will be backlogged without being resourced adequately.  That is the appeals process.  I am shocked at the lack of urgency in the Minister's Department, considering the shocking failure to develop this industry that is of real importance to rural, coastal communities.  Those statistics are irrefutable.  </p><p> In Scotland, it typically takes 18 to 22 months to deal with applications.  One application has been on the board here since 2005, 13 years ago.  The process has been absolutely strangled by bureaucracy and a failure to update systems.  The Minister will get the word in his ear now from his officials about the EU.  That is ten years ago.  That is a long time ago.  That is a long time to deal with these issues and address them with resources.</p><p> I commend the Minister on the independent report.  I am not having a go at the Minister personally, but I think the Department officials have seriously failed our rural, coastal communities.  The report is finally published and there are hearings in this committee and still we do not know what the Department officials are doing about the 30 recommendations.  We need to know soon.</p><p> Who in the Department is responsible for making recommendations to the Minister about the issuing of licences?  Who are the officials who deal with the enforcement of regulations?  There should be a separation of Department officials or State agency officials who are responsible for the development and licensing of the industry from somebody in the environmental sector who deals with the enforcement of regulations in the industry.  Those two matters need to be separated.  That is one of the recommendations from the independent report.  There needs to be no conflict of interest.  I am interested to know if different individuals deal with the recommendations on licensing and the enforcement of regulations.  Are they separate people and departments, or are they one and the same?  That appears to be a challenge.</p><p> I may have more follow-up questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018102300002#U00200"><p>I thank the three members.  It is no accident that they are all from Donegal and I appreciate their long-standing interest in this issue.</p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn made reference to one company, as did the two previous speakers.  I visited that facility a number of years ago, long before I was in this position.  I appreciate the potential in the sector.  It is a relatively new industry in the context of farming generally and globally.  It is in its nascent stage in Ireland relative to global development.</p> <p>  I make absolutely no apology for running with the most critical element of the report to which my colleagues allude.  Clearing the licence backlog is, by a country mile, ahead of any of the other recommendations.  I make no apology whatsoever for that.  That is the key to unleashing the potential and all of the rest are secondary considerations.  In an ideal world, we would have flowcharts and indications, but I specifically asked the division within the Department and equipment is there.  </p> <p>  The first step in the light of the report was that we prioritise the clearing of the licensing backlog, to the cost of every other recommendation, if necessary.  That is what we will do.  The Department is making progress and I make no apology for that.  That is the key and critical issue because no one can work without a licence.  I cannot operate outside the law.  It is important to take into account the very clear judgment and finding against us by the European Court of Justice about our licensing agreements in the context of the habitats directive.  To give credit to officials who have been unfairly maligned, they did negotiate permission for those who currently had licences to continue to operate under those licences while we did an enormous undertaking in gathering the data for the appropriate assessments in all of the bays.  We were starting from scratch.  That was a mammoth undertaking.  The judgment was challenging but it would have been calamitous if the judgment was applied with its full rigour and intent.  It would have closed down the industry.  The Department negotiated an ability for the industry to continue to operate its existing licences.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to the tonnage and I am aware of the international comparisons but we need to be sure we are comparing like with like.  Our production is generally in the organic sphere, so it is not as intensive an operation or production system as others in the international sphere that have been quoted.  That said, the tonnage is lower than it was in the early 2000s.  The history of the sector will show that, in the early 2000s, there was a collapse of the European market.  Many of the early operators, by virtue of the economic consequences of that, got wiped out.  There was an anti-dumping court case taken at European level but the consequences for the early operators in the industry here was they were wiped out.  We were virtually starting from scratch again post 2003, when we produced 23,000 tonnes, which was the figure to which Deputy McConalogue alluded.  The flexibility of the arrangements we have, albeit they are restricted arising from the European Court of Justice ruling, show that, in 2012, it was 12,000 tonnes.  In 2016, it was 16,300 tonnes and, in 2017, we produced 19,305 tonnes.  The trajectory has been in the right direction but we need to make more progress on finfish, which seems to be the area of primary concern for the Deputies, and I understand that.  It is not 75% of the value.  In fact, the figures I have for 2016 show the value of the finfish side was around &euro;100 million and the value of the shellfish was just shy of &euro;60 million.  It is more in the region of 2:1 rather than 75%, but that is a moot point as both are extremely valuable sectors and provide valuable employment. Our endeavour is to get to a situation where the licensing regime enables the full potential of the sector to be realised.  </p> <p>  In taking into account the licensing regime, we must be conscious that, in the context of that process, there are rights enjoyed by all parties, as Deputy Pringle alluded to.  There are rights of third parties to register their views and there is an independent appeals process for any licence determinations that are issued.  If one looks at comparable issues, the most obvious one is a routine planning application to a local authority.  There is an appeals process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is an appeals process for these licensing decisions and that can be exercised by either a third party or an applicant.</p></speech>

It is one we take seriously.  We negotiated substantial funding under the MFF to assist approved and licensed operators to achieve their potential.  That is not in any way in conflict with our role to determine a licence.</p></speech>

It is exactly the Department's role to get as much funding as possible for the industry but it should not also be licensing the operators.  The licensing system should be independent of the Department.</p></speech>

There are different views on it.  I do not see it as a conflict at all.  We take all the respective roles extremely seriously.  There are many licence applicants who would wish that was not the case, although I appreciate that successful applicants are quite happy with the process.  However, there are appeals and checks and balances built into any system.  We are striving to address the licensing backlog as an imperative.  That does not mean finding in favour of all applicants.  The statistics show that of the approximately 300 applications this year, there were 160 grants and 144 refusals.  It is not a slam dunk.  We are not compromised in the integrity of the process by one iota.  There are checks and balances in the system as well.  I do not intend to refer to an individual application, and it would be inappropriate to do so, but Deputy McConalogue mentioned the one at Shot Head.  That was one of the licences granted by the Department.</p> <p>  The finfish issue is obviously of greater interest in Donegal.  I appreciate the geographical spread of the industry.  In trying to accelerate that licensing process, we will be issuing a requirement for environmental impact statements.  That is the necessary next step in clearing the backlog in that area of licence applications.  Bear in mind that the existing licenceholders continue to have that licence and operate under it.</p> <p>  It is a complex process; it is not easy.  I referred to all the legislation that governs it, ranging from the habitats directive and birds directive to foreshore legislation.  It is extraordinarily complex to do all the appropriate assessments, taking account of the individual nature of all the bays involved, the flora and fauna, the competing demands for access, the feed potential in the bays and so forth.</p> <p>  I believe I have covered the questions.</p></speech>

The judgment was in 2007, which is 11 years ago.  That arose from the habitats directive not being transposed, which was 24 years ago.  Governments did not do it.  It had nothing to do with the industry.  That was 11 years ago.  The other point is that there are applications for areas where SACs do not apply and they are facing the same delays.  Eleven years is hell of a long time to get to grips with the implications of a judgment.  The birds directive mentioned by the Minister was in 2009, which is a decade ago.  The Minister sees the impact it is having on the industry.  We are desperately trying to get jobs into rural, coastal communities and to get employers to locate there.  It is a decade now and the excuse of the ECJ has long run out.  After 11 years it should not be put forward as a barrier.</p> <p>  This makes me quite angry.  The Minister referred to people from Donegal.  I am a former member of this committee and my two colleagues are current members.  The coastal communities down the west coast of Ireland from Donegal to Cork have been let down, despite the potential this has.  It is estimated that the loss as a result of all this will be over &euro;1 billion within a year or two.  That is the estimated loss in production by the industry.  How many jobs is that?</p></speech>

This independent report has been published and I commend the Minister on doing that.  Apparently, it is the third report examining changes in the system.  However, this one is critical.  It has 30 recommendations.  As I have not heard the Minister or the officials say they are not going to implement those recommendations, I assume all 30 will be implemented.  One clearly states that the decision on licensing must be separated from the other matters.  Decision making processes have to be separated in order that they are independent of each other.  If somebody is responsible for development and licensing that person can get on with that.  Somebody is also responsible for ensuring that licences are complied with and that the concerns of the public are heard, which is also important.  These matters need to be separated.  That is one of the recommendations, yet the Minister says he does not see a conflict of interest and that there are different views on it.</p> <p>  We must have clarity.  Is the Minister going to implement all 30 recommendations?  Will he also listen to our concerns as representatives not only of Donegal but of rural coastal communities?  There is a massive loss here yet there is a lack of urgency.  The Minister says 65% and others say 75%, but the significant majority of value in this sector and where there is also an urgency is in the finfish area.  However, the summary from the Department refers to it being kicked back to 2020, two years hence.  Two thirds of it is in chaos or is stalled and being squeezed, yet the Department will wait two more years.  That is the lack of urgency and lack of acceptance in the Department.  I see nothing in the Minister's statement today.  My venting of my frustration and anger as the Minister listens patiently - in fairness, he is a calm and patient man - does not achieve anything.</p> <p>  I am appealing to the Minister to understand and perhaps meet some of the stakeholders in the aquaculture industry who feel they are being stymied.  He should visit their production centres, see the potential and then demand change from his officials.  What has happened previously must end.  There must be a change in attitude.  It is shocking that after everything I have said the committee gets a report that states it will be two more years before the Department prioritises finfish.  It is prioritising the low-hanging fruit of the shellfish licences.</p><p>Something has to change if we are to achieve our potential.</p></speech>

I appreciate Senator Mac Lochlainn's commitment.  He talks about a loss of &euro;1 billion to the sector.  Under the European Court of Justice ruling, we negotiated a situation where everybody who had a licence could continue to operate under that licence.  With regard to finfish, in the period from 2004 to 2017, the tonnage has increased by almost 30% from 15,200 tonnes to 19,500 tonnes.

My ambition, having engaged with the sector, is to have a system that is fit for purpose, delivers on the potential, recognises the rights of applicants and third parties for the process to be fair and transparent, and, as an imperative, deals with the licence backlog.  Until we have done that and made determinations on all those backlogs, the first thing that is needed to grow production is to have a determination on licence applications.  That is a critical gatekeeper.  There are others.  I have mixed views on some of the recommendations.  I do not think the Senator would find unanimity within the aquaculture sector on 20 year licences.  Although some might agree with them, I suspect a majority of operators might not, including with the costs associated with it.  Third parties and non-governmental organisations certainly might not like that we would be giving away rights for effectively a generational period.  There would be significant costs that might be beyond the scope of many smaller enterprises.  There are 30 recommendations but I make no apology for prioritising, in absolute terms, dealing with the backlog of licences.  That is where we are.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle raised an important point.  Will we be caught up again in the next wave?  We are doing the second round of appropriate assessments now.  We continue to update the database to enable us to make determinations more effectively.  We started without any baseline on those bays and what was happening there, and all the criteria we were found against on with regard to our quota.  We had a mammoth undertaking and it is important that we do not see that as a finite obligation.  It is a revolving obligation because bays change and their biological capacity to sustain wildlife and aquaculture operations is defined at any particular time.  It is important that we continue that process regularly.</p></speech>

That involved doing an appropriate assessment for all 29 bays identified around the country.  That was quite an undertaking.  I appreciate the point that Senator Mac Lochlainn makes that we are 11 years on from that but it was a mammoth undertaking and, as a consequence and understandably, a backlog of licences built up.  This is reflected in the growth of the sector even within the constraints we are operating under.  We secured permission for existing licences to continue to operate while we built the infrastructure to be able to make better informed decisions on those licence renewals as well as on new applications.</p></speech>

I would like it if there were an independent body dealing with licensing and a body dealing with regulations and ensuring that the law is implemented.  In the absence of this, would the Minister be willing to provide additional resources to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board in order that we can deal with all this?</p></speech>

An efficient decision-making and appeals process is in everyone's interest.  It is not just in the industry's interest; it is in that of those who may be concerned.  It is best for everyone - all interested parties - if this process can be as efficient and timely as possible.</p> <p>  The Minister has taken trade delegations to foreign countries, which is important work.  On such missions, he tasks about Food Harvest 2020 and seeks new markets, particularly in view of concerns regarding Brexit.  There are companies involved in aquaculture that are trying to find new markets and new customers.  Prospective customers want to know that such companies have a consistent, steady supply.  The problem for the industry is that it cannot guarantee this as a result of the logjam of appeals.  There is also the matter of very old licences and 35 year old regulations that are not up to date and do not relate to the modern aquaculture industry.  How can the industry possibly compete on the global market?  This is why the Minister really needs to meet the stakeholders as soon as possible.  They are being asked to step up for Ireland, to find new export markets and to satisfy the demands of new, growing markets and customers but they cannot guarantee a consistent supply of product for five or ten years.  I am sure the Minister can see that this is a major problem.  Again, if nothing else arises from this meeting, I ask him to meet those involved and listen to their frustrations.  My strong view, regardless of whether people accept it, is that there has been a failure in this regard.  My view is backed up by considerable objective evidence.</p> <p>  Today, however, is about the future.  It is no good bleating about what has gone wrong.  Today is about how we will move forward, develop the industry's potential and have a system that is fair to all.  It would be a huge help if the Minister were to meet the industry and hear directly from it.</p></speech>

As already stated, its representatives are continuously in and out of my office and I have never refused to meet them.  I have been on trade missions and I am aware that there is an insatiable global demand for seafood products.  Aquaculture is critical to meeting this demand.  In fact, production from farmed fish, whether shellfish or finfish, rather than the wild-catch sector, is likely to be the majority source of meeting this major global demand.  We are therefore very anxious that we maximise our potential in this sector, bearing in mind that one should ensure that one compares like with like when comparing production figures.  We have a specific niche market operation, primarily on the finfish side, on organic status, and certified organic status product commands a premium relative to other production systems.  I keep repeating this point, but my ambition - and the rationale for conducting the review - is to see how we might unleash the sector's potential.  I have been open to meeting all stakeholders in this regard.  As I said in the context of the licensing and the report, I asked that this element be prioritised.  I make no apologies for that.  Collaboration is the hallmark of the agrifood sector, including the fishing industry and the aquaculture side, and it is by working together that we will achieve the sector's potential.  As my said, my door has always been open for this engagement.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations of the review was that increased resources be provided to the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  Has this happened or has the Minister committed to or planned for it?  When the departmental officials were with us on the previous occasion, we teased these matters out in detail.  I certainly felt we were being stonewalled regarding the further and full implementation of the report and the timeline associated with the implementation of the various recommendations.  This is why we asked the Minister, as the political head of the Department, to come before the committee and discuss the issue.  I feel we are being stonewalled by him as well.  I ask the Minister to let me finish, and then he can come back in.  I feel he is still stonewalling us in not grabbing this and ensuring that the various recommendations are being implemented.</p> <p>  As stated earlier, one of the key aspects the review committee noted was that an implementation report or implementation plan should be put together and that this could look at the 30 recommendations, assign responsibility for them, put timelines in place for their implementation and assess resource implications.  When we discussed this matter previously, we have requested that the Minister put together a review or implementation plan.  He still has not committed to putting in place such a plan.  It is accepted that there will be different timelines associated with the implementation of different recommendations.  However, as a basic starting point in responding to the report, it is essential that the Department publish an implementation plan on the 30 recommendations and, if it agrees with them, state that each should be implemented and indicate how it will go about achieving them, the timelines for doing so and the resource implications involved.</p><p>If, in assessing that, we identify that there is a need for additional resources and if it is felt that allocating those resources could lead to improved growth within the sector and an improved financial return to the economy, it would make eminent sense to examine how they might be allocated..  To get to the nub of the issue, I am seeking a commitment from the Minister to the effect that he will put together a implementation plan together that will include timelines.</p><p> I wish to make a few more points.  One of the recommendations in the report relates to a reasonable timeline for licence determinations.  The report indicated that a reasonable timeline for all new applications after 1 January 2018 would be six months.  Another immediate recommendation of the review group was that work commence immediately on the preparation of new aquaculture legislation, having regard to best practice in other jurisdictions and in other relevant consenting systems that obtain in Ireland.  When I asked the officials about that at our previous meeting, the answer was that work had not commenced on the legislation because the resources were not available.  I ask the Minister for an update on this matter.  If that work has not commenced, I ask that it would do so immediately and that he allocate the resources in respect of it.  The feedback I have received is that one of the stumbling blocks in terms of the development of the sector is the fact that there is not a streamlined licensing process or specific timelines and that this is leading to a reluctance to commence and proceed with new applications.</p><p> In the context of finfish licences, the Minister indicated that the Department is scheduled to formally request operators to submit environmental impact assessments, EIAs, before the end of the year and that it will then engage with applicants regarding these.  He went on to indicate that this represents a significant response to the recommendations of the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  While that needs to be done, the Minister is indicating that his point about finfish licence applications is a significant response to the findings of the review group.  It is an essential part of furthering those licences but I imagine that there would need to be clear timelines associated with them in terms of how we can expect those EIAs to be dealt with, answers given and progressing matters once they are received.</p><p> On the separation of the licensing powers and the development function within the Department, the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission before the committee last week to discuss the proposed unfair trading practices directive from Europe.  She stated clearly that she felt a new sector regulator should be established to implement the European directive on unfair trading practices because it was in conflict with its remit of consumer and competition protection.  She stated that it is more about the producer than about consumer and competition protection and that there would be tension between those two functions, that it would not be appropriate to have the same person dealing with that tension and that two separate bodies would be needed.  Similarly, while licensing is a function of the Department, development can often be in tension with it yet we have a situation where the same people are dealing with those functions.  There should be a healthy tension in that regard.  That is something that would need to be considered.  It is one of the 30 recommendations.  If we were to see the implementation plan, that is something that could be fleshed out and addressed and on which we could get a clear line of sight in terms of what the Department's response will be to it.</p></speech>

It determines the nature of the scheme, invites people to apply, determines the outcome of applications and polices compliance with the terms and regulations.  I have never heard the Deputy make the point - because I do not believe it is sustainable or that the case is made - that the Department should not be responsible for all of that.  He makes a different case for the aquaculture side, as does Senator MacLochlainn.</p></speech>

It appears to be borne out of a belief that it might be less onerous in some way.  We all operate under the same law.  In many respects, I would say that the Deputy should be careful what he wishes for because a new body might not be as understanding as the Department in the context of breaches or compliance issues.</p></speech>

In fact, he does not believe it is the right way to go.  However, it highlights the point that what we need is an implementation plan with regard to those reviews.  The industry is currently working off the 30 recommendations in the review, of which that to which I refer is one, but we have not had a clear response from the Department that this is not something it will pursue.  If that is the case, the Minister should put the implementation plan together and say that he does not believe that recommendation is one that should be pursued.  Let us have the clear picture; put it all on the table.</p></speech>

I said at the outset what I thought was the most critical recommendation, which is to clear the backlog; the report states that also.  It states that this is the most critical service we could do for this sector, and that is what we are doing.  We are dealing with that.  The rest is secondary.  Legislation is required in terms of some of it.  The Deputy knows the difficulty in getting fisheries legislation through the House.</p></speech>

I hear the points the Deputy is making.</p> <p>  On resources, I am advised that the last time the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board sought additional resources it was given additional resources.

There are issues that cause delays other than resources.  Additional resources have been given to the section in the Department also.</p> <p>  I do not propose to change tack in respect of the overarching imperative to deal with the backlog.  We have touched on some of the other recommendations.  There would be mixed views in the industry about some of the other recommendations but the priority remains to clear the backlog.  I would imagine that in 2019, as we proceed, hopefully, with the same level of progress, we can begin to examine in more detail some of the other recommendations, but this is the critical issue.</p></speech>

It is the priority that deserves the biggest amount of resources and top priority in the context of getting movement.

Television coverage and Internet streaming can also be adversely affected.</p><p>The next item on our agenda is our engagement with stakeholders on the effectiveness and timeliness of consent classes in third-level institutions.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. P&aacute;draig MacNeela from the school of psychology at National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG; Dr. Brian Gormley, head of campus life at Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT; Mr. Shane De R&iacute;s, president of Trinity College Dublin Students Union; Ms. S&iacute;ona Cahill, president of the Union of Students in Ireland; Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar, executive director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, and Mr. Phillip Crosby, principal officer at the Department of Education and Skills.  The format of this part of the meeting will be that I will invite each of our guests to make a brief opening statement for a maximum of three minutes.  This will be followed by engagement with members.</p><p>I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I advise our guests that any opening statements they make will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  I thank them for their patience in waiting for us while we dealt with other business.  This is a very important topic.  All of the committee members felt we should examine it and hear from universities, students - who are incredibly important in all of this - and Rape Crisis Network Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members for their interest in the work we are doing at NUIG and at higher education institutions throughout the country to support a culture of active consent among the young adults who are students in our institutions.</p> <p>  I am representing the SMART consent research team, which comprises Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Higgins, Dr. Charlotte McIvor, Kate Dawson, also at NUIG, and me.  We work to put together a programme of research and practice in this area.  We have developed a programme of consent education and awareness to support ourselves at NUIG and other institutions as well.  We work from a definition of active consent.  That is a really important definition to clarify.  It is about ongoing and freely given verbal or non-verbal communication in respect of any form of sexual activity or intimacy.  This also reflects the person's internal sense of willingness.  It is quite complex once we delve into it.</p> <p>  We began in 2013, through a collaboration with Rape Crisis Network Ireland, to study people&rsquo;s understanding of sexual consent.  In 2015, we developed that programme into the SMART consent workshop.  This is a relatively short workshop.  Thinking pragmatically, as we must do in implementation, it lasts between an hour to an hour and a half.  We work with students with the help of trained facilitators with a manual and a full framework of support behind them.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Higgins and I have been very active in putting together a training programme.  We have trained more than 200 students and staff members as facilitators of consent workshops since 2016.  More than 4,000 students have now taken part in a SMART consent workshop in the nine or ten institutions where we have delivered workshops directly or trained people who deliver them within an integrated programme they develop at their institution.</p> <p>  I would like to direct the members' attention to four particular lessons we have learned through the collaboration we have pursued with so many people over the last several years.  The first is to offer trainable, high-quality materials within the workshop format.  Second, it is important for this to have a home within the institution, for example embedded within student orientation or the curriculum.  There must be a place for it to be.  Third, to embrace the goal of full awareness and culture change in this area, which includes awareness of sexual violence, consent programmes need to reach out the full community of students.  It is not simply about workshops.  We are particularly interested in developing a media campaign this year.  There seems to be a sense that this is going to be rolled out quite widely and in the long term, we need to think seriously about going beyond the workshop format to embrace a theatre performance-based format.  An example of this is the model that is available from several US campuses.  A theatre troupe from the US has briefed us on their work in the last few weeks.  Finally, this programme has to be made sustainable.  It is great to do this work and we have learned a lot, but in the long term this has to be taken on board in institutions' policy frameworks.</p> <p>  It is really important to realise that the definition I have outlined is a positive, active definition of consent.  It obviously encompasses all of the issues of non-consent, sexual violence, sexual assault and harassment.  However, given where students are coming from and the often quite limited sex education they have received at school, we really have to meet them in a very positive way and work with them in the terms of their young adulthood.  They may be experiencing this kind of sexual activity for the first time.  Working through a consent workshop must not be perceived as a threatening encounter, but rather a liberating or fun experience students can have with their peers.</p></speech>

DIT considers the area of sexual consent to be deeply connected to positive student engagement and gender equality, and we welcome the focus on this matter nationally.</p><p>In DIT, and, more specifically, in campus life, our aim is to deliver the best student experience to the 20,000 students in the institute.  We provide free healthcare, counselling, pastoral care services, career development, accommodation support, financial aid and learning support, as well as sports, societies and volunteering activities to our students.  We work in close partnership with our students' union, and I wish to acknowledge the work carried out by the students' union around the area of sexual consent in DIT.</p><p> DIT prides itself on serving a diverse range of students, including mature students, students with disabilities and international students.  We serve full-time and part-time students and those undertaking continuing professional development.  Our students undertake courses ranging from apprenticeship and undergraduate degree programmes to PhD research.</p><p> In the campus life office, primarily through our counselling and health services, we see the impact sexual violence and unwanted sexual contact can have on students.  We are working hard to develop a proactive effective approach to tackling the issue.  Our aims are to introduce a positive change of culture, to develop a more respectful community, to educate students and staff around consent and to ensure that our policies and procedures can be used effectively to support and protect all our students.</p><p> This year for the first time a short video on consent was delivered at our orientation to all our incoming undergraduate students, over 4,000 of whom commenced in DIT this year.  However, we recognise the need for a more in-depth approach.</p><p> As with many of my peers across the higher education sector I do not have any specific expertise or qualifications in the area of sexual consent, sexual violence or harassment.  As such, we rely on the research and outputs of projects such as the NUI Galway SMART consent project and the ending sexual harassment and violence in third level education, ESHTE, project of which DIT is an active participant.  We expect the outputs of the ESHTE project will be delivered over the coming months.</p><p> We have discussed the need for more comprehensive training.  We are examining the effectiveness of voluntary versus mandatory training and the impact each approach would have on resources.  In our submission we set out some recommendations and I would be glad to discuss any of our recommendations or comments afterwards.  We hope these recommendations will be a useful contribution to the discussion.  In particular, the institute would welcome a national framework and guidelines on how to positively promote consent, and, in particular, guidelines on how to effectively manage allegations of sexual assault between students who may be in the same programme or accommodation block.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute and I look forward to discussing the matter further.</p></speech>

This conversation was initiated by students' unions and student support services many years ago.  The vital and urgent need for more education on all issues relating to boundaries, consent and sexual relationships was identified in numerous surveys and reports.  The 2013 Say Something survey by the Union of Students in Ireland found that 16% of respondents had experienced an unwanted sexual experience at their current institution.  In 2015 my students' union in Trinity College conducted a survey which revealed that one in four women and one in 20 men at Trinity College had had a non-consensual sexual experience.  The survey also highlighted issues around harassment and stalking.  It was evident a shift in culture, attitude and behaviour was necessary.  It was clear then that more needed to be done to tackle the crisis directly.  The first step was to initiate the conversation around positive consent in relationships through the development of consent workshops.  The need for education on such a topic was further highlighted in surveys carried out on those who attended the first pilot we ran in 2016.  At that point, only 22.9% of attendees claimed to be well-informed about sexual consent.  This rose sharply to 64.7% following the workshops.</p> <p>  In Trinity College, in conjunction with the student counselling service, the students' union first employed the SMART consent model from NUI Galway in rolling out the classes.  This pilot was rolled out in first-year student accommodation on a voluntary basis during the orientation programme.  The primary aim of these workshops was to get conversation and understanding going about what consent was and to have this as an ongoing topic during the year.  It was, however, identified through participant feedback that there was a need to change the programme or model and develop one specifically for Trinity College.  We changed the model by removing the PowerPoint presentation and the emphasis was moved from didactic presentations to interactive discussions.  The workshop would aim to become more inclusive and less heteronormative, through the content and the case examples.</p> <p>  In 2017 and 2018, almost 100% of the target population attended the workshops and positive feedback was garnered from all the participants.  Although the workshops were not mandatory they were promoted in such a way as to have them seen as a normal part of the orientation to college and the college residence welcome programme.  The success of the workshops in Trinity College can, for the most part, be accredited to their inclusive nature from planning and administration to the content of the programme.  The workshops were designed in partnership with students and staff, and are facilitated by both.  This is vital in creating a cultural shift on the issue and encouraging participant engagement with the workshops.  The effectiveness of the workshops is best evidenced by the feedback of those who partook.  Fully 99% of participants referred to the relevance of the workshops to college life and 87% agreed that they learned something useful.  The model employed in Trinity has proven its value and effectiveness.  The necessity of the workshops cannot be understated.</p> <p>  The challenge now lies in broadening the accessibility of the workshops.  We operate in an environment where support services are stretched to the limit and the resources necessary to make the workshops available are not available.  The workshops must be supported by other initiatives within our institutions.  In Trinity, we have embarked on developing first responder training to equip staff and student representatives, who may be presented to by a victim of sexual assault, with the necessary tools to assist.  We are also developing bystander training for those who witness an inappropriate situation to train them in how best to respond and best manage the situation.</p> <p>  The period of transition from second level to third level is a formative developmental period in any student's life.  It gives us an opportunity to ingrain a positive attitude towards consent in all students and embed it as a natural part of college life.  It is, however, a conversation that should be started at an earlier stage in the education of our young people.  It should be built upon as young people progress through the system.  If the committee, the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister genuinely want to see change and put an end to sexual violence at third level, then we need tangible support in the form of resources.  The methods and models are ready to go.  We simply need the means to do it.</p></speech>

I am before the committee on behalf of over 374,000 students throughout the island of Ireland.  I am here because this is in fact a problem.  I am here not because consent is simply the next new gritty issue for the student movement to talk about or because I or the student movement have all the answers, but because the issues arising now represents a problem that is growing.  The student movement is not going to stand by, nor have we ever, and do nothing or be silent on the issue.  It has to stop now but we need everyone on board to make that a reality, including Oireachtas Members.</p> <p>  The student experience is one highlighted to us by students and their students' unions across the country.  The issue around sexual harassment at third level or within and for this age cohort did not start today or yesterday.  Students' union welfare officers deal with the problem in their offices week after week.  Sexual harassment has often become normalised in a space dominated by being social and sharing more of oneself across multiple online platforms.  Photos are screenshotted and saved.  They are used to threaten, vilify or hold over.  Students and young people are being hurt by this behaviour emotionally and physically.  They are subject to assault, and, more often than not, during all of this they tell no one.  That is why in 2014, the Union of Students in Ireland led the way in creating and issuing the first survey of its kind in Ireland.  One key finding was that 16% of students reported having experienced some form of unwanted sexual experience while in their current educational institution.  Notably, only 3% recorded that they had reported these incidents to an official within their institution or to the Garda.  Two frequent reasons for not reporting were put forward.  First, the students did not believe the incident was serious enough to report.  Second, they did not think that what happened to them was in fact a crime.  We are not being dramatic when we say this is a serious issue.  It is widely understood that students attending third level are in the process of handling a significant transition, one that affects all parts of their lives.  It affects academic standards and can result in a distancing from familial supports and parental guidance.  It often involves new living or rental conditions and experiences, as well as new social and peer group expectations in terms of socialising and relationships.</p> <p>  The Union of Students in Ireland has led the calls for improved relationships and sexuality education, RSE, before students reach third level.  It is the daily experience of our elected officers that students are ill-equipped and do not have a satisfactory level of knowledge around sexual health, well-being and respectful relationships, including understanding the language around consent.</p><p>Sexual health awareness has been a key point of USI's plan of work for more than two decades.  We welcomed the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which indicated that resources needed to be allocated to develop a systematic approach to sexual and reproductive rights in Ireland.  Looking at the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's, DRCC's, national helpline figures for 2016, the age groups, 18 to 24, and 24 to 29, make up almost 30% of its overall callers.</p><p> The USI has identified that there are gaps within the third level system in accessing safe ways to raise concerns and to get an effective remedy for issues arising.  There is significant consensus among sectoral stakeholders that consent education is required at third level.  There is also broad consensus that consent needs to be mainstreamed into the education of young people and students.  We need more than a poster awareness campaign or social media content.  Funding must be made available.  A second Say Something data research project is required.  Consent education must have a sex-positive approach and must also be inclusive of the LGBTI community.  It must be student-centred and peer-led in conjunction with professionals.  Our staff need to have first responder-style training in order that in the event of disclosures, post consent education, that there is somewhere for a person to go.  Significant changes are required to the reporting structures at third level.  We believe a designated staff member needs to be appointed in third level colleges.  The statistics are clear and there are people behind them.  We cannot pretend that it is not our responsibility and we must do something.  We must act.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.231" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018102300002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to members today.  This is a timely intervention.  Sexual violence has been much discussed recently and the question now is what actions we can take to move beyond awareness into creating the change needed to build safety and freedom from sexual violence.  The RCNI believes higher education institutes, HEIs, have a significant role to play in prevention.  The third level sector is an engine for the production and reproduction of our culture and, as such, we would welcome these institutions fully, consciously and critically engaging in transformation towards prevention.</p> <p>  The task this committee has set itself benefits from the industry of a range of academics, welfare professionals and student leaders who have invested their expertise, resources and passion into devising and testing a range of curriculum interventions such as consent classes, bystander training, workshops, online resources and interactive and performance models of exploration on these issues.  Some of these specialists are here before the committee today and can speak more expertly than can I on those aspects.  With the right climate, these pockets of excellence can be nurtured and sustained into the future to continue the essential work of evolving and developing engagement with our ever-changing culture in order to create tools for safety from sexual violence.</p> <p>  The RCNI would like to make a key point to the committee about consent classes in third level.  They are not stand-alone solutions to the challenge of addressing sexual violence and the work is not complete if or once the best practice and proven classes are embedded across HEIs.  Indeed, we would consider it a failure if we limited ourselves to consent classes.  Consent classes need to form one part of a whole-of-system approach in order to have a sustainable and positive impact.  A whole-of-system approach would involve a critical engagement of the institution, and accountability and proactiveness in creating safety.  This might include, for example, consent and bystander programmes integrated into induction programmes for all new entrants, as has been achieved in the IT in Tralee; consistent, visible year-round zero tolerance promotion across campus, on and offline; a protocol on responding to all sexual crime incidents; a policy on supporting an individual who has reported an incident, including establishing a tailored support plan for the duration of the person's education; a policy on responding to individuals against whom allegations have been made; HR and CPD strategies, which are gender-proofed, to ensure a professional and consistent support infrastructure is provided by the HEI in line with the above policies and protocols, which is visible to students, accessible and valued as a professional part of a staff member's role; staffing awareness, CPD and gender-proofing and equality measures to reflect an institution-wide engagement with embedded inequalities that facilitate rape culture.</p> <p>  Other jurisdictions have examined this matter in detail, which means much of the research and evidence is now available to us.  For the RCNI, a key barrier to sustainable success in preventing sexual violence is that expertise keeps falling away due to a lack of infrastructure and investment in specialisation.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that no institute, dedicated funding stream or academic topic specialises in sexual violence.  We contend that identifying and valuing multidisciplinary engagement and sustaining academic specialisation in sexual violence is a critical part of the effectiveness of any third level approach to the prevention of sexual violence.  This committee, in reflecting on these issues, might ask what the Government can do to foster the sustainability of this expertise.</p> <p>  We recommend that first we would have consent and other workshops on preventing sexual violence and that they should be evidence informed, evolving and embedded.  There is no shortcut to a whole-of-institute response and consent classes should be parallel to ensuring the appropriate structural responses to sexual violence and primary prevention across the whole institution are in place.  The standing this focus and subject has in our HEIs, the space provided for reflection and intervention and the value placed on this work is critical.  Engaging new entrants to all HEIs in their culture to create a safe place to learn and freedom from the fear of sexual harassment and violence is a key part of that transformation; supporting institution-wide engagement is the rest of the work.</p></speech>

As committee members are aware, all publicly funded third level institutions provide a range of student support services, including counselling and health services to their students.  In conjunction with these services, the third level institutions support the student unions in their campaigns and initiatives on sexual health for students.  In recent years a number of third level institutions have established sexual consent programmes and workshops for their students.  These programmes and workshops have a significant positive impact on students.  An example of the programmes include NUI Galway's SMART consent workshops, which were developed from a recognition of positive health promotion, as well as an awareness of sexual violence.  NUI Galway has assisted in the rolling out of the workshops in a number of other higher education institutions.  University College Cork's bystander intervention is a six-workshop module on bystander intervention for first year students in its law, nursing and applied psychology classes.</p> <p>  The student unions are an integral element to the provision of such information to the student population in the higher education institutions.  Every year the USI holds its sexual health and guidance week in the higher education institutions throughout the country.  The issue of consent has been a significant feature of its recent campaigns.  I also acknowledge the significant work being done by the National Women's Council of Ireland under its ending sexual harassment and violence in third level education, ESHTE, project.  The project aims to tackle sexual violence and harassment in third level institutions.  The NWCI's It Stops Now website is an invaluable resource in this area.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has stated that providing excellence in education depends on providing a safe learning environment, free from sexual harassment, assault and the fear or threat of it.  In August 2018 the Minister of State launched the latest report of NUI Galway's SMART consent team, on sexual consent among third level students.  On 4 October 2018, the Minister of State brought together representatives from the higher education institutions, student unions and other stakeholders for a meeting on consent and tackling sexual violence in third level education.  The Minister of State is currently examining the issues that were discussed at the meeting, and will shortly be establishing a working group to devise a toolkit of appropriate initiatives and interventions that will be made available to the higher education institutions to deploy within their institutions.  I hope I have been of assistance to the work of the committee.  I am happy to answer questions and provide the committee with any additional information it may require.</p></speech>

Is it the gold standard in this country for consent at third level?  What are the ongoing funding requirements of that initiative?  What can it do with the funding it has?  Can any of its research be applied to second level?  I understand the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is doing some work in that regard.  Ms Cahill should explain what she meant by differing cultural norms from international students.  I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.</p></speech>

This question has been touched on by others.  I understand that Trinity College has timetabled workshops for students in halls of residence and that Institute of Technology, Tralee has something for all new entrants.  As we have heard from Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the work we need to do in this area should not be confined to consent classes but should apply across an entire institution.  To what extent do we reach everybody we need to reach?</p> <p>  That is my main question, but I have some subsidiary questions that Ms Cahill might be best placed to answer.  Are the people who are most likely to go to these workshops those who are concerned that something will happen that they have not consented to?  What about the people who are likely to assume consent when it is not being given?  How do we reach the people who may be the main cause of the problem, if I can put it that way?  It is in that context that I am asking whether these classes should be voluntary or mandatory.  To what extent are the people on both sides of the consent question being reached?</p> <p>  I was interested in what Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar said about the approach being taken at Institute of Technology, Tralee.  I wonder whether the joint committee should get some specific information on that.</p> <p>  Ms Cahill mentioned the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I was a member of the committee, which made an important ancillary recommendation on the question of having appropriate and comprehensive relationship and sexuality education at all levels.  Perhaps Mr. Crosby can tell us to what extent the Department of Education and Skills has a role in ensuring such education is offered.  This aspect of the matter is probably broader than what we are considering today.</p> <p>  Mr. De R&iacute;s mentioned that some people who start college have not previously been given much information on the specific area of consent.  I ask Mr. Crosby to comment on the role of the Department of Education and Skills in moving beyond identifying good practices in certain places by ensuring those practices are spread across the education system in an age-appropriate manner.  They are needed at higher education level and maybe also at the pre-higher education levels.</p></speech>

In addition to asking my own questions, I would like to ask some questions on behalf of Senator Ruane, who has had to go to the Seanad Chamber.  When she was here a minute ago, she asked me to put certain questions to the witnesses.  I will begin with my own questions.</p> <p>  Is Ms Cahill of the view - I suspect she is - that all third level institutions should have a dedicated liaison office with trained personnel to oversee the reporting and handling of sexual harassment and assault allegations?  It seems that the current reporting structures in a number of institutions can be quite unclear.  I presume that lack of clarity acts as a disincentive to students when they are deciding whether to report incidents.</p> <p>  Is there any process for collecting data on incidents of sexual assault on campus at a national level?  Could the collection of data inform a standardised approach to consent classes across Ireland?  Should there be a standardised approach to the provision of consent classes across all institutes?  Would that help to develop best practice, allow shared learnings and avoid duplication of effort?</p> <p>  Like others, I would like to know whether the witnesses believe we should be starting earlier.  If so, should we start at post-primary level or at primary level?  Does the potential exist for the higher education institutions to work with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to develop consent-based programmes that complement one another for the various stages of the school curriculum?</p> <p>  I join Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in asking the witnesses whether they believe consent classes should be compulsory.  What is the best way to ensure the people who need these classes receive them?</p> <p>  I will conclude by asking three questions on behalf of Senator Ruane.  The first two questions are for everybody.  First, how well do the dignity and respect policies under which most universities operate work?  What would an adequate framework for responding to reports of rape and unwanted sexual contact look like?  When we introduce consent classes, there is an increase in reporting.  Second, how are consent classes currently funded?  What is needed to sustain consent classes and help them to grow?  Senator Ruane's final question is for Mr. De R&iacute;s.  Can he give the joint committee an idea of what is involved in consent classes?</p></speech>

Some of the questions I had intended to ask have been touched on by my colleagues.  Are we coming at this too late from the witnesses' perspective?  Should we be introducing this at a more appropriate stage before students reach third level?  That is primarily a question for Mr. Crosby, although other speakers have touched on this aspect of the matter.</p> <p>  Having listened to the witnesses' contributions, it appears to me that a great deal of good work is being done in this area by different people.  Everybody seems to be doing his or her own thing.  Is there any joined-up thinking between everyone?  Are ideas being shared from the Department down?  Are ideas being shared across the universities?  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p> <p>  Has there been a decrease in the number of sexual assaults reported to the universities since the introduction of consent classes?  What are the data in that regard?</p> <p>  The issue of funding has been mentioned by many speakers.  Do the witnesses agree that if we are serious about this, we need to provide the necessary funds to ensure the recommendations that are made are actually carried through?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018102300002#L01200"><p>I would like to ask a couple of questions along similar lines.  Dr. MacNeela mentioned that the limited education which exists in schools can be seen in the work that is being done in Galway.  I ask him to explain how that can be seen and what its impact is.  Obviously, it links in with the point that has been made about taking an holistic approach.  Third level institutions do not exist as islands.  Students have lives before, during, after and outside their lives in third level institutions.</p> <p>  I read the report setting out the results from Galway.  On the one hand, they illustrate the prevalence in our society of problems like sexual harassment and bad attitudes to consent.  On the other hand, it is striking to see that the consent workshops are having an impact across all the different metrics.  The report shows there is a significant improvement in awareness levels after the workshops by comparison with the levels prior to the workshops.  I definitely take the point about a need for an holistic approach.  This is one of many aspects of that.  Obviously, there is now a very strong evidence base for consent workshops.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether anyone has mentioned what percentage of students receive consent workshops at the moment.  Does anyone have that figure?  I presume the percentage we are dealing with at present is quite small.  If we have an evidence base for saying this is an important element of education on sexual health and consent etc., how can we make it more accessible?  This is the key point of all the contributions.  Has anyone put a figure on how much it would cost to provide the necessary resources to roll this out on the kind of basis that would be needed to make it accessible?  I accept that the question of whether this should be compulsory is an important one, but at the very least it should be accessible for every single third level student as a starting point.</p></speech>

Essentially, the joint committee is examining the effectiveness, timeliness and delivery of various types of programmes.  The colleges and universities that are rolling out programmes certainly have to be commended.  The programmes that involve students and their peers being given training to help others are definitely to be commended.</p><p>Different approaches are taken.  Part of what we want to do is to look at standardisation and who delivers the programmes.  We all accept and acknowledge the need for these programmes.  It is heartening that the number of students taking the courses has jumped by 600% in the past 12 months.  Young people are recognising the need for this and are willing to participate.  That is heartening.  This goes back to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question regarding whether it should be mandatory or voluntary.  There is also a question as to whether Government funding for universities and institutes of technology should be dependent on the delivery of these classes.  This needs to be taken seriously.</p><p> It is important that young people better understand the meaning of consent.  There is a need to support them and improve their communication skills when they are at a vulnerable stage of their lives in to minimise the risk of inappropriate sexual behaviour.  The key point is whether this needs to start at secondary level.  I direct that particularly to Mr. Crosby to answer.  Does the Department feel there should be standardisation and that it should be mandatory and introduced at second level, while preparing young people to take the leap into the world of third-level and further education?  Perhaps there are plans to introduce consent classes at post-primary level about which Mr. Crosby can tell us.  What funding is needed?</p><p> I thank Rape Crisis Network Ireland for the practical and useful suggestions it has made.  I will now go back to the witnesses and stakeholders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane De R&iacute;s" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018102300002#M00200"><p>It might be good to start with the content of the workshops that we employ in Trinity.  They are modelled from NUIG's SMART consent.  We remodelled it so it was less about teaching people what consent is and how to act and more about stimulating their own thought and understanding and conversations around consent.</p> <p>  The workshop takes a simple format and lasts about an hour or an hour and a half.  It begins with a general warm-up session and ice breaker.  We then use the FRIES model, which was originally employed by Planned Parenthood in the US.  FRIES stands for freely given, retractable, informed, enthusiastic and specific.  We then move on to case-by-case studies and examples.  They are open-ended so it could be a relationship or something that is happening after a night out.  We ask the students how this situation should proceed.  That gets them thinking about what they would do in that situation.  It is simple and does not take a lot to roll out but it is a matter of making them more accessible.  We roll them out in the first year residence in Trinity Hall.  It is a targeted population of first years and there was 100% attendance on their part.  It is now a normal part of orientation.</p> <p>  To make it available to the whole college would require resources.  We have trained student facilitators who, in partnership with someone from the student counselling service, facilitate the workshops.  The counsellors and the training of the students are the resources required to carry out the workshops.  There is now incredible demand from societies, sports clubs and college sports departments to roll the classes out to their members and the people who use their facilities and services.  There are ways of rolling this out beyond the first year hall of residence.  It is a matter of getting the resources to ensure we can do that.</p> <p>  The content is simple but it does work.  The figures and feedback say that people feel more informed after they have sat through, and engaged with, the workshop.  It is about creating a positive atmosphere around consent, rather than telling students what constitutes consent.  It gets students thinking about what is consent.  We are pleased with how it has gone.  We need to make them more accessible.</p></speech>

Mandatory means that a student will not graduate unless he or she completes this programme.  I do not think that is what we are seeking.  We can put it into orientation, which we say is required, but if a student misses orientation, as happens, he or she can still progress.  If it becomes a cultural norm within the institution, then it can reach more than 90% or 95% of students.  The most effective way to ensure that we get the vast majority of the students is to incorporate it into an orientation programme.  If we try and insert it in the academic programme, there are significant challenges because our first year engineering students, and our apprenticeship students, are timetabled for 35 hours a week.  If we get it into the orientation, we can reach the vast majority of students.  There is real value in the voluntary programmes like the SMART consent programmes.  There is an element of preaching to the converted, because people who go to a voluntary programme are people who are supportive of these ideas, but they are also generally the student leaders, the opinion formers on campus and the people who can call out behaviour that they see and highlight inappropriate behaviour and bring it to our attention.  "Mandatory" is an unusual word in higher education.  Much as one would think we can set it down, sometimes we cannot.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its support of Technological University Dublin.  We are working with our colleagues in Blanchardstown and Tallaght and everyone is supportive of incorporating consent classes into orientation next year.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked if there will be a drop in reported sexual assaults.  I think there will be an increase in reported sexual assaults due to the increased awareness and willingness of students to call out unacceptable behaviour.  Students are more likely to recognise that something that happened to them should not have happened.  They will be more willing to report it.  According to our counselling service, over a five-year period, there were five or six reported rapes or attempted rapes each year, some on campus and some off campus.  We are not aware that any of those have been reported.  They were dealt with by the counselling service and it supported the students but they did not progress to the garda&iacute; or the university authorities.  The feedback from the students was that alcohol was involved and they were not aware if consent was given.  I could go on about alcohol.  The students in question were also conscious that if they reported it, they were not comfortable that they would be treated fairly and the process of reporting it may be more challenging for them and would make the situation worse.  That is an area we must work seriously on.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin asked about the standardised approach to dealing with complaints.  That would be valuable.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of all my colleagues in student affairs across the higher education sector, because we are all struggling with this and trying to deal with it, it would be quite challenging for some of the smaller institutions to get legal advice on a framework that would assist in dealing with these complaints.  The sector has previously dealt with alcohol sponsorship on campus, etc., through a sectoral approach, and this framework has been very helpful.  Even though it may not be stipulated that one must go down that route, the fact that it is recommended as good practice means that, very quickly, one must implement such practice and it then becomes the norm.  Such a framework would be very helpful to us.</p><p> As to whether consent should be taught earlier or at secondary level, it absolutely should be incorporated in that regard.  However, this would not remove the onus from third-level institutions to continue with consent classes because we must set the culture, ethos and values in higher education.</p><p> I have probably spoken enough so I will give colleagues a chance.</p></speech>

We attach significant importance to it.  That said, and while issues of sexual consent and the culture behind it are very long-standing ones for us all in society, the reality is that it has come to the fore as an issue in higher education in relatively recent years.  For this reason, and like others, I think the system is probably in a way catching up and trying to develop initiatives and so on to respond to this.  While it is of considerable strategic importance to the Department and the Minister, I would not want to suggest the Department is claiming any particular expertise or monopoly of wisdom on the matter.  For this reason, the Department is not carrying a flag for any gold standard or particular standardised approach.</p> <p>  In considering whether there is a gold standard, one thing that occurs is that if I look at the contrast of perspectives and approaches, it seems that SMART consent very much relates to the issue of consent as it affects people in situations at given times.  The UCC bystander programme, on the other hand, has more to do with the culture that surrounds what happens when we are a third party and we see something happen.  It aims to create a culture that is less tolerant and less supportive of misconduct and the attitudes - particularly the sexist attitudes - that go with it.  In other words, both approaches have a role to play.  The ESHTE project and It Stops Now seem to combine them.  I would not like to see any of these being seen as a particular gold standard for which to aim.  For this reason, and coming out of the workshop that was held in October, what the group that has been brought together plans to do next is to try to develop a toolkit or suite of appropriate interventions that can be operated or implemented in institutions and then to have some means of ensuring that the institutions are accountable for doing so and rolling this out.  That is where I am coming from.</p></speech>

If NUIG is rolling out the programme nationwide, do we decide that the funding should go to NUIG, which can then take the lead on the programme, or do we decide that every college can do this?  We do not really have an NCCA, a centralised curriculum body, at third level.  Each university devises its own programmes of education.  I am only asking the question.  If NUIG saves a few quid and does the job properly, is it the one that should be picked to receive the limited State funding available?  Should we decide to support NUIG because its programme works, or has been seen to work, and it would then be mandated to support the rest of the institutions?</p></speech>

One piece of good fortune the Department had was to have many of the leading experts in the field, including one or two people sitting at this table, involved.  They will go on to be members of the group to try to devise that toolkit of initiatives.  Again, while the group will produce a suite of measures, I would not want the Department, the officials or the Minister to claim any kind of monopoly of wisdom on this or to pre-empt the work the group will do.  The group's work is about to get under way and it intends to produce its output in a very short period.</p></speech>

I am conscious of two things in this regard.  One is the issue of a standardised approach.  While I appreciate that a standardised approach can avoid duplication of resources, the question of a standardised approach across higher education institutions should be linked with the question of mandatory versus voluntary courses that was discussed earlier.  From the point of view of good practice - and this came out in Mr. De R&iacute;s's comments about tailoring something for the particular circumstances of a college - while there may be a suite of initiatives, tackling the attitudes that go with misconduct and that are so negative involves communities.  The community on a campus is where one gets this right and gets best practice.  From this point of view, the Department does not believe there is a one-size-fits-all scenario.  When it comes to the question of course content or student content delivered by the HEIs, there is an issue of academic freedom, and the Department would not be in a space of directing or dictating whatever the institutions themselves might do.  The idea here is really to make best practice models available to the institutions and then ensure that they deploy them as best they can.</p> <p>  If I may come to the question as to whether it is too late, there is an issue as to whether this work would begin when someone is at the age of 18 or 19 or earlier.  I do not want to comment in any personal capacity in this regard except to say that the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, very recently called on the NCCA to initiate a review of the RSE programme in schools.  This review covers a multiplicity of different relationship and sexuality education issues, but consent, what it means and its significance is the first item on the list as an issue to be dealt with.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is our expert in this field.  As I said, as the NCCA goes into this review I am not sure with whom it will consult but I have no doubt but that the HEIs will have a role in that, if for no other reason than they have a role in teacher education and so on.  However, this would really be a matter for the NCCA, which is due to report back to the Department and the Minister on this review in the first half of 2019.</p></speech>

It is also never too late, however.  I have specialised in sexual violence for a very long time.  I am still learning.</p><p>Third level is an appropriate point at which to start intervening and doing this work.</p><p> On the issue of reach and the mandatory aspect, I agree with Dr. Gormley.  There was a query about IT Tralee.  It is a question of embedding and normalising this content in, for example, induction and orientation processes.  I apologise for flying through the issues raised, but this goes somewhat to the question of cost.  If there is an existing orientation and induction infrastructure, the content could become a normal and embedded part of that and, consequently, would not require a new infrastructure.</p><p> Another aspect of the question on who gets to have this conversation on campus is covered under the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  A gold standard of content is being developed across the various subject matters at third level.  In this context, I am referring to training in areas where people would in their professional capacity need to have interactions about and some knowledge of sexual violence.  For example, a gold standard would be developed in respect of what every nurse should know about sexual violence when graduating.  That development is happening in parallel with this work, with the latter being about all students, with some specialisation and targeting of information around domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p> A part of the slightly tricky question of who volunteers is addressed by embedding and normalising it and changing the culture.  It is a matter of trying to surround those who are not engaging to the point that they are inevitably engaged because the context around them has changed.  It is a multilayered response, not one where people simply turn up to a workshop in order to tick a box.  There must be visibility of the multiple layers of response throughout so that the wagons surround those who are reluctant participants in change, as it were.</p><p> As Dr. Gormley alluded to, the standardisation of some aspects would be helpful.  Most higher education institutions would welcome some standardisation of, for example, response protocols.  It is often a crime that is being responded to, which requires a multi-agency set of protocols to be devised in order to help guide every higher education institution.  There are other types of standard response that we would like to be accessible to students.  Ms Cahill has spoken about some of those matters.  Response protocols would be an important element of standardisation.</p><p> Regarding the content of the curriculum, I would be cautious about locking it down as we do at primary and second level.  As we move up in cultural sophistication, the question of locking down a curriculum becomes counterproductive.  We need an evolving curriculum because our culture is evolving.  In our experience regarding developing and delivering these types of programme, they go out of date very quickly.  However, criteria would be locked down and standardised.  For example, one would want to standardise what a learning programme is and whether a measurable capacity to evolve is built into it.</p><p> Several members asked for data and inquired about how we are counting, tracking and monitoring things.  This is an important aspect of standardisation.  We count badly at the moment.  There are little data and visibility and a great deal of unevenness.  Institutions count differently even within their different locations.  ITs are doing the counting and taking responsibility for it.  It is a hotchpotch, so we cannot answer the question of where we stand as regards data.  It would be good if we standardised how, what and when we counted and who was counting it so that we could begin to understand what we were looking at and to measure impact.  Doing it together would make it more possible and productive.  A question was asked about collaboration.  There is a great deal of collaboration.  The universities and ITs have organisations that work on building shared and standard responses for them.  As programmes and initiatives have grown, most of us at this table have engaged in organic collaborations.  There are a number of structures.  There has to be a collaborative, inter-agency and multilevel response from administrations, academics, students, NGOs, the Department and the HEA.  It is through this type of approach that we will get there.</p></speech>

It cannot only be something that identifies with people aged between 18 and 24 years.  There are mature students, international students and LGBTI students who need an inclusive and sex positive space.</p> <p>  Reaching people cannot just be the box-ticking, class-type model.  We are not advocating for that.  Rather, we are saying that a workshop model needs to be introduced across institutions in the wider context of consent education.  As Dr. MacNeela mentioned, it can be done through theatre, videos, social media campaigns and workshops throughout the year.  However, a box-ticking class is not the way forward.  We tend to see people who are interested in being student leaders or who are already interested in this area, for example, those doing good work in feminist and other societies on campus, being the first to attend these.  It must be asked whether they are the right people.  The more we mainstream this, the better, as we will not just be equipping people who are already interested to be bystanders.  In TCD, for example, accommodation was a target, with as many people as possible receiving consent classes.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin asked about the data collection process.  There is zero to little collection, which is part of the problem.  A member asked whether there will be a drop in the number of people noting violence or disclosing issues.  The numbers of those making disclosures will increase.</p><p>I have seen in my own experience but also in students' unions across the country that where one runs sexual health and awareness campaigns and introduces the concept of consent people at that point see the students' union as a place to disclose, which is a concern.  </p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin also asked a question about staff members.  We support the idea of a person being designated in each institution to ensure consent education programmes are rolled out. </p><p> Senator Ruane asked about reporting.  We have a serious concern about the protocols in third level education institutions.  The question has already arisen in the DIT's submission about where people approach and speak to somebody in a counselling centre, are dealt with in a health centre but then they do not  progress to the reporting stage.  We are seriously concerned that the reporting structures in colleges are not clear enough.  We are concerned that in the majority of institutions issues of consent, sexual harassment and assault are couched in terms in dignity and respect policies that are not very accessible to students.  </p><p> A question was asked about whether educating at third level was too late or whether people should we educated about these matters beforehand.  I want to make it absolutely clear that it is USI's policy that such education should happen way before entry to third level.  The fact is one has a higher population of sexually active young people aged between 17 and 24 years, at which point intervention is needed.  The first time people hear about consent or condoms should not be during sexual health awareness and guidance, SHAG, week run by USI in the first year of college.  It is not good enough that there is no comprehensive relationship and sexuality education, RSE.  I take Deputy Thomas Byrne's point that our interaction with the process is important.</p></speech>

We need to have a conversation about such education being tied to the compacts.  I do not have a position on it, but I do think we need to have that conversation quickly.  We need more data because people are asking questions about what happens in institutions.  That is why we would like to rerun the Say Something survey we carried out in 2014.  We need to move away from consent classes being the point at which we talk about consent, education and respect across all levels of education and society.  </p> <p>  I thank committee members for their time.</p></speech>

Last but not least I call Dr. MacNeela.  I have listened to the call that consent education should be mandatory.  It strikes me that if such education was mandatory in college and not everybody attended the class, potentially, a situation could arise.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, recently launched NUIG's SMART Consent workshops.  At the launch she said attendance at sexual consent courses should be mandatory for students in all third level colleges and I share her view.  What about the delegates?  Obviously, they will respond to some of the other questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. P&aacute;draig MacNeela" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018102300002#P00900"><p>It is really important that strong language be used to have a strong impact and statement of purpose when one comes from a position where historically there has been little or no activity.  That is why I think deliberately using a word such as "mandatory" is a strong way to put it out to colleges that they should work out what it means for them.</p> <p>  Let me outline what we have seen in our travels throughout the education system.  We now work with up to ten institutions from Belfast to Cork and from Galway to Dublin.  We have seen a range of settings into which this work will slot immediately.  Sometimes it is students' union driven, sometimes it is student service driven and sometimes there is a balance.  It is a unique configuration and we have learned from these lessons.    </p> <p>  Institute of Technology Tralee has been mentioned.  Ms Jackie Ruttledge works in its health promotion department.  She has been inspirational and helped to show us how one can integrate students safely within the programme of education one is trying to convey.  </p> <p>  I want to mention a couple of points by way of clarification.  We offer a workshop.  We use the word "workshop" deliberately because it implies that one is active and involved in a range of different activities.  One is out of one's chair performing individual tasks.  One works with a small group of people with whom one exchange views.  One also engages in whole group tasks.</p> <p>  Where we bring introduce information from outside, we draw on data we have gleaned from over 3,000 students who responded to our surveys and scenarios we presented to them via online formats.  It does not matter what the view within the room is because we offer ambiguous scenarios and ask whether a smile is enough and the people concerned had too much to drink.  We can also give people information from their peers outside the room, which is really important.  For example, we present a same-sex scenario where the question is if the people concerned should have talked more because there was a misunderstanding and some non-consenting behaviour.  What we can show is that 90% of one's peers outside the room who have completed our online survey say it is okay to ask and that one can clarify.  Then we work with the people in the room and ask them what they would say.  We get their words, to which we can come back repeatedly during the course of a workshop.  All of it is really important in terms of inclusivity.  Another scenario we present is where a man has been subject to harassment by a woman.  It is another really important model that has to be spoken about.</p> <p>  We discuss relationship issues, including, for example, the issue of consent in long-standing relationships versus prototype hook-up scenarios.  All of these things are extremely important in terms of the content of a workshop, what makes it interactive and why we get a high score of four out of five from students, including those in Trinity College Dublin in 2016.  It is encouraging that that result was not obtained by specialised persons who delivered workshops.  Instead, we have trained people who go on to get really positive results from the students with whom they work.  It is important to note that our workshops are effective.</p> <p>  I would like to interest members in a much bigger vision.  We can get bogged down in discussing issues surrounding programmes being mandatory and so forth, but we want to see the big picture.  Ideally, as several people said, it would not simply be a workshop, an island of civility, with someone then walking out and encountering whatever else is going on.  We need to be targeting people via new methods such as what we are doing with short consent videos.  In that case, one gets to choose the decision points and decide whether the people will back out of the scenario or go ahead and so forth.  Also, there is the theatre performance.  It was one of the only ways we could reach the thousands of students who had been mentioned in the vital couple weeks of orientation.  We have seen a consent programme deployed in different settings.  The University of Limerick and the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, have scheduled it in classes.  The National College of Art and Design has scheduled it in class hours.  In Galway as that opportunity is not available to us, we worked it into a student accommodation model similar to what is done at Trinity College Dublin.  As I said, we have to consider the bigger picture.  It should not just be an one-hour experience but a repeated message based on good, solid research evidence that is updated regularly and seen throughout the year.  </p> <p>  At second level we now have, possibly, the only opportunity we will ever have to have the different levels of education speaking to each other.  People are asking what should be done in colleges and schools.  It is the perfect opportunity to have common language and a stepped or graded approach to how we will talk about consent at second and third level.  Of course, it will be based on a common message and common features of interaction and dialogue but which will be tailored to the needs of the individual user that one has at school where one is curious about the biological aspects of sexual health and in colleges where people are much more interested in issues of equality and diversity.  In turn, we can tap into ongoing issues that we totally need to discuss.  I refer to the debates about alcohol, relationships, communication and mental health.  It is what makes consent such an interesting issue that sheds light on a number of aspects of the development of young adults. </p> <p>  We need to approach the matter in a very positive way.  In a school environment where 75% of students say they have not received satisfactory sex education, the idea of a consent workshop is threatening on several levels when one enters third level education.</p><p>Women who experience sexual harassment may see a consent workshop as a threatening experience, while men walking into a consent workshop with no background knowledge of what it involves may also see it as threatening and wonder whether they will be put on the spot or asked questions.  We need to embrace it as a positive experience and unique opportunity.  The committee has a unique chance to speak across the different levels of education and we are very interested in helping it to do so.</p></speech>

The motion D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has been asked to approve reads:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Kazakhstan, of the other part, signed at Astana on 21 December 2015, a copy of which was laid before the D&aacute;il on 6 July 2018. </blockquote> <p>This agreement is the first of a new generation of co-operation agreements between the European Union and the former Soviet states of central Asia.  It is intended to provide a framework for strengthening the bilateral relationship between the EU and Kazakhstan.  In addition to facilitating stronger economic relations, the agreement aims to enhance political dialogue and to promote peace and stability.  At its core is a commitment to strengthen the promotion, protection and implementation of fundamental freedoms, human rights, and the respect for democratic principles, the rule of law, and good governance.</p><p>The agreement provides for a comprehensive dialogue between the EU and Kazakhstan and co-operation in a wide range of areas, such as trade, justice, economic and financial co-operation, energy, environment and climate change, culture, education, and research.  It also provides for the provisional application of certain aspects that fall under EU competence until such time as all EU member states ratify the agreement and those aspects come into force.  The agreement has been applied provisionally since 1 April 2016, mainly in the area of trade and economic co-operation.</p><p>Since gaining independence, Kazakhstan has become an increasingly important partner in the promotion of peace and security, regionally and internationally.  It is currently a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and previously served on the UN Human Rights Council from 2012 to 2015.  Ireland has worked well with Kazakhstan at a multilateral level.  When Kazakhstan was the Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, in 2010, Ireland served as the Chair of the Forum for Security Co-operation.  Kazakhstan continues to play a prominent role in the OSCE as the chair of the economic and environmental dimension.</p><p>Ireland formally recognised Kazakhstan as an independent State in 1991, following which diplomatic relations were established.  Our embassy in Moscow is accredited on a secondary basis.  Although we do not have a large footprint in central Asia, several Irish companies have an established presence in Kazakhstan.  Bilateral trade consists mainly of Irish exports to Kazakhstan.  In 2017, our total exports amounted to &euro;34 million and total imports, &euro;450,000.  A double taxation agreement between Ireland and Kazakhstan entered into force in December 2017.  This will allow Ireland to develop greater opportunities for trade and investment with Kazakhstan, including in the education and agricultural sectors.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge concerns about the challenging human rights environment in Kazakhstan.  Together with the EU, Ireland continues to encourage reform within Kazakhstan, particularly in the areas of rule of law, freedom of expression or belief, and human rights.  The EU and Kazakhstan have an annual dialogue in the area of human rights and this agreement provides for further engagement in this important area.  Encouraging steps have been taken by Kazakhstan, including on reform of the penal system and greater participation of civil society in policy decision-making.  The agreement we are discussing specifically provides for co-operation regarding civil society in order to allow for more engagement between the EU and Kazakhstan in this area and encourage the active participation of civil society in the areas of economic, social, and political co-operation.</p><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this motion.  This agreement will not only broaden and deepen the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Kazakhstan and provide for closer economic and political ties, but will also provide the framework for further constructive dialogue on human rights.  I hope the committee will support the motion and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will approve the terms of this agreement in order that Ireland may proceed to ratification in the near future.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Places like Kazakhstan are important, not alone in trade terms, but also in our contact with that part of the world.  We need to think beyond the pale when we look at what will happen with Britain exiting the EU.  We have to be very conscious that we are going to end up as an island nation, stuck out in the Atlantic with no near neighbour who is a member of the European Union.  I am very fearful that it will be very easy to be forgotten if we are not regularly involved.  The contact with Britain through various means has been a great advantage for people looking to this part of Europe.  Friendship with Kazakhstan - not that there would be a great deal of trade initially - can be beneficial where we are at one end and they are at the other.  I attend today to support the Minister of State and the proposal before us but also point out that we have to raise awareness publicly at every opportunity that we have a bigger task on our shoulders with the prospect of Britain exiting the EU.  There has not been enough discussion within this country as to what is going to happen.  We are all so gobsmacked - at least I am &ndash; by the hullabaloo about Britain's exit that we have forgotten both where we are going to stand into the future and the fact that part of this island will not be in the EU either.</p> <p>  These are very serious issues for this committee that we should highlight and get people thinking about as to how we are going to improve our contact with other parts of Europe.  I am not exaggerating when I say this but everybody knows, particularly people of our vintage, if the Cathaoirleach does not mind me saying so, because we have been around a long time, that it is a fact that before Ireland joined the EU, we were stuck out there and we were a small, undeveloped country.  I do not want to see anything happening as a result of Britain's exit that will lead to the same happening again.  We need to make contact and be conscious of our need to become part and parcel of welcoming in countries like Kazakhstan as members into the whole trade situation, and to look ahead to what way we are going to deal with the situation we are going to be faced with.</p> <p>  It would be important that at some early date, we as a committee should have a general discussion as to where we think we are going with the exit of Britain and not be hanging around waiting for it to happen, not that I suggest that we are.  The way things are going there, one would not know what is going to happen.  It is vitally important that we keep up to date and keep Ireland's future out there in red lights.</p></speech>

I note what the Minister of State has said on the changes or improvements in the human rights regime in Kazakhstan.</p><p>The improvements have been very minor in the context of the abuses perpetrated in that country. </p><p> I am aware that in the past the European Union funded a project entitled, Enhancing Criminal Justice in Kazakhstan.  It also co-funded support programmes for the Kazakh authorities to improve the quality and efficiency of the justice system.  However, human rights workers and the international bodies that have examined the reports have stated the officially presented outcomes do not in any way correspond with reality.  The reality is that 140 participants in peaceful protests in May and June are being prosecuted and persecuted for attending the rallies.  One of the key human rights defenders, Elena Semenova, was banned from leaving the country to raise these issues at an international parliamentary assembly.  These are not the actions of a country that embraces fully the human rights conditions set by the European Union.  Does the Minister of State think it should withhold funding from Kazakhstan, unless it makes genuine progress in dealing with human rights issues, rather than seek the implementation of a co-operation agreement?  In particular, we know that the co-operation agreement with Israel which includes very strict, or what look like very strict, sanctions, including suspension of the agreement if the human rights conditions are breached, but that has never happened.  I do not know of any EU co-operation agreement, to date, that has been suspended owing to a breach of the conditions and protocols set by the European Union.  It is inappropriate or, at the very least, premature for us to sign up to this agreement.  If we were to withhold signing it, we would do a lot more for the people of Kazakhstan.  The regime has ruled with an iron fist and might be discouraged from perpetrating human rights abuses in the hope it could reach an agreement in the future.  If we sign up to the agreement, it will view it as an endorsement and carry on regardless.</p></speech>

I also notice the various things the European Union has called on the Kazakh Government to do in dealing with human rights issues, including the media not having freedom of expression.  The European Union did call for a substantial review of the dialogue on human rights in Kazakhstan.  I also know that the Kazakh Government has created a civil society consultative platform.  It appears from what is contained in the document that it is not doing as much as the European Union has called on it to do.  To follow on from what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked, has the Minister of State seen any sign of progress? </p> <p>  When one analyses the trade figures, the agreement seems to be more beneficial to Ireland than Kazakhstan.  Do the Irish companies that operate in Kazakhstan provide proper conditions for their workers?</p> <p>  Other EU countries have not ratified the agreement.  Have they conveyed the reasons they have not done so?  Do they have the same issues with the agreement as Ireland?</p></speech>

I will respond first to the comments made by Deputy Barrett.  I agree with him that we need to look further afield.  If anything, Brexit highlights that sometimes we rely on our neighbours more than we thought we did.</p><p>Certainly, while our closest neighbours within the EU will continue to be our largest market, providing us with access to more than 500 million people, we need to continue to engage with countries further afield.  Working with our EU colleagues to develop not just this partnership but other partnerships and co-operation agreements is very important, especially in Asia, central Asia and the Pacific region.  We have our own Asia-Pacific organisation here, chaired by a former colleague, Mr. Alan Dukes, which is doing a huge amount of work to create new links and strengthen those ties and areas of co-operation already in existence.  We launched Global Ireland 2025 earlier this year, which is a roadmap or plan to double our global footprint by 2025.  That plan is not just focused on Europe but also on North America, South America, Asia and Africa.  While Brexit is not something that we wanted to happen, it has certainly opened our eyes and has focused our attention on the need to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones elsewhere, and this agreement is very much part of that process.</p><p> In terms of funding and the support we have given, there was a provisional agreement in place before the overall ratification.  We are one of five countries that have yet to ratify the agreement.  I cannot answer the question as to why the other four countries have not yet ratified it.  On other occasions we have been one of only two or three countries, so we are not the last to ratify it this time.  Approximately 350 projects have been funded since the country became independent in 1991.  Funding amounted to &euro;180 million over 27 years, which is not a huge amount on an annual basis.  That said, the funding has been used to strengthen the capacity of the country's regional and local government system, to support reform of the justice sector, and to improve the capacity of the public sector to introduce social and economic reforms.  While the amounts are minimal, taking those moneys away would do more harm than good.</p><p> In terms of delaying the ratification and not letting that happen, by ratifying the agreement we can influence Kazakhstan from within the ring.  We can work with its leaders as well as with people on the ground in civil society, but if we do not ratify the agreement, we can only observe from the outside and watch while other countries, states or unions work with Kazakhstan.</p><p> The agreement covers a number of key areas, including a framework for trade.  The latter can be used as a mechanism to address a lot of human rights issues.  Other areas to be covered include people to people relations, civil society co-operation as well as co-operation in education, culture, research and innovation.  The more that we can engage on all of these levels, the more effective we will be in encouraging reform.  As the Vice Chairman has mentioned, we engage on human rights issues not just through the EU but also through the Council for Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  We have regular dialogue in that regard, and having this agreement in place only enhances such dialogue.  It will allow us to continue to highlight the fact that there is still a threat of radicalisation and violent extremism in Kazakhstan, which is a significant threat to civil society and has resulted in violations of a number of fundamental human rights.  Again, by engaging on more than just an economic level, but in the context of education, culture, people to people relations and so on, we can address these issues.  In terms of the funding piece, it would be foolish to stop funding projects in Kazakhstan, particularly given the fact that these projects are focused on people, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, all of which are of fundamental importance to the EU.</p><p> The Chairman also asked about benefits accruing from this agreement.  It is beneficial for Ireland and the rest of the EU to have a closer relationship and partnership with Kazakhstan.  Closer integration will also benefit Kazakhstan.  The EU is its largest trading partner at the moment and as we engage further, that partnership will grow further.  The more support that we can provide, the better.  Some of the areas covered in the agreement include energy, transport, environment, public health, consumer protection, education, training, youth and cultural co-operation.  The agreement will assist in the production of better quality products.  The focus is on business, as well as on better functioning of the judiciary, the rule of law and enhanced transparency, all of which will help citizens.</p><p>It is beneficial to both sides, but the more we work with them and are included in the fold, the more we can do to support them.</p></speech>

We have had this debate around quite a number of countries.  The EU and the developed world often encourage countries that are looking towards democratisation but have harsh regimes.  The EU often encourages them, or bribes them, whichever way one wants to see it.  If they tackle a list of human rights abuses and have more transparent elections, we offer to trade with them, endorse them and enter a trade agreement.  This falls under that category.  That is not a bad thing if one gets product.</p> <p>  I have not been to Kazakhstan but looking from the outside, the problem is that we can only depend on those we trust, whom we have heard in this committee, and they have given various examples of regimes, with which we have had trade agreements, flouting the human rights conditions set by the EU once the agreement is signed.  One question which the Minister of State may not be able to answer is whether any EU trade agreement has been suspended because of human rights abuses.  In every single one of the early years of this century, we argued in committees pertaining to foreign affairs or the EU for suspending Israel from the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership on the very same principles outlined here, seeking to tie trade to improvement in human rights.  That never seems to happen despite very blatant human rights abuses.  I am afraid that if we sign up to the likes of what is before us today, the same will happen.  I am firmly of the belief that sometimes if the carrot of an EU trade agreement is dangled in front of some countries, they will keep moving towards the goal, but once we sign up, they ignore it.  That is my belief.</p></speech>

The more we get involved and pursue that sort of programme through the EU, the greater the chances of getting the changes we are looking for.  If we give the people the two fingers, they will walk away.  As a small, independent country, Ireland can do an awful lot more by being inside the tent and trying to change people.  The more we mix with business people in Kazakhstan and other places like it, the more chance we have of influencing.  Everybody is very conscious of the need for changes to be made and it is recognised in the papers before us.  We should ask the Minister to make certain that the EU keeps an eye on this.  We are endorsing this on the basis that these changes should happen.</p></speech>

To answer the question about whether supports have ever been stopped, I am not aware of that happening.  There are sanctions on Turkey and Russia, but even with sanctions in place we have always continued to engage with countries.  The EU was established and developed on the basis of dialogue.  It is underpinned by the key fundamentals of democracy, human rights, freedom of expression and the rule of law.  Any engagement that we have is underpinned by those core values.  To be able to work with countries and incorporate those rights into their overall agenda, we need to be around the table engaging and talking to them.  As I have said, the figure of &euro;180 million over 27 years is a small amount, but it is a significant gesture of our desire to work with them.  It is important that the funding goes directly to the people for whom it is meant.  That is the manner in which the EU has always operated and will continue to operate.  From my own point of view, working with my colleagues around the European table, these issues are continuously raised at every committee meeting on human rights.  Again, I stress that we are much better within the fold than outside looking in.  That is the best way to move forward.</p></speech>

Suspension does not mean ending.  It applies until our partners get their act together.  Deputy Barrett referred to the document.  The document points out some of the failures which are not acceptable.  Point 20 asks for an end to judicial persecution, harassment and imprisonment of independent journalists.  These are issues we are asking them to tackle.  What if they do not?  Do we just say that an agreement is in place and hope they do if we ask nicely?  If this is passed it does not come up for review.  As I have said, the call for some agreements to be suspended over time has not been heeded.  If Ireland calls for it, that does not mean the EU 27 or EU 28 will listen.  This is an EU agreement, so in some ways it goes out of our hands once we have signed it.  It is not in our gift to automatically suspend it.  If it was a bilateral agreement we could have a parliamentary debate and a greater influence.  It is a concern I have had around several of these agreements.  At this stage I cannot vote for it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018102300002#E00300"><p>I have a flight to catch.  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the recent Report on Local Public Banking in Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. Patrick Casey, the Registrar of Credit Unions, and Ms Anna Marie Finnegan, head of policy in the registry.</p> <p>  I will address three topics that intersect between the scope of the report and the work of the Central Bank.  First, I will provide an overview of the process for bank authorisation.  Second, I will outline developments in the provision of credit to the SME sector.  Third, I will discuss the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector.</p><p>Since 2014 the ECB has been the competent authority for the authorisation of banks in Ireland and across the eurozone.  This means that applications for bank authorisation are dealt with in a consistent manner across the entire eurozone.</p><p> In practical terms, the national competent authority in Ireland, is the Central Bank of Ireland and it assesses applications in consultation with the ECB prior to a recommendation being made whether to approve the application or not.  To this end the Central Bank of Ireland has dedicated authorisation teams following processes that are transparent, predictable and consistent.  The assessment of an application will consider the financial resources the firm has available to it, the sustainability of its business model, governance and risk management arrangements and its ability to recover if it gets into difficulty.  Applicants that can meet the requisite standards in these areas will be approved.</p><p> Turning to SME's, the Central Bank of Ireland understands the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy.  Small and medium enterprises account for the vast majority of active enterprises by number and employ about two thirds of the Irish workforce.  In Ireland the majority of SME investment is financed through internal funds.  For external financing bank lending and leasing are the two largest sources of funds.  In recognising the challenges faced by the SME sector, the Central Bank of Ireland has issued regulation aimed to strengthen protection while also facilitating access to credit.</p><p> The provision of credit to SMEs in Ireland was undoubtedly severely impacted by the financial crisis.  Total credit outstanding to non-financial, non real estate SMEs stands at &euro;16.2 billion as at quarter 1 2018, which is significantly lower than it was at peak.  Default levels remain high at 23% of total loans outstanding and three banks have a market share of 87% of all new SME loans issued in the first quarter of 2018.  This concentration together with the high historic levels of default in Irish SME lending are contributory factors to interest rates for Irish SMEs being higher than average interest rates for SMEs operating in other countries in the eurozone.</p><p> New bank lending is recovering and has risen from &euro;2 billion in late 2013 to &euro;3.75 billion as of the first quarter of this year.  This recovery has been broad based across industrial sectors but two sectors are predominant, agriculture and wholesale and retail trade, and they account for 42% of new bank lending into the SME sector.  </p><p> The credit market has shown a reduction in the SME application rate for bank financing since 2012 until 2017, but has stabilised and started to recover somewhat since.  The market for financing is most common among medium sized firms and lowest among micro sized firms, that is those with fewer than ten employees.  The rejection rates have declined from March 2012 to March 2016 and have stabilised in 2017 and 2018, but are still higher than European averages.  Micro firms experience significantly higher rejection rates than other SME types.  </p><p> The establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has provided a further source of funding to Irish SMEs.  Total loans drawn down from inception to end of March 2018 stood at &euro;952 million.  There are also a range of asset based financing firms, peer to peer lenders, invoice discounters, leasing firms and other types of non-bank financiers that have entered the domestic market in recent years.</p><p> Credit unions play an important role in Irish society and in the financial system.  The role and ethos of the sector reflect the primary objectives and purpose of credit unions to promote thrift among their members and the creation of sources of credit for members' mutual benefit at fair and reasonable interest rates.  </p><p> Our role in respect of credit unions is reflected in our statutory mandate to regulate with a view to ensuring the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of financial stability and the well-being of the sector as a whole.  The Central Bank of Ireland is supportive of further developments of credit union business models.  The consolidation and strengthening of the sector has seen improved standards in the running of credit unions and their financial resources but further progress is required on embedding governance, risk management and operational capability.  The emergence of larger and more sophisticated credit unions presents additional opportunities.  Credit unions are already permitted to provide commercial loans but are not currently particularly active in this type of lending.  The Central Bank of Ireland will be very shortly consulting on proposed changes to the lending framework for credit unions and the proposed revisions also provide increased capacity to engage in both home mortgages and commercial lending for those credit unions with the financial strength, competence and capacity to do so.  Should credit unions wish to become involved in a local public banking model, they will need to ensure the continued protection of members' funds and comply with legislative and regulatory framework that applies to credit unions.</p><p> I hope my contribution has been useful in terms of the topics the committee wishes to discuss.</p></speech>

I will be as brief as I can, given the time constraints as other members may want to come in.  What is the Central Bank's position on the Sparkasse model as referred to in the report that was published by the Government, as to whether there should be that second tier of banking in that model?</p></speech>

We do not have a position as such.  If a public bank sought authorisation, then we would look at it on its own merits and subject to the four areas that I outlined.  I would have no issue with authorising such an application.</p></speech>

If such an application was made that role would obviously have to kick in.  It is four years now since Governor Honohan responded to me in this committee when he said, and I quote:</p><blockquote>There should be a second tier of banking which is geared more towards local concerns, with local managers and a greater level of local awareness.  This would be on a scale larger than the credit unions.  They could be the nucleus of it, but the credit unions as they stand are too small individually to be really effective suppliers of services.  This is all a long-term vision.  The entry of large international banks into the Irish system does not seem to be coming down the tracks, although these things can change.</blockquote> <p>The Governor clearly advocated that type of second tier of banking, recognising gaps that were there in lending to SMEs.</p></speech>

More competition would be welcome to ensure that those needs are met.</p></speech>

He also referred to this level of concentration and the historic levels of default as being some of the contributory factors for high interest rates for SMEs.  In his view, looking at international experiences, what should the market share be for such as these three banks?  What type of concentration should we be looking at if we were to have a more normalised banking system here?</p></speech>

Clearly, that is a very high level, particularly from an SME sector perspective, it is higher than in the mortgage market, which is also relatively highly concentrated.  There is much discussion from a European perspective about other parts of Europe being over-banked, that is having too many banks, and the impacting of this on the sustainability of the banking systems in other jurisdictions.  This is not a like-for-like comparison.</p> <p>  I also noted in my opening remarks that there are other sources of funding for SME's and a lot of SME investment is driven through Internal Funds.  There are studies that show that Ireland is mid-table on SME access to finance, if one looks at it in the round, and not just bank but other available finance.</p></speech>

What should we be looking at and how far out are we from where we should be as a normalised banking system?  From the Central Bank's point of view, should it be much more or a lot more or does it believe that lending to SMEs is still suppressed or at normal levels?  I am trying to get a range from the Central Bank as to where it thinks lending should be at now.  Mr. Sibley's survey shows that micro-firms are experiencing a high level of negative responses from lending institutions.</p><p>Should lending, from the Central Bank's point of view, be increased?</p></speech>

The SMEs are continuing to invest in their businesses.  In and around 23% of SMEs look for finance.  I would suggest that a large number of them are financing investment on their own account or through other means.  Certainly we would, from an economic perspective, be hoping that SMEs continue to invest in their business.  Again, it is difficult to be precise in terms of figures.  What we can see is that the total stock of SME lending has reduced from in and around &euro;30 billion in 2010 down to &euro;16 billion as of today.  There was a high degree of and unsustainable levels of indebtedness at that period.  We would expect SME lending to continue to recover to some extent.</p></speech>

I think there clearly are still relatively high levels of rejection rates.  Interest rates are clearly higher here than in other jurisdictions.  If one considers this in the round, as I discussed it, there are studies that show Ireland is mid tier in terms of financing SMEs if one looks at it beyond just banks.<br/><br/>Looking at the report, it does call out that it is a concentrated market.  It does touch on potential roles for credit unions and other bank finance.  It articulates, I think, that there are potential areas for consideration.  It also identifies the need for public investment in order to set up the model that is being proposed, and it is a decision for the political system whether that is warranted.  </p></speech>

One of the reasons that this session has arisen is because a delegation from here visited Germany a number of weeks ago, in particular to assess the Sparkassen model.</p><p>We looked at the operation of Sparkassen.  We met officials from Sparkassen in their headquarters and we went to L&uuml;neburg where one of the Sparkassen banks are located.  Several features struck us.  First, they had an old-style type of banking.  Trainees come in from school and do in-house examinations.  It was like the banking system here years ago.  There is heavy orientation, in-house training, courses and banking examinations.  The model is based on a low-risk model.  These banks charge a percentage on top of the cost of funds from deposit-holders.  They are not publicly owned as such.  That is something of a misnomer.  They are regionally organised - that might be a better term.  Ultimately, the beneficial interest will return to the municipal authority in the region.  There are many attractions to the model in that they are prohibited by law from engaging in speculative lending.  They are regionally based.  We met members of the public in Germany and I did not meet one German who had a negative view of Sparkassen.  They have Landesbanken as well - that is a separate issue.</p><p> I want to deal with the credit unions and post offices.  I am not looking for a State bank but I am looking for a public bank.  The credit unions and the post offices provide a network.  The post office is ultimately State-owned while the credit unions are not.</p><p> Mr. Sibley made one point that struck me in particular.  He said that a survey undertaken by the Department of Finance showed that those seeking microfinance experienced higher rejection rates than other small and medium-sized businesses.  I would have thought there was scope within the model and regulation of credit unions to fill the void where small and medium-sized business lending should be.  I note that An Post has made reference to bringing a partner on board for home loan lending.  What if the credit unions provided a back-office national facility whereby loan applications would come and be adjudicated upon?  It could operate a little like the Housing Finance Agency.  I know the agency is doing that role in some form for home loans.  How does the Central Bank view that idea?</p><p> I have a particular personal view that we need another pillar.  I believe we need a public banking pillar.  What would be required, on the face of it, from a regulation point of view to allow the credit unions to move into that sector?  The Central Bank could put limits on the level of small and medium-sized business lending.  The credit unions have a network, staff and credibility with the public.  They are similar to Sparkassen in Germany in that way.  Will the Central Bank officials give me their perspective?  I am trying to flesh out what the regulators would look for to allow the credit unions in particular to move into this sector from a prudential viewpoint.  I note An Post is going into the home market as well.</p></speech>

There were many attractions.  I am unsure whether the Sparkassen model in Germany would work here but there was much to be said for a public banking model.  What elements could we bring back?  Are there key elements we could take to be adapted within the credit union system and post office system to provide another public banking pillar?  Currently, there is no such offering to customers in place within the small and medium-sized business lending sector or the home loan sector.</p></speech>

Senator Kieran O'Donnell has mentioned the similarity between the Sparkassen model and the credit unions in how they are set up to serve the local area.

I am zoning in and looking at the credit union movement which has enormous trustworthiness with the public.  Some of the credit unions got into trouble but came through relatively unscathed.  They are based in every town and rural area in Ireland.  They have resources and have &euro;7 billion on deposit with the mainstream banks.  I believe there is a need for competition.  The regulator will take the view on Sparkassen in Germany that they put the other banks under unnecessary pressure, Deutsche Bank being one of those.  I am aware of that.  I will not have this perfect but I am not coming back to Sparkassen with rose-tinted glasses.</p></speech>

I refer to one owned by the members, not privately owned, and that is not a State bank but is a bank that can serve needs.  The credit union network appears to tick many of those elements.  My question is what other elements would Mr. Sibley like to see in there from a prudential perspective to allow things to move in that direction?  I refer to it serving the small and medium business sector as well as people looking to get their starter homes.</p></speech>

I guess this is connected with Deputy Pearse Doherty's question as well on whether there is a gap, or the perception of a gap at least, between where the credit unions are operating and where the banks are. There is also the question of whether the credit unions, to some extent, can close up that gap and serve needs like that at a micro level sufficiently well on an individual basis - I say that because they are individual entities - or is there a need to bring them together?  Alternatively, is there some way to create something entirely new?  That is, ultimately, the question being posed.</p></speech>

If they are moving into an area, however, there must be prudential lending and skill sets available to enable that lending to be assessed.  I wonder can Mr. Sibley come up with a suitable model for the credit unions.  They are doing it at the moment with home loans where they have appointed Link ASI, previously Capita, to look at home loans as they come in.  Can something similar be done in the small and medium enterprise sector to allow any credit union to offer the facility but with a set of skills in the back office to enable loans to be properly assessed?</p></speech>

I understand there are 540-odd locations if we include branches.  That concept is valid by way of coverage.  Mr. Sibley has mentioned the notion that credit unions are individual entities that lack size and scale and, therefore, could benefit from access to expertise, including the benefit of access to scale by working together.  Certainly, in the support services area we can think of the Canadian model-----</p></speech>

Those central provincial credit unions serve the credit unions in their areas with liquidity and various back-office supports.  It is a concept that has worked.  It has served the Canadian model rather well.  In the USA they have similar arrangements as they have in Australia too.</p> <p>  I suppose it raises competition considerations, if we are talking about a competing community or public bank coming into existence, to the extent that such a public bank would be both providing shared service supports to credit unions on the one hand as well as competing with credit unions in respect of deposit sourcing or the provision of loans on the other hand.  That raises competition issues.</p></speech>

Credit unions would remain individual credit unions that have to make prudential requirements.  However, as it stands, my colleagues and I believe there is currently a gap in the market to service micro or small businesses in rural communities, cities and towns.  The credit unions could come together.  Individual unions could pay a levy to a central shared service operator to enable them to access expertise relating to the assessment of SME loans above a certain level.  In that sense the shared service would not be competing with the credit unions.  They shared service would be funded by the credit unions to enable them to have access to the skill-sets to assess micro-loans.  A potential borrower could walk into any credit union and that arrangement would provide the comfort in terms of the regulation by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

If it is helpful we could touch on another point.  We are aiming to consult this week on changes to the long-term lending rules we have, including thinking about micro and SME lending as well.</p></speech>

We are looking at proposals to remove the current lending limits for five and ten-year loans.  This is connected to the rigidity that has to do with the fact that the denominator is loans.  That has caused some issues for individual credit unions &ndash; this has been touched on previously &ndash; and has also caused some pro-cyclical issues.  One option is to replace these with new tiered concentration limits for house and commercial lending.  That would involve a base level of limits for all credit unions but then higher levels and more flexibility for those which can demonstrate the capacity to undertake additional lending from our prudential perspective.  That would cover both categories - house and commercial lending.  I am conscious that much of the discussion here is in SME sector rather than the house lending sector.</p> <p>  Credit unions are permitted to provide commercial loans, as they are termed under the credit union framework, for up to 50% of their regulatory reserves.</p><p>Currently the sector has about &euro;90 million outstanding in loans to SMEs, with an average loan size of about &euro;20,000, which would be quite different from the average loan size that the three main banks operating in the market would provide.  Currently, credit unions are only using about 10% of the existing framework capacity.  They have an opportunity to meet any demand at a local level for SME lending.  I would say their typical SME loan is to a small, local owner-managed business such as a shop, trades person or farm.  That is their traditional sweet spot in terms of lending into SMEs.  That is linked to personal lending in a way; it is coming through the member channels that they have rather than varying outside them.</p><p> We did send a questionnaire to the sector during the preparatory work for our forthcoming consultation to ascertain the appetite among those who thought there was a need for a change in the framework.  What they saw in total lending for five years from now, to 2022, was only &euro;136 million.  We need to ground the discussion in some realism as to the demand the credit unions themselves see in respect of SME lending; it is not significant from their own perspective.</p></speech>

I will summarise what I see as the essence of the report and the witnesses can feel free to give a different assessment.  The key lines are that there is not a compelling business case for the State to establish a new local public banking system but that there is no impediment to Irish Rural Link and so on taking action themselves although they are not going to do it with State funds.  That is effectively what the report says.  If they want to go and get the money and do it, there is no impediment but the State is not going to provide funds.  I interpret that as being negative rather than positive about the establishment of local public banking.  The bottom-line point is that the State is not going to provide money to do it.  That is somewhat ironic given the amount of public money that was pumped into private banks to rescue them from the crisis.  It shows clear favouritism towards the current private banking system.  Is that a fair assessment?  What does the Central Bank think of the report, to the extent that it has a position?</p></speech>

There are some inhibitors to bank finance in Ireland and, typically, SMEs in Ireland use bank finance less than in other parts of the EU.  The report identifies that setting up a public bank would require some degree of State finance.  That is the conclusion of the report.  It describes some business model challenges as well,  on which I would not have a particularly strong view either way.</p><p>From a Central Bank perspective, there is a fundamental question there in terms of authorising a bank to both lend responsibly and also to fund itself responsibly.  Banks need capital and without that capital being in place there is nothing for us to authorise.  I have personally met Irish Rural Link a couple of times and we have met the Sparkasse representatives so we are certainly happy to accommodate, engage and discuss.  We are going through much authorising activity at the moment so we are well versed in that but there are basic fundamentals involved in authorising a bank and unless those fundamentals are in place it is not possible for us to authorise one.</p></speech>

Even where there are State-owned banks, in reality they are run on that same model which has proven to be problematic, both in terms of the immediate scandals that we end up dealing with here such as mortgages going to vulture funds and the tracker mortgages issue, but also in terms of bigger problems which have cost society a huge amount of money in the last decade or so.  I subscribe to the argument that banking should be treated as a public utility.  It has many of the features of a utility and it should be regulated and owned as such.  How does Mr. Sibley respond to those points?</p></speech>

That is why everyone who works in the Central Bank goes to work and our absolute desire, aim and ambition for the financial system is that it serves the needs of the economy and society as a whole in a sustainable way over the long term.  The work that we have done since the crisis - which is still being done - to address those fundamental problems within the banking system and in other parts of the financial system has most definitely improved the resilience of the system and hopefully moved us to being in a situation where the system can serve the needs of the economy and its consumers over the long term in a more sustainable way but there is still work remaining to be done.  We have seen that in the issues of tracker mortgages and the recent work on banking culture.  There is still work to be done on the problems in the institutions.  The Deputy asked a more political question on our views on public and private ownership and that is a matter for the political system rather than for me.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Sibley believe it is the case that on the whole, the private banking system that we have does serve the interests of society and the economy as a whole?</p></speech>

If we imagine a circumstance without functioning banks - and in the history of Ireland we have already stared down that barrel before - and we see that as the alternative proposition it can clearly be seen from the point of view of what is good for the economy and for society that the banking system serves a function but it does so imperfectly.</p></speech>

A recent study concluded that the total implicit State guarantee for private banks within the EU is &euro;240 billion.  Does that not contradict the point of a private, free market and<i>laissez-faire </i>system because in reality if a bank becomes too big to fail then not only will it not be allowed to fail but investors also know that it will not be allowed to fail and in effect the bank has a subsidy which also serves to benefit the existing big banks in the market as opposed to new entrants?</p></speech>

Ireland is an example of this.  We saw it in multiple other jurisdictions across Europe, as well as in the US and beyond.  Since the onset of the financial crisis, a huge amount of work has been done to try to address this problem, make banks more resolvable and enable our resolution authorities to bail in private funding of banks.  While that work has progressed, it is not as far along as I would like.  As I said earlier, the resilience of the system has been improving through the mechanisms that have been put in place.  The work that has been done at European level includes the creation of the European resolution mechanism and the efforts to push banks to make themselves more resolvable.  As I said in my opening remarks, one of the four things I look for is the ability of firms to recover if they get into difficulty.  Resolvability is the mirror of that.  While we expect firms to be able to recover, we are also working hard to make sure they are resolvable.  They are more resolvable than they were, but as of today they are not fully resolvable.  This implies that there is some element of subsidy, albeit a much reduced subsidy than was previously the case.</p></speech>

Having looked at the report, clearly there is a question of what one would do in terms of authorising, which is where we would have responsibility here.  There is clearly a concern in the system around SME lending, so that is why we talked about SMEs.  There are clearly connections with the credit union sector.  In five minutes, which was my instruction, I tried to cover the areas that I thought intersected, in terms of Central Bank responsibilities with the topic that the committee wanted to discuss.

We touched on this, on a number of different occasions.  We only touched on it.  I am a very strong believer in the role of the credit unions.  They can play a really important role, from a financial inclusion perspective.  They can play a really important role in terms of local communities.  We are, as Mr. Casey has outlined, examining the lending frameworks that exist today to make sure that they are fit for purpose for today and tomorrow.  Clearly, there is a role for credit unions.  There are potential opportunities for others to play a role in servicing SMEs in other parts.</p> <p>  If one looks at how banks are lending within Ireland it is relatively well geographically dispersed.  In and around one-third of new lending takes place in Dublin.  However, other jurisdictions are relatively well dispersed.  There are lots of other options for SMEs.  Maybe it is not enough but there are lots of other options for SMEs in terms of access to finance.  Leasing plays nearly a bigger role for SMEs in terms of total finance than bank lending does.  Internal generation of funding plays a much bigger role in terms of the investment SMEs do than bank finance.  Then we have other possibilities.  Peer to peer lending is increasing and so on.  There are other players in the market, not necessarily just banks.  I do not want to overly focus on one particular study but there has been a study of the European system and SME access to finance.  Ireland would rank below the likes of the UK, Germany and Austria but above the likes of Italy, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus.   </p></speech>

I mean people who would come together, make available a sum of money and they test one out then in terms of one's business plan.  That loan is then offered at a huge interest rate.  That situation is damaging the economy and an SME sector that employs so many people, and employed almost 1 million people at one stage.  The statistics hide that fact.  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked Mr. Sibley whether the existing arrangements within the bank were part re-financing and, actually, it is.</p></speech>

If one goes to the bank now, if one has ever had any sort of blip in one's credit position one will not get money anywhere except on a market where one is paying massive interest rates.  That is why the concept of a community bank or a credit union to examine a local application, or an application from a local business or whatever it might be, is hugely attractive because SMES find it simply impossible to trade at a micro level.  Also, banks make it even more impossible by selling off one's overdraft.  I know that Mr. Sibley must catch a flight.</p></speech>

There is a high level of engagement, including information seminars, CEO forums, sessions with boards, quarterly meetings with the representative bodies, town hall meetings, road shows that the teams go on and so forth.  The bank meets hundreds of credit union staff and we publish information and guidelines for them.  As Mr. Casey has described, we have a dedicated team to support credit unions in the context of business model development.

Mr. Casey gave the impression that credit unions should just be lending and that there are no restrictions or regulations preventing that.  Obviously, we as a committee know that there are such restrictions.  We prepared a very important report on the restrictions, particularly the fact that the amount of lending in a credit union should not exceed 15% of loans that have a maturity of ten years or more.  We called for that restriction to be loosened.  Mr. Sibley gave a lecture in Trinity College recently suggesting that it will be loosened.  I ask Mr. Sibley to provide more details on the proposals that will be put out for consultation.</p> <p>  My other question is for Mr. Casey.  Is it the case that one of the credit union movements has received all of the authorisations required from the Central Bank to involve itself in the housing sector?  We understand that the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, has passed all the tests and met all the requirements.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, in response to questions on credit unions investing in social housing said that one of the credit union movements is ready, has gone through all of the processes and has the money available.  I ask Mr. Casey to clarify whether it is CUDA or the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, that has been through all of the processes, is ready and has the money available.  Has the Central Bank authorised a structure, model or SPV?</p></speech>

The Minister of State said that one of the credit union movements is ready, has gone through all of the processes and has money available.  He also said that he could not be any clearer than that.  The witnesses are telling us that the Central Bank has not been involved in those discussions.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We can check that and come back to the Deputy on it.</p><p>The Deputy's first question referred to lending.  Clearly, there is a responsibility on individual credit unions in terms of decisions they make on lending with regard to the safety of their members' funds and their own risk associated with that and the common bond areas we have described.  Mr. Casey has described that a little bit already but perhaps he could expand a little on the consultation.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the deputy governor has indicated that previously and I mentioned it earlier but I will reiterate what has been said.  We are proposing to remove the current five and ten-year maturity limits that are expressed as a percentage of loans, and that is connected with rigidities that are well understood within the credit union sector.  From a prudential perspective we see a degree of procyclicality connected with low loan to asset ratios in credit unions being prevented from lending long term because they do not have significant short-term loans outstanding, and replacing those with tiered concentration limits for both house and commercial lending.  We are planning to consult in relation to that in the coming days, so we will be sending out a consultation paper and seeking the views of the sector and sector representatives and we will share a copy of that consultation paper with members.  I think that is what the deputy governor was referring to in Trinity College recently.</p></speech>

It was argued here a couple of years ago that we should take the current approach and then move to a more tiered system.  Will we now take a tiered approach or will there be flexibility for different types of credit unions?</p></speech>

We will provide just over a two-month consultation period to facilitate people to provide us with submissions.  We will then go through an internal process in terms of assessing those submissions and the various views expressed.  That normally leads to a process of refining proposals and then we will have an internal process within the Central Bank itself.  The last step in the process is the statutory consultation we are required to undertake under section 84A of the 1997 Act.  To an extent, it is a little difficult to put a specific timeline on it because any piece of the process can take longer than anticipated.  Our own broad plan is that we would publish final regulations in the second or third quarter of next year.</p></speech>

There is inherent tiering in the proportionality that we apply in terms of the approach to engaging with credit unions of different size and complexity, our expectations in terms of credit unions from a minimum standards perspective, and what we expect if they want to have more sophistication in terms of their business model.  There is very much proportionality and, as a result, an element of tiering in the approach that we take today.  The suggestion that we would spend more time focusing on the credit union sector is something that we would be very happy to accommodate.</p></speech>

The Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, represents CEOs and senior managers of credit unions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Our members manage the daily interactions with a membership of approximately 3 million people.  In the Republic of Ireland, while the number of credit unions has declined in recent years owing to mergers, the number of credit union offices has not.  We still manage services across more than 400 offices.  Our services are delivered through a variety of channels, people to people, by telephone and online.  We continue to evolve and improve these service offerings.</p> <p>  Ours is the largest movement of co-operatives on the island of Ireland, owned and governed by our members and their representatives and staffed by committed and highly qualified professionals.  Ours are not-for-profit co-ops, born out of and embedded in communities.  Our service to members, the overwhelming majority of the public, is driven by the member interest of that element of the Irish public.  Our co-ops are and remain the original public interest financial institutions operating in the financial services sector.  We are, undoubtedly, pleased that for four years in a row credit unions have been voted number one for customer experience in the CXi, Ireland customer experience report.  That has never happened anywhere else worldwide and it is a tribute to the member-centric, service culture of our 4,000 staff members and directors spread throughout urban and rural areas.  For more than 50 years we have delivered excellent services in communities.  We have responsibly built up our reserves and expertise.  We have quietly and purposefully provided savings and loans facilities, survived recession without any bailout and are expanding our loan books again to meet renewing member demand.  We enforced member care before mainstream banking had customer care imposed on them.  We adopted and adapted to regulation when it was imposed.  We adapted to accelerated mergers and are adapting to new demands as our members' needs change.  Throughout that time we continued to deliver our core business.</p> <p>  Since our inception we have lent money for personal and commercial purposes.  We still do so today.  Loans for commercial purposes have been part of the lending portfolios of credit unions for many years and still are.  The 2016 credit union regulations gave greater definition to commercial loans and limited commercial lending to 50% of a credit union's regulatory reserve, which is equivalent to 5% of the overall assets of a credit union if it holds the minimum reserve requirements.  In March 2018 commercial loans accounted for 1.9% of the &euro;4.5 billion credit unions had out on loan.  It was equivalent to 0.51% of our assets.</p><p>Given that we could be lending up to 5%, or more where there are higher regulatory reserves, there is considerable headroom in credit unions for greater levels of commercial lending in suitable circumstances.  Credit unions have both a public interest and a member interest to serve and must lend responsibly.  We need the frameworks, policies, procedures, systems, personnel and expertise to continue to lend responsibly, including when we are lending in the commercial domain.  These standards should apply to all financial institutions and other entrants in this sphere.  There was in the past and is currently a willingness to address the standards expected by regulation.  There is an expectation and evidence of increasing engagement by small local businesses with credit unions.  We are open for business and anxious to engage meaningfully and responsibly with the members and future members of communities.  We invite commercial interests in communities to come and talk to us.</p></speech>

CUDA was formed in 2003 and represents many of the largest credit unions in the country.  It also provides a wide range of support services for its members, as well as for a growing number of credit unions nationally.  In its early days it was the representative voice of its owner member credit unions in communications with legislators and regulators.  It has since evolved and provides not only a voice for members but also an increasing level of support facilities in the areas of regulatory compliance, risk management, shared services and competency development.<br/><br/>CUDA which also manages the Solution Centre has a vision for a credit union system in Ireland that builds on credit unions' standing as the trusted source of financial services for members.  According to that vision, credit unions can help to shape the society in which we want to live through financial education and the provision of credit for small businesses and community purposes now and for future generations; continue to provide loans for members' individual everyday and longer term needs, while dramatically expanding the points of access to credit; continue to provide secure savings though enhanced investment options, and offer real choice to people to meet their financial needs.  This is a comprehensive vision and we have delivered on several aspects of it, including through our mortgage support framework, a wide range of digital channels and digital engagement facilities and a green energy better home partnership.  We continue to seek solutions to enable credit unions to contribute to resolving the housing emergency and are well on the way to delivering on other product and process solutions, including lending to small businesses.<br/><br/>CUDA has studied the report and agrees with its statement:</p><blockquote>Credit unions are looking to play an increasing role in the Irish retail financial landscape into the future and the Central Bank is assisting credit unions in developing their business model.  This may also provide a channel for increased lending to the rural SMEs in some cases, subject to the capacity of individual credit unions.</blockquote> <p>This is a key component of the societal element of our vision.  The continued importance of the success of the SME sector to Ireland cannot be underestimated.  Ireland has almost 250,000 micro and small enterprises and 43% of private sector employees work in these small firms.  Many small business owners are existing members of their local credit union and their success and the continued success of credit unions are inextricably linked.  That has always been the case.  Faced with massive youth unemployment in the 1950s, a group of people came together around the idea that the solution to that crisis was co-operative self-employment.  However, there was no money with which to start and grow businesses.  As Nora Herlihy, one of the principal founders of the credit union movement in Ireland, said in 1982, &quot;[the] object in promoting the Credit Union idea was to show the people how to accumulate that money from their own savings and resources.&quot;<br/><br/>The report defines public banking as involving a state or other public actor owning a financial institution.  The stated purpose of the report was to investigate the possibility of local public banking in Ireland based on the Sparkassen model and evaluate its potential in an Irish context.  The report states: &quot;The ethos of Sparkassen is not profit maximisation; rather it is public interest based, promoting financial inclusion and economic development within their regions.&quot;</p><p>We could easily replace the reference to "Sparkassen" in that quotation with "credit unions" and have an excellent summation of the objects of credit unions contained in section 6 of the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended.  According to the report, the evidence suggests applications for credit by SMEs are falling in Ireland and, conversely, the supply of credit, both to SMEs and retail customers, is increasing.  However, the question arises as to whether prospective borrowers are receiving fair value.  Speaking at a Small Firms Association event in November 2015, the previous Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, questioned the absence of interest rate reductions and wondered whether it was the result of limited competition in the sector.  As he put it, "We could all do with more competition in the banking system."  CUDA believes credit unions are naturally positioned to bring that competition to the market.</p><p> Credit unions are expert at providing consumer loans, savings and payment facilities and loans for owner-managed businesses.  More credit unions are providing home loans and working to bring extended current account related facilities to the market.  In the Solution Centre we have focused on making it easier and more convenient, through the use of technology, for members to engage with their credit union.  The report correctly acknowledges that "Credit unions are looking to grow their services to small and medium-sized businesses and in doing so fulfil their role as an action group for community development through mobilising local resources for investment in the small firm economy".  An essential ingredient of this development is the review of credit union lending terms and category limits.  In November 2017 the CUAC review report implementation group forwarded a detailed submission to the Central Bank.  We thank all stakeholders in the group, in particular the team at the Department of Finance for its very supportive work in this area.  It is also very encouraging that a consultation paper reviewing the limits is imminent from the Central Bank, the recent references of which to this issue have been very positive.</p><p>  The report correctly recognises that the credit union sector is active in the Irish SME lending market.  As such, the independent external evaluation being commissioned by the Department of Finance should focus on addressing the elements that will facilitate credit unions in delivering the benefits anticipated from a local public banking concept.  They will include utilising the credit union network and prudently using members' savings for productive and provident purposes such as loans to the SME sector.  To this end, we will work with other stakeholders to apply expertise to a model that enables credit unions to bring a range of standardised credit facilities prudently to the market.  Another element is an assessment of how the attractive interest rate frequently referenced in other jurisdictions might be replicated here and how it can be provided in a sustainable manner.  Recognising that not all credit unions may have the capacity to provide these facilities, there should be a review of the common bond legislation to enable such credit unions to introduce members and/or collaborate on such loans with participating credit unions.  A level playing field must also be provided for by regulating peer to peer lending to ensure protections apply to consumers of crowd-funding.  The Central Bank's codes of conduct and the protections which they provide for consumers should also apply to crowd-funding platforms.  Similarly, providers of PCP finance should be subject to the regulatory requirements credit unions must meet.</p><p> I again thank the committee for its kind invitation and look forward to addressing questions members may have.</p></speech>

The Irish league of Credit Unions represents more than 250 credit unions operating in over 500 communities in Ireland.  Ours is an indigenous, local, democratically-led, volunteer based and co-operative financial movement.  Credit unions and the credit union ethos which emphasises not only accessibility in the community but also local leadership are already the embedded cornerstone of what the country needs and people want locally.</p> <p>  The meeting is in response to the publication of the Government's report on local public banking in Ireland.  From a credit union perspective, it also takes place in the context of the committee's own unanimously agreed to report on the review of the credit union sector which it published last November.  We are also meeting in a specific political context in which the confidence and supply agreement has concluded and the CUAC review process is concluding.  In the circumstances, credit unions are looking for a move from aspiration to action.  The commitment to develop a strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector has long been in gestation and, if fulfilled, would provide the local public banking service communities need.</p><p>The challenge now, and it is essentially a political one, is whether kind words of reassurance are going to translate into political prioritisation.  The challenge credit unions face is the challenge for the development of more localised banking and financial services, that we are ambitious to lead.  The challenge is not a lack of goodwill, but the much scarcer commodity of determined prioritisation. <br/><br/>In the report of the committee, it was recognised that the &lsquo;common bond&rsquo; structure inherent in the credit union movement is essential in underpinning the community and democratic base of credit unions.  The common bond is the essential fabric of what binds community and credit unions together.  Its continuance is correctly supported by the committee, and is clearly the obvious foundation stone for enhanced financial services delivered at local level. <br/><br/>In a world of globalisation and homogenisation there is consolidation among credit unions.  There is also a continued enhanced level of service provided by credit unions in over five hundred separate communities.  As credit unions are membership based and co-operative, we have values that banks do not.  Because of our common bond, we are a real community of members saving together, and lending to one another.  A mark of our values is that, for the fourth year in a row, Irish credit unions have come first place in the annual Customer Experience of the Irish CX Impact Awards which were announced on 16 October 2018.  Customer experience is measured by how customers perceive an organisation&rsquo;s brand through their interactions with its employees.  The fact that the credit unions are the only organisation in the world to win this accolade in four consecutive years speaks for itself. <br/><br/>The next step, to deliver financial services locally through credit unions is to deliver now as the CUAC review process concludes on the commitment to &quot;develop a strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector&rdquo;.<b></b>The welcome report on public banking is a backdrop to inform that development as is the excellent report of this committee.  A strategy of itself, however, will not be sufficient.  Any strategy worthy of the name must be accompanied by an implementation plan.  Implementation to be effective must marry policy driven by the Department of Finance with regulation which is the responsibility of the Central Bank.  Any initiative which falls into the void between the two - a void where credit unions have already spent too long - is pointless.  Political prioritisation must be accompanied by effective means to translate aspiration into action.  This has to be the critical move-on required to progress this issue. <br/><br/>The credit unions have been moving on; for example, among other things, they are now processing electronic payments and issuing mortgages.  These are significant and welcome developments, but the scale of what we can do is severely restricted by regulation.  Our aim is to deliver current accounts and debit cards, and support our members with the full range of services they need on a day to day basis.  We are ambitious to deliver lending for SMEs and family farms and we are ready to invest in social housing as asked by Government. <br/><br/>Local public banking is an idea whose time has come.  I can say today that the foundations are in place, and those foundations are credit unions.</p></speech>

We are very proud to be involved in the proposal.  We made an extensive submission to the consultation process investigating a local public banking model for Ireland and we appreciate that the joint committee's Report on Local Public Banking has taken this submission into consideration at great length.  Irish Rural Link is delighted that the report recognises the merits of public banking models and people have listened to our arguments as to how this will add to the financial stability of our regional economies.  However, we have responded to the report in a formal rebuttal as we found misunderstandings within the report with regard to our proposed model.  I have included a copy of that rebuttal in the submission to this committee.</p> <p>  I draw attention to two areas in which we were disappointed at the lack of understanding shown in the local public banking report, competition in the banking market and the Sparkassen model and how it differs from the pillar banks.</p><p>We are particularly disappointed with the view in the report that an Irish local public bank would risk crowding out the private sector institutions.  The Government has often stated a desire to increase competition in the banking sector so it seems counter-intuitive to be afraid of the effects of introducing competition apparently on the basis that it would reduce the oligopoly profits of existing market players.  We note that in the past, the ACC and the ICC banks played an enormous role in the development of the economy of Ireland.</p><p> It is also unfortunate that the report has some inaccuracies in relation to their understanding of the Sparkassen model and how it operates in Germany.  An invitation was extended to the officials carrying out this investigation to visit Germany to see at first hand the model in action but they did not avail of this opportunity.  We are delighted that Irish Rural Link and our partners were able to facilitate members of this committee to take part in such a visit and we are confident that this has substantially enhanced the members' knowledge of the operation of the model.  Coincidently, my colleagues Ms Sinead Dooley and Mr. Noel Kinahan are just back from such a trip with members of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which I am sure was equally well received. </p><p> We are very much looking forward to participating in the stakeholder forum as part of the independent external evaluation referred to in the Government&rsquo;s report.</p><p> It should be noted that we have submitted proposals for the terms of reference and we are awaiting a reply to that.  I am sure that this forum will provide the opportunity for Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders such as the credit union movement - and we are glad to see their representatives here today - to participate in the process.</p><p> We make it clear that by adopting the model of public banking, this creates an opportunity to bring another dimension to our banking sector.  It is not a new idea as we have had it before.</p><p> Irish Rural Link has no vested interest but wants to ensure that the well-being, financial and social, of rural Ireland continues and is not lost or dependent on the current pillar banking system.</p><p> We would welcome questions.</p></speech>

Given the brevity of this presentation and the fact that Irish Rural Link has adequately dealt with the micro issues in its rebuttal letter, we intend to devote our time to highlighting the macro issues involved and the joint consultation group&rsquo;s abject failure to adequately inform Government of the machinations of the banking industry, in terms of regulatory failure; credit creation and the monopoly thereof by the pillar banks; the difference between creating credit for the real or productive economy and creating credit for financial transactions; and why Basel I, II and III regulations do not and cannot work effectively; why another financial crash is considered by many as inevitable; why artificially high interest rates being charged by our current pillar bank oligopoly are wholly incompatible with driving our indigenous economy; the imperative to introduce competition in the Irish banking sector; the illegal suppression of our credit unions and the fallacy of turning our post office network into an &ldquo;agency bank&rdquo; for the benefit of pillar banks and not post masters or communities.  It is worth remembering that a partnership banking arrangement with An Post has already failed back in 2010.</p> <p>  The consultation group&rsquo;s Government report incredibly has failed to take into account the article in the Constitution that deals with competition.  Article 45.2.iv specifically states: "That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole."  We ask why Government, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance repeatedly put the interests of pillar banks before those of the people, the indigenous economy and the general socioeconomic well-being of our country.</p><p>In that context, Professor Steve Keen of Kingston University in London has said that &quot;the financial sector should be the servant of the rest of the economy, not the master but at the moment, it's the master of not just the economy but of the politicians as well .... [so] to break the nexus, we need a complete political shift&quot;. <i></i>In the 1960s, the term &quot;regulatory capture&quot; was coined by an economist, Professor George Stigler, to describe the domination of regulatory agencies by big business through lobbying and selective information sharing.  He claimed that regulatory capture is endemic and that regulatory agencies tend to be understaffed, unaccountable and peopled by bureaucrats, many of whom are drawn from the industries that are being regulated and see themselves as partners with industry rather than its overseers.  Two economists, Dr. Daniel Kaufmann and Dr. Pedro Vicente, published a paper on legal corruption in 2011.  It describes such corruption as taking many forms, including &quot;cronyism, patronage and state 'capture' - when powerful groups manipulate policy formation to serve their own interests rather than the public interest&quot;.<br/><br/>Irish pillar banks currently have a monopoly on the creation of credit.  The effect of this is to put them in control of the economy.  They decide how much money will be created, to whom it is loaned and for what purpose.  There is no effective control over bank lending.  Pillar banks continually lend for speculative purposes.  This leads to asset bubbles such as the property bubble, which brought about the financial crash ten years ago.  Investment in the productive economy is kept to a minimum.  The Basel regulations, which include tier 1 capital requirements, incorrectly assume that banks act as financial intermediaries by accepting deposits and lending the same deposits out again.  The reality is that banks are creating money largely for speculative purposes with virtually no cap on credit creation.  While this leads to high short-term profitability, it inevitably creates asset bubbles and ultimately leads to banks that are too big to fail.  This partly explains why banks are not lending in any meaningful way to SMEs, microenterprises and farmers.  Where they are lending, there is no ceiling on the interest rates being charged.  This means Irish consumers pay the highest interest rates in Europe.<br/><br/>The circumstances I have described, in which pillar banks can charge what they like, is continuing unchecked and unchallenged, mainly because the Government and the captured Department of Finance refuse to countenance competition in the banking market.  High interest rates apply only to those who succeed in obtaining credit from pillar banks.  The reality is that banks are simply not lending to the productive economy.  There is ample evidence of this in various ISME reports.  There is a host of anecdotal evidence from farmers and people involved in small and medium sized enterprises.  The figures that have been reported are exacerbated by the fact that many customers are being informally refused before they go to make formal applications.  Such refusals are not taken into account in the official figures.  We see this time and again.<br/><br/>The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, has acknowledged the roadblock facing the indigenous economy arising from the behaviour of the pillar banks.  As he said in April of this year:</p><blockquote>There is a problem and I am hearing every single day as a rural Deputy, not as a Minister, how banks are dealing with consumers.  We do need a bit of competition in the market.  Banks have certainly lost the sense of what they used to do and are certainly not there for the people anymore.  They are there for themselves, not for the ordinary general public who need banking services.</blockquote><p>Before we submitted our detailed proposals to the joint consultation group, we engaged with the Department of Finance and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to make proposals in respect of public and community banking.  They responded to us by saying that public and community banking would bring no additionality to the banking sector and to the needs of Irish consumers and small businesses.  In many ways, the views put forward by the consultation group in its report were to be expected.  It could be interpreted that the outcome of the consultation was a foregone conclusion and that the consultation was no more than a mechanism to fulfil commitments made by the Government in the programme for Government.  More commitment is needed.<br/><br/>The consultation group has made multiple references to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  We dealt with the SBCI in detail in Appendix 2 of our presentation to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Change and the Environment.  The SBCI is merely an on-lender, with the bulk of its loans - over &euro;700 million to date - going to the pillar banks.  This strategy serves to further consolidate the oligopoly enjoyed by the pillar banks.  It allows them to gouge huge profit margins from further on-lending.  I remind the committee that 80% of funds on-loaned are guaranteed by the SBCI.  The funds provided to the SBCI should, at the very least, have been made available to credit unions and post offices.</p><p>They could more prudently have been used to assist in setting up public and community banks.  As it stands, the SBCI model borders on the provision of illegal state aid to the pillar banks, at a time when post offices and credit unions continue to be suppressed. </p><p> The real problem is not funding - it is a culture of reverence to the pillar banks that does not serve the public interest.  This fundamental aspect of the matter must be changed if Ireland is to build a self-sustaining indigenous economy.  Western countries are realising the folly of allowing banks that are too big to fail to dominate their economies.  Four of the larger credit unions in Canada now have banking subsidiaries.  There is a clamour to reintroduce postal banking in Canada's 6,000 post offices.  Mr. Bernie Sanders, who is a former presidential candidate in the United States, recently introduced the Too Big To Fail - Too Big To Exist Act, which provides among other measures for the break-up of US banks that have a total exposure of more than 3% of that country's gross domestic product.  It is time for Ireland to take the lead in financial and banking reform.  We can start this by quickly convening the promised stakeholder forum, setting a tight timeline and bringing in the requisite experts in the field of finance and financial reform to assist stakeholders in arriving at long-term workable solutions in the public interest.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I invite Ms Annmarie O'Connor of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, to address the joint committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annmarie O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018102300002#JJ00300"><p>On behalf of MABS, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the joint committee's consideration of the substance of the report on financial inclusion and related matters.  The report and the submissions point to a variety of concerns to be addressed in the development of banking and financial services in Ireland.  The report touches on many issues that are pertinent in our case work, including the role of banks in the lives of our clients, the potential role of post offices and credit unions in meeting the needs of our clients, access to affordable credit, the potential of financial technology, unresolved issues in the mortgage market and developmental opportunities for people and communities that are under-served in their consumption of vital financial services.  While we view the primary goals of the proposed local public banking model positively, we have a focus on the needs of a wider segment of the population.  We have a sense of the factors which lead to financial exclusion in day-to-day access to banking, such as the availability of accessible, expedient and low-cost payment mechanisms and affordable forms of credit.  We understand the need to have the ability to extract best value from increasingly complex financial products.  Many people have come to distrust banks and are increasingly wary of any potential toxicity in the financial products they consume.  While we welcome innovative initiatives that seek to include specific groups in the productive economy, we do not want to see the emergence of a merely partial solution to widespread and systemic issues.</p> <p>  Since the beginning of the recession, MABS has assisted approximately 250,000 households through its face-to-face service.  Virtually all of them have experienced a breakdown in relations with financial service providers.  Our strong links with credit unions help our clients to build a bridge back to affordable and sustainable credit.  We have worked with all of the main banks with the aim of re-establishing productive relationships.  We are now dealing with a changing client group.  A higher percentage of our clients is now waged or self-employed.  There is an older age profile.  Their debts are more substantial.  The changing landscape is making our work for our clients more difficult.  Our concern for their future access to affordable, simple and reliable banking and financial services is now more acute.  Although a great deal of positive progress has been made towards the goal of improving the banking and financial services environment, our view is that the banking, payments and credit needs of atypical consumers have not been given sufficient attention.  Many of our clients have impaired credit ratings, but they are not necessarily high-risk consumers.  Viewed from the perspective of a remote and centralised lending unit within a commercial credit institution, they may face barriers in accessing affordable credit.  High-cost credit is a poverty trap.  We have seen the damage caused by sub-prime lending.  Other solutions are needed.  The proposal in the report is to be welcomed as part of a proactive search for such solutions.</p> <p>  Deep and widespread social scarring exists as a lasting legacy of the recession and the banking collapse.  Some people have achieved solutions, but those whose loans have been classified as non-performing and sold on to funds are a significant ongoing concern for MABS and other stakeholders. The sale of non-performing loans represents a severing of relationships between banks and their customers.  For many people, the distress of a loan sale is compounded by not knowing what might come after some resolution to their mortgage arrears is achieved.  They have real concerns about how they will bank and what access, if any, they will have to affordable credit in the future.</p><p>In its submission on the report, CUDA rejects the idea that credit unions be "relegated to acting only as the 'poor man&rsquo;s bank'".  We likewise would disagree with such a proposal.  If, however, for the purposes of today&rsquo;s discussion, the poor man may represent someone who lives on a low income, who has experienced a reduction in their income, or who has some fragility or unpredictability in their income as a consequence of the nature and type of their employment, but who nonetheless plays a productive economic role and needs to have access to affordable banking, credit and payments systems, then we need a bank or a financial services provider that will meet all of those needs.  Perhaps local public banking could be a partial solution.</p><p> We know from debt advice agencies in other jurisdictions that local public banks and debt advice agencies can work effectively together.  We would like the opportunity to contribute to a more in-depth appraisal of how debt advice could be married in a practical and sustainable way within a proposal on local public banking in Ireland.</p><p> The report refers to the potential of FinTech and we feel strongly that this needs further exploration.  We therefore welcome the Department of Finance&rsquo;s statement in the report that "emerging trends, such as FinTech will be kept under review for their potential to develop initiatives that could deliver credit in a more effective and less costly manner".  We see scope for a sandbox type regulatory regime that could exploit both FinTech and RegTech to the benefit of our client group, reducing cost and facilitating access for the types of consumer we have described previously in this paper as atypical and potentially underserved by main banks and financial institutions.</p></speech>

Before we start, at the end of the previous session we asked the representatives of the Central Bank about the obstacles in the way of the credit unions almost fulfilling the role of a community bank.  They said that they had loaned &euro;90 million and they could loan &euro;900 million with business mortgages and so on.  What is the obstacle?  If the Central Bank tells us that there are no obstacles to the credit unions doing that, will Ms O'Connor outline what the obstacles are?  Deputy Pearse Doherty also raised this question with the Central Bank representatives.  With &euro;7 billion in the bank, as it were, why can the credit unions not let that money find its way into the economy, housing, business, loans and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Farrell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018102300002#KK00300"><p>There are rules and limits within the regulations so there is an amount that we are allowed to lend for longer-term loans.  Mortgages and most of the bigger business loans would be longer, five years plus loans.  We are allowed to do 10% of our loans for in excess of ten years and we are able to do 20% of our loans for in excess of five to ten years.  Post the recession and the financial crisis, credit unions are emerging and coming into that space.  The representative bodies are helping credit unions into the mortgage and home loan space and into the small medium enterprise, SME, space as well but it takes time to develop expertise.  Much of the expertise in credit assessment for mortgages and, more particularly, for business lending retired from the other players who got themselves into bother during the global financial crisis and the recession.  We are all working hard to increase the amount of lending within the SME, home loan and mortgage spaces.</p> <p>  We have put proposals to the various Departments and to the Central Bank about centralised vehicles for both of those areas but they are not finding favour.  We engaged with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland but it has funds from other sources and it is not looking to collaborate with credit unions in the SME space.  The Central Bank changed its rules for investment in centralised vehicles this year.  It took the social housing piece on board but it did not take on board the concept of a central vehicle into which credit unions could invest money for onward lending from a centralised, more risk-managed position than individual credit unions, which by and large do not have the underwriting skills developed to the point where they feel confident enough to do the bigger SME lending on their own backs and putting all of the risk on their own balance sheets.</p><p>A centralised vehicle would be safer and would be a way of sharing risk, but the Central Bank has not endorsed that one.  It is looking more to each individual credit union, which we feel is a slower way.</p></speech>

It also said that out of all of the financial sectors, it devotes the most time to the credit union sector in terms of giving the credit union supports.  At some stage after the meeting, will Mr. Farrell provide the committee with a list of the problems that the Irish League of Credit Unions sees in the context of the credit unions developing their space relative to the answers that were given by the Central Bank, because there seems to be a difference of opinion or emphasis?  Will Mr. Farrell say why the Sparkasse model cannot be rolled out by the credit union movement?  The credit unions have &euro;7 billion so why can they not step up to plate, work with Sparkasse to roll out that model of community banking, get the licence from the Central Bank and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.508" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Molan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018102300002#LL00300"><p>There is considerable headroom and scope for business lending.  At the minute, 0.51% of our assets are in commercial lending.  We were doing commercial lending up until 2011 and 2012, and at that stage a number of restrictions were placed on credit unions.  Many of those have now been lifted but not all of them.  There is still considerable headroom there to do lending but we need to be realistic.  If one is to engage in something such as commercial lending, one has to have the structures in place, the staffing, the risk appetites and the risk management capacity.  These are not built up over night and they cannot be just plugged in and played with.  In the past two years in particular, much advancement has been made in those fields, so it would be inaccurate to say that advancement is not being made.  There are credit unions seriously addressing those areas which are also engaging with the Central Bank in those areas, but there is no simple plug in and play model.</p> <p>  Public banking, or whatever term we put on it, is not something that can just be dreamed up, plugged in and be had working tomorrow morning.  There are 50 to 60 years of experience in the credit unions.  We have got some things wrong but we have got many things right along the way as well.  As my colleagues from the Irish League of Credit Unions, Mr. Farrell and Mr. Johnson, were saying, there are serious efforts going on behind the scenes of co-operation between the co-operatives and the credit unions to fill those gaps.</p><p>Our colleague from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, spoke of dealing with issues such as impaired credit ratings.  These are very much part and parcel of the landscape of reinvigorating Ireland, with which we have to deal with not only on a personal level but on a commercial level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018102300002#MM00200"><p>I would also like to make an observation on that.  When we talk about the credit union movement in Ireland, at times we can perceive it as being one single entity.  The point Mr. Molan was making is that a comparison between it and the public banking model is not a simple direct one.  We have 261 independently owned and independently regulated entities.  As we started to broaden the offerings from the basic consumer loans to products such as home loans, we found that a degree of expertise and systems were needed to support that.  Initially, we found that the limits that were referred to made it very difficult for any one credit union to do it in a sustainable way on its own.  It has encouraged and enhanced much more collaboration.  We certainly have seen that.  There are some different approaches to how that might work but, overall, if it ends up offering a wider range of service and a better proposition for members and the wider community, it is a good thing.</p> <p>  Regarding the regulator, we have a job to do on the credit union side and the regulator has a job to do on its side.  We have to extend the collaboration into that space also and ensure that we are not doing anything to the detriment of each other.  Ironically, we both share the same vision, which is around protecting people's funds and using those savings in a productive manner.  I would not like to think that it is all about confrontation with the regulators.  It is about trying to find a way to work together.</p></speech>

For as long as I have been involved at national level there has been discussion on expanding the role of the credit unions.  We had Ed Sibley from the Central Bank and members of his staff and Mr. Patrick Casey, the regulator of the credit unions, before the committee.  Effectively, they told us that as far as they were concerned, there was no issue in terms of the capacity of the credit union movement to lend to both the SME sector and the home loan sector.  Mr. Molan referred to a point they made, which is that there is a capacity to lend up to 50% of the credit union regulatory reserve, which is just short of &euro;1 billion.  Currently, 90%, or &euro;900 million, of that is being lent.  They believe there is also capacity in terms of lending to the home loan sector.</p> <p>  We are very supportive of public banking and the credit union movement expanding into that role.  We need to get down to the hard facts.  Does the credit union movement have the capacity to increase lending to the SME and home loan sectors?  Are there any regulatory issues that prevent that?  The Central Bank has said that the credit unions have the capacity to lend up to 50% of the credit union regulatory reserve, which Mr. Molan said is equivalent to 5% of the overall assets.  Is there something else involved, and Mr. Farrell touched on it, which makes the regulatory capacity that the Central Bank has indicated unworkable for the credit unions in terms of meeting those targets?  There is no point in reinventing the wheel if the wheel is a small bit rusty and needs a new tyre.</p><p>I want to get down to the issue of the capacity of the credit union movement within the existing rules to lend to the SME and home loan sectors.  How does that marry with what we have been told by Mr. Ed Sibley, deputy governor of the Central Bank, and Mr. Patrick Casey, the regulator of the credit unions?</p></speech>

It does not mean anything.  If one credit union is not in that business, it has 100% capacity and another credit union that is in that business and doing the job very well and being prudent could well be tipping the ceiling.  To blur them together and say there is 50% capacity is meaningless.  The point I was making is that they are individual entities.</p></speech>

We need to know if the credit unions have the capacity within the existing regulatory rules to engage in SME lending, or is there some barrier?  The Chairman alluded to this earlier.  He asked the exact question I intended to ask.  It is the only question we need answered.  The regulator implied that the capacity existed but the credit unions were not increasing their lending.  We need to know the real facts.</p></speech>

As in the case of speed limits on roads, there is capacity there.  The rules allow credit unions to loan up to the 50% limit and some are further down in that respect.  Credit unions started 60 years ago and they provided a service very much in the personal space.  It is not an automatic assumption that credit unions will engage in any SME lending.  They have been engaged in some of that lending and they probably did more of that before the crash and then wound it down.</p></speech>

The credit unions are not a mini-version of the ICC or ACC banks that were mentioned.  Ninety percent of credit union lending is personal lending with more of it in recent times being for mortgages within the same macro-prudential rules as apply to the banks.  Mortgage lending to the set of people who are working is safe enough.  The SME sector is a riskier set.  As Mr. Johnson said, some credit unions are further down the road of making that offering.  Some are probably not going down that road at all.</p> <p>  We met representatives of the Sparkasse foundation on a good few occasions when they were over here.  The credit union movement in Ireland has a foundation that dates back to helping African countries and former Russian republics to build credit unions.</p><p>We asked the Sparkasse people if they could they help us with more SME lending and some current account debit cards.  They have not done so as yet.</p></speech>

We might have a bit of a statistical understatement in this regard.  The issue of the classification of business loans only arose after SI 1/2016, which brought a lower entry level of &euro;25,000.  A significant amount of lending to small enterprises is below &euro;25,000.  It is a surprisingly large amount and it was not reflected in the most recent set of statistics from March.</p></speech>

It is a statistical matter.  There are swings and roundabouts because when one goes above the entry point of &euro;25,000, the level of regulation surrounding an application for &euro;28,000, for example, is significant.  I am not saying it is wrong; it is prudent.  There is a much higher bar that is addressed in this respect.  As my colleagues have stated, there are two ways in which this can be enhanced.  The first involves taking the hard road of building skill sets within our individual credit unions-----</p></speech>

We know the financial capacity is there and there are different ways of addressing the issue of expertise regarding capacity.  There was a question about the benefits of a public model.

It is more of a legislative than a regulatory matter, but it is something we must factor into this as well.</p></speech>

The Department has compiled a report on local public banking and what has become known as the Sparkasse model in the context of filling the gap that many have suggested exists.  Do the witnesses support the concept of a Sparkasse model being introduced instead of credit unions filling the gap in respect of lending for SMEs?

We have outlined the gap we perceive in the provision of credit to consumers.  I am not sure the model addresses that.  The report highlights the potential of digitalisation.  Digitalised financial services should be considered in more depth.  There is scope there for at least some of our clients' needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I can reiterate many times what I have already stated here and in other places.  There is a problem and it has come about because of the demise of ACC and ICC.  They worked hand in hand with credit unions and other banking systems.  To be honest, most rural businesses, especially those of farmers, would not exist were it not for ACC.  I remember benefiting hugely because it was the only institution that would lend.</p> <p>  We are not talking about a model that will damage the credit unions.  It should not damage them, the post offices or anyone else.</p><p>What the report states very clearly - the terms of reference in this regard are being worked through at the moment - is that we have got to figure out how to create an alternative banking model.  That may well involve the credit unions.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked some probing questions in terms of identifying the obstacles.  Right now, the position is not very good.  The banks' situation is very clear as far as we are concerned.  Members of Irish Rural Link are still being refused loans.  People are still not getting the access to loans and facilities.  If those in this room can come up with a better model than Sparkasse, Irish Rural Link will be quite happy.  We are not a vested interest and are not going to gain anything out of what might happen.  We are simply saying that if we do not, under the terms of reference set out by the Department of Finance, explore the next step, we will be running away from the problem.</p></speech>

People in this country are being charged outrageous interest rates.  The pillar banks effectively have over 90% - it might be 95% - of the market.  The way it currently works, those in the indigenous economy have their hands and feet tied.  We absolutely need change.  We have advocated two forms of change. One involves the New Zealand example and what has been done there regarding post offices.  We believe that must be brought into post offices here.  The Government is not listening to us and wants to bring in an agency type bank instead.  The latter would do nothing for communities.  We are huge fans of the Sparkasse model for obvious reasons.  It has been in existence for over 200 years and we know it is unbreakable.  Where we differ slightly is that we see that there are two networks in Ireland, namely, the post office network and the credit union network.  We have adequate infrastructure but we still have problems.</p> <p>  The Government has promised a stakeholders' forum.  Much of what is being discussed here should probably go to that forum.  We could iron out the differences, clarify the position and then come back to the committee.  One thing that has to be done if we are ever to have a thriving indigenous economy is to break the banking oligopoly.  The Public Banking Forum of Ireland acts in the public interest and represents farmers, small businesses and citizens.  We want to see credit available at competitive prices and believe this can be done through the existing networks.</p></speech>

It is an alternative that we have been building fairly steadily, cautiously and prudently.  We do not believe there is a need to introduce another banking system.  We have memories going back eight and ten years when competitor banks were brought in.  When it was no longer profitable or insufficiently profitable, they withdrew.  We are from and of communities and we have always made our mark in terms of the needs of our members and communities.  That is what we will continue to do and we will go forward on that basis.</p></speech>

I just wanted to get a handle on where the organisations stand.  My party and I are long-time supporters of public banking.  With the pillar banks not meeting the needs of certain sections of society, it would be a terrible crime if we missed the opportunity to deal with the issue of public banking, whether that means the credit unions being able to tap into SME lending in a bigger way.  I fear that time will pass and the matter will get kicked into this forum.  There will be some discussion and we will then hear that there is a bit more lending from the pillar banks, that there might be even more the following year and that the problem has been resolved.  At that point, we will be back to the monopoly scenario.</p><p> I am not convinced that the credit unions are going to move into this area any time soon.  I would not suggest that the credit union movement should jump in.  The last thing we want to be doing is fast-forwarding five years and asking the credit unions how they got it so wrong, why their underwriting was not done and why they did not have the skills to deal with this.  That is the challenge.  When there are so many different independent credit unions, how do we bring them all together and release them from some of the shackles on them?  A consultation paper is going to be published.  However, I am concerned that we equip credit unions with the necessary infrastructure and capabilities in order that it might meet some of the needs a Sparkasse model would meet.  If the credit unions are going to move into that area, what needs to happen and how can we move matters forward?</p></speech>

It is five years, almost to the day, since the commencement of the 2012 Act.  It was actually commenced in October 2013.  That was the most significant and revolutionary change in Irish credit unions since the Credit Union Act 1966, which was introduced by the late Jack Lynch.  In those five short years, the capacity for change in the credit union movement has been absolutely staggering.  We had complete change in our governance structures and the introduction of some of the things Mr. Johnson and Mr. Farrell mentioned.  For example, one of the ways in which we could address commercial lending would be on an A1 product basis.  We have seen that in the agriculture sector whereby four credit unions began offering what are termed "Cultivate" farm loans.  A significant number of credit unions, probably 50, are now offering such loans.  Under this model, a product was created and an approach was adopted in respect of underwriting, etc.  If this can be done for agricultural lending - the small businesses in this area are much complex in nature - then it can certainly be done on a commercial level.</p> <p>  Certain credit unions have also moved into the area of offering current accounts.  There are, essentially, two current account offerings.  Some credit unions have begun offering plastic cards to customers.  For the past five years, as well as getting restrictions lifted and engaging in a really vigorous and challenging regulatory regime, we have managed to do those particular things quietly and under the radar.  I am much more optimistic about the capacity of my colleagues and the capacity of the directors, who come from the members' communities and all of the other communities around here, to actually change and deliver.  I assure the Deputy that we will not be found wanting in those areas.</p></speech>

Mr. Molan outlined clearly how that has happened and how credit unions have had to respond to the Credit Union and Co-Operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, as well as some of the advancements that have taken place.  I am concerned about some of the shackles, as I have referred to them, or the restraints on the movement and whether they will be lifted to allow for the credit union movement to meet its full potential and to act as that movement which fills the space that people are talking about Sparkassen filling.</p> <p>  Some of the change is happening quickly but then some of it is also very slow.  I am a huge advocate of the credit union movement but nowadays people are using their iPhones to pay for goods.  Mr. Molan mentioned plastic cards, which are not available across the board.  There are restraints.</p><p>It is going to take another year to lift the shackles off the credit union movement and allow to move forward some of those that have met their threshold in respect of lending to small and medium enterprises or very close to it.  There has not been a very good response from the Central Bank on some of these issues.  Mr. Molan can respond to that if he wishes.</p><p> I also want to ask about the debate that has been taking place on the credit union movement in respect of using its members' assets to invest in social housing.  The Minister had suggested that CUDA, of which Mr. Johnson is chief executive officer, was now in a position to invest in a special purpose vehicle set up by one of the approved housing bodies, AHBs.</p><p> It was also suggested that the Irish League of Credit Unions, of which Mr. Farrell is the chief executive, would be in a position to do so by the end of October.  Has that been resolved?  Is the credit union movement now in a position to invest substantially in social housing?  Is the vehicle that was designed by the approved housing bodies the way the credit union movement believes its contribution should take place in addressing the social housing needs or would it prefer a different bespoke instrument to be set up?</p></speech>

There were many questions there, so I will just touch on them and try to break them down.  If we take the first point, there are some vehicles there, albeit they may reside outside of this jurisdiction.  They would, however, qualify, so there is potential there.  CUDA has been working on this for six years.  It is pathetic, to be quite honest.  Our concern was that we never wanted to do this by way of investment.  I will make that clear again today.  It is still not our preferred way.  Our preferred way would be to amend the legislation to allow credit unions to lend for housing.</p> <p>  I referred to it in the document as an emergency because that is what we believe it is.  We have a social housing problem but we also have a real affordable housing crisis.  We see members of our credit unions, people who are doing essential work, who cannot afford to rent or buy a house.  It is a bigger societal issue.  It is not a society we would like to see existing now or in the future.  For that reason, our belief is that we can prudently lend to support part of the solution.  As I said, we do not necessarily believe it should be restricted to tier 3 AHBs.  There are other co-operative housing initiatives that have proven very productive and fruitful over the years that we would like to be able to help.</p> <p>  That being said, much good work was done and regulations were brought in to allow the credit unions to invest in an approved vehicle that then lent to tier three 3 AHBs.  There are a variety of solutions.  It is not necessarily the AHBs themselves establishing a special purpose vehicle.  There are other potential solutions.  We have done quite a bit of work on this ourselves.  This, however, is where the real problem comes in.  There is little point in establishing and commencing such a vehicle if the projects are not there.  For all the good potential reasons that exist, these things, unfortunately, are costly to establish and to run.  There is little point in commencing something like that if we do not have the projects to be funded from it.  That is where the real problem lies.  I know all of the discussion is around setting up Irish collective asset management vehicles and special purpose vehicles.  The real issue, however, is getting projects to take those funds.  That is the real concern.</p></speech>

There was reference to the league in October.  We have been engaging with various arms, including the Department, the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, and the AHBs to see where is this fund.  We were engaging with the Central Bank originally but it has changed the investment rules, as Mr. Johnson said, since earlier in the year and not the lending rules.  Rebuilding Ireland clearly laid out that money was going to be made available and support would be provided to an Irish Council for Social Housing special purpose vehicle.  We have been trying to ensure that vehicle is created and assuming that it was going to be created.  This goes back to July 2016.</p> <p>  It was stated then that it would be compliant for credit unions.  It was stated it would be made certain that the rules in place for the credit unions since earlier this year would be taken on board and it would be a Central Bank regulated vehicle.  It has to be that way to provide an extra layer of safety for the credit union money going in, which is different from private money going in to it.  It has been very difficult to get clean facts on where it is.  It looks now like the special purpose vehicle fund is being created but it will not be ready in October or this side of the new year.  It looks like it will not be Central Bank approved or authorised at that stage.</p> <p>  The question is whether the credit union movement will have to build a bridge or a buffer of a regulated vehicle to take the money and then invest it into the approved housing body vehicle.  The comments about the projects are relevant as well.  Land for these approved housing bodies seems to scarcer because there is an upturn.  It depends on the different parts of the country but it is particularly the case in the tier 3 approved housing bodies.  They are more in the populated areas with a heavy density and the land values are increasing in those areas.  We said we were happy enough with October, but this is near the end of October and I am pretty sure it is not going to be October or even this year.</p></speech>

That is our understanding.  There is a special purpose vehicle, CUDA is approved to invest in it and the league is likely to be in a position to do that in October.  I presume it is the same special purpose vehicle that we have been talking about and to which reference was made in the Minister's comments to the Irish Council for Social Housing and the process that it was involved in.  Has a special purpose vehicle been set up?  I am slightly confused.</p></speech>

I want to be clear.  We have, however, over the past two years done considerable work in understanding what is required and how it could be set up.  To be completely transparent about this, we have done everything other than seek final approval from the regulator for that.  All that work is there and can be done.  As I said earlier, however, what is the point in hitting the go button and incurring the cost if there are no projects?  That is the real dilemma.</p> <p>  One of the things that should be said is that when the regulations - and a lot of work by many people went into developing those - were commenced by the Central Bank, only a month later the classification of the tier 3 approved housing bodies changed.  In fairness, that is a game changer as well.</p> <p>  There is another issue.  Wherever the funds are sourced, be it the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, credit unions or other private sources, it all counts as being on balance sheet.  The approved housing bodies are now going to find themselves restricted by how much they can borrow because of that and we know the knock-on effects of that.</p></speech>

The Public Banking Forum of Ireland's position is that we need to establish ten public banks around the country and that was our position in the submission we made to the consultation.

We said eight whereas he said ten, so let us argue the point.  The question is spot on.  The reality, as outlined by my colleagues in the credit union, is that the slowness of the Government and the Department of Finance is trying to protect the existing banking system.  That is why the slowness is there in allowing some flexibility and regulation to favour the individual, the potential homeowner, or the community.  While we have a banking system at the moment with one kind of bank and another in a kind of zombie place, we are going to have this type of slow deliberation on allowing either the credit union movement to be regulated so it can lend more or a public banking system.  We believe public banking is the way forward.  Where there is no public banking system, then the existing banking pillars continue as they are.  That slows down the Government, slows us down, slows people down who are not in housing, and slows down the country.  That is what is happening.</p></speech>

That is why I talk about the frustration about the length of time being taken.  That was out of the hands of the credit union movement.  Mr. Johnson mentioned that he thought the best solution was for the credit union movement to become a lender as opposed to an investor.  Will he explain to the committee who exactly he was talking about when he mentioned lending as opposed to investing?  I ask him to clarify whether he was just speaking about people who want to purchase homes.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connor spoke of a sandbox-type of regulatory system which would help to serve the atypical customer.  Will she let us know a little about that and has there been engagement with the Central Bank on that proposal?</p> <p>  On the public banking model and what the report suggests, I agree everyone needs to get around the table, and the sooner that forum is convened, the better.  I hope it is done with genuine motivation.  The Sparkasse proposal was always pitched to support small and medium enterprises.  The Government's report suggests perhaps a narrower focus and finding a niche or a gap in the market would be more appropriate.  Has that been considered or would it be something that is perhaps appropriate for the forum to consider?  I would like the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

A sandbox is like a safe regulatory space for small start-ups in order that they do not have to invest in the regulatory overhead at the outset.  Many countries do this and many different ideas have emerged.  I think there is potential in this space because the research indicates that in respect of lending, some FinTechs are bringing atypical consumers into a kind of prime or near-prime market because they have other detail over and above the credit rating in terms of informing their lending decisions and so on.</p> <p>  The other issue is payments.  In our view, there is huge potential for our clients under PSD2.  Do not ask me about the technical detail, but the research indicates that if payments can be sped up, cashflow is eased.  There is a lot of potential in the area of SME lending as well.  What I would regret is if we did not put time and investment right now into looking at the social potential of FinTech for our clients and indeed for the underserved populations this report concerns.  We would then have a missed opportunity.</p></speech>

Rural and regional economies have suffered severely in this recession which, insofar as SMEs are concerned, they are still not out of.  What we are saying very clearly is that the terms of reference must be published very shortly and this forum must meet urgently.  We would have preferred if it got on to the business of looking at the logistics of a public bank rather than talking around it.  Deputy Doherty made a good point earlier.  Are we going to try to kick the matter further to touch and somehow hope it goes away?  Irish Rural Link will not be going away from this subject any time soon.  We want it dealt with urgently.  Otherwise, we are a prisoner of the current banking system.</p></speech>

Many of my questions have been addressed, so I will be very brief.  I am very interested to hear Mr. Boland's and Mr. Maye's commentary.  If I understand their statements correctly, they are saying the Sparkasse model would fill a gap in respect of lending.  Could I get an understanding as to whether there is a geographical bias in this regard, so to speak?  Are we talking about the midlands, the north west, the south west or the south east?  If I understand Mr. Boland correctly, if there were a better lending model, there would be no need for another banking system.  Do I understand him correctly, first, on the geographical considerations?</p></speech>

The midlands are very much affected by the recession.  The Western Development Commission has shown that the level of lending has reduced considerably in recent years in the midlands.  The region is suffering, but the reality is that the south west and the north west have suffered enormously as well.  That is the answer to the geographical question.  I do not know if it answers the question.</p></speech>

We are talking about a public banking system.  The clue is in the word "banking".  It is exactly what it is: a banking system.  It should be remembered that Sparkasse is not insisting, and never did, that we adopt the German model absolutely because that is not possible.  What we need to do is adopt the Irish model of public banking.  We are very clear that it is a banking system.</p><p>We proposed eight regions.  We talked about synergies with the credit unions, An Post and whoever else.  I think everyone would step up to the plate from then on, but it is a banking system.</p></speech>

If I read them correctly, they are stating they are open for business and ready to adopt new mechanisms to enhance their offerings and try to move into the very space referred to where there is a gap.  The proof of this is, for instance, in CUMA and Mr. Molan's intervention on the 2016 regulations, in which he stated that in March commercial loans accounted for 1.9% of the &euro;4.5 billion credit unions had out on loan, equivalent to 0.51% of their assets.  Do the delegates take some comfort from these proceedings that there is scope, subject to a move by the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and, one hopes, these Houses, for the credit union movement to step in and plug that gap?</p></speech>

That is the question.  I am not necessarily saying they should not or will not; I am simply saying these are questions for the forum to look at.  Again, let us go back to the reality.  We also want to keep every single credit union open, but not every single credit union, especially the smaller ones which serve an enormously valuable purpose in being small, will be able to loan huge amounts of money.  That makes sense.  I think my colleague said one would have to look at this and I would be quite glad to see them looking at it.  However, it should be remembered that there are, to quote Mr. Johnson, 261 units throughout the country.  How does one manage the legislation in order that all of them can work with cohesion?  The worst thing that could happen, if the credit union was suddenly to become a banking institution, is that there could be pressure on it to start closing branches.  That would be a real danger, unless we work this out properly.  Let me be clear: Irish Rural Link is not a vested interest.  Whether the Sparkasse model is picked-----</p></speech>

There was much discussion at this committee about that process.  If I read the tone of the delegates' interventions today correctly, one senses that there has been some improvement in that relationship, or else they are couching their language in very careful terms.  I do not know, but I would like to hear from the representative organisations about their perception of the relationship with the Central Bank in respect of regulation and the future of credit unions.  Short interventions or answers will suffice.  I will start with Mr. Johnson.</p></speech>

We must be very clear that the public banking forum's proposal was for an all-encompassing full banking service model that would, on the one hand, compete with the commercial pillar banks and, on the other, provide a long-term sustainable platform for the survival and growth of credit unions, post offices and the indigenous economy.  We expect the report to refer to niche markets because the Department is all about protecting the banking oligopoly.</p> <p>  We are very similar in what we are proposing, that is, eight or ten banks throughout the country.  Each and every part of the country must be serviced and needs a public banking service; therefore, it is a nationwide matter, although I think a pilot scheme, perhaps in the midlands to start with, was mentioned.</p><p> The representative bodies are going to speak about regulation.  It is clear that the rules and regulations that have been applied to credit unions during the years are in breach of competition law because they discriminate against credit unions in favour of banks.  They apply dissimilar conditions to similar transactions but dress them up as something else.  I see that the Central Bank seems to be modifying its stance in that regard but it ought to be.  It has a lot more to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018102300002#XX00300"><p>It is very challenging.  There should be a healthy tension in the relationship between the regulator and the regulated.  The key is that it is healthy.  The Central Bank stated the credit union sector was the one with the highest level of engagement.  If that is an offer to us to choose our level of engagement, we will take it.  We would opt to reduce our level of engagement if we had the choice.  We are, however, respectful of the role the Central Bank has to play.  It is critical, but we need it to be more constructive.  It has certainly improved, but we need to see it continue to improve.  There is a responsibility on credit unions and their representative bodies to put ideas and proposals to the regulators in this area.  We have become better at taking advantage of what the rules permit today, not necessarily having looked at them in the past.  This equips us to better present our case to the Central Bank, with home loans being a perfect example.  We have demonstrated that credit unions can provide them prudently and serve segments of the market that are not being served.</p> <p>  The three bodies represented had a considerable input into the CUAC review, which led to a very thorough report highlighting a lot of the things that had not been delivered.  An implementation group, in which we, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance participate, was set up and we are working through the issues.  I share Deputy Doherty's concerns about timing and the pace at which things move.  We made a thorough and detailed submission on longer term lending in November last year and hope the consultation paper will come out in the next few days.  As the Deputy said, there will be another extended period before we see regulations.</p></speech>

It will be the middle of next year before there will be changes.  As Mr. Johnson said, the engagement is better, but we must not underestimate the number of regulations there are for the credit unions.  There has been no easing of regulation.  A very heavy regulatory regime is still in place for directors and staff of credit unions.  The consultation paper, about which we talked, is coming out tomorrow and a lot of work was done to get it through.  On the other side, strategic business model development is being undertaken.  The Central Bank has recently put together a group which comprises credit union CEOs only.  There are no representative bodies or volunteer directors represented on it.  The Irish League of Credit Unions believes the law charges directors with responsibility for strategy, while the CEO and staff implement it.  Therefore, we do not see eye to eye with the bank on that issue, notwithstanding the fact that the relationship is improving each year.</p></speech>

An important point was made about the ability of smaller credit unions to be responsive in business and other lending.  The vehicles about which my colleagues spoke are very important.  Scrutiny by public representatives in a public forum such as this is very valuable as it informs the pace at which things are done, as well as the nature of what is being done.  It is important that smaller credit unions and their communities not be excluded by virtue of the collectivity of assets.</p></speech>

He mentioned regulatory capture, but there is also political capture.  Are we captured by the Central Bank that tells us what we can and cannot do based on a fear of spooking the market?  We heard this during the course of the banking inquiry.  Is it preventing us from catering for the market on behalf of the people?</p> <p>  It is great that the delegates are trying to drive this process.  Is the Government and the State engaging superficially on the issue?  We have had the report and will now have engagement, while there is the promise of another forum.  If we were to succeed in providing public banking services based on the Sparkasse or the Kiwi PostBank model, as promised in the programme for Government, would it not require the State to drive it?  I find that Departments and the Central Bank use divide and conquer tactics as a mechanism not to move things forward.  If CUDA had one view, the credit unions another and Irish Rural Link yet another, even if there was little separating them, the Department and the Central Bank could state they did not know what they wanted and could not, therefore, move things forward.  Might it be the case that the delegates are the wrong drivers and that we need the Minister to come here to say he will introduce a model?</p> <p>  In the context of the discussion on the indigenous economy, Sparkassen are only allowed to lend in certain areas and support certain things.  They do not lend money to people to buy speedboats but to support the economy and employment in rural areas.  As I know the views of credit unions and Irish Rural Link, I ask my questions of Mr. Maye.</p></speech>

The answer is, "of course."  We would not have had the banking crash or an orgy of credit ten years ago if the body politic had not been captured, as well as the regulatory body.  This cannot go ahead without political input.  Politicians must separate themselves from the Department and the Central Bank.</p><p>I take the opportunity to give one example of the indigenous economy.  It relates to the agri-sector, in particular the beef sector.  We produced a report recently, in which there is a section on the fifth quarter.  I do not know if anybody knows about the fifth quarter, but it is the waste product from cattle - the intestines, bones, ears and head.</p></speech>

I did not expect to find myself in this position.  As I did not even know if I would get here, I did not bring all of my information with me.</p> <p>  I am a big supporter of the credit unions, Irish Rural Link and the Sparkasse model.  When I was in Germany yesterday, I spent the full day hearing about it, with some people who are in the committee room.  So enthusiastic were they that we nearly missed the flight back.</p> <p>  The public bank issue is the one Mr. Maye has been addressing.  I know that Mr. Boland is also interested in it.  There is an opportunity for more cross-fertilisation between the credit unions, An Post and this model.  All bets are on the table.  </p> <p>  I have a short amount of time because I do not want to miss the vote.  The comment was made that the credit unions would like to see the legislation amended in order that they could lend.  That would take time to do.  Reference was made to the special purpose vehicle.  Is that something that would allow them to move forward more quickly, just at that particular end of things?  I could not agree more with what was said about lending larger amounts, but will credit unions not be limited to lending to their members?  The Sparkasse model is public banking and Sparkassen only lend within their region.  As a consequence, they are significant contributors in their region.  One of them paid more than &euro;500 million in tax to the local authority in a short period.  Nobody owns the Sparkassen; they are owned by the public, which is the reason they are called public banks.  Senior bank officials, local politicians - something which might make people in this country nervous - and customers are all represented on the board.  They have a supervisory board.  They are very keen to help us to set up the model here.</p> <p>  I do not believe we need another long report, forum or whatever else.  We need action and I will call on the Minister to take it.  Let us have a forum and tight terms of reference that will allow us to do the work that needs to be done.  Let us receive a time limited report and get this on the road as there is a huge gap in the market.  The geographical location limit is to protect the local area in order that the money will stay there and benefit the area.  It is not the case that one area takes precedence over another.  We need to see movement now in dealing with the obstacles.  I know that the delegates have been exploring the various co-operation options with each other, but we must take off the local jersey and try to make this happen for rural areas.  Let us get back to the old ways of banking, which is what the Sparkasse model is.  It has been around for 200 years.  It is about walking the land, going into shops and businesses and understanding people and their community because they are part of it.  It is about lending while being able to make the risk assessment on more than just what is written on paper because there is background knowledge of where a business, family or person sits in the community, which is hugely important.</p> <p>  I encourage the delegates to continue to fight the fight.  I will make as much noise as I can about it.  We are aware of all of the problems outlined in terms of capture and protecting our own banks which we need, but they do a different job.  That is clear from what happens in Germany where we heard a presentation by a man who had a great business.  He went to Deutsche Bank - I do not mind mentioning it - with his idea and it funded him to a point and then stated he could have no more.  He went to a Sparkasse and it took him on.  He now has a turnover of &euro;10 million which is growing.  As the business is in the area of the Sparkasse, the &euro;10 million is being generated in the community and tax is being collected by the local authority.  The Government should not worry too much about the risk because it would get the money back in tax, jobs and a better society.  Never mind the money - community cohesion is more important than money.  </p> <p>  I wish the delegates well.  I will certainly raise the issue with the Minister to expedite matters as quickly as possible.  I am sorry, but I must leave.</p></speech>

It is worth taking about the beef sector in the context of that economy.  The fifth quarter is the waste product for which farmers are not getting paid.  They do not get a cent.  It consists of the heart, liver, kidneys, tongue, stomach, skirt, tripe, intestine, embryonic fluids and so on.  The fifth quarter is the most valuable part of the animal but there is no money to back farmers to set up co-operatives to process the fifth quarter.  For example, the fifth quarter is now used in the making of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household and industrial goods, ointments, binders for plaster and asphalt, footballs, lubricants, soaps, lipstick, face and hand creams and ingredients for explosives.  In addition, fatty acids are used in the production of chemicals, biodegradable detergents, pesticides and flotation agents.  Bones, horns and hooves are used to make buttons, bone china, piano keys, glues and fertiliser, and also gelatine for photographic film paper, wallpaper, sandpaper, combs, toothbrushes and violin string.  More than 100 individual drugs, including insulin, are derived from cattle.  That is the answer for our agricultural sector.  If, however, one approaches AIB or Bank of Ireland and states that one is going to do some of the things I have just outlined, one would be laughed at.  That is just to put it in perspective.  That is why we need public banking and community banking.  That is why the German economy is the fourth largest in the world.  We need to stop talking and get moving.</p></speech>

As Senator Reilly said, it is not going to affect the banks.  At a national economic dialogue conference a couple of years ago, an employer stated that the banks find it much easier not to process what they call small accounts because it is too expensive to do so.  Those accounts might involve &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million.  The banks prefer massive accounts.  In regional economies, one always has smaller businesses which are significant and create enough employment but which require greater attention from the lender than they receive.  That is the reason we have a proposal on community banking.</p></speech>

Most of the questions I wanted to asked have already been asked and answered.  There is no point in delaying the witnesses any longer.  I know Mr. Boland and Mr. Maye well and I also know Mr. Farrell and some of our other guests pretty well.  Over the years, I have given total support to what they are trying to do.  It appears that we could get agreement among the witnesses on a rural bank but they are like the fox who has been caught in his den - if he puts his head out, he will be shot.  That is the way I read it.  I have been listening to the debate all afternoon.  Despite their will, plans and best efforts, it appears that someone is waiting outside the den to take them out if they emerge.</p> <p>  In reply to a parliamentary question last month, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government , Deputy English, indicated, "One of the credit union movements is ready; it is through all of the process and has money available.  I cannot be any clearer than that."  To me, that is worth nothing any more.  I am of the view that there is a lot of blocking going on.  I will put some direct questions and any of our guests can answer them.  In terms of getting this up and running, are we as far from our destination as we are from Timbuktu?  Rural banking, as it was provided by the pillar banks, is gone.  There is no counter service in the branch Strokestown, County Roscommon, where I live.  That is a joke.  The position is the same in towns in many counties.  We will not have any banking service soon.  We are lucky to have the credit unions.</p><p>We need this public bank.  As a previous speaker indicated, the banks do not want small accounts and they do not want people calling to branches.  The tell people they will call out to the community and that, as a result, there is no need for customers to visit branches.  My worry is that we are a long way from achieving this, however.  I hope I am wrong but I ask that someone comment.</p></speech>

When we did so, we found that in certain regions, particularly near Stuttgart, the impact and influence of Sparkassen, the name of local public banks, is huge.  In effect, the local Sparkasse governs the economic development of an area.  The Sparkasse model helps created thousands of jobs, both in terms of the people who work for the bank as well as indirectly.  That is what we are talking about.  It should be remembered that during the recession, the Sparkasse model was the banking service or structure which did not fail.  Had it not been in place, Germany would have very different problems now.  This is the model that is in place and we should develop our own Irish version.  The people in the room have the skills and capabilities to do so.  That is what we are asking for.  I go back to the question on who is stopping it.  While Irish Rural Link has met with a great deal of support across the political system, there is a hard core - perhaps in the Department of Finance and among the members of the banking fraternity - which sees this as a threat and does not want to move it forward.  We need bravery and leadership at this stage.</p></speech>

He asked a straight question and I will give him a straight answer, which is "Probably not".  I read out what the Minister for Rural and Community Affairs, Deputy Ring, had to say about the desperate state of banking and how badly everyone needs public banking.  While it is just an example and it may be unfair, when the Minister crosses the M50 and enters the Pale, the Government's stance is that there is no compelling case for public banking.  Which is it and why is this the Government's stance?  Everyone knows there is a compelling case for public banking.  As such, the problem is at Government level.  It is a political problem, a problem in the Department of Finance, a Central Bank problem and an ECB problem.  These are the entities which are preventing this from going ahead.</p></speech>

The fact that Ministers were not available to attend today in order to discuss this matter is a further indication that the political system does not have the backbone to do what is necessary.  Now that we are discussing the confidence and supply agreement, one never knows what might happen.  Fianna F&aacute;il might find itself again and ensure that public banking is put back on the agenda.</p></speech>

We know what is needed.  We know what medicine is required in rural parts of Ireland.  We have seen the new land agency and Mr. Farrell and Mr. Johnson are here from the credit unions.  My understanding is that credit unions are not allowed to lend money in the new land agency context.  That shows the unwillingness to even think about credit unions.  The first thing one has to do is think about someone.  If I want money to buy something, the first thing I do is contact the credit union.  However, credit unions have not even been thought about in the context of the new land agency.  The attitude is that we will just go for the commercial option.  Credit unions are being stymied.  The big problem for them is that they have a great deal of money.  If they have money that is not attracting a return in terms of interest, they are in trouble.  Any business which does not make money will not survive.  Mr. Maye has travelled the country, north, south, east and west.  I have fought with and against Mr. Boland down through the years.  The Chairman and I are always talking about people being whipped out of their houses and about the housing crisis.  We are blue in the face from talking about it.  The bottom line is that we can publish all the reports in the world, but the people who matter do not want to make the decisions.</p><p>They would rather ensure that vulture funds, rather than someone in Ireland, are catered for.  They would rather ensure that we borrow money in order to ensure that someone in Europe is made up than to help some community get a few per cent in interest under a community banking model.  I get so fed up when I talk about this for a simple reason.  Decisions are made by the Central Bank.  As we know from a year ago, to get a small movement in the Central Bank is like trying to put a jigsaw together over months.  One ends on one's backside and one has to get up and go forward again.</p><p> Those of us from rural Ireland know that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank do not want to be there.  They have let people go.  They left most small towns once the State came to their rescue and bailed them out.  They do not give two damns about small villages.  If we had a public banking model along with the credit union sector, they would open branches in places where there is a pub and a shop and facilitate people.  One could put in a loan application on a Monday and get a phone call by Wednesday night to say whether it had been approved.  To be fair, most people are helped.  It is about whether the decision to facilitate what is envisaged is made by the Central Bank and, perhaps, the ECB.  The Chairman would know more about that than I.  Ultimately, there needs to be a willingness in government.  A Government cannot say something has to be done, but it can create the environment and push the buttons behind the scenes to make it happen.  It is a sad thing to say to the witnesses.  They have travelled the roads and will continue to do so because they are believers.  That is rightly so.  However, it depends on whether the will is there.  People will probably look at the polls and vote for the same Tweedledum and Tweedledee who are still screwing rural Ireland by not giving us the facility to use our own money to build infrastructure, etc., in our areas and help those who would invest in public banks or the credit unions to get a return. However, the will does not seem to be there.  Everyone will tell the witnesses that they are great fellows.  Their heads would nearly swell up with everyone telling them they are good.  The bottom line, however, is whether there is action.  Unless we get action, we are going nowhere.</p></speech>

For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland raised &euro;1.25 billion which came from KfW in Germany, the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  When one particular submission said &euro;170 million was required, however, the Department said it was ridiculous and that it could not come up with that much.  Some of the other submissions did not look for money at all.  Our submission, which was a substantial one, mentioned KfW, the EIB and so on.  As far as we are concerned, the consultation group had made its decision before it started its work.  We have to get real about this.</p></speech>

This type of discussion is useful because it helps us to understand some of the needs which, perhaps, are not being met.  In my opening remarks, I outlined our vision for credit unions.  To condense and summarise that, it is really for the local credit union to be the financial hub of a community.  That is really what we are trying to do.  It was interesting to listen to Senator Reilly talk about his visit to Germany.  He might well have been talking about a visit to any credit union.</p><p>He could easily have been talking about a tiny credit union.  Everything he talked about in terms of knowing individual customers and communities already exists.  The concern we have is that there is talk of establishing a new entity, which requires capital investment, licences and infrastructure but it is not actually needed.  We have all of the foundations of community banking in the credit union system.  That said, while the financial term is "banking", credit unions do not want to be banks.  We are credit unions and the one thing we want to ensure is that the regulations and legislation continue to protect our uniqueness.  The erosion of that uniqueness is something about which we are concerned.  We also want a level playing field.  There are other entities out there providing consumer loans through the likes of personal contract plans or store credit, for example.  These may appear very convenient to consumers but they are not regulated and do not provide the same level of consumer protection that is provided by credit unions.</p></speech>

We certainly had some fun travelling around the country together dealing with another matter.  On this matter, let us be clear.  Irish Rural Link is asking that this is solved because if we walk away from it and decide to leave the pillar banks the way they are and protect them at all costs then job creation in rural Ireland will not happen and the financial health of rural Ireland will not improve.  There are problems to be solved and regulations to be drawn up.  We proposed a public banking system.  We could have sat outside the gates of Leinster House and done what lots of other groups do, namely, make loads of noise but offer no new proposals.  We put forward a very detailed proposal.  It could be argued that we risked getting our heads cut off and, in a sense, the Department tried to cut bits off the proposal.  However, it is still on the table.  When it has been proven to be useless and a better idea is on the table, we will be quite happy.  Right now, however, Ireland needs a local public banking system.</p></speech>

Capital is important and we are significantly more capitalised than any banks in this country.  My colleague spoke about the model that did not fail.  I remember a statement being made in the Houses of the Oireachtas to the effect that there was a &euro;1 billion hole in the balance sheets of credit unions.  We never found it because it was not there.  Capital is important, as are the reserves.  We have over 18% in realised reserves.</p> <p>  One of the issues that was not addressed today, although I mentioned it earlier, is micro-lending.  That is very important in terms of the regeneration of our communities and is certainly an area in which we are involved.  It is not being picked up in the statistics because it is below commercial levels.  I also want to stress the importance of a level playing field.  We are the original peer-to-peer lenders but there are others in that space now that are not subject to the same level of regulatory scrutiny as the credit union sector, to the detriment of consumers.</p></speech>

If our guests have suggestions or want to come back again - or if there is any way we can support them through the work we do - we will facilitate them.  I speak on behalf of members and, as Chairman, I make that commitment.  The Government needs to take heed of the conversation we have had and of the efforts the representatives are making.  In terms of the confidence and supply arrangement, I will press for forward movement in respect of the matter we have been discussing.  I know it was contemplated in the previous confidence and supply document.  We have work to do and, in that context, I urge the witnesses not to give up.

The Department has been invited by the joint committee to answer questions on transport policy in rural and regional areas and assist it in its consideration of the matter.  I am joined by some of my colleagues in the Department working across the area of land transport.  Mr. Kevin Doyle and Mr. Garrett Doocey deal with matters related to public transport policy, while Mr. Dominic Mullaney deals with matters related to roads policy.</p> <p>  The committee has had several discussions on rural and regional transport policy and will be aware that there are many actors in the transport arena in Ireland.  In addition, there have been several changes in the way public transport is organised and governed in the past decade.  Against this backdrop, it might be useful for the committee if I were to start by outlining briefly how some of the State institutions in the public transport area are organised, including the Department, and provide a summary of their respective roles. </p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Minister and the Department have responsibility for three overarching themes - policy and statutory frameworks, aggregate funding and corporate governance in State transport bodies, in which the Minister is a shareholder.  In fulfilling these responsibilities we work on a number of fronts.  We develop transport policy and also provide a transport perspective and input when other relevant Government policies are being devised.  We develop the statutory and legislative frameworks to govern the transport sector.  They are often seen as they are brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas to be promulgated into law or as policy statements.</p> <p>  Through our Vote, we channel aggregate Exchequer funding for the transport sector.  The Department's total voted allocation in 2018 is around &euro;2 billion.  Of this, &euro;1.6 billion relates to land transport.  Committee members might be interested to know that a piece of analysis conducted a few years ago under the auspices of the Department indicated that more than three quarters of the spend on land transport at the time was occurring outside the greater Dublin area. </p> <p>  In the public transport area, that is, bus and rail services, funding from the Department flows mainly to the National Transport Authority.  The funding is for investment in infrastructure and public transport service support.  </p> <p>  With regard to the investment in roads that the Department supports, funding flows from it to Transport Infrastructure Ireland - one of our State bodies - and the relevant local authorities.</p><p>Members will be aware that during the years of the fiscal and economic crisis which followed the banking crisis of 2008, many areas of Government expenditure were reduced in order for the State to regain fiscal stability.  In the area of transport, this curtailment affected both current and capital budgets that were available to support services and invest in infrastructure.  It impacted on roads and public transport.  At the time, the Department undertook an analysis to advise Government and the Minister on how best we could prioritise transport capital investment in these circumstances.  The approach adopted was published in 2015 in the strategic framework for investment in land transport SFILT, report.  Ultimately, the report came up with one very clear conclusion, namely, that the key priority had to be very much to direct the funding we have into maintaining the existing and very extensive road and rail networks we have throughout the country in order that they remain operational and safe.  There were some lower-order priorities, but this was identified as the number one priority.</p><p> Since then, it has been a priority to return to the levels of maintenance and safety investment required to keep the networks at what we call a steady state of service and reliability.  Annual budget allocations have happily been increasing in more recent years and are scheduled and profiled to rise further over the coming periods.  This is enabling us to regain and achieve what we call the steady-state investment level.  Together with this, we are enabled to undertake a number of targeted new projects under the national development plan and in line with the strategic objectives that have been agreed by Government in the national planning framework.  The Department also oversees the corporate sector in the State bodies involved with transport and exercise a shareholder role on behalf of the Minister in respect of the State-owned service provider, C&oacute;ras lompair &Eacute;ireann, CI&Eacute;, and its subsidiaries.</p><p> Another significant actor in the sector, which the committee has already met in recent months, is the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The latter is a relatively new body on the transport scene.  It was established approximately ten years ago under legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  It acts as an independent body with regulatory, funding and strategy development roles and now has a considerable role in the public transport sector.  Among its statutory functions, as the committee will be aware, the NTA is responsible for: regulating and contracting all PSO bus and rail services; allocating PSO funding to the operators in accordance with their contracts; licensing and regulating commercial bus services, that is, services that can be run on a profitable basis and that do not require public subvention support; regulating taxi services throughout the country; developing integrated ticketing; and some strategic transport planning.</p><p> Transport Infrastructure Ireland is another body under the aegis of the Department.  Its main function is around infrastructure and providing an integrated approach to the future development and operation of the national roads network and light rail infrastructure.</p><p> There is another body I wish to mention because it has a vital role, although it probably does not come up for mention as often as the others.  I refer to the Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR.  It was set up by the Oireachtas under 2005 legislation and is the national body with responsibility for oversight and authorisations in the very important area of rail safety.  In more recent years, it has also had a role in some economic aspects of the running of railways and facilitating market access.</p><p> In many respects, our national regulatory framework for public transport reflects EU law that applies across all member states and, therefore, like other member states, Ireland now has independent transport-focused authorities that are responsible for matters such as the allocation of funding and licensing - roles carried out by the NTA - and issues such as the oversight of safety, for which the CRR is responsible.  These are functions that in previous years - going back some decades - were all exercised under the ambit of the Department.</p><p> The most visible set of actors in the State sector dealing with public transport is probably the long-standing CI&Eacute; and its three operating subsidiaries: Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath in Dublin, Bus &Eacute;ireann, operating throughout the country, and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, operating the rail service throughout the country.  They are visible because these are the companies that actually provide the services to passengers.  They are the ones passengers can see daily and with which passengers and many of us identify.  The companies are responsible for running all their services, making decisions as to how they operate them and deciding on strategy, etc., in respect of the commercial aspects of their operations.</p><p> What I have described are the State operators in the sector.  There are many non-State participants, the obvious ones being the passengers.  Among the service providers there are many private firms and community bodies involved in transport provision.  They do this under relevant regulatory, licensing or funding arrangements with the NTA.</p><p> The committee is primarily concerned with transport matters that affect rural areas and regional travel.  Regarding the work of the Minister and the Department, our remit for policy development and overall aggregate transport funding is probably the most relevant to the context of support for transport in rural and regional areas.  Members will probably be aware that on the policy front, A Programme for a Partnership Government, running over the Government's lifetime, contains a number of commitments that are relevant to what we are talking about, in particular the area of public transport area.  One of the commitments in which I am sure the committee is very interested is to look at how best to improve the integration of services in the rural transport network and to provide a report on this to the Oireachtas committees.  The matter is being examined and developed by the Department in the context of a broader piece of work that we have under way, which is to review public transport policy more generally.  This review of public transport policy is another commitment in the programme for Government, which asks us "to ensure services are sustainable into the future and are meeting the needs of a modern economy".</p><p> As a key part of this policy review process, the committee may be aware that the Minister hosted a round-table discussion involving a very broad range of organisations and individuals closely linked to the public transport sector in May.  Specifically regarding rural transport, these included representatives of the Rural Transport Network and Irish Rural Link.  The purpose of the discussion was to give all participants the opportunity to outline their perspectives on key public transport policy issues and, equally, to ensure that all those involved were in the room at the same time in order that they could hear the perspectives of others and engage in a dialogue about the challenges of achieving appropriate policy balances.  The discussions, papers and presentations made at that event are forming the basis of a public consultation that we plan to undertake very shortly.  The public consultation will feed into the work the Department is doing on reviewing public transport policy, including the rural transport dimension, and we hope the upshot of this will be the development of a public transport policy statement.</p><p> This transport policy review work is taking place against the backdrop of another piece of work in which we were heavily involved, which is a noticeable policy development that came to some fruition earlier this year.  I refer to the recently agreed Project Ireland 2040 plan.  The latter was developed by means of a cross-Government initiative led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and involving other Departments and Ministers, including ourselves.  The plan was published earlier this year and it comprises two elements.</p><p>First, there is a new national planning framework, which sets the vision and policy direction in which the Government sees Ireland developing over the next 20 or 25 years.  Alongside that is a new capital development plan, which is the strategic capital investment plan for infrastructure for the first ten years of the longer-term vision statement.  Transport is a key element of national infrastructure.  It is a critical component of how we plan for the country's future development.  Therefore, transport features strongly in Project Ireland 2040.  Equally, Project Ireland 2040 will influence and shape how we develop transport over the next number of years.  <br/><br/>The Exchequer provides considerable funding for public transport.  This includes subvention support, which is provided via the National Transport Authority, NTA.  This goes towards the public service obligation, PSO, operations of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, both of which have very substantial operations and services across rural Ireland and to facilitate regional connectivity.  It also provides investment for their infrastructure.  Exchequer funding also supports the rural transport programme, which is obviously specific to rural areas.  That is aimed at addressing issues of social isolation though providing a public transport service.  It is very much tailored to local needs.  This funding is also channelled by the NTA.  Since 2012 that body has had national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the rural transport programme.  Members will probably be more familiar with it under the rural transport programme's new branding, which is the Local Link brand.<br/><br/>The delivery of demand-responsive transport services has been and remains the cornerstone of the Local Link programme.  In tandem with this, there has been an increasing focus on trying to provide some regular commuter services.  This has occurred since 2016, and it responds to identified local demands that have cropped up over the course of the delivery of the Local Link programme.  These scheduled services are high-frequency services, running as often as seven days a week depending on where they are.  They are designed to facilitate regular access to education, employment and healthcare in addition to recreational opportunities.  Key features include connectivity with other public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages throughout Ireland.  The NTA tells us that since it began opening scheduled services under the rural transport programme in 2016, 60 such regular rural services have been introduced into the network, which is managed by the Local Link offices. <br/><br/>One of the priority areas under the national planning framework is the essential requirement to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban areas of population and their regions and hinterlands, while trying to initiate the development of more compact growth within urban areas.  Compact growth, improved public transport and decarbonisation of car journeys are all necessary elements of our transition to a low-carbon future.  <br/><br/>Another major objective of the framework is to make substantial progress in linking regions and urban areas.  That does not just mean linking them to Dublin, but also linking them with each other and with local areas of significant interest.  Project Ireland 2040 recognises that significant investment in public transport will be required to accommodate changes in growth and provide more choice for the travelling public, improving the quality of people's lives.  The plan builds on this investment.  In June, the Minister and Minister of State at the Department launched &quot;Linking People and Places&quot;, which involves investment of &euro;8.6 billion specifically in public transport.  The aim is to link more people and more places, as the title says, while also improving the quality of life, easing congestion in our cities and doing our part to deliver a low-carbon society.  <br/><br/>New major public transport programmes to be delivered under the national development plan, NDP, will be fully accessible for people with disabilities.  This has been done as part of the normal design.  Designing for accessibility is part of how projects are designed nowadays.  In tandem with that there will be a continued investment programme to retrofit existing older public transport facilities to enhance their accessibility features. <br/><br/>One of the flagship investments that will be delivered within Project Ireland 2040 and the ten-year NDP horizon is BusConnects.  This will apply in Ireland's cities.  It will commence roll-out in Dublin, followed by the other major cities starting with Galway.  It is a key investment priority for public transport.  It will address congestion in the short to medium term and is therefore a key project that we wish to see developed.  The programme of BusConnects in the regional cities will include new bus fleets, bus lanes with segregated cycling facilities, revised bus service networks and park-and-ride facilities.  The objective is to deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, to make the bus an attractive option and to allow commuting by bus to become a viable choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.  <br/><br/>With regard to the inter-urban rail network, the funding priority in the NDP and the planning framework is to protect the investment that has already been made over several decades in the development of the railway system by funding maintenance and safety projects that are needed to maintain safety and service levels across all rail operations in the State.  <br/><br/>Turning briefly to roads, the sheer scale of Ireland's road network tends not to be very well known.  Our roads have a combined length of 100,000 km.  This is twice the EU norm on a <i>per capita</i>basis.  The road network is really the workhorse of economic and social infrastructure throughout the country.  Most of our freight is carried on it, all of our bus services rely on it and the people of Ireland rely on the road network to link regional and local areas and to connect communities.  Maintaining and renewing the road network is recognised in the NDP as being of critical importance.  Within available budgets, both Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Department are very focused on maintaining the network in as serviceable a condition as possible.  In the case of regional and local roads, the main grant programmes operated by the Department are targeted at specific policy objectives.  One of these is pavement sealing.  This protects the surface of the road from water damage.  Another such objective is road strengthening.  This is based on giving the road a condition rating.  It is intended to lengthen the life of road pavements.  <br/><br/>These grants, which are intended to supplement the local authority's own resources, are allocated on the basis of the length of the road network within a local area of responsibility.  It is done this way because that is seen as the fairest and most equitable basis for allocation.  The committee might be interested to note that the Department's grant funding for regional and local roads is principally directed to local authorities outside of Dublin.  This reflects the fact that since the revision of the arrangements for the retention of local property tax, carried out in 2015, the Dublin councils no longer receive any grant assistance from the Department under the main road categories.  <br/><br/>In addition to substantial support for the maintenance of the road network, the NDP lists 23 new national road schemes.  They are already at the stages of planning, design or construction.  These include things like the strategic road link between Cork and Limerick.  At regional and local level, another 13 significant road improvement projects are currently being advanced under the NDP.  <br/><br/>Together, all of these schemes will better link local communities.  They will reduce congestion and contribute to the local economies and society of their areas.  Work is also under way on appraisal and early planning work related to a pipeline of road projects identified as suitable for future development.</p><p>Overall the Department works on providing the general policy context for all transport in Ireland, including land transport in rural areas and connectivity within and between regions.  The road network and the public transport networks are integral to this and they each received substantial levels of support from the State each year.  This is set to continue and be enhanced into the foreseeable future and is closely linked to key outcomes that have been identified by the Government in Project Ireland 2040, the development and investment strategy plan.</p><p> We hope we can assist the committee in its deliberations by explaining and discussing the policy context for land transport in Ireland.  As mentioned earlier in my statement, as we are currently embarked on reviewing public transport, including rural transport policy, we hope that in the course of discussions this evening, we will learn from hearing members' views and will be able to take on board those views and experiences to help inform the work we are doing on our policy review.</p><p> I thank the Acting Chairman.</p></speech>

I have read her script carefully and it is clear she has set out an overall policy remit, not choosing a specific item here or there.  I will try to keep my focus on policy.</p> <p>  First, has the Department a policy on public transport fares to ensure the setting of fares is evidence-based and that there is an equality between rural and urban fares?  I received the most extraordinary statement from the NTA dated 16 October 2018 stating that as is common practice internationally, different fares apply in city areas reflecting the different operation characteristic in those areas as opposed to rural areas.  I do not care what they do internationally.  I do not live in an international area, I live in Ireland.  I do not care what irrational policies they have anywhere else, I like to see Irish policy being rational.</p> <p>  Let me give Ms Hanlon a simple example of what is happening all over the country.  If one takes the train from Dublin to Sallins, that journey is considered to be within the urban area and is half the cost of taking the train to Newbridge, which falls into the rural category.  By going to the next station, the fare is suddenly doubled.  When one asks the NTA or authorities, their response is that the way it was and that is the way it is and that is the way it will be forever, Amen.  That is not a rational decision.  On an expressway bus route, one can travel from Galway to Dublin for &euro;20 but a bus from Galway to Carraroe costs something similar.  I do not want to be fobbed off with the answer that this is a decision for the NTA, but I want to know whether the Minister has a policy set out for the NTA that all fare should be based on the same rationale and one cannot double the rate per kilometre just because one must travel a further distances down the road.  </p> <p>  Is there a ministerial policy that lays down that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann must do what it is meant to do, that is, provide on the railway lines it owns efficient national services and not just concentrate on a few routes?</p> <p>  From a study I have done it would appear there is a clear relationship between frequency, fares, timetabling and journey distances and when one puts all those factors together, one gets the passengers.  I have looked on a spot basis, but has the Department looked at the massive latent potential arising from the interplay of those four factors?  For example, there is a frequent train service from Athenry to Galway because there is the Limerick train.  There are 399 people travelling on the train from Athenry, which has a population of 3,950, to Galway city and making the return journey every day.  If one compares that service with  the service from Clonmel to Waterford, one will find that practically nobody is travelling on that train, even though the population of Waterford is 17,140 and one would think that four times the number travelling from Athenry would be travelling, which is more than 1,000. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018102300002#D00500"><p>I meant the travelling population from Clonmel to Waterford.  The population of Clonmel, which is 17,140, is four times the population of Athenry but as the Chairman knows, nobody is using the train.  That is not surprising because the train leaves at 10.38 a.m. and arrives at 11.29 a.m.  Similarly, one would leave at 7.45 p.m. and would get home at 8.45 p.m.  Given a very small town like Athenry has achieved such numbers, has the Department conducted a study on the potential, should the four parameters I mentioned be co-ordinated?  I think one would find similar outcomes on the east coast, where there are frequent services into Dublin.</p> <p>  I have two more questions.  Has the Department developed or is it developing a commuter rail policy in line with the spatial strategy?  Not everybody wants to live in an area of housing density, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport should forget that long-time dream that will not happen because people do not do what the Department wants them to do.  They will do what they want.  If people want to live in Tuam, they will live in Tuam, and travel to work.  The same applies in every area.  If they want to live in "Cloneedebonk", they will live there.  That is the way it is.  I am focusing on policy.  Allowing that my assessment of what people will really do is correct, has the Department a plan to develop commuter policy into the cities of Galway, Waterford, Cork and Limerick along the existing rail network, including open and closed railway lines?  There are three classes of railway lines, open, semi-open - I count Nenagh to Limerick as semi-open and Limerick Junction to Waterford as semi-open - and real open railway lines.  Is the Department developing a policy on this?</p> <p>  There is a little known provision in law in rural areas for rural hackney cars, Public Service Obligation, PSO, vehicles.  It is nearly impossible to get this licence.  How many PSO vehicles have active licences?  I got an answer before and it was minuscule.  Is it intended to review the PSO vehicle licence to ensure there would be an attractive arrangement for public service vehicles in every small country area, particularly since the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was diligent in introducing the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018?  I am absolutely against drink-driving and I wish we could do something about the people who are driving when five times over the limit, but if one goes out for a meal or an event in a rural area, there is no service that will bring people the four or five miles to their home.  When one tries to ensure there are local PSO vehicle licences, one is told there are five taxi licences, but those with a taxi licence are working in the city as they are not confined to a local area and are not available when one needs them.  Will the Department review that and will the officials look at a policy of introducing an attractive PSO local-based licence system for new entrants, which would mean that such a licenceholder would have to pick up and deliver a person within a certain radius?  This would fill a very big black hole in terms of rural transport services that people living in urban areas take for granted.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to note those question and I now call on Senator Hopkins.</p></speech>

One of my questions is about the road network.  I am from the west where there are huge concerns about the need to develop a fit-for-purpose road network.  I live very near the N5.  Everybody is aware of the need to upgrade both that road and the N4.  The current map of Ireland shows that there is very little motorway access north of the M6.  What policy is there to support the development of road infrastructure in the west?  I am aware that work is ongoing on the N5 and the N4, but it cannot happen fast enough.  We must have fit-for-purpose road infrastructure to facilitate both individuals and businesses.  That is critical.</p> <p>  My second point is related to what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned about timetables.  This morning I took the train from Castlerea to Dublin, but if I wish to get home this evening, the last train leaves at 6.15 p.m.  We live in changing times and many people have to and do commute.  Many would use public transport if the timetables met their needs.  The Department must play a more active role in facilitating greater efficiency in having timetables that meet people's needs.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v gave another example, we are not talking about the matter in isolation.  There are challenges in trying to meet people's needs.  Obviously, we wish to create employment in rural areas, but we must deal with the reality that many people commute.</p> <p>  I emphasise the importance of Local Link and the improvements that have taken place in its infrastructure.  Last week I was in a school in Tulsk where the Local Link bus service has been very beneficial in bringing children from the school to an after-school childcare centre.  That is just one example of where the service is supporting families.  There are other examples where it links with bus services and towns.  I believe that as the service is developed more people will use it.  Improvements have been made, but can the officials address my concerns about train services and the road network?</p> <p>  The document mentions that there have been round-table discussions which will result in a public transport policy statement.  As I am a practical person, what will that mean?  Ms Hanlon has said there is a particular emphasis on rural areas.  What will that mean for people living in these areas?  How will it translate into or deliver better services for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018102300002#E00200"><p>I thank Ms Hanlon for her presentation.  There are a few issues of concern.  I would love to talk about rail services, but, unfortunately, there is no rail service west of Cork city.  I cannot talk about it being early or late because we do not have one.  When we had a discussion with representatives from Bus &Eacute;ireann, they gave an indication that they would link bus services with rail services from Cork, but that has not happened.  Do the officials have any indication that it will happen in the future?  As it appears that there will never be a railway line running through places such as Bandon, Clonakilty or west Cork, why is there no bus service linking people living in west Cork with the rail service every morning?  Such a service would help workers and reduce the numbers travelling to and from work in their cars.</p> <p>  Another issue is the cost of fares for those living in rural communities.  I hear about it from many young people who are in college or the cities.  They find that fares in the cities are much cheaper than they are in rural areas, particularly west Cork.  Yesterday I was talking to an operator, Damien Long in Skibbereen.  He is willing to provide a service in west Cork to take people to the city early in the morning to work.  The service would be in competition with Bus &Eacute;ireann, but competition is the lifeblood of trading.  However, he needs a licence.  If he, Cremins Coaches or any other operator in west Cork wishes to provide such a service, we should encourage it.  He is willing to offer it at a much cheaper rate.  Why has it or something similar not been progressed?  Bus &Eacute;ireann has been given ample time to reduce fares to favourable rates, but that has not happened.  Perhaps the officials might elaborate further on the matter.</p> <p>  The other issue is transport for people with disabilities who are over 18 years of age.  In the last two and a half years I have raised this issue in the D&aacute;il with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the current Taoiseach.  In west Cork - I can only talk about my constituency - if somebody is 18 years of age, he or she will not be provided with a transport service.  He or she will receive a public bus pass, but that is not sufficient for many people with disabilities.  People are driving here, there and everywhere for up to four hours a day to take their children to and from training or other facilities.  When I mention it to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, he tells me that it is not an issue in Dublin.  Obviously, in Dublin they are being collected from their home, which is correct.  However, it is an issue in west Cork.  The previous Taoiseach sidelined it as not being an issue and when I raised it today the Taoiseach sidelined it and said I should deal with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The bottom line is that once people with disabilities reach the age of 18 years, they are left totally alone, as are their parents.  It is extremely stressful for their parents, most of whom might be in the 60 to 70 years age bracket.  They are travelling every morning and evening and it could take up to two hours to travel each way to and from west Cork.  This issue must be examined because something could be done.  There are many taxis and buses that are probably paid for by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the HSE and they are crossing paths, but nobody is talking to anybody.  Local Link has a huge chance to play a role in organising and co-ordinating such services.  Obviously, it would take a little funding to put a service together, but money might be saved in the long term and everybody might be looked after.  We read in the newspapers last week about Sarah Dullea from Dunmanway, a very successful business woman who has spina bifida.  She cannot avail of public transport from Dunmanway because Bus &Eacute;ireann has told her that it cannot collect her at her bus stop in Dunmanway owing to accessibility issues.  We have signed agreements that we are now compliant with disabilities requirements in the European Union, but we are not.  We are very far from it.  Perhaps the officials might enlighten me on that transport issue.</p> <p>  I will comment briefly on roads.  As we do not have rail services, people must use the roads in travelling to and from the city and places such as Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Castletownbere and the peninsulas.  We have not received what I would call decent money.  For as long as I can remember, money has not been spent on the N71 and the R586, other than on fire-fighting repairs.  I was very young when the Skibbereen bypass was constructed.  It was a fabulous bypass, but that is the last time a real amount of money was spent in west Cork.  Let us take as an example when someone is travelling to Bandon and has to take the R586 in travelling between Ballineen and Enniskeane.  There are two major factories, Grainger Sawmills Limited and the Carbery factory in Ballineen.  Lorries are travelling at a speed of 25 to 30 km per hour and cars have to travel for 15 to 20 km behind them.  There are no passing bays.  The situation is the same if one travels from Bandon to Clonakilty and Clonakilty to Skibbereen.</p> <p>  I am not here to criticise anybody.  However, I must face the electorate at some stage, whether it will be in one month or two years hence, and the first issues that will be raised are broadband and roads.  Mobile phone coverage might the third.  I have no answers.  I have been here for two and a half years seeking answers and trying to see if we can create simple solutions such as providing passing bays on the N71 and the R586.</p><p>I am not looking for flyovers or anything else, only common sense.  Reference was made to an announcement by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, of an investment of &euro;8.6 billion in the report, Linking People and Places.  A bridge in Lyre in Clonakilty that was severely damaged six or seven years ago as a result of bad weather has not been replaced.  It has resulted in the community being split up and people having to drive a few miles in one direction or the other but no consideration has been given to replacing that bridge.  It was probably built in the 1900s and money was found to construct it then, but in 2018 no money can be found to repair it.  The community keep asking me why money has not been spent on repairing that bridge as it has been blocked up for the past few years.  Small measures such as that one would mean a lot.</p><p> A transportation plan is being drawn up for Castletownbere.  Will the officials examine the way plans are developed in the Department in terms of working with the local communities as there is a great deal of resentment to that plan?  Some parts of it might be excellent but nobody sat down with the community and teased through the difficulties.  The officials will say they consulted the community, they advertised what is proposed in a notice displayed on a wall, which I saw, but they need to talk to the community.  We are now at gridlock and it is left to politicians like me to try to resolve very serious issues for people whose businesses are haemorrhaging in rural Ireland.  They are afraid there will be further closures if they do not resist much of what is proposed in the plan.  Those issues could have been noted at the beginning of the process and now councillors are being asked to oppose the plan.  It comes back to officials sitting down with the local community and teasing out the issues.  That can be done in many communities but if people feel they are being ignored, that will not happen.</p><p> The officials might say I am viewing developments in a negative sense but I am not.  I see many improvements in towns like Drimoleague where a great deal of money has been spent on a fabulous resurfacing project.  Similar investment has been made on the N71 in Leap in west Cork, but we are firefighting.  All we are doing is repairing damage.  We are not looking to the future. West Cork has been neglected for a long time and it needs to be prioritised.  Funds need to be moved from the second part of Ireland, which is Dublin, and we need to focus on the other part of Ireland, which is rural Ireland.  I would appreciate if the witnesses would consider those points.</p></speech>

I will deal with them in the order they were raised, cluster some of them where points were made regarding interventions in a few areas, and I will ask my colleague to comment on the road items.</p> <p>  The issue of public transport fares was raised by Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Michael Collins.  The Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 specifically provides that one of the functions to be carried out not by the Minister of our Department but by the independent National Transport Authority, NTA, is to regulate, set and determine fares.  It does that typically by way of an annual statement.  It issued its fares determination sometime last week or the previous wee,.  That is an exercise of powers the Oireachtas conferred on it and that it has specifically stated should no longer be exercised by the Minister of our Department but by an independent authority and that it should be done in this way.  Matters about fares and the fairness of them-----</p></speech>

It does not arbitrarily set fares.  It published a document spanning 50 to 80 pages about two weeks ago setting out its explanation of the changes it had made to fares and its approach and strategy with respect to fares over a period.  As I understand it, it is seeking over time to move to having fares that are relatively comparable on a distance basis or on like-for-like journeys.  Obviously, the experience the Deputy has raised with us would be at variance with that and we can bring that to the attention of the NTA.  However, overall, the approach as to how it is to be dealt with has been decided by the Oireachtas and that is what happens.  The NTA sets its fares and publishes them annually.  They are available on its website.  They are published and made public together with an explanation of the rationale for them and the longer-term strategy the authority is following regarding the setting of fares.</p> <p>  Regarding other matters that were raised, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if there is a policy on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann providing efficient national services.  Yes, the expectation of Government is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of CIE that is fully owned by the Minister for Transport on behalf of the people, would provide transport services on the rail network that it has not run and it does provide services on a national basis.  It provides many types of services, including commuter services, particularly around the cities, notably the DART.  As referenced by the Deputy, an increasing commuter-type service is being built up in or around Galway.  Commuter services around Cork have also been developed in recent years.  In addition to those services, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann runs the InterCity services.</p></speech>

They live in certain areas, work in other areas or commute for education purposes, and they are availing of the services that are operating.  InterCity services are run right across the network and then, on parts of the network, services are not run between cities but between large towns and these provide facilities for all passengers who want to travel between those points along the lines.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-23a.681" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Hanlon" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018102300002#G00100"><p>That is an interesting set of points and one that has come up from a few members of the committee.  It is one we will refer back to our colleagues in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority.</p> <p>  Timetabling issues are core operational issues for the transport companies.  Timetabling is done primarily by the public service transport providers and, in the particular case raised, by the rail company.  Overall, especially in the bus area, timetabling is overseen by the NTA.  The authority has a role but there is no role for Ministers or Departments in respect of operational matters.  Yet, the fact that Deputies and Senators are raising this as a point is one of the things we are interested in hearing about today and it will feed back into our thinking about the development of services, public transport policy, the approaches that can best be developed for the future and how public transport can best be articulated for the public.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in respect of the point about rural hackneys.  The rural hackney licence was an innovation introduced by the transport regulator several years ago in or around 2012.  It was a response to the fact that in rural areas there was an identified issue about the availability of taxi services.  It was thought that this might provide an additional feature that could be availed of by some people.  It has not proven popular.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether there is a proposal to review it.  Some review work is under way with the taxi advisory committee and the National Transport Authority, which is the statutory regulator for taxis.  In the course of this work one of the issues they will look at is the fact that the rural hackney licence, although introduced as an innovation, has not been taken up much.  They will examine the reasons and whether there are other ways of approaching the matter that could be useful to pursue.  Some suggestions were made in the course of comments today.  We will reference this back to those involved in the review.</p> <p>  Other points were raised.  I will not go over the points on the LocalLink service again but I referenced the service in the opening statement.  There has been strong development of the service.  There seems to be strong and positive feedback about it throughout the country.  Obviously, that is a good thing but there is cause for more.  We have been able to provide additional funding for the service through a combination of specific funding for the rural transport programme and through the public service obligation programme as well.  Communities throughout the country are seeing the benefits.  Small interventions can have a major effect and impact on linking people and places.  That was the phrase the Minister of State chose when launching the transport part of the national development plan.  That is the critical theme those involved are trying to speak to in developing these proposals.</p> <p>  Senator Hopkins asked about the policy statement that we are working on bringing forward and whether it will translate directly into benefits for rural Ireland or rural people.  She asked how they will know when it is done and whether they will see the benefits.  I suppose what we are talking about with a policy statement is a gathering together and articulation of State policy or Government policy in respect of a particular area.  In this case, it is useful to look at public transport and other areas of our Department.  Public transport is an area where we have not yet pulled together one single cohesive statement synthesising the policy.  We have any number of policy documents here, there and everywhere but we do not have a synthesis.  The Department has worked on that approach in recent years.  It has been done for aviation policy.  There is a single document called the national aviation strategy.  We have a national tourism strategy.  Recently, only this summer, a national sport policy document was pulled together by the Department synthesising the approach to things.  It was launched by the Minister and Minister of State.  The aim for public transport is to do something similar.</p> <p>  Of itself, a policy statement does not necessarily make anyone's life any better but it provides in a single place a coherent and easily accessible definition of what we are trying to do.  It enables a discussion on what we should be doing as we come to formulate policy and then it allows for Government to agree on the key principles.  These are not likely to be principles alien to what has been done heretofore, but the statement represents a synthesis, an articulation and a setting down in one place at one time of what is expected to be at the core.  It offers guidance for Government, policy-makers and the plethora of agencies, including State agencies, working in the sector.  It guides them for the future.  It is a something of a reference point they can use as a compass to check they are navigating in the right direction.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins asked about bus services linking with rail.  Again, that is in or around timetabling so it is not a matter the Department deals with directly, but it is interesting to hear that perspective and to hear of the real need to provide connectivity and interconnection by ensuring the various strands and facets of public transport that we provide link up with one another.  The NTA has a specific role in the integration of transport.  That was seen by the legislators and policy developers around 2008 and 2009 when the NTA legislation was being developed.  This is critical because it helps us to get beyond the sum of the parts.  If we have a bus service providing a given level of service and a rail service provider another level, then they are good.  If we can have some level of integration that makes sense and that still has a healthy competitive tension then we can get better outcomes.  We will reference that matter to the NTA to examine for the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about potential bus licensing for a commercial operator interested in providing a bus service.  This is something the NTA does, although going back some years it would previously have been done by the Department.  The NTA runs this now.  A good deal of information is available on the NTA website if parties are interested in developing a proposal for a bus route and have ideas.  The website provides guidance on how to make applications.  It also gives an outline of the timeframe for making an application, the timeframe within which an applicant can expect to have a licence application turned around and when the applicant can expect to have a response.</p> <p>  The question of disability and transport services was raised.  I only touched on this briefly in the opening statement because of the length of other matters but there is an increasing drive to improve the accessibility of public transport.  There have been strong improvements over several years and the Department has become more involved with stakeholders in the sector by engaging with them regularly to get a better understanding of the needs and how they can best be dealt with through the public transport systems we have.</p><p>We are not there yet.  There are elements of the system that are not yet fully working or are not working as cogently as we would expect.  That said, within the cities, there is 100% accessibility on the urban transport fleet.</p><p> There is substantial accessibility at bus stops.  In the context of the urban transport fleet, there are a small number of bus stops that have still to be upgraded.  By and large, there is a good story within the cities.  Around the country the situation is not as good but it is improving over time.  Within its network, as Bus &Eacute;ireann replaces its coaches, it is replacing them with coaches that have improved accessibility.  It has gotten to a level now where 86% of its coach fleet is accessible.  That said, we are back to the same issue.  Is the bus stop compatible with an accessible coach?  It tends to be that journeys between bus stations are accessible but if one is getting off at other points in between places, which many people are, accessibility is not as good.  For that reason, the NTA is rolling out a programme to improve the accessibility of bus stops throughout the country.  It is trying to do it on a route basis.  The routes it has picked to start with are the Dublin-Donegal routes where there is no alternative public transport service and no rail service.  It is trying to start it there.  It is scheduling to develop it around the country.  I do not know the precise pattern on which it is doing it.  I am not aware of what the plans are specifically.</p></speech>

The committee has a specific remit in terms of rural services.  The Deputy referred to the case of a disabled lady in west Cork who is finding it very difficult to get transport support.

It is an issue, as Deputy Collins said.  When people with disabilities turn 18 years of age, all of a sudden they do not have transport, particularly in places like west Cork.  One of the things the NTA is doing, which is part of its strategy statement and plan for the next four years, is the integration of the non-emergency HSE transport services with the LocalLink services.  It is something it is looking for to give a better opportunity for better services in that regard.  It is doing a pilot with the HSE.  I think the Cork-Kerry region is the planned area to look at.  It is specifically with the HSE and relating to people with disabilities.  That might assist in some way but we will certainly bring it back to the NTA.  We have also met with the HSE in that regard but we are leaving it to both the HSE and the NTA to run this pilot and hopefully it might achieve some results.</p></speech>

Before I do, I will note Ms O'Hanlon's title, which is assistant secretary for public transport, sustainability and climate change.  It is something we should mention in the committee.  We all know the energy, agriculture and transport sectors contribute a lot to our carbon emissions.  I have a brief question on sustainability policy.  With regard to the potential for electric vehicles in the public transport fleet, what is the view of the Department on motivating our public transport agencies to improve their carbon emission footprint?  Will Ms O'Hanlon give a view on that?  Senator O'Sullivan will agree with me on some of this.  With regard to cycling infrastructure in our towns and villages, where there are new roads or upgrades of roads, there should be adequate provision in our Estimates for cycling infrastructure to try to improve access for cycling and sustainability.  Will Ms O'Hanlon note some of those questions?</p> <p>  I call on Senator O'Sullivan, who will be followed by Deputies Fitzmaurice and Danny Healy-Rae.</p></speech>

I will refer to the comment made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about fares.  Should we be looking at affordability in terms of equality so there is a fair regime throughout the country so people in rural areas are not disadvantaged?  It might be something we could look at in the committee.  If the NTA has put out its fare regime, we should look at it and make sure there is no inequality.</p></speech>

The Department can answer but it would be in our interest to have the NTA in specifically to talk about fares and affordability in the regional context.</p></speech>

I am a Green Party member.  We were quite disappointed with the recent budget in terms of the focus on public transport and the allocation of funds to the areas of cycling and walking.  I want to press Ms O'Hanlon a little bit more in terms of the Department's policy on sustainability.  With regard to our carbon emissions, what is the policy of the Department in terms of transitioning away from oil-burning modes of transport?  What is the policy with regard to supporting electrical vehicles?  What is the Department's policy on supporting bicycles with regard to schemes in Dublin and in cities like Cork where there is a very efficient system at the train stations?  It is an example of smart connectivity where people can benefit from using public transport.  I lived in the Netherlands for nine years.  It is very frustrating to be here in Ireland - I am from Tramore - because the opportunity to use public transport is restricted by timing.  With rail services, the last train in the evening is around 6 o'clock, which is a pity.  The morning schedule is excellent but the evening one is not.  What is the Department doing to try to create a better system where people can use public transport, have connectivity and avoid congestion?  Congestion is an enormous problem in this country.  Trying to access Dublin is a disaster.  Galway is a disaster.  The congestion is desperate.  When people are sitting in congested traffic, not only is there frustration but they are burning fossil fuels that are leading to the acceleration of climate change.  What is the Department doing?  Ms O'Hanlon's remit is sustainability and climate.  What is the Department doing in terms of mitigation policies around extreme weather events?  In Waterford, when there are heavy rains the train station floods.  What moneys have been set aside?  Is the Department adapting or mitigating in this regard?</p> <p>  The freight train between Ballina and Waterford ended service in May 2018.  It seems regressive that we are pushing away from using systems of transport.  In that case, one could have taken the train from Rosslare through to Waterford and up to Ballina.  What will happen with that railway line?</p><p>Could it be used for public transport services because, again, tourism forms part of the Department's remit?  Could tourists be brought by rail from Rosslare along the Wild Atlantic Way via Waterford?  We could probably still do it.  What is the policy on closed and abandoned railway lines in the context of greenway development?  </p><p> On procurement and the use of EV buses, if one travels to Nijmegen or anywhere else in the Netherlands, one will see that the shift to electric buses has already been made.  What can we do to speed up the process?  </p><p> What is the strategy for the future for the rail line running from Waterford to Limerick Junction?  Has there been any discussion in the Department on connecting Waterford, Limerick and Galway on the rail network?  </p><p> Having regard to climate change, cost, affordability and the difficulties experienced by students in renting, what do the officials think about making public transport in all its forms free for students?  Do they think this would be a realistic idea, given the pressure exerted by affordability, to encourage young people to use public transport?  </p><p> It is funny that I am raising the issue of BlaBlaCar-----</p></speech>

BlaBlaCar is an international car pooling mechanism that is used throughout Europe.  My children use it all the time when abroad.  It is such an efficient system.  Are the officials aware of it?  Is there any opportunity for us to encourage a company such as BlaBlaCar to operate in Ireland in an effort to be more efficient in car usage?  It is a brilliant mechanism in the context of affordability.  If people are operating on very tight budgets, they could go online and link up with one or two others and car pool.  It is a really good mechanism.</p></speech>

She spoke about the programme for Government in reference to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In it there is a commitment that Ireland will make an application to the European Union for Trans-European Transport Networks, TEN-T, funding for services in the west.  However, nothing has been done in that regard.  Why not?  Freedom of information requests have been forwarded to the Department, but it seems to be very reluctant to provide information.</p> <p>  From what the officials have said, the priority when it comes to funding for the inter-urban rail network under the national development plan is to protect investment already made in the network by funding maintenance and safety projects which are needed to maintain service levels in railway operations.  If we are to move to the wonderland world about which everybody goes on where we will move towards the use of electric vehicles from Dublin to Cork, Belfast, Galway or Westport, from speaking to people in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, it appears that the cost will be &euro;3 billion.  Is that money available?  </p> <p>  I do not want the officials to box from my next question because I have been trying to get to the root of it for about six months.  There is a rail corridor from Limerick to Galway and talk of a rail review of services connecting Athenry, Tuam and Claremorris.  When representatives of the NTA appeared before us, they said the review would cover the eastern side of the country.  Two groups have appeared before the joint committee that I have tried to nail down to get a straight answer.  It has been alleged that a rail review is ongoing.  Do the officials agree that when it comes to funding, the Department has no intention of opening the rail corridor because their statement is very clear?  I have spoken to Barry Kenny and in detail about services to places such as Longford and Athlone and the use of high speed trains, but we need to make sure we are not talking about apples and oranges.  The Netherlands is the same size as Munster and has a population three and a half times the size of that of Munster,  yet it is more economical to run trains around it.  We need to make sure we will not get carried away.  I fully understand Ireland is more remote, but we need to nail down an answer to the question as to whether there will be a western rail corridor?  I have been waiting for an answer to that question for about two years.  </p> <p>  Do the officials agree that emissions from Euro 6 engines are the same as for gas engines?  Has the Department carried out research into the use of bio-diesel buses?  It is my understanding there is a company in England, 20% of the buses of which are electric, and that after three years, it is getting rid of the lot because the batteries have been giving ferocious trouble.  Will we jump into the sea and be unable to swim when we spend a lot of money?  Has the issue been fully researched and is the system workable?  </p> <p>  On transport policy in Galway, I do not think the west matters to the Department for the simple reason that there is no Luas service there.  It is like the words of Nanci Griffith's song "From A Distance".  Next week we are going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider the outer bypass.  We will probably travel around the world and back again, with people objecting to the project which might proceed in seven or eight years time after a heap of court cases.  The situation is chronic and I live 40 miles from Galway, but the officials might not know about it because they do not live there.  I live 112 or 118 miles from Dublin and can get to Leinster House faster than I can to the county council building in Galway.  Is it not a fierce denunciation of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that a city such as Galway to which the biggest companies have come does not have a rail network and infrastructure that can handle the volume of traffic going into it?  In case the officials do not know, Galway city is losing jobs, even in areas where it is growing.  I am not criticising a Government; it is due to the lack of infrastructure.  </p> <p>  Every year we meet business people in the west.  Senator Hopkins will also raise this issue.  There are companies in Westport that tell us that 20% of their goods are damaged by the time they reach Dublin because the road from Westport to Mullingar is a disaster.  The officials spoke about the quantities of goods being transported by road.  At the same time, there are many small towns to which Expressway services have been cut.  We should bear in mind that we are talking about the need to get people to use buses instead of their cars.  At the same time, we have problems with haulage services on the rail network because the carriage of passengers must be prioritised.</p><p> The Department is examining the position regarding hackneys.  I have dealt with a licence.  Prior to making an application, the person applying must go to the local authority for a letter stating that there is a need in an area and, after three months, he or she receives a lovely letter stating that a study is required.  These people operate on a voluntary basis and they are needed by communities.  When the letter to which I refer is issued, a community group must formulate a study to prove that someone is needed to provide a service in an area where there is currently none.  People are sick to their back teeth of the paperwork involved.  I can answer the question on this because I dealt with a licence application.  We compiled a study, which we were then told was out of date even though there was no mode of public or private transport in the area.  People must still get a community group to carry out an analysis - without funding - of why an area needs someone to bring a few people home from the pub.</p><p> Last night, I was speaking to a guy who bought a new bus.  Under the rural transport scheme, it is now compulsory that buses must be wheelchair accessible.  That is good and I agree with it.  If, however, someone wants to bring US tourists from Kerry to Donegal and he or she buys a new bus, there is nothing in writing about it having to be wheelchair accessible.  Whether a bus owner gets the VAT back depends on the length of the bus.  Under the rural transport scheme, making a bus wheelchair accessible costs &euro;6,000.  This means it would cost &euro;12,000 to accommodate two wheelchairs and the bus owner will not get the VAT back.  If we are trying to incentivise people in rural areas to buy proper buses in order that they might provide local transport, why are we driving them away?  At the same time, depending on the size of the bus and whether there is a big bumper on it, people will get the VAT back.  Our guests know that LocalLink transport providers use smaller 18 or 20-seater buses because they will not bring 53-seaters down a bog road.  They must go to all the expense.  It probably costs the Department and the NTA more because there is no incentive.</p><p> Our guests referred to 100,000 km of road network throughout the country.  Galway has one 20th of the overall total.  Why is County Galway less funded per kilometre of road than 99% of the remainder of the country?  We have had departmental officials speak on this.  We can speak about property tax and that we are getting &euro;12.5 million from central government but &euro;14.5 million was collected in property tax so the local authority gave back an extra &euro;1.5 million.</p><p> Our guests referred to Cork and Mallow.  Is there any vision to put in place what I would call a proper road from Mullingar to Westport?  I know our guests will speak about Collooney and Tarmonbarry but they are only pieces.  What I mean by a proper road is a dual carriageway at minimum.  Will this also be the case from the Tuam motorway up to Letterkenny?  The motorway is exceptionally good.  It has provided a connection all the way down.  When the route from Cork to Mallow is completed, it will be a fine road.  If we look at the area that includes Sligo we do not have a proper bus service in Galway or all of the towns that will be made cities under the 2040 plan.  We have no plan whatsoever for a Luas or tram system.  The witnesses spoke about park and ride, which is a great idea, but seeing it will be believing it.  Where is the vision?  The start to the vision is in the first question I asked about the TEN-T funding.  I know the ifs and percentages involved.  I am not asking about them.  It is written in the programme for Government but we are two and a half years into that so why has it not been put in place to go from the west to the north of Ireland?</p></speech>

I have a small bus transport service.  My father operated it before me since 1956.</p> <p>  My question is on the rule operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann whereby private contractors providing school transport cannot have buses older than 20 years.  If they are older than 20 years, they are off the road.  How is it that until very recently Bus &Eacute;ireann was using buses that were more than 20 years old?  Perhaps they are off the road now.  I have been advised that they were on the road until very recently.</p> <p>  There was a big hullabaloo, instigated by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and some Fine Gael Ministers, which involved propaganda about an evening service operated by Irish Rural Link to bring people out and home.  In Kerry, eight services were to operate.  Seven of the services were on a once-a-week basis and the other was once a month to bring card players from Castlegregory to Croghane.  A promise was given that this pilot service would be extended but I do not see any mention of it in any budget or hear any talk that the service is to be enhanced.  What is the position in this regard?</p> <p>  There is no test centre for buses or lorries in south Kerry, which means people who want to have their vehicles tested must leave Valencia or Cahersiveen and travel to north Kerry or to Cork, whichever is nearer.  Many of these operators are asking for this service to be provided in the southern half of the county.  Who makes decisions in this regard?  Is it the Department that decides where test centres are located?</p> <p>  Three-year road funding was announced recently but regional roads have been put together with local roads.  It has been highlighted by our local authority for many years that regional roads should be given funding of their own because they take the bigger part of the local road funding in any three-year period.  Many members of Kerry County Council are asking for separate funding for regional roads because they are longer and wider and take a sizeable chunk of the funding from local link roads and long cul-de-sac byroads.</p><p> There are two types of funding, one for road paving and the other for road strengthening.  Road strengthening is great when we get funding.  Many who see us doing road paving, which is to seal a road surface, ask why we are spending money on a good road when their roads are in way worse shape.  The relevant Department, which I am sure is that of our guests, has insisted that funding of &euro;50,000 be put aside in each engineering area should bad weather come and damage roads.  It is very hard to explain this.  I refer to prioritisation on the list and to what is included in the roads programme.  When people who travel on a road that is very bad ask what the &euro;50,000 is for, we have to tell them it is being kept for bad weather or flooding.  They then say that they do not have to wait for their road to get bad because it is already in bad shape and they ask why the money cannot be spent on it.  If there was bad weather or extreme circumstances in the past, the Exchequer provided funding to help.  The current arrangement is diminishing the amount of money we receive.  It is difficult to explain to people who must travel on an already bad road that we are waiting for some other road to get bad in order that the money might be spent on it.</p><p> How are national primary route projects selected?  IBEC tells us that we have fewer projects than any other country in Europe.  It keeps pointing out that interest rates have never been lower and that money is easily obtained for these projects.  I am asking how the projects are selected because the Killarney bypass was promised in 2003.  In 2004, there was a big presentation in what was then the Great Southern Hotel and the project was to proceed.  The name of the hotel changed for a while and now it is the Great Southern Hotel again but we still do not have the Killarney bypass.  Some 18,500 vehicles travel on the ring road.  It is chock-a-block.  It has been determined that the road is no longer safe in view of the volume of traffic.  I ask that the project to which I refer be progressed and prioritised.  We are now hoping and taking for granted that Macroom bypass will go ahead.  The existing road serves the traffic coming in from the Moll&rsquo;s Gap side.  If the bypass were put in place from Castlelough to Lissivigeen, it would help the people.  It would take all the traffic around Kenmare Place that wants to go on to Tralee or up the country and, likewise, the traffic coming in on the N22.  The town is absolutely choking.  It is good that there is traffic but it is felt that the town will lose out eventually because people are not happy to be sitting in their cars for perhaps an hour and a half or two hours between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m on warm evenings.  No one is happy with that.</p><p> I want to ask a question that contractors ask me.  How is school transport funding given to the operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann?  Is it subsidising other services of Bus &Eacute;ireann?</p><p> I, like many throughout the country, am very upset about all the talk of climate change, carbon tax and the big cry since the budget-----</p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about climate change and electric vehicles and it is said that a certain percentage of the bus fleet should be battery operated.  It is now a fact and it is coming home to roost that batteries, even in cars, are giving a lot of trouble.  Will this be another ridiculous experiment that will cost the Exchequer, taxpayers and fare payers?  Road hauliers and others were before the committee and complained that the Euro 6 diesel engine does not affect the climate and that there are no emissions from it.  Why, when we have something right, do we have to experiment, make changes and go down some other road about which we are not certain?  The signs are that battery-operated vehicles will not last.  I spoke earlier about Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles being over 20 years of age.  If the officials expect buses operated by battery will last 20 years or more, they need to think again because it will not happen.  There is so much talk about climate change.  If we were reduce our emissions altogether, our contribution would amount to only 0.13% in the worldwide context.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his views that matter.</p> <p>  I am conscious of time and want to give every member an opportunity to ask questions.  Senator Dolan will forgive me for making some comments before I call him.  Most of what I had to say has been covered so I will be very brief.  We have spoken a lot about connectivity for regions and rural areas, be it in the context of broadband, road or rail.  It is essential that, whatever policies we devise, we improve regional connectivity in the first instance.  If our regional connectivity is good, local access will be better.</p> <p>  I note the comments on Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan.  One of the regional cities identified for substantial urban growth is Waterford.  Of all the access routes to Waterford from other cities, the only good one is that from Dublin.  The N25 to Cork is dilapidated.  There are road works in Castlemartyr that have been going on for ever.  I remember travelling to Munster finals in the early 1980s and there were road works there.  I am now almost 50 and there are still road works going on.  Why is the N25, a primary national road, in what seems to be a very poor state?</p> <p>  The N24 connects two cities, Limerick and Waterford, whose populations are estimated to almost double by 2040.  The N24 is one of the worst national routes in the country in terms of its surface, the number of bends, the number of accidents on it and the number of villages through which it runs.  It is a terrible road connecting two of the cities for which we have such high ambitions.  How are we going to connect the cities with proper national primary routes and, by extension, improve access to those networks in the regions?</p><p>It is 2018 and the N24 and N25 are in a deplorable state.  I would like to hear the views of the officials from the Department on how we are going to improve that in accordance with the ambition already outlined in Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan.  It is essential that we do so.  I apologise to Senator Dolan.</p></speech>

I would also like to say a word of appreciation because a number of things have happened for people with disabilities, although there is much more that must happen.  The increase in the parking fine for people wrongly using disabled parking bays has been a great fillip and morale boost.  Much more can be done there as well but credit where credit is due.  The appointment of approximately half a dozen people with disabilities to a slew of public transport boards is a move in the right direction.  That is also welcome.</p> <p>  I want to start, believe it or not, with Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  At the start of Article 9 it is stated that parties - that means Ireland since April - to the convention "shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications ... both in urban and in rural areas".  We are referring, in particular, to rural Ireland here today.  The article also states, "These measures, which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to [a slew of things we will not go into]".  On 19 April last, Ireland lodged the papers with the United Nations in New York.  On 19 April 2020, two years from now, Ireland will make its first report on progress made.  Does the Department have an implementation plan to make Article 9 accessibility happen?  What is the Department's intention?  What does it hope to be reporting in respect of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities in April 2020?</p> <p>  We mentioned the rural aspects.  Approximately 37% of the population lives in rural Ireland.  That is 228,000 people with disabilities and their families.  I state that to make it clear.  The NTA is mentioned in the Department's presentation.  I will say again - sadly and clearly - that I have no confidence in the NTA.  That is based on what I have seen of its understanding of and empathy with the issue of providing inclusive transport solutions for people with disabilities.  My evidence comes from March 2017, when the NTA advised the Minister - and the rest of us - during the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike.  Three sets of Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles were being taken off of three routes, leaving three operators with licences to operate those routes.  The NTA stated at the time that there would be no diminution in service.  It was interesting that it could say this when all of the buses left on the routes were not wheelchair accessible.  What was even worse - and this goes back to points raised by colleagues to my left - was that they were not required to be accessible.  I refer to licences that are being given to bus companies.  I am not getting into public versus private, I am just talking about Joe Bloggs who is in a wheelchair or who has a mobility impairment.  He does not or should not need to know the logo on the bus to be able to get the bus from Clonmel to Dublin and out to the airport.  That was one of the routes involved.</p> <p>  The other instance to which I wish to refer occurred on 18 July last when representatives from the NTA were before the committee.  I asked about BusConnects.  The eye of that storm at the moment is in Dublin but, as has been said, it is due to go nationwide in the fullness of time.  There was no engagement with people with disabilities or their representative organisations until two days before the meeting in question.  That engagement happened because a person with a disability on a national disability inclusion strategy committee pushed for it.  The horse was well gone by then.  I am not sure if it was 60 or 80 buses, I forget the exact number, but they had been ordered from Wrightbus in Ballymena, delivered, paid for and liveried.  Everything had been done.  The day before the meeting, people with disabilities, visual impairments, physical impairments and hearing impairments got their first chance to look at those buses and point out a number of things.  The committee was told that some of the things could be resolved but the solutions were being retrofitted to something that should already have been done.  There has been a disability access committee in the Department since the 1980s.  This is not new.  Some 20 years ago, 100 buses came into the fleet thanks to an Exchequer grant of &pound;1.5 million.  That was unprecedented at the time.  Not one of those buses was accessible.  Now, 20 years later, the same thing is happening.  The consultant appointed to the BusConnects project was not asked by the Department, the NTA or whomever, if he or she had any experience of providing accessible public transport systems.</p> <p>  Those are my reasons for saying that I have no confidence in the NTA.  I do not see any change.  Such an important body was being dismissive, I will use that term, because it could not even indicate or provide an estimate regarding the number of disabled people with mobility impairments who currently have a single bus journey from start to finish but who will have to take a second bus as a result of BusConnects being put in place.  I refer to the number of people who would have to get off one bus and onto a second.  We could ask the drivers on the routes and I am sure they could nearly tell us passengers' names and where they get on and off.  It is quite dismissive of the whole project Ireland has taken on.  I would be interested in any comment the Department has to make on that point.</p> <p>  Wheelchair accessibility is available on a number of Bus &Eacute;ireann coaches on the Expressway regional service.  I will qualify that by saying that it is when the services operate the way they should and to the 24-hour rule, etc.  The number of routes is limited, however, due to constraints with accessible bus stops.  This has already been touched on.  The introduction of additional fully accessible routes is dependent on the production of suitably accessible bus stops.  Each wheelchair-accessible coach has one wheelchair space which must be booked 24 hours in advance using the reservation system.  There are still routinely issues.  It sticks in my craw that members of the public still have to give 24 hours' notice to use a public bus or train but that is the case.  When they do that, they still have the fingers on both hands crossed that the bus, when it gets there, will be accessible.  Even if they get to where they are going, they then have a bigger plight wondering if they will get home.  That is reality for people with mobility impairments.  There are many different issues but the coaches are now accessible.  The figure of 86% was mentioned.  There is still the issue of the bus stops along the routes.  I will return to that in a moment.</p> <p>  There are six Expressway routes that are wheelchair accessible. The routes in question are Dublin to Belfast, Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Letterkenny and Waterford to Cork.</p> <p>  I want to start with, believe or not,</p><p> All but one of the seven public service obligation, PSO, routes serve Dublin and the Dublin hinterland.  The one that does not runs from Galway to Ballina.  I refer to the routes from Navan to Dublin, Navan to DCU, Trim to Dublin, Drogheda to Blanchardstown and Dublin to Kells.  There is a strong pull into and around Dublin city.  There is an equity issue here, and other committee members have raised that in other ways.  Whether it is in regard to people with disabilities or others, there is a huge drag in and around Dublin.  I can understand that, but those of us involved in public policy have to create a counter-drag running the other way so that people can move around.</p><p> The Chair raised the N24.  We need the Saw Doctors to do something about the N25 and the N24.  I know the N24 well.  I come from Tipperary town.  There was a big protest in Tipperary at the weekend.  A greater number of people than the town's population came out and protested about jobs and other issues.  The state of roads and the lack of a bypass were some of those issues.  Public transport is not just about transport.  It is about people's social and economic lives.  On the outskirts of that town, there is a rail junction, Limerick Junction, which horizontally and vertically links Dublin, Cork, Limerick, the area beyond it and Waterford.  That town is dying on its knees.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and agencies under its aegis could do some very practical things.  They could provide the bypass, address the state of roads in and around the town and make strategic use of the fact that north, south, east and west are connected through Limerick Junction.</p><p> Finally, I wish to ask some very specific questions connected to some of the things I have raised already.  What level of engagement does the Department have with local authorities throughout the country with regard to the creation of wheelchair accessible bus stops?  That is part of the conundrum.  The whole fleet could be accessible, but the bus stops in rural and regional Ireland must also be accessible.  Local authorities bear a responsibility too.  What percentage of the LocalLink fleet is wheelchair accessible?  Has there been any progress in inserting a protocol to the effect that no new public service licences will be issued to operators unless they have a 100% accessible fleet?  It is unfair to the public purse and the public service that we are licensing private operators while the public transport operator has at least one hand tied behind its back.  A private operator can just rock up with an inaccessible bus.  Quite apart from people with disability issues I do not see the sense in that.  Obviously my concern is for people with disabilities.  Can the officials revert to the committee with figures on disability awareness training undertaken by Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann and LocalLink staff and on how often refresher training is delivered?  Go raibh maith agat.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

There is a considerable level of State investment in providing rural transport now and in the future.  There are several motivations for that, one of which might broadly be termed the green agenda, that is, a policy direction towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches to life in Ireland.</p> <p>  On the question of the public transport fleet and the type of fleet it is appropriate to bring forward, let us start by looking at emissions.  Transport emissions account for 20% of Ireland's emissions.  Just 1% of that is public transport.  It is very low.  One could ask if it matters whether it is made greener.  As some of the members of the committee have correctly pointed out, the standards of transport vehicles change as they move up the European emission standards classes.  We were at euro 3, euro 4 and euro 5.  Euro 6 is the norm nowadays.  Moving up the standards, vehicles become more sustainable and environmentally friendly and have fewer emissions and better exhaust profiles.  It is getting better all the time.</p> <p>  That said, a leadership role must be taken by the public transport sector.  While its own emissions might not be at a tipping point concerning Ireland's emissions generally, the fact that so much public funding goes into the area suggests that it should be leading rather than following.  Public transport should be demonstrating possibilities to other parts of the economy, particularly private personal car use and private business vehicle use, whether heavy-duty vehicles or lighter-duty goods vehicles are concerned.  There are initiatives around this.  A commitment has been made in the national development plan that by the middle of next year there will be no more purchases of diesel-only fleet for urban public transport services.  That sends a very strong signal.  To support that, not just in regard to immediate purchases but throughout the coming period, the Department is researching these issues internationally, looking at evidence from other jurisdictions, what they have done, how they have got on and the experience they have had.  We are examining whether other jurisdictions have taken a straight route or done about turns on the way.  In addition to that and to hearing from the manufacturers, we want to test it for ourselves.  We want to test the technology on our roads, on hilly and flat bus routes and on routes where a vehicle has to stop ten times going down a street because of traffic, traffic lights or whatever.  That is a piece of work the Department has commissioned.  A set of trials will be rolled out.  They will start within a few weeks, certainly before the end of the year, and they will run for a fixed number of weeks.  </p></speech>

What does she mean by that?  Will the Department be buying diesel-electric vehicles or electric-only vehicles after that?  A few weeks of trials do not test anything about how a vehicle performs.  The battery performance of electric vehicles must be tested for three years.  I presume Ms Hanlon is aware that the transport budget will need to accommodate an automatic 20% rise in fuel costs.  If the Department buys biodiesel or electric-diesel buses or vehicles with two different types of fuel, its budget will fuel eight buses instead of ten.  That is going by the prices.  Has a budget been laid out?  Costs are 20% higher.  Is Ms Hanlon confident the Department will not be buying a pig in a bag?  I have had machinery all my life and I know that weeks of use do not test something.</p><p>Things should be tested for three years or perhaps five years in order to find out whether they are going to rob or make a person.</p></speech>

Alternative fuel technologies and different types of buses are more expensive than conventional diesel buses at the moment, so they will cost more.  The Government is aware of that, and has been aware of that since it made its commitment to move away from diesel-only buses.  We have not started to prescribe the precise technologies to be purchased.  I was trying to explain that there are horses for courses in this.  A number of technologies are available, for example, hybrid electric vehicles, being part electric and part diesel, fully electric, either via battery or by plug-in, hydrogen vehicles and CNG, or compressed natural gas-powered vehicles.  A range of buses will be tested in the trials mentioned to see which are suited to particular types of routes.  We want to find out whether the technology appropriate for hilly terrain is also appropriate for driving in flat areas or in congested urban areas where one is starting and stopping regularly.  This is not the be all and end all.  It is only one component of the research we are doing, but I am talking about it because it will be done over the next few weeks.  We will run these different types of buses under simulated conditions on real Irish bus routes.  We are not talking about bus routes in a foreign city that we are being told about by manufacturers, but rather we will find out for ourselves and actually measure what is coming from the tailpipe.</p> <p>  This is a practical move by the Department which will support the trial and testing of innovative solutions where we just do not know the absolute, definitive best answer, and no one else can give us the answer.  Members of the committee are raising very real points about this approach.  Considerable experience has been built up internationally, but it is not entirely conclusive.  We are trying to add to it with our own analysis and understanding and to help inform decisions so that better purchasing decisions are made over time.  Indeed, we expect technologies to develop further as we go into the future, so we do not expect that we will definitively come up with the correct answer at a particular point in time which will forever after be the approach we slavishly taken.</p></speech>

A euro 6 engine has been proven, without a doubt, to be the same as gas in terms of emissions at the moment.  I am sure it will be tested by the Department as part of its testing process.  Why are the gas engines being tested while the euro 6 engines are being ruled out?  Perhaps the euro 7 will be even better than gas.  Why has that decision been made?</p></speech>

We will measure not only the carbon emissions but also the emissions of nitrous oxide, sulphur oxide emissions and the particulate matter.  There are impacts on two fronts, and we want to try to get measures on both.  One is the impact on climate, which largely comes from carbon, and the other is the impact on air quality.  Air quality impacts are more acute in areas where there is congestion and places where there is a higher proximity to people and buildings.  Technologies, which might not cause the same impact on air quality in rural areas, might have a larger impact on air quality in urban areas.</p></speech>

Everybody is talking about balanced regional development but we will not get that if a company is struggling or a businessman is behind the 35X but when he is trying to get to Castlebar, Waterford, Donegal or anywhere in Ireland.  I spoke to a person who met their boss from America and who hired a helicopter to bring them to Donegal because they were afraid that if they were on the road too long, the boss would pull the investment.  It is about jobs in these areas.  I do not know why we cannot make the decision.  It is our business, as public representatives, to bring in something to ensure that we have dual carriageways.  I am not looking for a motorway everywhere but a road on which one can overtake with some comfort and not be stuck behind something all day.</p> <p>  Under the transport regulations, it is illegal to drive a tractor on the hard shoulder so one has to stay on the road and block everything.  Frustration builds and people take risks by overtaking at the wrong time, which leads to crashes.  I do not know why, for the sake of the extra few euro it costs to purchase land compulsorily, we do not have a structure north, south, east and west to tie the A5 at Aughnacloy into the M1.  We need a vision so that everyone from Donegal to the south of Wexford and Kerry has the opportunity to bring industry to their regions.

The M3 is great down to Virginia, when it runs into the bog.  On the N4, one gets to Mullingar and then runs into the bog.  That is also the case with the N5.  The N6, N7, N8 and the N9-N10 have been done and the N11 is almost done.  All that remains to be done are the Waterford to Cork and Waterford to Limerick routes.  Cork to Limerick will be a dual carriageway and will be done, as will Cork to Killarney and back to Adare, by which time virtually the whole south of the country will be done, with a bit more to do in Wexford.  Then we will go into the black hole of Ireland, which is from Tuam to Letterkenny.  One way to measure a road is to count the 50 km/h speed limits on it.  If the Acting Chairman drives from Waterford to Limerick, he will see that a speed limit of 50 km/h applies on the final 16 km, which would drive one nuts.  The wear and tear on vehicles is phenomenal in such circumstances.  Does the Department think the Government made a good decision to forget about doing patches on the M6, the M7, the M8 and the M9 up to the Border but to do it all instead?</p></speech>

The N4 Mullingar to Longford road will probably be a dual carriageway.  There is also the N4 Carrick on Shannon to Dromod and the N25 to New Ross.  The N11 public private partnership project from Gorey to Enniscorthy is being done, as is the N30 off it.  The N24, from Waterford to Cahir to Limerick Junction, is to be appraised by TII.  The cross-section has not been decided yet and is still in its early stages.  The N25 Waterford to Glenmore is also to be appraised under the national development plan, as is Carrigtwohill to Midleton.  The N22 from Ballyvourney to Macroom was mentioned earlier, as was the Westport job, and they will start construction next year</p></speech>

We have the implementation plan from our accessibility consultative committee and this contains all the actions we are required to take in respect of public transport arising from the national disability inclusion strategy, comprehensive employment strategy and so on.  It has been published on our website and there are a lot of actions in there.  There have been successes recently but a lot of retrofitting is to be done relating to disability access.</p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned an issue regarding engagement with the NTA in the context of matters such as delivery of buses and so on.</p></speech>

We have held discussions with the NTA on it and the authority engaged with the National Disability Authority, as a result of which it was able to make changes to delivery, particularly in the context of visually impaired people.  The NTA is also looking to appoint a dedicated accessibility officer, which it does not have at the moment.  This will be useful to do.  It is looking to provide for better engagement with disability sector.  We have a disability and accessibility committee and each of the transport operating companies has one.  Perhaps the NTA needs one too.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about bus stops.  These are an issue and they are part of our retrofit programme.  We have a significant capital programme over the next number of years to deal with the antiquated infrastructure which we have in some cases, and it is being rolled out on a route by route basis.  We have done Dublin to Donegal and Dublin to Letterkenny.  The NTA plan is to have accessible bus stops in 43 towns with populations of over 5,000 people by 2021.  It will mean one such stop in each direction so there will be a total of 86 accessible bus stops.</p> <p>  Approximately 69% of LocalLink services are defined as fully or partially accessible.  The NTA is now retendering in respect of the more than 1,000 routes on the LocalLink service.</p><p>One of the conditions it is putting on that is that all those services must be wheelchair accessible within two years.  The existing services must remain accessible; the other 31% must be accessible within two years.</p><p> On commercial operators, as the Senator mentioned, this is certainly an issue on coaches.  Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services have to be wheelchair accessible.  There is no requirement on commercial bus operators to provide wheelchair accessible coaches.</p></speech>

The NTA will publish proposals for consultation shortly which will set out minimum accessibility standards for commercial public transport services.

That will guide future ways of dealing with the licensing of commercial operators and whether there should be a requirement on them to provide accessible coaches.</p></speech>

This issue will lead to LocalLink prices increasing.  Buses must be wheelchair accessible, which costs &euro;6,000 .  The cost is &euro;12,000 for most buses now.  The cost is down to the length of the vehicle.  It does not have to be used for bringing Yanks around the country and, depending on the length of the bus, the operator will get back the VAT on that cost.  Can the Department not communicate with the Department of Finance with a view to offering some incentive in regard to claiming back the VAT?  First, we would have a better standard of bus and, second, they will be more accessible for people with disabilities.  The only criteria currently in that regard is the length of the bus and if it is an inch one way or the other, the operator is out.</p></speech>

From what the Deputy is saying, however, this is an issue that affects the people who are trying to provide transport services and, therefore, it is real in their world.  It happens to be transport but it is VAT law, which is tax.  It is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and the rules are set by the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

We must flag the fact that there needs to be a policy to the effect that services will be provided late in the evening.  We will be commemorating the centenary of the First D&aacute;il on 21 January 2019.  The general election took place on 15 December 1918 and the results were not in until the end of the year, with Christmas in between, yet those involved managed to set up a D&aacute;il, with translation and stenography services and everything else in place, within 21 days.  That monumental decision 100 years ago will be commemorated by this institution in January.  I approached Bus &Eacute;ireann on the issue of getting late night services to Carraroe, although it could have been to any Carraroe in the country, because the last bus leaves Galway at 6 p.m.  In early spring, Bus &Eacute;ireann put a proposal to the NTA, and the service was meant to be in place in September.  Bus &Eacute;ireann assured me it was ready to rock and roll.  If the first D&aacute;il could be set up within 21 days, will our guests explain why, as I have been informed, it will take until January to put this service in place?  Bus &Eacute;ireann has just put in a revised timetable.  Will somebody explain to me what has gone wrong in the past 100 years?  We could set up the First D&aacute;il in 21 days and we cannot reconfigure a bus timetable to provide a vital service, which has taken eight, nine or ten months to set up.  Something is wrong in this country.  Nothing seems to get done.</p></speech>

We can pick up on it.  I made comments on disability awareness training and I sought a response.  The current 24-hour waiting period when booking wheelchair-accessible transport is not acceptable.  People still routinely ring up to book that and it does not happen for them even though a bus or train with the necessary ramps is available.  We need to have a zero-tolerance policy in terms of people booking wheelchair-accessible transport 24 hours in advance who still cannot get that bus or train.</p></speech>

I understand there has not been a resolution in respect of that matter.  We engaged with all of the agencies but none of them is taking ownership of it.  Do the officials from the Department have any information with regard to finding a resolution in respect of that issue?  This is a primary railway route from Galway to Limerick - two of our main cities identified under Project Ireland 2040 - and it is unacceptable that it is being shut down due to flooding.  If the officials have some information on that, we would appreciate their response.  We will hear final answers now, and I thank the officials.</p></speech>

I will go backwards through the questions.</p> <p>  We are aware of the issue of flooding at Ballycar.  Progress seems to have been made on it in that the bodies involved are working together with Clare County Council.  Irish Rail is involved, as are some consultants who are looking at the issue.  The issue seems to be one of flooding in the area.  It affects the rail line but it also affects other things in the area.  They are considering what would be the best approach to bring forward.  It is heartening that matters seem to be moving in that those involved are working together, co-operating and looking jointly at identifying the best way forward.</p><p>We await the outcome of that.  </p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae asked about the ages of school buses being 20 years or older depending on whether they were operated by or on contract to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The school bus system is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills and his Department.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates it for the Minister as his agent.  It is not a matter in which our Department has a role or knowledge.</p><p> I do not know the answer about the question on test centres for heavy vehicles and buses.  We can find out.

It is out to tender for assistance with economic expertise and technical help to compile a business case.  We expect it will be a couple of months.  Alongside the business case, which comprises the technical financial procedures that are required in accordance with the public spending code, Irish Rail also has been told to carry out a consultation.

We asked what was the best thing to do and it was to hunker down and keep the existing extensive network running.  Now that more capital funding is coming forward and being profiled under the national development plan, we can do that.  We have reached the steady state of keeping the existing networks going and we can undertake targeted additional projects.  Several of those projects are specifically set out in the national development plan, such as the metro, BusConnects and the DART expansion, but there is also scope for more.  What is happening in respect of the western rail corridor is that the Government has told Irish Rail to do an up-to-date robust business case and return with it.  When Irish Rail returns with that, in accordance with the programme for Government commitment there will be an independent review and peer assessment of the Irish Rail case because there is a significant degree of dispute as to the robustness and quality of figures that are being put forward by different parties.</p></speech>

I asked how much EU money had been funnelled through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for road and rail transport projects in the period from 2000 to 2010.  Instead of giving me the answer, I was referred to every agency within the Department's remit, all of which give the answer in different ways.  I now have to sit down and spend a week trying to put all the stuff together.  Is it possible to find out how much money was channelled through the Department from the European Union for road and rail infrastructure projects in the period from 2000 to 2010?</p></speech>

If we are undertaking projects, we fund them up-front from the Exchequer and apply for EU funding afterwards.  One can obtain approval for the allocation of EU funding, but one would not hang on in waiting for it.</p></speech>

As they build, pay contractors or people who undertake the project, they fill in claim forms and send them to the European Union and the money comes through in due course.  As they have already been funded from the Exchequer through the Department's Vote, the funds typically flow back into the Exchequer.  They do not necessarily flow through the Department.  That is what happens in the main, with a small number of exceptions.</p></speech>

Exactly as Ms Hanlon says, money is given to the LEADER group and money comes back from the European Union when claims are made every quarter or six months.  One then has at the bottom of the Estimate appropriations-in-aid.  I could have received appropriations-in-aid, but there were other things thrown in which were not EU moneys and I could not desegregate them.  Surely all of the EU payments came back into the Department as appropriations-in-aid.</p></speech>

It sticks in their craw that they have to give a day's or four hours' notice.  There is no excuse for it not working every time.  Who will crack the whip with the public companies?  To say it comes back to the disabled person is like saying it is up to an individual to keep complaining every time it does not work.  The public system has picked the required number of hours, whether it be 24 or four.  We have not picked it and would pick zero.  We would rock up and get on the bus or train just like anyone else.  The public system has put in place that backstop.</p></speech>
