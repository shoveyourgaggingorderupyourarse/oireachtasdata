Apologies have been received from the Chairman, Deputy Fleming, and Deputy Pat Deering.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting on 3 May will be ready next week.  Are there any matters arising?</p></speech>

It relates to Caranua.  I will not delay the meeting but I wish to raise it now.  I will also raise it again at the next meeting.  It is about the review being carried out in respect of eligibility for the Caranua scheme.  I asked a series of questions and the original answer I received was that an economist was going to be seconded from another body to carry out the initial phase of the review and that it was to be published.  That has not happened, as far as I can see.  We are now told that the second or some other part of the review will be published in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It was confirmed to the committee that one in four workers is on a bogus self-employment contract.  An issue that was not raised, and it was raised with me later by a number of staff who contacted me to tell me they are in that position, is that there is also a potential loss to the State.  If these people are being paid as contractors, RT&Eacute; does not pay employer's pay-related social insurance, PRSI.  Can we write to the Revenue Commissioners and ask them what is the difference-----</p></speech>

We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.</p><p>No. 1271A is correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 10 May, providing briefing for the meeting which was scheduled for today but has been postponed until a later date.  We note that.  No. 1288A is from Mr. Kieran Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.  No. 1290A is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.</p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 1266B is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 1 May 2018, providing a note on non-resident high wealth cases and how the Revenue Commissioners monitor their compliance with residency rules.  We note that.  No. 1268B is from Mr. John O'Sullivan, Commissioner of Valuation, dated 2 May 2018, providing information on the failed tender process to procure external services for the proposed independent review of the Reval 2017 projects.  That is noted.  No. 1272B is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 3 May 2018, providing additional information as requested at the meeting of 19 April 2018, including an explanatory note on the different models for measuring of national output and income, that is, gross domestic product, GDP, gross national product, GNP, gross national income, GNI and modified gross national interest, GNI*, an update on the Apple escrow fund, Ireland's contribution to the EU budget and components of the national debt figure.  That is noted.  No. 1273 is from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 3 May 2018, providing information on funding and governance models of Benefacts.  It was very interesting and I noted that.</p><p> Category C is correspondence from and relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Nos. 1265 and 1274C, are correspondence received from an individual regarding allegations against Novartis.  We dealt with this matter last year and wrote to the Department of Health on the matter.  A reply from the Secretary General stated that the information had been forwarded to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Medical Council and the HSE.  I suggest that we write back to the Department for an update.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Nos. 1279C and 1282C are from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director at the HSE, dated 9 May.  In the first item he states that Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting.  Obviously, this has been superseded so we will move on.  No. 1280C is from Deputy Cullinane in regard to Mr. Tony O'Brien.  Again that has been superseded.</p><p> No. 1281C is from Deputy MacSharry, dated 2 May 2018, in regard to a case against Department of Finance on liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  We discussed this briefly last week and are formally noting it now.  We will discuss it in private later.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 1283C, dated 9 May 2018, is from Ms Geraldine Finn of the National Cancer Registry stating that the director, Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr, is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting as requested as she is out of the country.  Can we note this item?  It is noted.  I spoke with the National Cancer Registry and was told she was out of the country.  I asked if there was anyone else it could put forward and it said there was no one else and that if we wanted to correspond with it, we could do so.  I explained that being present today would be far more beneficial, given the dynamic of the situation and the topic but the organisation is not in a position to send somebody.  The director general is away, which is noted and is of concern.  I note that we have now made the decision to bring the National Cancer Register in next week, so it has enough notice to send somebody forward.</p><p> Item No. 4 is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  One account and statement has been received from the Irish Film Board and it has a clear audit opinion.  Can we note this?  It is noted.</p><p> We will move on to the work programme.  The secretariat circulated a note regard to our upcoming meeting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and a copy of the committee's draft discussion document on corporation tax.  The committee will have to agree on the report and I propose we meet in private session to finalise the report the week after next.</p></speech>

The clerk to the committee said at the time that the likely date for that was 14 June.  I do not see any date for that, so have we tied down that date?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.32" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Mr. Jim Breslin (Secretary General, Department of Health), Mr. Tony O'Brien (Director General, Health Service Executive) and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen (Director, State Claims Agency) called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#E00300"><p>We are discussing matters related to the CervicalCheck revelations.  In particular, we will examine the management of legal costs and the policy on open disclosure.  These matters were included in the work programme of the Committee of Public Accounts to be considered in July, but as a result of the matters that have come to light, members agreed that they should be dealt with more urgently.</p> <p>  We are joined from the Department of Health by Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General and Accounting Officer for the HSE; Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, and Ms Mary Jackson, principal officer.  From the HSE we are joined by Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general; Mr. Damian McCallion, national director, national screening service; Dr. Philip Crowley, national director, quality improvement division; Mr. Liam Woods, national director, acute hospital services; and Ms Maura Lennon, head of legal services.  From the State Claims Agency we are joined by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director; Mr. Cathal O&rsquo;Keefe, head of clinical risk; and Ms Ann Duffy, senior clinical risk manager.  We also invited representatives of the National Cancer Registry.  It was done at short notice earlier in the week, but its director is not available and it was not in a position to send anybody else.</p><p>The registry will be invited to join us again next week.<br/><br/>I welcome the witnesses.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can expect to be, should be and will be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in line with the Oireachtas witness protocol.  I will ensure that happens.<br/><br/>There were to be a number of opening statements from Mr. Breslin, Mr. Breen and Mr. O'Brien, but we will take those documents as read in order to save time.</p></speech>

I have seen so much of Mr. O'Brien this week, I thought there was a statement.  Is it agreed that we will take Mr. Breslin and Mr. Breen's statements as read?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The director general of the HSE and Mr. McCallion will have to leave in an hour and a half, as the cervical cancer issues with which we are dealing are live ones and they must travel to Limerick.  Now that the meeting has commenced, we will allow a round of questioning for the first hour and a half to the Deputies who are present.  There is an order in which they will ask questions.  They can ask questions of any of the witnesses, but they should be aware that Mr. O'Brien and Mr. McCallion will be gone in an hour and a half.  The first two members will get seven minutes each.

I would ask him to do it as a matter of urgency.  In my 16 years in the Oireachtas, it was the most harrowing interview that I have heard about any crisis.  A lady we heard about yesterday naturally gave an emotional interview this morning where the presenter even became emotional.  Any of us who listened would have been emotional.  She stated: "I tried to do everything right, by, you know, breastfeeding, and being a full-time mum".  She had got a clear result, but "now I'm dying [...] And I don't even know if my little baby is going to remember me."</p> <p>  In light of statements like that and the principle of accountability, does Mr. O'Brien not feel it is untenable for him not to resign his position?</p></speech>

I am just responding to his question.  It is always very tragic when any young person receives a diagnosis of terminal cancer.  That will always be the case.  The Deputy's question is based on a presumption that there is some action that has been taken that has led to that diagnosis, but that is far from established.  As has been explained in other forums, the reason we have a cervical screening programme, which is a screening rather than a diagnostic programme, is to limit the number of such cases, but it cannot eliminate them.</p></speech>

If the contraceptives it manufactured were faulty, the matter was all over "60 Minutes" and he as a board member called on the CEO to attend a board meeting and explain the situation, could Mr. O'Brien see himself as a non-executive director of a commercial entity telling the CEO not to worry about it, that what was needed was a full investigation and that, at some stage down the road in the never-never when the share price was in the ground, the board may or may not feel that the CEO was responsible and needed to go?  I put it to Mr. O'Brien that, in the private sector, he would have been gone months ago as soon as this issue emerged.  Here we were this morning listening to a harrowing story on "Morning Ireland", a story that has every woman in the country - my sisters, my nieces, my neighbours, my friends and my work colleagues - terrified, but the only response from the person in command is nothing.</p></speech>

I will get to that in a few moments.  That is my job.  Mr. O'Brien has a job to do as director general of the HSE.  As public representatives it is our job to hold him to account.  That is why we are here and that is what we will do.  That is what I will do.  I will do my job.  My first question for Mr. O'Brien is; what is the difference between a false negative test result and an incorrect reading of a smear test?</p></speech>

To explain, the process of smear taking involves a pathologist, or a technician in the first instance, who examines a sample through a microscope and makes a subjective judgment of subtle changes and abnormalities.  The reality is that it is not a perfect science.  That is part of the reason the organisation of any proper organised screening programme, such as the one we introduced in this country in 2008, builds in mechanisms to try to take account of the known limitations of the test.  It builds in mechanisms to monitor the quality of the operation of that programme when it is in operation.</p></speech>

I know it is a complex area but my question is a very simple one.  Mr. O'Brien is telling us that this not a perfect science.  We accept that.  We accept that it is not infallible and that is not a diagnosis.  We accept that there is approximately a 30% failure rate, which could include false negatives.  However, there is a difference between misreading a smear result and something not being evident.  What is the difference between an incorrect reading of a smear test and something which is simply not detectable, which I would imagine would be a false negative?  Is there a difference between the two?</p></speech>

When the serious incident management team did its review of the audit it established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with and that 175 cases received an interpretation different from the original smear result.  Based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation.  My problem with Mr. O'Brien is that he is putting up a straw man argument that this process in not infallible, a fact which we all accept.  He is putting up a straw man argument that he cannot be held to account because of the actions of individuals in his organisation.  He accused Deputy MacSharry of trying, in the case of Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, to create the impression that the false diagnosis had some consequence on her being diagnosed with cervical cancer.</p></speech>

That was a systemic decision taken by the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien is responsible for systemic decisions taken within his organisation.  The real scandal here was the response to that systemic failure and that women were not told.  Mr. O'Brien has heard that Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  It was very harrowing interview.  This is a woman who had to tell her five children that she is going to die.  Obviously she is very emotional.  She told Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, who raised this issue in the D&aacute;il yesterday, that she is more angry than she is worried about her death.  It is a very personal tragedy for her.</p> <p>  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was told in 2013 that her smear test was normal.  Three years later, following a routine smear test, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The audit of the 2013 result showed that, in Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na's case, the first indications of cancer were already there.  She was never told.  It was the same for Vicky Phelan and Irene Teap.  We also heard from Stephen Teap.  I would imagine it was the same for many more women.  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, Ms Phelan and Mr. Teap have all asked Mr. O'Brien to resign because, unlike him, they understand accountability and that this was a systemic failure.</p> <p>  The reason Mr. O'Brien is paid the salary he is paid is because the buck stops with him.  He is responsible for systemic failures.  That is why he is in this position, why the post carries a heavy responsibility and why he is on the salary he is on.  He is responsible for the actions of the corporate body of the HSE.  I will say one more thing and then I will let Mr. O'Brien come back in.</p><p>Mr. O'Brien yesterday described the director general as the one person who must be personally accountable for every failure or mistake of 140,000 individuals who work in the health service and stated that that is not the basis for accountability.  Nobody is asking Mr. O'Brien to be personally accountable for the actions of 140,000 individuals.  We ask him to be accountable for a clear and systemic failure in the HSE not to communicate that information to 208 women who today are very angry.  The failure to communicate is not the only matter that is causing hysteria.  The hysteria has been caused by the systemic failures in Mr. O'Brien's organisation.  The fact that, even today, Mr. O'Brien does not recognise that there were systemic failures and that he should take responsibility for that rings alarm bells for me.  There is no doubt that Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Stephen Teap are correct that Mr. O'Brien should step down.  That would be the first step in he and the HSE taking accountability for systemic failures, although not responsibility for the actions of individuals.</p></speech>

We have clearly stated that the communication should have occurred and have identified that when the serious incident management team examined the 209 cases, only 48 had been informed prior to the establishment of that team.

The people who chose whether to communicate or not communicate the information made a decision not to do so.  Those people, who are clinicians, were playing with people's lives in not so communicating.  What has Mr. O'Brien done about that in terms of the chain of command?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#H02500"><p>As I stated, I will listen to the interview when I have an opportunity to do so.  An obstetrician or any treating clinician would be correct to say that had the test that was reported negative been reported positive at the time, there would have been a referral and earlier treatment and the outcome may have been very different.  That does not relate to the failure to communicate and does not imply that the outcome would have been different but for that failure.  The failure to communicate only arose after the diagnosis of cancer because it was that diagnosis which triggered the review that was subsequently not communicated.</p> <p>  I am advised by treating clinicians that receiving knowledge of a prior false negative after a person has been diagnosed and is in treatment would not change the course of that treatment.  However, it is clear that had the screening programme picked up an individual's cancer three years earlier, the programme would have done what it is designed to do and has done in 50,000 other cases and brought the person into a treatment pathway which could have prevented cancer or further consequences from developing.  What the obstetrician stated is correct.</p></speech>

We were considering it in a very cold way because we are looking at the contingent liabilities.  However, we are examining those because they show the culture in an organisation.  What we are being told about open disclosure and what is happening in practice are very different.  According to the document provided by Mr. O'Brien, in January or February approximately 20,000 of the 140,000 HSE staff had been trained in open disclosure.  Not all staff will directly impact on patients because there are many ancillary staff and sections 38 and 39 organisations and so on.  Do we have open disclosure or not?  What is Mr. O'Brien's viewpoint on voluntary, as opposed to mandatory, open disclosure?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the decision in the CervicalCheck programme following the audit was that the results should be communicated.  It is clear that the failure was one of not following through on that decision.  Far too much time appears to have been taken up in discussions and possibly disputes about who should do the communicating.  However, I have seen correspondence which does not involve arguments that people should not be told but, rather, discussion of who should tell.  That is not an acceptable explanation for what happened.</p><p>In fairness to those involved, I have not seen evidence that there was a decision not to communicate, but certainly there was a failure to communicate.</p></speech>

What we have heard and seen in the past two weeks points to a failure to follow through on a decision to communicate, rather than an active decision not to communicate.  That, of course, will also be looked at in the scoping review.</p></speech>

If somebody is bouncing emails about whose decision it is, there is a decision being taken.  The decision being taken is not to communicate if the decision is being postponed.  I find it very difficult to accept Mr. O'Brien's explanation.</p></speech>

Given that the decision to communicate was made, that communication should have occurred.  As I have said here and elsewhere, it appears that far too much time was spent on trying to resolve a dispute without bringing it to a final conclusion.  Had it been brought to a final conclusion, clearly the results would have been communicated.</p></speech>

I do not think it is fair for the director general to leave it at that.  In the circular discretion was given to GPs.  They were given discretion to decide whether they should communicate the results; therefore, it is not correct to say the HSE, or the body, did not take a decision not to inform the women.  Discretion was given to GPs, as Mr. O'Brien knows.</p></speech>

The open disclosure policy is pretty clear.  It creates significant obligations, but in many jurisdictions throughout the world it is reported that in the absence of mandation or a legal duty of candour, policies will only get someone so far.  I am on the record as saying and remain of the view that open disclosure-duty of candour should be on a statutory basis.  Yesterday in this room the Minister gave an indication of his intention to do so.</p></speech>

It also references care, compassion, trust and learning.  In that regard, will Mr. O'Brien explain how this matter was not brought to his attention?

It was not until 30 April 2018 that the HSE changed that position and said that each hospital group was required to tell each of the 162 women.

Did the alarm bells not go off for Mr. O'Brien?  He is admitting now there was dysfunction within the system.  How come it took so long?  It took Vicky Phelan to bring a case to court and to win.  There were attempts to silence her during that case.  I know it had nothing to do with the HSE but was due to a foreign company.  Did no one within the entire HSE see that there was a dysfunction and step in to try to stop it?  Is anyone, including Mr. O'Brien, responsible for what is going on?</p></speech>

This case went into legal process, I believe, in January and was concluded in April.  There would have been opportunities before and during that case for someone to recognise the seriousness of what was happening and to escalate it to me.  They did not.  In a different forum, many of the people who might have escalated it to me confirmed that they had not.  They had nothing to gain by confirming that; in fact, they potentially had  things to lose.  They confirmed that they had not escalated it to me.  Because it was not escalated to me, there was no potential for any alarm bell to ring in my head.  Had I been aware of it, alarm bells would have rung.  I said to a different committee yesterday, at which Deputy Kelly was present, that had I known that there were a significant number of women who had gone through the same audit process and who had not been made aware of their results, the first thing I would have done would have been to make sure they were aware of those results so that, by the time this did come into the public domain in the way it did, there would have been no cause or reason for other women to be concerned that they might be about to be told.  That is one of the most regrettable aspects of this whole case.</p></speech>

It is vital that the women of Ireland who are in crisis at the moment understand how both the HSE and the functions within it work.</p></speech>

The immediate focus here has been as follows.  First, to make sure we understood the totality of the nature of the audit and, as the Deputy is aware, we learned during the process issues to do with that.  Second, to make sure there were effective processes in place to communicate with all of those who were the subject of the audit.  We have got, I think, to 201 of 209.  There is challenge establishing communication with others who may be out of the jurisdiction or on leave but we will pursue that continuously.  Third, to deal with all of the persons who, as a result of concerns or worries, are making contact with the helpline.  We are arranging for each of them to have a detailed, over-the-telephone medical consultation.  That is taking quite some time.  We are also carrying through a number of data check processes to ensure that we have a full picture on this.  That has to be the priority at this time.  Other things will follow in due course and we also now have the appointment by the Government of Dr. Scally to carry out the scoping exercise, with which we will co-operate with fully.</p></speech>

We all know about the difficulty in getting access.  Patient experience surveys carried out jointly by ourselves, HIQA and the Department of Health and published by HIQA show the way people feel about the services that they receive from the HSE.  The biggest challenge of course is one of access.  This situation aside, I believe that we are served very well by highly dedicated, professional and committed health service staff throughout the country.  That also goes for the staff of CervicalCheck and the screening programmes, who are as devastated as anybody by the circumstances that have now unfolded.</p></speech>

We are carrying out a specific case management review in this instance to ensure that the warning bells that did not sound in relation to this case will sound in the future.  We will be working closely with our colleagues in the State Claims Agency in relation to that.  All of those who are in charge of hospital groups and community health organisations are very much aware of the need to ensure that every step is being taken to assure the quality of services, recognising that the biggest challenge to the quality of our services actually is getting access to them, not the quality of care once a person is in.</p></speech>

Obviously it has been a very difficult two weeks for the health service.  On the national screening programme, from the HSE accounts, if we look at CervicalCheck, it seems to be operating in isolation.  It has its own website and its own register for all the details, the patients, etc.  When I look at the accounts for the HSE, I cannot see what the costs of outsourcing to laboratories are or what the cost of running the programme is.  That goes for the other screening programmes.  Are they all bulked into one area or what way is that derived from the accounts?</p></speech>

That is split up across the four programmes and there are some common elements to that.  One of the things that undoubtedly will be looked at, either through myself or through the other review process, will be whether there are opportunities for the programmes to perhaps work together more closely.  There is a common piece.  Approximately &euro;5 million of that is the national screening service as a whole and then each of the programmes has a budget underneath that.  The laboratory costs are in the order of about &euro;6.9 million per year spread across the different laboratories that provide the services.  At the moment, there is an overall national screening programme and there are four programmes underneath that.  Each of those has a budget but there is an overall budget of &euro;77.8 million.</p></speech>

However, my concern is that identifying risks in accounts is very difficult when we cannot see the figures.  The problem here is that for the different screening programmes, it is very hard for the reader to assess what is happening or to get a clear picture when we are not given the detail.  I think that does need to change in the future.</p> <p>  In terms of all the screening programmes that are under way in the health service, it was very strange to see the Minister for Health being handed information just before coming into the D&aacute;il to state that the National Cancer Registry had not liaised or reconciled with the CervicalCheck register in terms of having cases reviewed.  That showed huge concern at that stage.  Can Mr. O'Brien tell me if there have there been cross-checks done with the other screening programmes?  If there is another screening programme and someone does develop cancer, is there a cross-check done to check that those original tests are being held to the highest accountability and to ensure that they are being carried out correctly?</p></speech>

If one has two separate lists or two cohorts of patients, one of which has those who developed cancer but had gone through screening, then the original tests should be checked again for anomalies.  That is a basic thing that should happen with screening.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I think Deputy Cullinane was correct to identify and distinguish between the known shortcomings of all screening programmes which, unfortunately, will lead to a later diagnosis of cancer for patients who have not been detected in the screening programme, on the one hand, versus this failure to communicate in the aftermath of an audit process, which is really what this issue is actually about.</p></speech>

The reason the issue arose in respect of the D&aacute;il, as the Deputy referenced - the difficulty with which the Minister was faced - was that in the white heat of the process of the serious incident management team, what was communicated to the serious incident management team was that the audit had related to all cancers in that period, rather than that they had only related to cases notified in a particular way.  That is what led to the Minister, myself and colleagues in the Department believing that the audit was about a wider group of patients than it actually was.  We will get to the bottom of why that was communicated in that way.  There could be a number of reasons for it but clearly that was a significant issue for us giving rise to a difficulty for the Minister in having confidence in the information he was being given.  That was corrected as soon as the serious incident management team identified the problem on Tuesday afternoon and that very day, he clarified the matter in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

That is fair.  We will get the letter and we will go through it.  I would like to ask a quick question about the issue referred to by Deputy Burke.  As colleagues will know, I have discussed this matter with Mr. O'Brien at two committees - this committee and the health committee.  I have gone through it in the finance committee with the State Claims Agency and there have been debates in the D&aacute;il.  I have classified as a "bombshell" the fact that there was a difference between the cancer registry figures and the CervicalCheck figures.  The issue in relation to those two sets of figures - the fact that they relate to completely different catchments of women - has been detailed.  As part of the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, we will get details of what has transpired in respect of this other cohort of women.  Over a number of years, CervicalCheck attempted to ensure these figures were consistent and correlated.  Obviously, it failed.  In what aspect did it fail?  It is possible that the failure was not on its part.  In what aspect did those figures fail to come together?  I understand that similar issues do not exist across other screening programmes.  Can Mr. O'Brien confirm that?</p></speech>

In the case of the diabetic retinopathy screening programme, there is no relationship with the cancer registry so there is no requirement for exchange.  BowelScreen will operate in a similar way to BreastCheck.  There is no immediate issue there because it is at an early stage and because of the way cancer data is collected.  I do not want to comment on the efforts that were or were not made to resolve the issue of two-way data exchange over various periods of time because I am not sure of the details at this stage.</p></speech>

Okay.  Nobody is being held accountable.  This is a problem for me.  I will finish on this thread if I can.  I want to put on the record a communication that was received by Dr. Keith Swanick, who is also a Member of the Oireachtas, from one of his colleagues.  It reads:</p><blockquote>How can you and your colleagues stand over the cervical controversy.  We are inundated with requests for smears with no formal guidance even how to process them, how to claim remuneration.  We cannot offer any form of reassurance to any patient so all smears need to be repeated.  Can we trust the results of repeat smears? What's the lab they will be sent to? </blockquote> <p>I think this captures for me the reality here.  Mr. O'Brien has taken no action against any member of staff.  He has admitted he was not told things when he should have been.  We know there were system failures.  In calling for Mr. O'Brien's resignation, I have to say it may well go to Ministers, taoisigh and the head of the State Claims Agency for further calls of resignation.  Mr. O'Brien and the Ministers are commentators on a national crisis.  We have no leaders.  That is crystal clear.  Mr. O'Brien has admitted that no action has been taken against anybody.  There is nobody accountable.  Three weeks into the crisis, Mr. O'Brien is not even in a position to tell us who was supposed to tell him but did not do so.  There is a policy of sitting back and letting everything take its course.  The people and accountability come last.</p><p>The problem is that all of those here, most of the political establishment and it seems the Government served the system, not the people.  That is why I again appeal to Mr. O'Brien, in the interests of the women in Ireland, to show them what their taxes have purchased - accountability on their behalf.</p></speech>

One reason is this circular which, as we said, gave discretion to GPs.  At no point, at the time the circular was issued, did the HSE as a corporate body decide that all patients must or should be informed.  It is amazing that even today, as Mr. O'Brien sits here, he is not in a position to tell me exactly who drafted the circular and who the individuals were because I suspect that they are the same people to whom he referred in answer to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's question.  They are still working in organisation and, furthermore, now central to the examination being carried out and the solutions being put in place.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson said, "I was involved with the then clinical director of the screening programme in compiling it,"; therefore, he was responsible.  The circular gave three instructions.  I want Mr. O'Brien to take this in for one moment, as I am sure he has already.  The first instruction was that a copy of the audit be added to the patient's file;  to use clinical judgement in deciding whether patients should be informed and that if the patient had died, a note was to be added to the file.  That was a decision taken by the corporate body that is the HSE.  Imagine, that if somebody had died, a note was simply to be added to the file.  That is the systemic failure Mr. O'Brien is not prepared to accept.  He is not prepared to accept that that instruction clearly given and the circular represented a systemic failure.  How can it not be a systemic failure?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has come to the committee weeks after the scandal frightened the women of Ireland and days after a number of the women affected have asked him to stand down from his position.  From today, we know that Mr. O'Brien believes a number of individuals made mistakes, but he is not prepared to say who they are.  Even when it is pointed out to him who one of the individuals is, he is still not prepared to accept it, nor is he prepared to accept that a circular sent by the HSE, I imagine on HSE-headed paper, bearing the brand of the HSE, was sent by the organisation, not by individuals as individuals.  He is still sitting here not able to answer straight questions or to accept any accountability - whatever about responsibility, Mr. O'Brien is accountable - and not even prepared to accept that the issuing of the circular and the instructions given represented a systemic failure.</p> <p>  I may never have another chance to see Mr. O'Brien before the Committee of Public Accounts or in any forum.  I do not believe, given all his years of public service, all the years he has worked in the HSE, he does not understand it is a systemic failure.  Frankly, I do not believe he does not believe it was a systemic failure.</p></speech>

The communications strategy was to communicate with people who would be told that there had been a false negative in the past.  There was a catastrophic piece of communications work to be done.  Two separate things are happening in this case.  One is looking at the overall system and the level of error, while the communications strategy was only about communicating with people who would be told something very significant.  We know that one person, Vicky Phelan, went through the courts system - I understand there were more - and was not subject to a confidentiality agreement.  Where is the process between the HSE and the States Claims Agency in that regard?  I do not see it.  It is as if there are two parallel universes.  The fact that Vicky Phelan did not sign a confidentiality agreement has led to the issue being brought into the public arena.  How will Mr. O'Brien deal with the fact that he only learned from the news headlines that something as significant as this case was going through the courts?</p></speech>

That was said, but I want to be clear in the context of the Deputy's question.  It is also evident that the case proceeded quickly and that the judge commended all parties involved for their humanity.  Notwithstanding that, clearly there are lessons to be learned from the way the HSE participated in the process because matters that were in the public domain as a result of the legal process of discovery, had they been analysed more effectively in terms of the issues drawn from them within the HSE, they could have provided an additional route by which alarm bells would have rung and might have been escalated to me.  I have initiated a case review of the way in which the particular case was handled from beginning to end in order that we can improve the process.  I will ask the HSE's internal audit division to map out all of the steps and opportunities a different process might create for a speedier escalation and identification of issues at an earlier stage.</p></speech>

They were joined together by a discovery process.  The joining together of those pieces of information ought to have flagged the nature of the concerns that are now in the public domain.  That process did not do that.  It did not happen and I am intent on finding out how we can close that off.  While the ideal situation, of course, is that things do should not have to go to court, but at least when they do, the information is being assembled for that purpose ought to be interrogated to find out what are the wider issues that could be identified, and that is a process that we are engaged in.</p></speech>

Let me be clear.  I was made aware by a memo, which I will provide to the committee, of the fact that an audit had been concluded, and that there was a plan in place to communicate the results of that audit.  The memo itself provided reassurance to me that there was an effective plan in place.  I was never subsequently informed that anything had gone wrong in the process of communication.  The first I knew that this was the case was when I heard media reports relating to the Vicky Phelan case.</p></speech>

My question was in relation to accountability and what Mr. O'Brien was made aware of.  He is repeating and repeating.

One lady is in Russia and we are trying to work through the Russian Embassy to make contact with her.  There are three people in respect of whom multiple hospitals were involved and we are trying to close those out.  We would need to go back to the consultants for the numbers with terminal cancer as it is a clinical judgment and all these situations are very difficult.  We would have to assess whether it would be an appropriate course of action to go back but perhaps we can reflect on it.  Each of the consultants has met the women and their families, some on a number of occasions. It is a medical judgment but we can certainly look at that, if that is what is required.</p></speech>

What is that based on?  Is it based on clinical knowledge?  Without knowing what the actual rate should be, how can he read a memo in his position and make that assumption?</p> <p>  In the data reconciliation process, the two-way data does not seem to have been transferred from the National Cancer Registry, in this case to the CervicalCheck people.  It seems that when the audit process started, for the first two years the audit data were used for education and training purposes and they were only used for patient purposes subsequently.  There is a definite swing to a focus on academia, education and data, rather than the patient.  We spoke last week on this.  There is an issue when one does not have clinicians in positions of management.  If a clinician was in charge, I firmly believe patients' needs would have been to the fore.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien talked about there not being a joined-up process when the systems kicked in.  That is a very serious admission to make because it says that the process did not work when it kicked off.  If Mr. O'Brien is admitting that the HSE cannot even communicate in a joined-up way to serve a population the equivalent to that of Manchester, he is admitting that it is not fit for purpose.  Mr. O'Brien also spoke about the corporate knowledge of the team.  I agree that just firing everybody who was in charge would get us nowhere but the way the corporate management team did its business does not seem to be the gold standard.  I am not sure how much value its corporate knowledge is; can Mr. O'Brien elaborate on this?</p> <p>  It is extremely strange that it is not as simple as putting a reference number into a sheet and pulling up a memo or a circular.  If the memo is not to hand, it appears as though no one can get it for Mr. O'Brien.  As for Mr. Breslin not knowing whether he got the memo, how does the Department get memos?  Where does it put them?  Does it put them in a box in a corner?  What way is it to run a business when it is not known how to find a memo or who definitively crafted a circular?  Surely, if someone writes a circular there is a reference number showing who did it.  I cannot understand this.</p> <p>  One reason for not having a statutory inquiry immediately was to avoid a pause in delving into things but Mr. O'Brien told me on a couple of occasions that a matter was for the scoping inquiry.  That, however, is exactly what this committee, as well as members of Opposition parties who met the Minister, did not want.  We did not want the answer to be that you could not talk about it because there was going to be a scoping inquiry or a statutory inquiry.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to say how he deemed himself qualified to read a memo and make an assessment that it was reassuring and did not raise alarm bells.</p></speech>

I cannot believe that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Government sanctioned it.  As head of the HSE, Mr. O'Brien has an onerous job.  If he retired, which he will shortly, I would see no conflict but he has a job of great consequence in this country yet he has been allowed to take a directorship of a board in America.  I understand he will have to go there once a month.</p></speech>

That is acceptable to Mr. O'Brien and to the system here in Ireland.  That is not good.  I do not believe it is good practice that a senior public servant such as Mr. O'Brien, given the responsibility he has, should be allowed to sit on another board in a foreign country.  It should not have been allowed.  As I said, if he is retired there is no problem, but I cannot believe the Government sanctioned it while he is still active.</p></speech>

Despite some very strange media reports the actual time commitment is in the range of one to two hours per month in this phase, although currently I am taking a leave of absence from that.</p></speech>

My intention was to be on leave this week and to be in that country.  As it happens, I have never been to that location, and it will wait for another day.  I followed a procedure set out in my contract of employment.  I applied appropriately and I was given consent appropriately.  The organisation in question has no products on the market.  There is absolutely no conflict of interest, and the amount of time absorbed in a non-executive director role at this stage in the life of that process is minimal.  For the Deputy's information, I spend far more time leaving my house in the late hours of the night to respond to 999 calls than I ever did with regard to that company at this stage.  There has absolutely been no impediment to my functioning as director general.  Some of this wild reporting that I spend five hours per week on it is complete nonsense.  Like so much in the media today, it is just made up.</p></speech>

Each judgment is made on a case-by-case basis.  The standard contract of employment for chief executives of State agencies such as this provides for a process where one can apply for the consent of the Minister if there is a remuneration involved.  I have two consents from two different Ministers.  One relates to a pro bono teaching commitment I have to a health sector-related higher level course in a third level institution in this country in respect of which I give approximately 15 hours per year and for which there is no remuneration.  The second relates to this issue, of which the Deputy is aware.  I followed absolutely the correct procedure in this regard.</p></speech>

In 2007, having previously been director of BreastCheck, I became the first chief executive of the National Cancer Screening Service board.  That board was created to continue with BreastCheck, to seek to roll out what had been a fledgling, regionally-based Irish cervical cancer screening programme from about 1996, which had not rolled out at that point, and to begin the investigative process around the development of BowelScreen.  At the time I was very pleased to be given that opportunity because as early as 1993, when I was chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association, I had participated in a lobbying exercise to seek to win Government policy.  I hope I played some small part in the development of the pilot programme in Limerick.  That programme in Limerick, 12 years on, had not achieved all that it could.  We were having as many smear tests taken in this country without a cervical programme, probably more than we do now with an organised programme, and it had made absolutely no difference to the incidence of cervical cancer.  Women were waiting up to a year in some instances for results.  One could not roll out a screening programme on that basis.  Some of those tests were being done on kitchen tables at home on overtime in non-quality assured circumstances.</p> <p>  The priority was to ensure that this country got a cervical screening programme to minimise the incidence of, and reduce deaths from, cervical cancer.  This programme has brought down the incidence by 7% per year.  There have been 50,000 high grade detections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN, which is a pre-cancerous abnormality of the cervix, and I am absolutely certain that one of the best day's work I ever did was to ensure that this county had a national cervical screening programme that is currently called CervicalCheck.  I know that it has saved many lives, and I am very pleased it has.  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to say that today.</p></speech>

I accept that.  I have a question about outsourcing the contract to America.  This is the last question and it is the same subject.

An open competitive tendering process was carried out in 2008, which followed quite a significant public debate, including a debate in the Houses.  There was a debate on this in the D&aacute;il at the time.  Some of the members of the committee might have been there; I am not sure.  The process was carried out in accordance with European standard procurement.  The requirements were that the laboratories had to be accredited to the relevant ISO standard - I cannot remember the exact number of it now but it was ISO 15 something or other - and that they had to have a volume of 25,000 tests per annum.</p></speech>

I attended the finance committee as a guest and had the benefit of questioning Mr. Breen on this.  I asked at that meeting, albeit it was unorthodox, that he would familiarise himself with the service level agreement which I assumed was in place, but I appreciate people are saying it might be a contract.  Did Mr. Breen have an opportunity to examine that in the meantime?</p></speech>

We contacted CervicalCheck and established that there is no service level agreement, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  It is a contract which sets out a whole series of things to include the indemnity clauses, which were the purpose of our particular detail.</p></speech>

I looked at it for all of the various clauses setting out, for example, who the contract was between, the duration of the contract and the ordinary terms of the contract in relation to the duties and obligations on the parties arising from it to include insurance, indemnities and so on.</p></speech>

I ask those senior personnel who remain from the HSE make contact with CervicalCheck and ask that the contract be made available to the Committee of Public Accounts, if necessary on a confidential basis, but ideally on a public basis, so that we can examine a number of issues related to value for money, reporting, communication and so on which may or may not have been reflected in it.</p> <p>  I asked Mr. Breen specifically at the finance committee the other day if there were any terms in the contract that would give recourse to the State for what are unknown but likely to be very substantial costs relating to this crisis, including the cost of investigations, scoping, a commission of investigation, redress and so on.  Is there anything in the contract which provides recourse for the Irish State in that regard?</p></speech>

It would be the normal ones in relation to those particular services and, for example, any legal proceedings that might arise, or claim in respect of a failure of those services which are more generally described within the contract.  Beyond that, I could not find anything necessarily which would give recourse.  I should caution that I had only very limited time to examine the contract.</p></speech>

If the witness could give us a note on it between now and the next meeting, that would be fantastic.</p><p>At the meeting the other day, we were talking about the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and we also discussed the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  It is clear from recent days that parts of those Acts have not been commenced, which has affected the State Claims Agency's ability to do its work as Mr. Breen expressed at the meeting of the finance committee the other day.  I will quote Mr. Breen.  He said: </p><blockquote>I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPOs, periodic payment orders, legislation.  We advocated pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow, I know that myself and my colleague [Jenny, who was with Mr. Breen at the time] would say it would transform the behaviour and way we would handle these cases.  It has been in the UK for a very long time and what it does is it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings, simply a letter of claim.  We then issue a letter in response to that and the idea is that you narrow down the issues to the issues that are real between you and that you mediate them.</blockquote> <p>I can tell the Chairman that I have advocated this position for a very long time.  Despite the fact the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into place, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have it even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had it tomorrow.  We still do not have it because that section of the Act has not been commenced or implemented.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Legal Services Regulation Act is quite high level.  It is an enabling clause and there is quite a deal of complexity to set out the actual rules around pre-action protocols.  Some Acts are very clearly set out and the regulation is to commence them.  In this case, a lot of work has to be done post the Act to set out the detail of how it will operate.</p></speech>

In the current crisis, I cannot let the timing of the promise to have it in the next number of weeks pass.  It is very unfortunate.  We have no doubt based our legislation on a similar 2008 Act in the UK.  They have a very clear system.  We often take a lead or guidance from what is working in other jurisdictions.  That should be done as a matter of urgency.</p><p>It is costing the State more money, but much more than that, its absence has led to the incredible distress caused to patients affected by the crisis.</p><p> My next question is for Mr. Breen.  Of the 98% of claims settled - he had a flyer that he gave to us today and at our last meeting - how many are settled without an admission of liability?</p></speech>

There is a breach of duty which we concede on a lot of occasions, as well as a breach of causation.  I do not mean to be over technical, but the breach of duty may not, in fact, have caused the damage.  That might be a point of real issue between medical experts in cases.  Without an admission of liability is, in fact, only one component of cases in terms of there being a double breach.  I am guessing that it would probably be somewhere in the order of between 30% and 50% of cases in which there would be no admission of liability.</p></speech>

A doctor may not have properly sought the consent of a patient; that is a breach of duty, but with regard to the injury that actually occurred, a court could find the patient would have had the surgery in any event and that the complication - a known complication - might have occurred even if the doctor had obtained the consent of the patient.  We had such a case a number of years ago which went the whole way to the Supreme Court which found exactly that point, that although there had been a breach of duty, it had not led to the actual damage caused - natural damage that had occurred as a result of the procedure.  It is a legal concept which is based almost entirely on medical expert evidence.</p></speech>

When there is an instance, particularly if there is ambiguity between a breach of duty or the other issues mentioned, it is vitally important that whatever consultant, administrator, doctor, nurse or orderly is involved be monitored in order that there is a cultural awareness that this happened in an institution and need never happen again.  I ask the HSE the same question.  Who among the witnesses is best placed to answer it?  If an incident takes place as a result of which the State pays out without an admission of liability, what retraining, monitoring and supervision take place?</p></speech>

We do not have a sanction in the Act for anything to do with clinical risk management and it would never be for us to engage in any retraining.

We are so far into the crisis and nobody is on a verbal warning or a written warning, subject to suspension or anything else because nobody seems to have any sanction available.  Not even the public, it seems, has a sanction.  That is the crux of the problem.  I ask the witness present from the HSE who is in a position to answer if the State pays out in a case involving medical negligence or a clinical issue without an admission of liability, is there retraining, monitoring or supervision to ensure the person or persons involved do not mess up again?</p></speech>

That is where I am working and many of the claims made are in the acute hospital space.  There are processes in terms of risk assessment and training.  There are many occasions on which evidence of the requirement for training is addressed through recommendations, whether in the context of an incident or a report or as part of the normal process between a clinical director and clinicians or other parties in a hospital.  There is a process of learning.  There is a piece that is conscious of the point the Deputy is making.</p></speech>

Teachta Marc MacSharry asked what sanction was in place.  The sanction is a procedure.</p><p>Can Mr. Woods or another HSE official numbers - not names - of how many people were sanctioned as a consequence of disciplinary procedures within the HSE going back over a three or four years to give us an indication of whether people are held to account and sanctioned?  If he cannot do that, he might ask the person who can to furnish the committee with that information.</p></speech>

The main issue is that there does not appear to be a process within the HSE, or one that Oireachtas Members have been made aware of through the various avenues open to us, including parliamentary questions, to determine whether there is some form of sanction, retraining or at least awareness building in respect of these issues within the medical profession, including for doctors, nurses and care staff.  Deputy MacSharry and the Acting Chairman have hit the nail on the head regarding the provision of information.  Should the committee consider writing to the Medical Council to seek a direct example of the processes it goes through to deal with medical personnel who are the subject to medical negligence cases and an outline of its role and follow-up activity with them?  It might be worthwhile for us to entertain sending such a letter.</p> <p>  My other query is more about the nuts and bolts of whether the SCA has seen an adjustment following the amendment to the book of quantum in recent years, which the former Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, brought the Houses and whether that resulted in marked savings during the most recent budgetary cycle for the State.</p></speech>

It is not framed for medical negligence injuries.  For example, a fistula created following a surgical repair will not be found in the book of quantum.  Its application to medical negligence is limited, if at all.</p></speech>

Between 2015 and 2016, there was a &euro;400 million increase in the amount that was provisioned, &euro;300 million of which was to do with the discount rate that was applied to estimate the payout to be made in individual cases.  To a certain extent, it is not exactly the book of quantum issue but it is an expectation because of lower returns on investments that a bigger sum will have to be paid out to ensure that somebody who is expected to live for whatever period is actuarially determined to have sufficient.  It is quite a complicated issue but it is one of the reasons the amount that is provisioned or disclosed is increasing.</p></speech>

We also got advices from our actuaries which indicated that our provisioning was good when we looked at outcomes in settled cases.

The specific question relates to the memorandum.  It was not around in 2008 and, therefore, I am not interested in what happened in 2008 and what the Department is trawling through.  With regard to this memorandum, how in God's name does it take this long to get this type of information?  We had this issue with the Department of Justice and Equality when there was a difficulty trawling through and finding emails.  What is going on in the public service that we cannot be told whether the HSE gave information to the Department?  The HSE director general is saying one thing while Mr. Breslin is telling me that the Department is still trawling through emails and he is still not in a position to confirm whether he received anything.

It is not necessarily a matter with which one would have an issue contemporaneously, although we now have an issue with it.  Clinical audit is not pervasive across our health service.  It is part of our health service.  Some people are subject to clinical audit but many patients, probably the majority, come all the way through the health service and they are not subject to clinical audit.  In and of itself, the information being held somewhere would not have been of sufficient import to get to me or a Minister contemporaneously.  It became an issue when, within five days of us being told one version, it was immediately retracted and the opposite was told.  Unfortunately, within the five-day period, the briefing had gone out.  The director general had referred to it.  We had briefed the Minister.  We had briefed the Government in regard to that.  I considered it a serious issue, as did the Minister, and he put it into the House as soon as he learned of it.  That was the context for that.</p></speech>

Therefore, it has to be systemic.  Like the director general, I am really frustrated with the public service because all of us here are dealing with and watching women in a very distressed state.  Reference was made earlier to the poor woman on "Morning Ireland" this morning and to how harrowing her story was.  We are here to ask questions on the women's behalf.  These women were not given information that they should have been given.</p> <p>  I discussed earlier with Dr. Holohan the difference between a false negative and a misreading of the smear test.  He said they are one and the same.  I do not accept that.  For many of the women, it was a misreading of their smear tests.  They were not given the information.  There was a strategy put in place not to give it to them.  That is what was in the instruction given to consultants.  Mr. Breslin was not made aware of it.  The Minister was not made aware of it.  The director general says he was not made aware of it.</p></speech>

I am not hiding behind anything.  As was referred to earlier, the discussion between the Minister and the other political parties in the Oireachtas was aimed at putting something in place that would get us there as quickly as possible, in a matter of weeks.  The aim was not to go down a road where everything closed down for two or three years and only at the end of that process would things begin to emerge.</p></speech>

If the same level of candour was shown by other Accounting Officers it would be very good for the public service.  I very rarely say that about Accounting Officers when they come before this committee.  Our job is to hold them all to account.  I watched Mr. Breen's appearance before the Oireachtas committee on finance where he took the same approach.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for Mr. Breen but before I pose them, I wish to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General a question.  In 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office compiled a special report which contained a chapter examining the issue of clinical indemnity schemes.</p></speech>

On the one hand there would be an expectation that, in this case, the HSE would inform the State Claims Agency of incidents when they occur so that the agency would be in a position to identify patterns and then to feed back that information to the HSE, advising it, as Mr. Breen mentioned, on steps that might need to be taken to prevent future claims.</p></speech>

The HSE gives the State Claims Agency information and the agency then reports back to the HSE.  It seems that both organisations are telling us that at no point did they see a pattern.  In fact, the HSE did see a pattern because it issued a circular in 2016 which showed clearly that it did so.  It strikes me that either the HSE saw a pattern and did not report that to the State Claims Agency - which is a problem - or the State Claims Agency itself missed the pattern.  In that area of the relationship between the HSE and the agency something was missed somewhere, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p></speech>

It has unfolded because of system and process failures which have impacted people in a very personal way.</p> <p>  There have been 10,000 phone calls to the helpline, some of which have been replied to.  From what I am hearing, some general information would be enormously helpful as to what women should do and what advice doctors should give them.  I am hearing that there is a general confusion about this matter.  That confusion could be allayed by some general statements of advice.  If that advice is out there, it may not be as prominent as it should be.  Women have asked me who they should talk to and if they should have another smear test.  It is basic information that certainly is not getting across.  Whatever platforms it is put out on, it should reach as wide an audience as possible.</p> <p>  I am aware contingent liability is dealt with on a pay-as-you-go basis.  How does the State Claims Agency assess the HSE&rsquo;s &euro;2.2 billion contingent liability?  Is it by examining cases, such as the recent one in question, going through the courts?  Is an actuarial assessment done of others who might find themselves in such a situation?  Is it estimated on the number of catastrophic failures during delivery of a baby?  What system is used to calculate this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.861" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#FF00500"><p>We do it within the State Claims Agency.  We manage these cases on behalf of the HSE.  We do this quite independently of it.</p> <p>  In the clinical indemnity scheme, when we get a case and we understand what it entails, we immediately set contingent liability against it.  This is based on our knowledge of what that particular case involves, whether there are issues regarding liability, for example, and what we think is the most likely outcome in the case.  Sometimes in any individual case, it can be an incremental process.  In other words, as we gather more information and we get more expert reports, it then might become clearer to us as to what the injuries and losses are.  One problem we sometimes face is that when we are well developed in a case, on the day before trial we might be furnished with a schedule of special damages in respect of something we did not anticipate.  That can happen from time to time.</p> <p>  Going back to our earlier discussion, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred, we always have prudent margins in our reserve setting in order to meet contingencies as best we can.</p></speech>

We all accept it is how it happens.  The open disclosure experience in other countries tends to show it can be beneficial in that one can save on the legal side and not take shortcuts in the actual care and treatment required by people.</p><p>Mr. Breslin's submission stated:</p><blockquote>As the committee will be aware, in 2017 a total of &euro;283 million was paid by the health service towards the cost of ongoing cases and settlement of claims.  Speeding up the process and moving to a less adversarial approach has the potential, not just to reduce the legal costs for both the plaintiff and the State, but to avoid unnecessary anxiety for those who have already suffered injury.</blockquote> <p>This suggests we would like to move to open disclosure as it has benefits.  Earlier this year on 8 February, we got a submission from the HSE about moving towards open disclosure, which referred to pilot programmes, the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital in 2010 and 2013.  In the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach spoke about open disclosure regarding regulation by the Medical Council.  The HSE&rsquo;s document referred to 20,000 of the 140,000 health service staff requiring training in this regard.  We do not know what degree of training will be required.</p><p>If open disclosure is so beneficial, why is it taking so long?</p></speech>

That paragraph, which refers to the &euro;283 million, is following a number of other points that are made about the scope for further reform of the legal system around this.  In the next paragraph, I move to open disclosure.  Specifically, in that sentence I am referring to further reform of how we legally approach claims.  The Minister has indicated that we are going to work with the Minister for Justice and Equality to try to identify further reforms, building on the Quirke working group report to try to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.864" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#GG00200"><p>I recall a matter that is not relevant to the health service; it is more one for the State Claims Agency.  Perhaps ten years ago, we had case after case involving parents who went to the courts because they could not get appropriate education for their children.  In response to a parliamentary question, I was advised that over a period of three years &euro;20 million was spent on legal fees, effectively fighting parents in the courts.  Systems were subsequently put in place to make provision in schools for education, whether it was mainstream, special needs or whatever.  At that point, we stopped seeing so many cases going through the courts.  There was some degree of learning, albeit after parents had gone through quite a torrid time.</p> <p>  Every week now, we see people coming out of court.  Parents make the point that although the money will look after the child for the rest of his or her life, nothing will repair the damage.  It strikes me that the lack of services - not just open disclosure - prompts some of the cases because people feel that the services will not provide for their needs.  Has any evaluation done as to what might be the best outcome for people in circumstances where a failure occurs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.865" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#GG00300"><p>I might answer in the context of the litigation we have.  I agree with the Deputy.  I say at the outset, quite genuinely, that we do not pursue anybody through the courts.  We try, wherever possible, to settle these cases by way of mediation to avoid that court process.  Going back to the pre-action protocol, it would be a considerable advantage if we had that to avoid all of this.</p> <p>  To come back to a catastrophically injured victim, whether it is a child or adult, there is little doubt that when we are evaluating the overall cost of that, the largest item is the cost of future care - for example, aids, appliances, assistive technology and things like that.  The allegation that will always be made by the plaintiffs in those actions is that the current level of services will not support the kind of care that they need.  We have had some very fruitful discussions - they are ongoing - with the HSE on this particular issue about catastrophic injury cases and putting in place some kind of care packages more quickly outside the litigation process, which would be of assistance.</p></speech>

It is a reasonable question.  The policy that was produced in 2013 was based on the pilot in the two hospitals, Cork University Hospital and the Mater.  The idea was that when bringing something new in, there would be some resistance to it.  Potentially, people would have to change their practices.  We want people to openly disclose.  We have evidence that it was not happening.  The pilots were to prove to people that we could do it, that there was no threat in it and that it was something which people involved welcomed once they had done it.</p> <p>  We based the policy on that experience.  We then disseminated the policy and guidelines widely, once they were written, in 2013.  So they were then available.  However, because this is such an important policy, we committed, with the State Claims Agency - because we did this work together - to undertake a training programme as extensive as we had the resources to do.  The reason it took so long was because of the initial format of the training.  The training is very high quality and has been assessed by external evaluators and by the participants.  It is very much welcomed and people find it effective.  The people involved - the one or two individuals doing the training - were training everybody.  So, taking into account the basis of the Deputy's question, we moved from training everybody to training trainers who would, in turn, train other people so that we could at least multiply it.  Our next stage now is to develop an e-learning module so that everybody can train on it.</p></speech>

There will always be instances where individuals under stress, feeling ashamed of what has happened, feeling stress or whatever, fail to do what we would want them to do which is to openly disclose.  What we do is put policy out there.  We train people on it.  We try to de-stress it.  We try to ensure management supports people in something because one has to support staff when things go wrong as well; otherwise they will not necessarily do the right thing.  I do not think one can ever guarantee that in every instance of an adverse event.  I cannot say, hand on heart and with absolute certitude, that in every instance open disclosure will happen.  What we want to do is make sure it does.</p> <p>  We do not just do the training and see what happens.  One of the things we have done is that we did an audit of four hospitals and looked at charts in those hospitals.  In those charts we found 33 events that should be disclosed and in those hospitals disclosure happened.  I think it is starting to happen and if we continue training the trainers and maintaining the lead roles around the hospital groups and the community healthcare organisations, I think one will see the culture continue to change.</p></speech>

This begs the question as to what other memos exist, if any, of which the committee should be made aware.</p><p>This memo arose by accident this morning or as a result by a question put by me.  Are there other memos of which we should be aware that we are not?  I do not like this type of question.  It is like a fishing expedition.  I am not comfortable asking it, but it has emerged that there is a memo that Mr. O'Brien was given in March or April 2016.  What other memos are there relating to this matter?</p></speech>

Insofar as that information is not personally sensitive to women - I am not referring to other parties - we will release it.  I understand that, due to the reference this morning to the 2016 memo, a search is under way with a specific target around that period.  If we are in a position to identify something there, we will release it to the committee.  The other point to note is that all of those records will be given over to Dr. Gabriel Scally.</p></speech>

There is not a country in the world where that is the standard.  There is a duty of candour arrangement in the UK that is often cited.  It does not apply to physicians, only to organisations.  The arrangements we are making, confirmed by the Government's approval on Tuesday to draft legislation based on proposals that we have had in train for some time, are to make mandatory a list of what are called serious reportable events.  They are less frequent, but they are serious in terms of their potential.  A list is already in operation in the HSE in administrative terms.  It reports on that each month.  This is in line with the UK's duty of candour arrangement.  That is what I am in favour of.</p></speech>

I would have known that this country was one of a large minority that had an organised screening programme in the first instance.  It is still the case that the majority of screening programmes across Europe do not have organised clinical audits.  Of those that do, the only one where there is an ongoing discussion around open disclosure of facts identified - false negatives - is in the UK.  It is not the standard throughout Europe, but we introduced that standard in 2016.  We purported through our screening programme to give that information to patients, but the health system did not do that effectively.  That is what is at issue in this case.</p> <p>  Clinical audit is a good thing.  It would have generated information that should have been fed back to patients.  We believed that was happening, as we were told it was.  We heard that evidence this morning.  The people who were telling us also believed that to be the situation.</p></speech>

We had a very robust exchange earlier on information flow from the HSE to the Department.  How important is it that there is good communication between the HSE, whatever part of the HSE it is, and Mr. Breslin's office specifically, as Secretary General?</p></speech>

While the director general and I keep in touch on matters and have meetings, including formal meetings, there is also iterative engagement between the different policy areas of the Department and the HSE in respect of both policy and issues as they arise in the health service.</p></speech>

I will go a bit further to make it a bit easier for Mr. Breslin.  At the time the circular was issued, the circular that was sent to consultants pertained to, as we now know, 209 women.  At that point only a small number of them had been informed.  Discretion was given to consultants as to whether they should tell the patients.  They knew the scale of it at that point.  Mr. Breslin is telling me he is not sure whether his office was informed at that point.  When that circular was drafted, agreed and then sent to consultants, Mr. Breslin is not sure whether his office actually received any communication.</p></speech>

In a case where a person goes on to have an invasive cancer of the other type, previous knowledge of the screening history has no value and a decision may be made at that point that there would be no need to pass that information.

I find that extraordinary and all the more reason why those central to those decisions should be brought before us next week.</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Crowley will be able to answer my next question.  We heard earlier from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in regard to the legal services paper, which states guidelines for national screening services should be developed.  One of the witnesses from the State Claims Agency stated there are no specific guidelines for open disclosure in terms of screening but, rather, a more general policy.  Why is there no such policy for screening services?</p></speech>

I have also read the chapter in 2012 by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  What impresses me is that the State Claims Agency is thorough in theory and carries out an investigation.  According to the chapter, only 40% of the claims which the agency came across had been previously reported as adverse clinical incidents.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Given that that was in 2012, has the figure changed?  Given all of the training and the importance of disclosure, what is the current figure for the number of adverse clinical incidents reported?</p></speech>

The figure to which the Deputy referred was the number of claims that previously had been reported as incidents.  It was reasonable that some claims had not previously been reported as incidents because it might not have been known at the time of the incident that there had been an adverse outcome and that a subsequent claim would arise.  Looking specifically at claims previously reported as incidents is not terribly helpful.  This year we have revised the process.  When a claim comes in, we can make an assessment of whether it should previously have been reported as an incident.  What we are trying to look at is the difference between the number which should have been reported and the number that were actually reported.  Looking at the figure quoted by the Deputy in isolation is not that helpful.</p></speech>

Moving away from the very specific issue at which we have looked today, generally, how can the system be improved?

On the memo, this incident was not regarded as serious.  The memo states it was not a patient safety incident but rather a reflection of the known limitations to the current screening test.  Does the agency still hold to that view or has it changed its mind?</p> <p>  The national screening programme has assured the Department that no quality issues have arisen with the US laboratory which performed the testing in 2011.   We now know that two laboratories are being sued in 11 cases about which we know, yet there are no quality issues with those laboratories.  The solicitors for them gave an expert opinion.  I have run out of time, but perhaps Mr. Breen might respond on the two issues I have mentioned.</p></speech>

Having read it, I am shocked and it is not manufactured shock.  This reads like a letter of containment.  It states that screening &quot;is not 100% accurate&quot; and that CervicalCheck &quot;cannot give a 'yes' or 'no' answer&quot;.  I have a problem with the statement that there is, &quot;always a risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media if they feel that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  The memorandum continues: &quot;Most importantly during the course of the clinical audit to date no systematic quality problem of concern has been identified.&quot;  That is a concern.</p><p>The document subsequently states: &quot;One of the cytology laboratory providers has sought legal advice into the right of the programme to communicate audit outcomes.&quot;  The laboratories obviously had an issue with anyone being told the truth.</p><p>The memorandum continues:</p><blockquote>The programme is liaising with legal team.  This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.</blockquote> <p>It then sets out the next steps - this is frightening stuff - which are as follows: &quot;await advice of solicitors&quot;; &quot;Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks&quot;; and - here we go - &quot;Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  CervicalCheck was concerned about media reaction rather than individuals who had been falsely informed they were healthy when they could have taken remedial steps such as those we have heard about in recent weeks.  The director general stated earlier he found the memorandum reassuring.  If that is reassuring, it is the clearest indictment the committee and perhaps the House more generally has heard of the culture of containment, bury, suppress and protect ourselves at all costs.</p><p>I did not bother to read the two follow-up memorandums but I scanned them.  The memorandum issued in March 2016 and, according to his own testimony, the director general did nothing about it from that date until he heard about it on the news.  The policy of continuing &quot;to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'&quot; was very successful for two years because everybody, including the media, were kept in the dark for two years until the director general heard it on the news.  Frankly, this is an indictment of the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Secretary General, the HSE director general and everyone else associated with this issue and are taking wages paid by the income tax from the people.  The absence of humanity, compassion and accountability is a disgrace and I hope Mr. O'Brien, wherever he is <i>en route </i>to meetings in Limerick today, hears loud and clear that he should resign and allow us to reflect on whether the Minister, the Secretary General, I am afraid to say, and others also have to go.  This memorandum, which has been in circulation for two years, indicts many more people than its author.  I am disgusted.  I have no further questions because what we need now are actions from so-called leaders who, in reality, are nothing more than commentators.</p></speech>

We need time to read the full detail and reflect on its content before calling for resignations.  However, I share Teachta MacSharry's view that the memorandum crafted in 2016 was a letter of containment.</p><p>It was a policy of containment.  It strikes me that if I were one of the women reading the memo prepared for the director general and read by him, I would be absolutely livid.  What jumps from the pages is that the authors of the memo were basically saying to the director general that he needed to be concerned about the media reaction; not about patients or the women, but about the media reaction.  Even in terms of the next steps, nowhere does it say all women should be informed, nowhere does it say anything about open disclosure, and nowhere does it express concern for the welfare of women and patients.  Next steps include to pause all letters, await advice from solicitors and decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks.  I imagine, given the next line, that the potential risks are not risks to individuals but risks to the corporate body which is the HSE.  The next step is to continue to prepare a reactive communications response for a media headline that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  It is profoundly shocking that this was the issue which was uppermost in the minds of the people who wrote that memo.  Is there anyone from the HSE here - Dr. Crowley, Ms Lennon or Mr. Woods - who can give any response on behalf of the HSE to this memo?</p></speech>

John Gleeson prepared it on behalf of Stephanie O'Keeffe.

My understanding is that John Gleeson was one of those who was central to the circular we had a lot of discussion on, which was then sent to consultants.  He is also central to drafting this memo.  We have gone beyond expressing outrage at this point.  I do not think when I look across at some of the people here that they really understand why we are outraged and concerned.  I get blank responses when I look across.  I will finish on this because I do not really have anything more to say; if I were any of the women who suffered because of this scandal and who are shocked, fearful and angry, I would be absolutely disgusted by the mindset within the HSE.  Writing this memo was about containment and concern about the media reaction rather than for the welfare of the women.  Shame on those who did that.  Absolute shame on them.</p></speech>

I will not be long.  I appreciate that HSE colleagues here have only just seen this and we do not know if the Department of Health had a copy of this at the time, albeit we will find out in the coming days.  There are three versions.  Without putting words in his mouth, the Secretary General said it was likely it was sent on.  What jumps out most to me from what we have just read is on page 2 of the memo.  It continued on the previous version.  It refers, using inverted commas, to "a communications protocol" prepared for consulting clinicians to address their questions.  It says the spokesman on matters related to this audit was Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme, who we know has now moved on.</p> <p>  Unless I was chairing a different meeting, I understood earlier from the director general of the HSE that the communications he took to be in the memo and the programme of communications work was obviously with the patients first through the clinicians.  This is not how that reads.  Anybody reading that can see it does not use the word "patient" anywhere.  It says a communications protocol has been prepared for consultant clinicians to address their questions.  What about the questions of the women?</p> <p>  The spokesperson on matters related to the audit was named as Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme.  I say to all of those here that this should not give comfort that there is a communications process in place with the people that matter the most, namely, the women.  It does not.  It says, more or less, that there will be a protocol in place to ensure the clinicians are being told.</p> <p>  This is almost as if within the politics of health, it was intended to ensure that there was a protocol to tell the clinicians what was going on here and to name the spokesperson.  If that is the memo written by John Gleeson on behalf of Stephanie O'Keeffe and sent to the director general, is it any wonder that the women affected were not told for years in some cases?  Is it any wonder?  This memo has nothing to do with communications to the patients.  It only goes down as far as the clinicians.  That is the most devastating part of this.  It actualises what we have all been thinking and talking about for the last week and a half.  That one paragraph is a communications process being put in place from the HSE through the screening programme for clinicians, not the affected women.  It sums up where we are today.  That is at the bedrock of where this issue lies.</p> <p>  The women were not being thought of.  Nowhere in this memo does it say it is necessary to put in place a programme to communicate with all of the women and to ensure that they are all communicated with properly and dealt with in a compassionate way.  It does not say that.  It says there is a protocol in place for consulting clinicians and it names the spokesperson.  Does that not say a great deal about the politics of health in Ireland and the way in which the ultimate end users, the patients affected and the women whose lives have been destroyed, were treated?  It is a devastating paragraph in the letter and it is not a paragraph anybody could read to give comfort that the communications process down to the patients was going to happen.</p> <p>  On page 1, it states that all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  It states that the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information for the media and the public, where appropriate, on the CervicalCheck clinical audit process and results.  A small issue jumps out again; the patient.  It says "all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that "screening did not diagnose my cancer".  It says the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information.  To whom?  Not the women affected, but to the media and the public.  Transparent, effective and robust communications processes are referred to, not for the women affected but for the media and the public.</p><p>That says it all and it is quite damning.  It is not what I was expecting to read given the evidence I heard this morning.</p></speech>

From what I heard this morning, I would have been under the impression that a communications strategy was put in place to communicate with the people most affected - the women.  This is a strategy to ensure that the HSE and the corporate brand is protected and to ensure that there were communications processes with clinicians in place within the political health family.</p></speech>

This is not what I expected to read.  When Mr. O'Brien was talking to us this morning, he was very much focused on the communications strategy and how it was not carried out.  He went further, however, and said that when he reread it, it did not cause him any serious concern.  He also talked about the requirement to manage the situation when something like this occurs in order to ensure that widespread concerns about something like the cervical screening programme are not exacerbated, which is exactly what has happened.  Given the notice on this matter, which he must have read, it is very difficult to figure out why a different type of action was not taken.</p> <p>  The final four bullet points on the last page of the first memo include the phrase "Pause all letters", which is the converse of what we have been told in respect of the communications strategy.  Obviously, legal advice was then sought.  Was that legal advice received?  What was that legal advice?  Was that legal advice to the effect that people should not be told?  Can Ms Lennon confirm that?  The memo also includes the phrase "Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks".  I presume that refers to the order and volume of the letters that were to be sent to clinicians in respect of making contact with the patients who had received false negatives.  It is, therefore, about who would be told first and in what order people would be told in order to mitigate risk to the organisation and the programme.  On what is termed the "reactive communications response", I presume there is correspondence or a body of documentation in respect of that response.  It would be useful for us to see that because clearly it will have been worked through.  The witnesses might tell us what kind of working through would have been done and who it would have been done with.</p> <p>  I would particularly like to know what constitutes a patient safety issue?  That kept jumping out at me as it was being said over the past week or so.  People said that it was not a patient safety issue.  I am certain the patients do not feel that reflects their experience.  Will the witnesses tell us how that is defined and where the judgment call is made in that regard?  There are a number of questions there.  Some are addressed to Ms Lennon, others may be more appropriate for Dr. Holohan.</p></speech>

We will be revisiting this issue next week and it would be very helpful if we had the information in advance of our meeting.  I do not know who would deal with the communications strategy.  There would have been a communications strategy and it would be quite useful for us to see it because it would seem to be at variance with the information in the public arena about there being a strategy to communicate with the individual clinicians who, in turn, would communicate with the patients.</p></speech>

I have only read the July memo because that is where I got stuck, but there is a reference to a communications protocol having been prepared.  Seeing that communications protocol would also be very useful.  The memo says that the protocol was for consulting clinicians in order to address their questions.  What is not to the fore here, as the Vice Chairman said, is the women.  If, in the communications protocol, people had put themselves in the women's shoes and asked the questions they would ask their clinicians, it might be helpful to see.</p></speech>

There are two communications issues here.  The first is most definitely that protocol and the second is that there is a communications strategy in respect of the media.  It is important for us to see what that strategy was.  There may have been other strategies in respect of follow-on care and the reassurance that people might receive - reassurance which, I believe, is still absent - in respect of the CervicalCheck programme.  I am certainly being asked to ask certain questions in emails and in telephone calls to my office.  That is the kind of thing I am getting.  I am sure it is the same for other Members.  If a strategy had been worked out in respect of the questions that people who are fearful would be prompted to ask, surely we would also see that.  There will probably be three different types of strategy involved.  We might see what the HSE has with regard to all three.  I would like the witnesses to tell us if they do not exist.  On the issue of patient safety, how is it defined?</p></speech>

When we find out about something the first objective we set for ourselves is to determine whether anything about the incident represents a risk for people who have yet to use the service.  I am not talking about screening, I am just talking in a general sense.  We ask who would be at risk if the service was to continue on the same basis without something happening.  Such cases are the first group.  The next group relates to instances where there is reason to believe something about the use a group of people made of a service placed them at risk or harmed them and where there is a need to look back to identify such people and to put in place some service to address whatever has been identified.  The next would be individual incidents which are very significant but which might not have either of the first two ramifications I have identified.</p></speech>

Clearly it applies to people who are the subject of the audit, in particular with the finding that the disclosure of information to them did not happen.  It is a significant patient safety issue, which can clearly be seen now.  It is not apparent from the note that that was evident at the time.

My understanding of screening programmes at a European level - and I understand this from my own knowledge - is that open disclosure policies, regrettably, are not well developed.  We have evidence that our screening programme was attempting to put an arrangement in place to look back at areas of the programmes where audit was not standard and to feed back that information.  We know that it did not work.</p></speech>

There was then a decision taken that the results of that audit should be communicated.  We can say that whether it should have been communicated with the clinicians or with the women is a matter of opinion right now, based on the memos we have just got.</p> <p>  I presume there was a decision then to relay that decision to the laboratories, so somebody must have picked up the phone to the laboratories and said that he or she was going to relay the outcome of the audit to either the clinicians or the women as part of the HSE's open disclosure policy.  The laboratories objected to that.

Programme communicating cytology review findings to [not even women] treating clinicians and there has been legal correspondence in previous months."  I would presume the correspondence is in relation to the decision to relay that information to clinicians.</p></speech>

The programme is liaising with legal team on this.</blockquote> <p>I just mentioned a moment ago, it is also important that it goes on to say, &quot;This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.&quot;  The Deputy is definitely correct.  Somebody was saying, &quot;What are you doing there?&quot;</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051000002#RR04500"><p>I accept that.  The July memo states that the national screening service "met with one of the laboratories in May 2016 and legal correspondence has ceased since that meeting."  The question I would have to ask is, what was said at that meeting to reassure the laboratories?  I am presuming and I do not want to be presuming.  That is why I am asking the question.  There must have been something said at that meeting between the national screening service and the laboratories in May 2016 which allayed their fears and the laboratory in question then decided not to pursue any further legal correspondence.  That is one question and I do not know whether anyone in this room has the answer to it.  What was said at that meeting?  Were assurances given to the laboratories?  Was the open disclosure protocol or policy which was to be rolled out, that we discussed earlier, relayed to the laboratories?  I do not know the answer to that and maybe somebody here might.</p> <p>  The other point I want to clarify is the numbers.  The two July memos or briefing notes that we got contain two different figures.  That may be because one dates from the start of July and the other dates from the end of July.  We do not know because they are not dated.  It only states "July".  One is for 256 and the other is for 286.  I am just looking for some information on this.  We now are dealing with 209 women.  What happened to the other letters?  Who were they being sent to?  If the HSE is saying we have 209 women who needed to be informed, either through their clinician or directly, where are the figures of 286 and 256 coming from and how did we get from those figures down to 209?  That is my second question.</p> <p>  My third question relates to a paragraph in the July memo on the amount of correspondence which will have to be sent out.</p><p>It says that from September 2016, letters communicating the cytology review findings are likely to issue at a rate of four to six per month.  There was either 256 or 286 letters, but in both memos it says there are approximately 200 letters left to be issued, at a rate of four to six per month.  Even if the higher figure of six is taken, it would take two years and seven months.</p></speech>

My interpretation of the July figures is that one relates to an eight year period of data or notifications whereas the other one relates to a seven and a half year period.  I would say the difference between the 256 and the 286 or 288 is a seven and a half year period and an eight year period.  My interpretation on the volume of correspondence is that they were recognising a backlog that had to be cleared in July-August 2016 and that once it was through that it would be in a steady-state of notifying four to six women per month, into the future, as false negative cases would have arisen.  I think that is what explains those figures.</p></speech>

On the memo that was sent in March, which is the one Mr. Tony O'Brien said he saw, I want to quote what the director general said this morning.  He said that the memo outlined that a communication process was going to be put in place.  When pressed, he said that if the process had been carried through there would be no woman who was not informed.  I do not know how that can be taken from that memo because nowhere in the memo does it say it will inform women.  It says it will inform clinicians.  The memo says the volume of letters increases the risk of an individual reacting to the content if or when shared by the attending clinician.  It is not even clear from this that the attending clinician would share the information as it says "if" or "when".</p></speech>

The number that is here is the number that is flagged for review.  The 209 that is circulating at the moment relates to those that have been reviewed in terms of their cytology and what is called a discordance - in other words, the difference in what we say now looking backwards and what was said then has been identified.  That is what that number of 209 relates to and it relates to the cohort of years.  It is not just the eight years but it is all the way up to the end of last year, in effect, because there were effectively two more years worth of the screening programme operating and contributing to that number.  Those numbers get done by starting with all of the incident cases it knows about.  We now know it did not know about the ones the registry had or did not include those.  It worked those down.  The question it is effectively asking is where a person who has cervical cancer, was there some failure in the chain of screening that failed to take the opportunity to prevent this cancer from occurring?  That could be because an appointment was not sent out.  It could be because the person did not respond to an appointment.  It could be the screening.  It could be the GP service not taking an adequate smear.  It could the cytology or colposcopy service after the full chain is looked at.  Only those where there is a reasonable suspicion that it is the smear that needs to be looked at are flagged for review and then a subset of those are identified where there is that discordance or difference between what it said back then in the report and what it now appears to be saying.  I wanted to explain that.</p></speech>

I was working off the 1,200 cases in the latest figures for eight years.  The point is made that approximately 30% of the total notified cases have been flagged for a review.  The figure of 30% of 1,200 is 288 by my reckoning.  That is where a figure of about 288 comes from.</p></speech>

Some 30% of 1,200 comes out at about 360.  Then it says that approximately 80% of reviews include a focus upon cytology prior to diagnosis and that is what gives the figure of 288.</p></speech>

That is what was said.  When he was pressed, he said that if the process had been carried through, there would have been no woman who was not informed.  Nowhere in any of these three documents does it state that the women must be informed.  One memo says "if" or "when" they are informed.  The other ones talk about a communications process to the clinicians.  I do not understand how the director general can say that he was under the impression that women were going to be informed.  He has admitted this morning that is a systems failure.  He is the person accountable for that systems failure, but he will not take responsibility for it.</p></speech>

I know there has been a dispute among clinicians which we would not have been aware of at the time.

Before I do that, I believe I can speak on behalf of all members on this issue.  Today started for me with the "Morning Ireland" interview with Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  Since then, I have spent hours at this meeting and I have found this to be one of the most depressing exchanges the committee has had because of the absolute lack of information forthcoming.  There is still serious confusion and nobody wants to take responsibility for anything.  This is a source of great irritation to me and I am deeply shocked.</p> <p>  I will make a final point on the first briefing note of March 2016 and the statement in that note that there "is always the risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media".  The concern was that the women might go to the media and that women should not be trusted.  That is the message I get from the briefing note.  This is beyond shocking when one considers how this day started for most of the people in the room.</p> <p>  To take up the point made by Teachta MacSharry, it is important that the director general of the HSE appears before the committee again next week.  Dr. Holohan tried to do his best to interpret elements of these briefing notes but we have only an interpretation.  We need to hear from the people who wrote the notes and the HSE director general who is responsible for overseeing all of this.  The correct course of action, therefore, would be to invite Mr. O'Brien to appear again and if he cannot attend, the person who is next in charge, whoever that may be.  Mr. O'Brien should, however, make himself available.  The Department also needs to be represented and I hope Mr. Breslin, when he returns next week, will have found the correspondence he indicated he started to look for today.  It would be great if he had that material next week in order that members could discuss it.  He can send it on to the committee at any time.  If he does not have it, that would indicate to me that it was never sent.  We will find out next week.</p> <p>  The other witnesses we hope to have before the committee next week are Mr. John Gleeson, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, representatives of the National Cancer Registry who, I understand, have confirmed they will attend, the national director of human resources in the HSE and a representative of the Medical Council.  All the relevant invitations will issue.</p></speech>

My understanding is that our meeting with representatives from the National Treatment Purchase Fund and nursing homes to discuss the 2016 financial statements will proceed.  As a result, there will be two elements to next week's meeting.  While it is a matter for the Chairman and clerk to sort out times, I expect the more lengthy of the two sessions will be the follow-up discussion with the HSE.  I hope the individuals to whom I referred will be able to make the meeting.  It would also be useful to have Mr. Breslin attend.</p></speech>

I am an Australian.  I trained in the area of paediatric intensive care and for the past 20 years have been working as an aid worker.  I am proud to be back in Ireland because I spent many years working with Catholic Relief Services here, the American equivalent of Tr&oacute;caire, to establish relationships with Irish aid organisations which are some of the most effective in the world.  The Irish people are also among the most generous in the world.  I am happy to explain to the committee how aid is manipulated and controlled by the Assad regime, as well as highlighting how we must we ensure this multi-billion dollar aid effort does not continue funding President Assad&rsquo;s killing machine.</p> <p>  Few of us remember that once upon a time this conflict was a revolution.  The Syrian uprising began on 15 March 2011.  The regime has been in place since illegally seizing power in 1963.  Hafez al-Assad established himself as President in 1971 and his family has exerted control ever since.  It has a policy of civilian oppression and a poor human rights record.  We saw this in 2011 when civilians who had taken to the streets were shot.  Even children who wrote anti-regime graffiti were arrested and tortured.  Doctors were killed for the crime of treating civilians injured in protests.  On 22 March 2011 the first doctor and ambulance driver were killed while trying to save unarmed student protestors who had been shot.  Shortly afterwards, the international community responded with sanctions.  Initially, they were travel bans and asset freezes in respect of key individuals deemed to be responsible for the violence such as the chiefs of the military and intelligence forces.  It was done initially by the United States and the European Union followed rapidly.  By May 2011, sanctions had even been imposed on President Bashar al-Assad himself.</p><p>His atrocities continued.  The next year a lot of effort went into a peace process led by Mr. Kofi Annan.  By this stage, not only had the European Union which was Syria's principal trading partner at the time extended it to economic sanctions, many other countries had also imposed bilateral sanctions.  Mr. Annan's six-point peace process failed and a massive humanitarian crisis began to unfold.  Millions were forced from their homes inside Syria and there was a massive exodus of refugees.</p><p> In response to the crisis, UN agencies were mobilised.  The primary UN agency involved in this work is the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, which has a mandate based on UN General Assembly Resolution 46-182.  It mandates it to co-ordinate an international response, mobilise funds from governments and implement measures through other UN agencies and partners.  It has to do this work while respecting the principle of sovereignty.  The condition imposed was that everything would operate from Damascus, that all aid would go through it and that the Syrian Government would be fully in charge of aid efforts.  These aspects are the biggest problems and have led to the current situation.  Seven years later we are faced with the worst crisis in modern history.  It is certainly the largest and most expensive with which to deal.  It is a multi-billion dollar effort for Syrian alone.  There are 5.7 million refugees outside the country and an equivalent number inside it.  Sadly, the atrocities continue, as evidenced by the chemical attacks last month in Duoma in the Ghouta region, after which further sanctions were imposed.  There is great concern about whether the sanctions hurt the humanitarian efforts.  I shall explain the matter a little.  Syria not only has a terrible humanitarian crisis, it hasalso suffered a public health catastrophe.  One of President Assad's claims is that the catastrophe has been caused by the sanctions imposed.</p><p> Syria has experienced two polio epidemics.  In 2013 polio reappeared in Syria for the first time in 19 years, but the outbreak was covered up by the government.  Unfortunately, the World Health Organization, the primary role of which is to support the efforts of the Syrian Government, has had to toe the line.  It was a task force in northern Syria, operated from Turkey with the permission of the Turkish Government, that took control and successfully administered a vaccination programme.  Last year there was a resurgence of vaccine derived polio and the outbreak is ongoing.  We had never seen it happen in a war before.  The war in Iraq lasted eight years, but polio did not emerge.  I hope I have given a useful example.  Well before the war in Syria broke out, vaccines were withheld from politically unsympathetic areas, leaving people extremely vulnerable.  It was one of reasons people took to the streets to demonstrate in 2011.  After 50 years of brutal repression, they did not take to the streets to discover all of these new ways of dying - being shot at, made to disappear, tortured, arrested, gassed with chemicals, starved to death in a siege and attacked with vacuum bombs and barrel bombs.  They protested because they wanted a better life and, most importantly, for the sake of their children, which is why we all care.  </p><p> The terrible consequence of the Syrian conflict is that children have suffered the worst and are most vulnerable.  The Syrian Government fully controls the aid effort.  It exercises control through its partners.  They include the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the national non-government organisations, NGOs, operated by President Assad's family and friends.  They determine exactly where the aid goes and deliberately ensure it does not reach the regions most in need.  This is entirely consistent with its targeting of civilian homes and schools.  By this time last year the Assad regime had bombed well in excess of 4,000 schools.  There has also been the deliberate destruction of hospitals and doctors have been killed, which weaponises healthcare and turns people's need for it into a weapon against them by violently depriving them of it.</p><p> On areas under siege, the regime deliberately withholds humanitarian aid and refuses to allow civilians to leave them, which makes the siege illegal.  The proper way to operate a siege is to allow in humanitarian aid and civilians to leave, especially women and children.  The policy of denying humanitarian aid to anyone who needs it is entirely consistent with a war that the regime has practised consistently.  It is responsible for fuelling this massive refugee crisis.  It does this by using an incredibly effective intelligence and security apparatus, which is how one stays in power.  The Assad regime has been in power for 50 years because it has relied on brute force, a strong military and a very strong intelligence force.</p><p> Let us not forget that the people in power in Syria have all been sanctioned.  The first slide shows the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies with Prime Minister Imad Khamis.  The picture at the bottom of the slide shows President Assad, the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister.  Let us recall that all of them have been sanctioned.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies must work very closely with the same individuals who are held entirely responsible for the Syrian conflict.  Prime Minister Imad Khamis used to be the Minister for health.  The Minister for Health is also on the sanctions list and has been for years.  Every single government Minister in Syria has been sanctioned for participating in human rights violations - acts of violence, killing, shooting and disappearances - yet these are the same people with whom the aid agencies in Damascus are forced to work under the terms and conditions stipulated by the Syrian Government. </p><p> The second slide shows Mr. Bashar Ja'afari, the Syrian representative in the permanent mission to the United Nations.  In the photo one can see him embrace Mother Agnes whose name is designed to provide reassurance and allay fears.  Even though she has her own NGO, aid is withheld from those who need it the most.  She has also denied that chemical attacks ever took place.  She is one of the many people who have been appointed to roles to control the distribution of aid.  Syria is an authoritarian state and the only way one can succeed is through maintaining close proximity to the people in power.</p><p> At the bottom of the slide one can see Mr. Faisal Mekdad, former permanent representative of Syria to the United Nations.  Mr. Mekdad and Minister Walid Muallem are the most powerful people in the regime and have a direct relationship with the intelligence forces.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs dictates which agencies can enter Damascus.</p><p>Once they have agreed an agency is allowed to come in, the condition is that it must partner with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, SARC, which is a local member of the Red Cross-Red Crescent movement and Syria's largest humanitarian agency.  It is long established and staffed by thousands of dedicated volunteers.  However, it is also controlled by the same intelligence forces and has been for a very long time.  All of the agencies have to work through SARC, the primary aid agency that delivers aid, but they also have to apply for approval before they can recruit any staff.  Through the Ministry and SARC, which is controlled by the intelligence forces, they control who comes in to Syria.  We cannot get our best people to deliver an aid project when they are excluded because they are deemed to be politically unsympathetic.  They control the aid agencies, the people who staff them and the programmes delivered by SARC and through the national NGOs, which is another name for Assad's family's and friends' enterprises.</p><p> Faisal Mekdad's wife, Shukria, was hired by the WHO as the consultant for assessment of the mental health needs of internally displaced persons.  In the absence of any qualifications or experience she was put into this leading position by the World Health Organisation.  It is a measure of the influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that she was put into a position for which she is unqualified.  Her only qualification is that she is his wife.  She is meant to assess the mental health needs for which Faisal himself as one of the chief prosecutors is responsible. </p><p> The next slide shows the major general in charge of the blood bank.  As the member can see, it is part of the Ministry of Defence.  Elizabeth Hoff, the country representative of WHO Syria, was awarded a shield by the Minister of Defence for her special efforts in her services.  This is one of the most egregious examples of how the aid is controlled.  Blood is a very important resource in war, of course.  In cases where the Red Cross controls blood, we are able to donate it and receive it when we need it.  In Syria, the blood bank is controlled entirely by the Ministry of Defence.  Since 2013, because Abbott in the US was no longer allowed to supply the transfusion hardware and software or the screenings kits for HIV, hepatitis B and the blood-borne diseases, the Ministry of Defence approached the WHO to procure those items for it.  Since then, the WHO has been buying millions of dollars' worth of transfusion equipment, screening kits, blood bags, and all of the serums and fluids.  None of these is allowed to reach those in need, however.  Not to Darayya five miles away, nor to Ghouta, under siege since 2013.  They are not allowed to receive intravenous fluids, let alone blood.  In full knowledge that the blood products are being withheld from the population that is most in need, and that their supply is controlled by an agency that is responsible for the air strikes, the trauma and barrel bombs that drenched the country in blood, they are subsidising Assad's killing machine, bypassing the sanctions and even profiting.  Because they do not have to do so, they do not reimburse the WHO, of course.</p><p> None of us has any problem with a military Ministry overseeing aid.  In Liberia in the ebola crisis the US military helped build the roads and infrastructure that allowed aid to be delivered.  But when it is used, manipulated and controlled to deny those who need it most, that is a problem.  There are other alternatives.  The situation also benefits Abbott.  The spotlight here is on the UN agencies including the WHO but other companies find ways to get over the sanctions and they are equally in need of scrutiny.</p><p> I wanted to show the committee the next slide because it represents to me the obscenity of the Syrian regime.  This is Moaz and Nawras, who were conjoined twins born in eastern Ghouta in July 2016.  I am a paediatrician and have worked in many war-torn countries including Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan.  I have also worked in First World countries such as England, Australia and America and although I have seen lots of different things, I had never seen conjoined twins.  The doctors in eastern Ghouta are faced with siege, chemical attacks, outbreaks of infectious disease and trauma in addition to diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and then they were faced with these twins, these tiny little pieces of newborn humanity.  After a lot of effort we managed to get the twins into Damascus and there were many international offers to take them to a centre where they could be safely separated with a multidisciplinary expert team.  They were eventually allowed to be brought into Damascus with their mother who was breastfeeding them.  They were joined at the chest.  They could have lived their entire lives as conjoined; that they were breastfeeding tells us they were well.  Then they suddenly died.  The mother was not allowed to breastfeed them for five days and then they were reported dead and buried.  To the best of our knowledge, this is because the Syrian regime decided to try to separate them itself.  If it had succeeded, it would have been a great PR croup and if it did not succeed, they did not actually care.  They did not want to allow babies that could remind the whole world that there are babies in Syria too.  They could not let that out beyond their control.  If they cannot let these babies survive, there is not much hope for anyone else.</p><p> I have provided a lot of resources for the committee to review.  The next slide shows an illustration of the way convoys are controlled.  Convoys are just a drop in the ocean of the aid effort.  The current situation is that aid goes into Damascus.  All agencies have to partner with SARC which is corrupted, as I have said.  One of the leading figures is Tammam Mahriz, a nephew of Assef Shawkat who before his death in 2012 was the head of military intelligence.  It is very sad because there are thousands of volunteers who are brave on the ground, who are doing their best to still get aid to those who need it most but they themselves are shot, executed, arrested and tortured for that same crime of trying to help those who actually need it.  In addition to being already staffed by key people in the intelligence forces, after 2011, many more intelligence agents posed as volunteers from the bottom to be able to observe and inform on their colleagues.  At the top, those who were experienced and qualified were dismissed and replaced by retired military officers who belonged the regime and were known for their loyalty.  SARC is controlled by the agencies.</p><p> In an authoritarian regime, there are a lot of different branches of security forces.  I have included an illustration of that in the supporting documents also.  What happened eventually after a couple of years was that in order to exert maximum control over aid, the intelligence forces themselves had to form a co-ordinating agency in order to make sure they were all talking to each other as well as with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health, which is charged with deleting agencies and deleting the lifesaving supplies from all the convoys.</p><p>This is all done by the department of preparedness which I describe as the "department of deletion".  The department is run by Dr. Al Hajjaj al-Sharaa who is the individual in the photograph dressed in red.  His agency deletes all life-saving supplies from the lists, which means that instead of a supply of adrenaline or insulin, lice shampoo and empty jerry cans will be received.  Dr. al-Sharaa is one of the owners of the national non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that are approved and accredited by the Syrian Government.  He is, therefore, well positioned to redirect supplies and resources to his agency, Al Cham for Health, one of the major implementing partners for the World Health Organization, the UNHCR and UNICEF to provide mobile health services.  He is also one of the staff at the warehouse who ensures none of the life-saving supplies makes it onto the convoys.  These staff check the list carefully.  It is then sealed with a seal from the intelligence forces before leaving.  One of the most recent convoys towards the end of last year reached the warehouse in Ghouta, but the warehouse was then bombed by the government to make sure nothing was used.  The convoy in question included 50 dialysis sets which would have kept people alive for another week or two, but even it was bombed.</p><p> I will explain what the weaponisation of health care means.  Collateral damage is usually the primary reason for the deaths of civilians in war.  However, that is not the case in Syria where civilians are the target.  There are various ways of pursuing a strategy of suppressing and repressing a revolution which started as a protest for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.  One way of doing so is to arrest and torture demonstrators.  Military intelligence, air force security and the ministry of defence have thousands of black sites where they keep hundreds of thousands of disappeared persons, many of whom have been tortured and held for years.</p><p> Another way of doing so is to control health care delivery.  As I stated, one week into the protests, the hospitals which were under the control of the ministries of health and higher education were informed that they would not be allowed to provide aid for anyone hurt in demonstrations.  In response field hospitals were established, one of which was located in an ancient mosque in Dera'a.  On 21 March 2011 medical personnel were providing care for more than 50 people in the field hospital when a student protest outside, attended by a few hundred unarmed protestors holding olive branches, was attacked by military forces, including Iranian forces.  The mosque put out a call and one of the doctors responded in an ambulance.  They managed to pick up one patient who had been shot by the security forces.  He was thrown into the ambulance which was then hijacked by the Iranian military on its way back to the field hospital.  The driver was shot and killed; the doors were opened and machine gun fire killed the doctor and critically injured the nurse.  The patient was shot six more times.</p><p> The massacre that day was covered up and when one reads reports, they suggest only six people died because that is the number for which we have records.  No one believed Bashar al-Assad, a doctor in training to be an ophthalmologist, would exert this level of brutality.  We have since documented the direct killing of more than 900 doctors for the crime of assisting people injured by the Syrian Government.  This tactic was even legislated for in July 2012 and, as a result, a person who does what my colleagues and I do is designated a criminal and a terrorist and charged as such.  Hundreds of attacks on hospitals across Syria have led to a policy of building underground hospitals to provide protection from bombing.  It is a testimony to a country that has not been allowed to have a civil society and the depths of relationships and networks among Syrians that they have been able to create this informal and decentralised health system which has endeavoured to meet massive needs.  The needs of Syria have gone from primarily being first world needs to encompassing the whole spectrum, including outbreaks of infectious diseases such as polio, cholera, typhoid and tuberculosis to chemical attacks, which we were not trained in medical school to treat. </p><p> The map shows that the attacks take place according to area and are directed at any opposition held area or any area that has been politically antipathetic.  It shows the trajectory of the attacks during they years, although it is a little difficult to see this.  The slide features an analysis of attacks on hospitals since 2012.  It shows intentionality and that attacks are continuous and systematic.  The only time they stop is when the hospital has been destroyed and no longer needs to be attacked.</p><p> Ghouta was besieged shortly after the chemical massacre of August 2013 which was highly visible to the eyes of the world.  Who can forget the images of the naked, limp bodies of recently killed children?  A siege is invisible.  Irish people are familiar with starvation as a weapon of war and the withholding of food and creation of famine as a political weapon.  This practice was imposed on Ghouta shortly after the chemical massacre.  The second picture which was taken two years ago shows my colleagues in Ghouta.  They were very tired at the time and their message was to stop the killing of civilians.  At the end of last year the co-ordinates of the hospitals were published to show the government where they were located.  That the government subsequently bombed these hospitals shows that the destruction of hospitals in full view has been a deliberate and intentional policy.  The next picture shows a patient who died in a hospital in Ghouta.</p><p> Last week the widow of one of my great colleagues called me to say Kafr Zita hospital in Hama was being targeted again.  The hospital has been bombed hundreds of times and forced to move many times.  Unfortunately, when the Russians entered the conflict with much better weapons than the Syrian forces, they were able to destroy hospitals much more quickly and, as members can see, their attacks are highly effective.</p><p> Members will recall the Khan Sheikhoun chemical massacre of this time last year.  Khan Sheikhoun is an entirely civilian area.  Government forces first dropped barrel bombs on it.  People's response to barrel bombing is to take cover underground in basements and caves because this offers the best protection.  Shortly afterwards, there was a sarin attack.  Chemicals sink into basements and caves because they are heavier than air.  Government forces first put people in a position of maximum vulnerability in order that they would then suffer horrendously.  People did not want to go to hospital because they knew that they would be targeted.  However, sarin does not wear off and survivors of the attack had to go to hospital.  The Russians were able to track their movements, discover hospitals that had not been destroyed and target them immediately as people arrived.</p><p> Last month, in Hamouria and Douma in eastern Ghouta, government forces dropped chemicals to force people who had been living underground for weeks in an effort to protect themselves from the dedicated barrel bombs and missiles to go back on to the streets again.</p><p>They dropped chemicals to force them into the streets where they were then gunned down by machine guns in helicopters.  As someone who has worked in many wars, I have never seen such brutality and obscenity.  The egregious manipulation and exploitation of the aid response means that the generosity of the Irish, which is renowned, is contributing towards profiteering by the Syrian Government, the same people who are responsible for the crisis, which must be addressed.  Another example can demonstrate some of the ways in which Syrian aid in the hands of the military is corrupted and misused.  I would also like to provide the opportunity for questions.</p></speech>

Over the past number of years, the committee has heard very graphic descriptions of the horror inflicted on innocent people in Syria, the displacement, the loss of life and the never-ending conflict.  Her contribution today again highlights the savagery imposed on so many innocent people.  In excess of 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and 5.6 million people are in acute need.  Dr. Sparrow said that the people most in need of humanitarian aid are not getting it.  It is a horror story.  As she quite rightly said, it is the worst crisis in history.</p> <p>  We will take questions from members.  Unfortunately we are on a tight time schedule.  Ireland will take the chair of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance support group in June.  It is an opportunity for our country to play a leadership role in ensuring aid to Syria is delivered effectively and in line with humanitarian principles.  It is obvious to us that the principle of the impartial delivery of humanitarian aid has not been adhered to over the past number of years.</p> <p>  I am sure the committee will agree to bring the very important issues raised today to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Department officials.  We will ask them to ensure that when Ireland takes over the chair of the support group that it works in the most diligent and effective way possible to try to ensure humanitarian aid gets to the people who are most in need.</p> <p>  Due to time constraints we will take three questions together and then go back to Dr. Sparrow for a further contribution.  I will call Senator Bacik, who will be followed by Deputies Niall Collins and Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018051000002#E00300"><p>I thank Dr. Sparrow for her moving presentation.  As the Chair said, we have heard other eyewitness accounts of the war in Syria but she has described graphically and clearly the horrific impact of the war on children, in particular, and the outrageous brutality of the regime.  Many of us have sought to put that to the Russian government representatives here, as well as to people who have appeared before us who have been, in effect, apologists for the regime in Syria.  I thank her for appearing before the committee and making a very powerful presentation.</p> <p>  She wanted to highlight some things to us and for us to highlight with our Government, the UN and the EU the withholding or controlling of aid distribution by the Syrian Government for its own purposes and, allied to that, the weaponisation of healthcare, including the targeting of medical personnel, hospitals, clinics and so on.  Above all, she raised the impact on civilians, especially children, that has had during the years of the war.</p> <p>  How do we address these issues?  I have read some of Dr. Sparrow's work, in particular her critique of the WHO which she described as having become an apologist for Assad atrocities.  I read a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which pointed out that Ireland has contributed over &euro;100 million to the Syrian crisis since 2012, our largest ever response to a single crisis.  Clearly, we are stakeholders in this.  Our briefing also tells us that our support inside Syria is mostly channelled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, including the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, SARC, which is best placed to respond on the ground, including hard to reach areas.</p> <p>  If the view is taken that SARC is the body through which aid can most effectively be distributed, what is the alternative?  If we are seeking to ensure that the aid distribution is not corrupted by the regime, as Dr. Sparrow described, how else can we reach the 5.6 million civilians who are in hard to reach or besieged areas?  We have carried out an extensive review of Irish Aid programmes.  We have heard in other contexts about the difficulty for aid delivery programmes in conflict situations and how quite often aid agencies and Governments have to work with deeply corrupt and brutal regimes in order to be pragmatic in the delivery of aid to the people who need it most.  How else do we address this and deliver aid, other than through co-operation with SARC, in particular, or other bodies that are otherwise compromised by the regime?</p> <p>  I have had the privilege of meeting the white helmets, who are superb front line humanitarian workers.  I am conscious that beyond the white helmets, who are working in the most horrific conditions, there is a need for a network for aid distribution at a broader level.  Is that why the WHO and other agencies are working with government-controlled bodies?  Do they see that as the only way to deliver aid?  Does Dr. Sparrow have an alternative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018051000002#E00400"><p>I thank Dr. Sparrow for her presentation.  It was very insightful and had an impact on me.  This may not be Dr. Sparrow's area of expertise, but I ask her to outline her view of the implementation of the sanctions which are or are not being imposed on named individuals within the regime.  How effective are they?  What should be done?  What more can be done in regard to sanctions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018051000002#E00500"><p>I find this most frustrating.  When I was Minister for Defence I visited troops in Lebanon and went to Syria to try to keep in contact with the regime because our troops were under fire from rogues who came from Syria.  That was over 20 years ago.  I find this a most frustrating problem because nobody seems to know exactly what the likes of us, as politicians in Ireland, can do at a practical level to contribute towards the solution to this problem.  Aid is one thing and, of course, people in distress need help.  Ireland has a tradition of doing its bit in respect of aid, but there seems to be no possibility that an end may come to all of this.  That is the most frustrating thing for me.</p> <p>  Can Dr. Sparrow give us some light?  We hear all of the bad stories.  We know who is involved, who is propping up the regime and all of that type of thing, but the reality is from afar.  Given that we have, if I remember correctly, about 500 troops in Lebanon it is very important to Ireland but has never been discussed.  It is possible that there will be spillover from time to time, in particular where our troops are located.  I am frustrated to have to ask Dr. Sparrow whether she would ask us to do one, two or three things of a practical nature to try to bring a solution of some kind to the situation.</p><p>It is all very fine to condemn Russia and so on but condemnation will not bring about a solution to this problem.  I am searching for a ray of hope whereby if actions were taken in a certain direction, there might be a solution to the problem but there does not seem to be any talk of this.</p></speech>

It is a huge task, unfortunately, as Deputy Barrett said, but has she specific proposals that she could outline to us which we, in turn, we could advocate to our Government and it could promote at the Council of Foreign Ministers or at the UN.  We would be glad to hear specific proposals from her, if it is possible to condense them.  I do not take from the gravity of the situation and the huge task that lies ahead to bring peace to the region.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Annie Sparrow" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018051000002#F00300"><p>There are things that are being done that are pragmatic and will mitigate the disaster while providing a way forward.  One of the most important is cross-border aid, the bulk of which goes through Turkey.  The Syrian regime was able to assert sovereignty to control aid because it has a seat at the UN and sovereignty is a primary principle of the organisation.  Syria is backed by Russia and China.  Thanks to the persistent work of many governments and other key organisations in July 2014 cross-border resolution 2165 was put in place, which is a binding resolution of the Security Council and carries the most weight.  That provides the legal authority for all cross-border aid.  It is important to renew this because the assistance provided through cross-border aid is not obvious.  More than 2 million people in Idlib can be easily accessed from Turkey still while Dahal in the south is accessible from Jordan.  As the war appears to wind down, now that Ghouta has fallen, although the pattern of extermination or oppression of the civilians left in hospitals continues in Idlib, there has been talk of reconstruction and rehabilitation.  There is a massive need in the country where life expectancy has fallen from 71 years before the war in 2010 to 55 years.  That is a measure of the devastating public health crisis, which was not created by the sanctions, as is claimed by some people.  That is a measure of the pre-existing policies, which were compounded by the weaponisation of healthcare and an inability to do surveillance of these most important global threats.</p> <p>  Renewing a cross-border resolution provides the possibility not only for Irish NGOs, such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern, Goal and Catholic Relief Services, to work from Syria but to provide direct support and funding to the massive health services provided by the Syrians themselves with much greater accountability.  It is important to do that as well because it offers a pragmatic way to do the surveillance of infectious disease, which Turkey is behind because of the potential regional spread of diseases such as polio, TB and cholera.  Ireland can get behind cross-border renewal, which is important, and instead of Damascus asking Russia to put pressure on Turkey to shut it down, it is good governance to keep it open.  If that leverage is lost, more control will be in the hands of Damascus.  When the resolution came into effect, SARC, as an International Red Cross agent, was allowed to dramatically increase the number of cross-line convoys because the government wanted to take back control.  The resolution offers the leverage to make sure the government will give more aid in order that it can maintain control but if the government is permitted to have full control of aid by taking away the cross-border authority, it will not have to do anything.</p> <p>  Some of the sanctions were offset by the financial support of Russia, China and Iran.  It is an interesting question.  The US designated Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1978 and it cut off aid.  The EU tried hard to use financial incentives and access to the European market.  By the time the war happened, the Union was Syria's most important trading partner.  Economic sanctions had no impact on curbing Assad's atrocities.  He got through the first couple of years with the aid and support of Iran, China and Russia and then the massive multi-billion infusion of UN aid money was incredibly important.  As well as the legitimacy it gave to a dictator surrounded by war criminals, it converted them into a state and a government.  The fact that the UN has imposed no sanctions because of the Russian veto means the Syrian Government uses the UN to bypass all the sanctions.  Countries or agencies will still work with the government such as ABET in America or companies that partnered with Russia recently.  It is a form of economic prostitution.  Politically, we can still call them out.  These are war crimes committed by war criminals and the UN has agreed a special prosecutor to investigate war crimes.  That was established in December 2016.  Clearly it is a slow effort but the precedent for this is Kosovo where criminals were, ultimately, brought to justice with international endorsement, which we all believe in.  We must still find ways to make the UN stronger.  By endorsing and working with Assad, it brings the level of acceptable behaviour down to the lowest common denominator.</p> <p>  Ireland is an important state, which has good governance, is democratic and believes in basic human rights.  For example, the country is currently debating the eighth amendment.  The influence it has to talk about the conflict still is incredibly important.  The country can get behind innovations.  For example, even if the healthcare system is rebuilt, including all the hospitals and clinics, there is no one left to staff it.  More than 15,000 doctors have left Syria with 1,000 killed and hundreds more incarcerated or disappeared.  None of them will return and there are no resources for the system.  Ireland can support an innovative and a pragmatic policy such as the accreditation of healthcare workers because the Syrian Government will not accredit anyone working as a doctor.  There are medical students there who are the equivalent of vascular surgeons because of the experience they have gained but they cannot ever be recognised or paid.  The only way to bring professionals back to Syria is to recognise them, give them status and allow them to be paid as such.  That will require innovative but pragmatic tools.  This also applies to teachers, architects and engineers who are required for the water systems.  Medicine, in particular, is always controlled by the government.</p><p>The WHO has the authority, as a body, to get behind that and every country in the world has medical schools.  Last night I was at the Royal College of Surgeons to support a curriculum and an accreditation system that allow people to return.</p><p> There are some positive things that can be done.  In a world of pandemics and the threat of infectious disease, germs are frequent flyers and do not respect sovereignty.  The only way we can provide care to people, especially children, and alleviate their misery by controlling their disease, is with resources.  No one has access to health unless they have a doctor.  This is why the weaponisation of healthcare works - no man stays where there is no doctor to safely deliver his wife's baby or no place to educate children.</p><p> A radical but effective sanction would be targeted sanctions against the sons and daughters of the regime so that they cannot access the desirable colleges across Europe and Great Britain.  Bashar Jaafari's daughter applied to Columbia University in New York.  People say we do not want to punish the children of the regime but Assad is British educated and his wife is British born, and also highly educated.  They would respond much more quickly to a ban on their children attending prestigious Ivy League colleges.  They would stop their war crimes, bombing schools and hospitals more quickly if we said they had to educate their children in their own country.  It is a controversial suggestion but students at Columbia lobbied hard and said they did not agree with this.</p><p> Harnessing the power of solidarity and finding things we all agree on are important.  Health and education are massively important in this and there are partners in Lebanon who provide health and education to Syrians using Syrian teachers.  There are enough teachers in the refugee population to teach the Syrian curriculum, which cannot be done in Lebanon because it wants to teach its own curriculum.  One cannot teach Syrian kids science through French because they do not know the language.</p><p> There are many things that can be done but the cross-border resolution allows aid to be provided and for NGOs to be put in directly and to establish innovative programmes like accreditation, which will bring people back as everyone wants.  It also allows the surveillance of infectious disease which is an issue of global governance.  The advent of blockchain can ensure a much greater level of accountability and donors will get the chance to direct their funding with clear knowledge of where their money is going, which will help the UN accommodate these things.  There are pragmatic, political and financial tools we can still use.</p></speech>

I am honoured to address the esteemed parliamentary committee and am grateful for this opportunity to share with members a glimpse of the Palestinian people's existence, resistance and inextinguishable insistence on freedom and self-determination after 70 years of colonial oppression.  Like all Palestinians, I feel more at home in Ireland than in any other western country.  Its heroic struggle against centuries of colonialism has always inspired Palestinians.  This is why I shall speak from the heart.<br/><br/>At a time when Israel's regime of military occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid is implementing a shoot-to-kill-or-maim policy against peaceful Palestinian protesters in Gaza marching for freedom and refugee rights, charitable rhetoric is not enough.  It is time for accountability.  The EU still votes as a bloc in support of UN resolutions upholding basic Palestinian rights, including the right of return, and condemning Israel's settlements as illegal, but it has yet to take effective measures of accountability against Israel.  In contrast, significant EU sanctions were imposed on Russia soon after its military takeover of the Crimea.<br/><br/>Despite Israel's descent into unmasked, right-wing extremism, particularly with the current escalation of its repression, and notwithstanding the EU's rhetoric, the Union, including Ireland, remains largely complicit in enabling and maintaining Israel's grave violations of Palestinian human rights.  Israel's serious breaches of international law trigger legal obligations for the EU, Israel's largest trade partner, and its member states.  As reiterated in the 2004 ruling by the International Court of Justice, ICJ, states must refrain from any act that would entail recognition of Israel's settlement enterprise and from providing any form of assistance that maintains the illegal situation arising from it.  By trading with Israel's illegal settlements and supporting companies that are involved in the settlement enterprise, as defined by the UN, the EU is violating both obligations of non-recognition and non-assistance.<br/><br/>The EU, including Ireland, maintains a web of military relations, weapons research, banking transactions and settlement trade with Israeli companies, banks and institutions that are deeply implicated in violating our rights.  For example, the EU imports goods from the Israeli settlements at an estimated annual value of $300 million.  Through its Horizon 2020 research programme, the EU has approved more than 200 projects with Israeli companies, such as Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, that are accused of deep complicity in war crimes and possible crimes against humanity.  Another Israeli beneficiary of EU funding is Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, a main hub for developing Israeli weapon systems used to perpetrate crimes against Palestinian civilians.  Merely labelling some of the illegal products of Israeli colonies instead of banning them is considered by Palestinians as yet another EU failure to uphold European and international law.<br/><br/>As Israel's regime becomes more overtly associated with the global far right, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic groups in the United States and Europe, and as it becomes the model for Trump's xenophobic policies, its popularity continues to sink.  A recent BBC poll shows that Israel has the fourth lowest popularity rating among many countries.  Crucially, support for holding Israel to account is growing among Jewish Americans and the broader US public.<br/><br/>Israel is intensifying its land-grabbing construction of illegal settlements and walls in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.  It is tightening its fatal siege of 2 million people in Gaza, denying them basic necessities while counting the <i>per capita</i>calories that are allowed in.  The UN predicts that Gaza will be unlivable by 2020.  Israel is entrenching what even the US Department of State once characterised as a system of &quot;Institutional, legal, and societal discrimination&quot; against Palestinian citizens of present day Israel, enforced by more than 65 racist laws.  It also continues to deny the internationally recognised rights of Palestinians in exile, who account for 50% of all Palestinians.<br/><br/>In light of this ongoing <i>Nakba</i>, and given the failure of the international community to hold Israel to account, the non-violent, Nobel Peace Prize nominated Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, BDS, movement for Palestinian rights was launched in 2005 by the broadest coalition in Palestinian civil society.  It calls for an end to the 1967 occupation, full equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.  Anchored in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, BDS has consistently and categorically opposed all forms of racism and discrimination, including anti-Semitism, anti-black racism and Islamophobia.  We uphold that one's identity should never diminish one's entitlement to rights.  The BDS movement is supported by a near consensus in Palestinian society.  Days ago, the Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, which is the sole legitimate representative of our people, reiterated its support for BDS.<br/><br/>At the most basic level, Palestinians are calling on Ireland, the EU and the world at large to uphold their profound moral and legal responsibility to do no harm to us.  Beyond responsibility, we are asking for solidarity, not charity.  In a show of effective and genuine Irish solidarity with the Palestinian struggle a few weeks ago, Dublin became the first European capital to adopt BDS for Palestinian rights.  Derry was the first Irish city, in 2016, to endorse BDS.  The Irish trade union movement, the student movement, artists and academics across Ireland have adopted BDS in support of Palestinian rights.<br/><br/>In response to the impressive growth of support for Palestinian rights, particularly through BDS, and evoking memories of McCarthyism, Israel has waged a global war on the movement since 2014, including extensive propaganda, legal warfare and espionage.  A desperate Israeli Government Minister has established a &quot;tarnishing unit&quot; to smear Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights defenders in the BDS movement while another has publicly threatened us - my name was mentioned in that threat - with &quot;targeted civil assassination&quot;.  Amnesty International has condemned these threats.  Ireland, along with the EU in general, Sweden, the Netherlands and others, has upheld the right to call for BDS against Israel to achieve Palestinian rights as a matter of freedom of expression.<br/><br/>To fulfil Ireland's obligations under international law <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Palestinian people, we appeal to the committee to consider the following concrete measures of accountability: imposing a two-way military embargo on Israel, as was done against apartheid South Africa and as has been called for by Amnesty International; banning the import of products of companies implicated in Israel's illegal settlement enterprise and ensuring that companies involved in grave misconduct, such as HP and G4S, are excluded from State tendering processes in line with the EU directive on this matter; supporting the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement until Israel abides by its human rights clause; halting all financial transactions with Israeli banks that finance Israel's settlement enterprise; and stop considering the import of Israeli natural gas or electric power, given Israel's pillage of Palestinian energy resources.<br/><br/>Yeats once wrote: &quot;I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.&quot;  He also wrote: &quot;In dreams begin responsibility&quot;.  Indeed, in presenting my people's dreams and aspirations before the committee, I sincerely hope that members shall not tread on our dreams of dignity, emancipation and a just peace, but will act with responsibility to make them come true.</p></speech>

I think he has set out very succinctly why Ireland should support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, BDS, programme.  I am personally a supporter of it.  I am proud to support it on behalf of Labour, my party.  Students' unions across Ireland have backed it, as have other unions.  We need to act on it.  I would ask, on a related issue that we have heard about in this committee and which some of us have been working on, the systematic demolition of Palestinian infrastructure by the Israeli authorities, notably of EU-funded Palestinian infrastructure.  Mr. Barghouti might say a word about that.  I have always thought that was strong leverage within the EU for Ireland to take a position in defence of the funding that the EU has provided for structures that have since been dismantled or destroyed by Israeli authorities as part of the illegal settlement programme.  I express my support and thank Mr. Barghouti for coming.</p></speech>

Over the last years, Israel has intensified its demolition of Palestinian homes, schools, clinics and just about all infrastructure Palestinians have built, especially in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank that is under Israel's military and security control, where Palestinians cannot do anything without Israeli permission.  Despite these projects being funded by the EU and although the heads of missions of EU states in Jerusalem have always raised the facts very clearly to their capitals, there has been no accountability.  There has just been rhetoric of condemnation, even very light condemnation, without any action on the ground.  There has not been one measure to hold Israel to account or request that it pays back European tax money that has been invested in supporting Palestinian infrastructure.  This really raises the question of why Israel is put on a pedestal above international law.  As Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa once asked, why does it get away with all these violations of international law with no accountability?</p></speech>

My party supports BDS.  In Ireland, we are very proud of the Dunnes Stores workers.  Many years ago, they worked for Dunnes Stores here in Ireland and took a stand against apartheid in South Africa.  We celebrate them today because they were absolutely vindicated.  It strikes me that the boycott campaign internationally, against the apartheid regime in South Africa, had a successful impact eventually.  It was a successful campaign.  It was a way of peacefully conveying our opposition to what happened.  The efforts that the Israeli state has gone to with some of its allies, to undermine a peaceful and dignified opportunity for those in the international community to express their opposition to what has happened to the Palestinian people, are remarkable.  There is also their frustration at their own political leaders for their failure to take decisive action on behalf of the Palestinian people.  I believe that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people are in solidarity with the cause of the Palestinian people.  I believe that the overwhelming majority of Irish people believe that we should do what is dignified and peaceful to support the Palestinian people.</p> <p>  We hoped to bring legislation through the Upper House, the Seanad, relating to the banning of goods from illegal settlements internationally, which would obviously also include the occupied territories in Palestine.  That legislation has been deferred and will, I believe, come before the Upper House later this year.  I want to get Mr. Barghouti's views on that legislation.  What would that mean to the Palestinian people if it was passed?  On events in Gaza, and the shootings and killings of Palestinian protestors, what is the mood relating to that?  Can we get an update on the imprisonment of Ahed Tamimi and other Palestinian children and on what we can do in Ireland?  On the wider issue of Jerusalem and the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital by the American Trump Administration, what are the reactions and repercussions in Palestine?  What is the current mood among Palestinians?  I am conscious that BDS is an initiative of the Palestinian grassroots civil society as distinct from the political leadership.  There have not been elections in Palestine for a long time so how can we really assess who the political leaders in Palestine are if there have not been elections in a long time?  I would look at Palestinian civil society as being representative of the Palestinian people.  What are the views of all of these matters among civil society?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising those very important points.  We deeply appreciate Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the BDS movement.  It is important that the Senator has mentioned South Africa in this context because Ireland, in particular, played a leading role in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against apartheid South Africa.  Although British artists like to think that they were the first, Irish artists were the first to call for a cultural boycott of South Africa.  South Africans and Palestinians know this history quite well.  Regarding some of the issues the Senator has raised, regardless of the BDS movement, Palestinians are asking Ireland and other states to fulfil their legal obligations.</p> <p>  This is a key issue connected to the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, which was deferred, as the Senator mentioned, which would prohibit the entrance into Ireland of products of illegally built settlements in occupied territories, which obviously applies to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as defined by the United Nations.  We think this would be a basic first step.  It does not fulfil all of Ireland's obligations.  It is the beginning of fulfilling Ireland's obligations under international law.  We do not buy the pseudo-legal argument made by the Government about why it is deferring this, saying that it abides by EU directives and laws.  There is nothing in EU legislation that would prevent Ireland or any European state that is a member of the EU from fulfilling its legal obligations.  Those obligations are triggered because settlements are considered a war crime in international law.  Building settlements is a war crime.  It triggers legal obligations for all countries.  This is basic international law.  Ireland is obligated by it and it became part of domestic Irish law that international law applies in Ireland.</p> <p>  Another point is military embargo.  One of the main slogans raised by the tens of thousands of unarmed protestors in Gaza, protesting against the siege and for the right of return for refugees, is for a military embargo now.  Amnesty has called for a military embargo.  That is a basic responsibility, to export no weapons to an area of conflict regardless of what one's opinions are on the conflict.  The Irish Government claims that it does not have much of a military trade but some facts we have seen show that millions of euro worth of weapons, weapon parts or technology used for weaponry or military purposes are bought from and sold to Israel.</p><p>The Irish Government claims that it does not have much military trade but evidence we have seen shows that there is, indeed, millions of euro worth of weapons, weapon parts or technology used for weaponry and for military purposes being sold to and brought from Israel.  This needs to stop because the highest priority demand of the Palestinians everywhere is to stop arms trade with Israel.</p><p> Regarding Ms Ahed Tamimi and the hundreds of other Palestinian children in Israel prisons, this issue has been raised even in the US Congress, where it is really difficult, and several congressmen and women have courageously sponsored a Bill that would withhold US aid to Israel equivalent to the amount used in detaining, interrogating and torturing Palestinian children.  Coming from the US, from the belly of the beast, as it were, this would be an important move, and we hope that Ireland can push the EU to take similar action, not only of condemnation but accountability, on child prisoners in Israeli prisons.</p><p> The Trump Administration's Jerusalem embassy move is very dangerous, not only for Palestinians but for the entire region, if not the world.  Trump is undoing decades of US foreign policy and he is isolating US policy from the international consensus.  The United Nations and an absolute majority of nations around the world do not recognise Israeli sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and all of them recognise East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory.  In fact, Trump is isolating the US from this international consensus.  In a way, he is lighting a powder keg in a dangerous way in a very volatile area to start with.  We think this will enable Israel to build more settlements, to kill more Palestinians, to arrest more children, and to confiscate more Palestinian land and continuing with its ethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians, especially in East Jerusalem to colonise the city.</p><p> Finally, on civil society and the political leadership, the Chairman is absolutely right that there has not been any election in a number of years for Palestinians.  However, most recently, the PLO, which still symbolises the leadership of the Palestinian people everywhere despite its many problems and despite many demands to democratise the PLO, has adopted BDS.  Even the highest authority among the Palestinians has adopted BDS.  Among civil society, NGOs, trade unions, women's unions, academics and farmers' unions, there is wall-to-wall support for BDS.  Every main entity among Palestinians, in Palestine as well as in exile, has adopted BDS as one of the most effective popular resistance movements and as the most effective movement of solidarity with Palestinian rights.</p></speech>

In general terms, with regard to the encroaching settlements which have existed for some time now, how feasible is the two-state solution now?  A former foreign Minister of our country, the late Brian Lenihan senior, was the first person in the European Union to advocate for, and then have, a distinct policy in regard to that, and it is one that is held strongly in this country.  How feasible is it nowadays?</p></speech>

As a human rights movement, we stick to the basis three rights: ending the occupation, ending the system of Apartheid and the right of return.</p> <p>  My personal opinion is that the two-state solution has not been feasible for quite some time.  Especially with the Trump-Netanyahu far-right alliance and the support of the far right around the world, it has become even less possible than ever before.  In reality, we have one state already, one Apartheid state, with different rights allocated to different groups depending on their ethnicity and religion.  This was seen as extremely racist and frowned upon by the entire world when it was the case in South Africa but it is tolerated by almost all states today around the world while it is happening in Palestine.  We already have one state under Israeli control with Apartheid laws applying to Palestinians.  Even Palestinian citizens of present-day Israel suffer from more than 65 discriminatory laws.  Even if we forget the Occupied West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem, for now, we still have a system of Apartheid within Israel itself.  It is not so feasible.</p> <p>  The main point is not theoretically.  It is, what is needed to push for a just peace?  The world is stuck in a dogmatic obsession with two states and one, and this is not the real issue.  The real issue is rights.  In the Oslo Accords, the big omission was of human rights.  There was no mention of human rights in the entire Oslo agreement between the PLO and Israel.  What the world needs to push Israel to accept is that it has to meet its obligations under international law and respect Palestinian rights.  That is the main element that is missing.</p> <p>  The second point is accountability.  Israel has total impunity.  It is drunk with power, given Trump's blanket support.  Without accountability, it will not only endanger our very existence as a nation in our homeland, but endanger the entire region and, therefore, the world.</p></speech>

The main point is whether the EU is meeting its obligations to stop enabling and endorsing Israel's crimes against Palestinians.  Distracting our attention from this very important obligation with an empty rhetorical political debate about whether the two-state solution is the best solution or not does not serve anyone's purposes if a real just and durable peace is what we all aim to achieve.</p></speech>

In the European Union's discussion of the two-state solution, there is no mention today of the basic rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, for example.  They represent 12% of the entire Palestinian people and they live under conditions of Apartheid with dozens of laws discriminating against them.  The current discussion about the two-state solution just speaks of fulfilling the Palestinian right to self-determination by establishing an independent state in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem.  That is fine, but what does one do with the rights of refugees?  Fifty per cent of the Palestinians live in exile.  Even among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, a significant minority are refugees.  What does one do with the Palestinian citizens of Israel?  Without addressing the three rights, no solution will be ethical and no solution will, therefore, be sustainable.  To be sustainable, a solution has to be comprehensive.  It has to fulfil the basic rights of all Palestinians, not only the convenient part - the 38% who live in Gaza and the West Bank.  Those are only 38% of the entire Palestinian people.  If the EU was serious, it would have to address the basic rights of all Palestinians.</p></speech>

As an outsider looking in, Israel has from time to time changed its style of leadership.  I would have thought that the present regime would be the least favourable towards the Palestinian situation.  That is an outsider's view looking in.  At the end of the day, there is no solution to this problem unless we get a reasonable Israeli approach to dealing with the Palestinian problem.  It is one matter condemning Israel.  I believe that within Israel, which I have visited, there is a great deal of sympathy towards the Palestinian situation but that is not probably reflected in the manner in which the present regime goes about its business.  From time to time, the situation has become fluid because of changes of regimes within Israel but in trying to find a solution to the problem, we cannot move with the change of regime.  As a country, our approach would be, along with the EU, to try to find an overall solution to this ongoing problem.</p><p>I appreciate where Mr. Barghouti is coming from and what he represents.  However, in trying to find a solution to the problem wise heads are needed in the long term.  Taking polar positions will not bring a solution that is to the benefit of the unfortunate people who have to live under these circumstances.</p></speech>

On the basis of the Oslo Accords everyone in Europe subscribed to the two-state solution and the idea of the Palestinian people having their own state, limited as it is.</p> <p>  I was in the occupied territories some years back.  A presentation was made by an eminent professor.  He demonstrated to us the nature of the actual land in possession of Palestinian people today.  I understand it is approximately 5% of historical Palestine.  There is no two-state solution.  When I saw the presentation I was shocked to the core.  There is no feasible Palestinian state left because we have allowed the Oslo Accords, limited as they were, to be ripped to shreds by occupied territories, settlements and the carving up of the limited territories.  It would be useful to hear some testimony and Mr. Barghouti is far better qualified than me in that regard.  My understanding is based on a presentation from some years back.  It would be useful to hear some comment about the reality of what is in the possession of the Palestinians today.</p></speech>

They were not involved in some husband-and-wife conflict in which a therapist is needed to bring them together to talk about peace.  I am certain that the absolute majority of the Irish people then were seeking justice.  I imagine they expected everyone throughout the world to hold the British accountable for crimes of colonialism committed in Ireland over centuries and to support the Irish quest for freedom and self-determination.</p> <p>  Similarly, Palestinians have sought nothing more than our right to freedom, justice, equality and self-determination.  We are asking for people to do no harm.  That is not much of a charitable act.  It is a profound moral obligation to do no harm.  By doing nothing the EU, including Ireland, is doing harm to us.  By continuing to support or to be apathetic towards Israeli crimes, the EU, including Ireland, is doing harm.  Importing settlement goods and products and trading with companies that are complicit in Israel's violations amounts to doing harm.  Doing no harm, which is a profound obligation, is what we are asking for.</p> <p>  This should apply regardless of whether the current Israeli regime is the most racist in Israel's history, which it is.  Since 2015, Israel has elected the most far right government ever.  The premise of extraordinary sympathy for Palestinian rights among Israelis is not borne by empirical facts.  Almost all polls, studies and surveys that we have seen in recent years show an absolute majority of Israelis supporting the current government.  They support the racist policies, including those relevant to within Israel and not only in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.  A majority of Jewish Israelis today say they do not want to live next to a Palestinian within present day Israel, let alone the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>  Again, the point is not to consider this as a conflict of symmetric powers.  It is a colonial situation and a situation of apartheid, settler colonialism and occupation.  That means obligations are triggered.  Accountability is the most important issue.  Of course we need Israelis ultimately to agree on a just peace.  We cannot achieve it alone.  How do we get them there?  Is it by using carrots, carrots and more carrots?  The EU has provided tonnes of carrots during the past decades but to no avail.  Nothing has happened.  The EU has forgotten what a stick looks like when it comes to Israel.  With Russia, China and even the United States, the EU has adopted sanctions.  In recent decades the EU has imposed sanctions on every imaginable power on earth except on Israel.</p> <p>  When Palestinians accuse the EU of hypocrisy, double standards and putting Israel on a pedestal, we know what we are taking about.  There is no accountability.  That is the only thing that will entice a majority of Israelis to recognise that this is not sustainable.  They cannot have their cake and eat it too.  They cannot maintain oppression against Palestinians while enjoying free access to the European markets, military trade and so on.  No price is being paid by Israel for its crimes against the Palestinians.  We believe that making Israel pay for its crimes is the most important factor missing in getting a majority formed in Israel for a just peace.  I am not referring to a rhetorical peace that is lacking in justice and Palestinian rights.</p> <p>  A question was asked about Palestinians in Israel.  In fact, the relevant figure is 3%.  Palestinian citizens of Israel control only 3% of the land under Israel's control.  By law, not only by policy, Israel through some very convoluted laws and policies has kept 93% of the land under its control for Jewish development only.  This means if a person is a citizen of Israel but is not Jewish, that person is not entitled to the same rights as Jewish citizens to buy, lease or live on 93% of the land under the control of Israel.  That is the case even if we ignore the West Bank and Gaza.  In the West Bank, 60% of the most fertile land with water resources is controlled by Israel.  That is where settlements are growing most.</p> <p>  The general tendency, as has been rightly mentioned, is towards a shrinking space for Palestinians, shrinking land ownership by Palestinians and growing colonialisation of the entire land.  Oslo has acted as nothing more than a fig leaf for intense colonisation of Palestinian land, usurping Palestinian natural resources and demolishing more and more farms, lands and homes.  This is making it impossible for Palestinians - the indigenous people of the land - to continue living on most of the land of historical Palestine.  It is becoming less and less sustainable.  Gaza is the most extreme case.  We expect the territory to become unliveable in a year and a half.  The West Bank is not unliveable yet but it is becoming extremely difficult for Palestinians to sustain any life with the encroaching settlements taking over the most fertile lands and water resources.</p></speech>

The committee has also agreed to recommend to the D&aacute;il and Seanad that both Houses exercise the powers under protocol 5 of the Lisbon treaty to issue a reasoned opinion to EU institutions in respect of COM(2018)147 and COM(2018)148 regarding taxation of the digital economy.

I was shocked by the content of the interview.  I do not know how to explain it.  All we can do is extend our good wishes to her and her family and wish her the very best for the time ahead.  In my opinion the State has failed her.  She said this morning that she was dying when she did not have to.  She is one of the victims of this latest controversy.  One of the points she made was that the first obligation of Government is to keep its people safe and on this issue the people have not been kept safe.  There is a need for reform and for resignations in the appropriate places.  I acknowledge the bravery of this woman because she has done a lot for the women of this country.  I sympathise with her in the place she now finds herself in.</p></speech>

What really struck me was the fact that her anger outweighs her fear of dying.  If that does not say something on behalf of the women of Ireland, I am not sure what does.  If that does not force accountability on those who are responsible for the cover-ups and negligence, I do not know what it takes to do that.  I send our solidarity to her and her family and I thank her and Vicky and the other women for their bravery and courage and the service they are doing for this State, the service that has not been done by those who have been very highly paid to do so.</p></speech>

I can only imagine how difficult it was to speak publicly on that.  We were discussing earlier among ourselves how one would sit down with one's family and young children and explain to them that one was going to die when one should not be in that position.  The words today will have a long-lasting impact on many people here.  The pain that is felt by Emma Nic Mhath&uacute;na needs to be the nation's pain and her demand for accountability needs to be the nation's demand for accountability.  I raised this case last week with the T&aacute;naiste and I know my party leader raised it again yesterday.  My only regret is that we are now in a situation where the victims of this scandal have to pour their hearts out on national media to demand accountability.  We, on this committee, have worked well together demanding accountability from different sectors and it is important that we not only express our sympathy and solidarity with Emma and her family at this time, but also support her in her request for accountability.</p></speech>

It is a human tragedy and it behoves all of us to ensure that the truth, however unvarnished or uncomfortable it is, is reached and that there is accountability and justice.  Emma and her family have an incredibly difficult road ahead.  It is such a tragic situation and all we can do is extend our full support, our best wishes and be resolute in our commitment to get to the heart of the issues here and to ensure this kind of thing never happens again.</p></speech>

Emma Nic Mhath&uacute;na was more concerned for her children than she was for herself.  Emma is in the same situation as Vicky Phelan who has also spoken out.  We have to get to the truth and there has to be accountability.  Once again it is an issue around women and a young mother.  If something happens in life through no fault of one's own, and which is out of one's control, that is utterly frustrating but when it involves the loss of life, it is unforgivable.  Emma referred to meeting her medical people and I wish her well.  I have no words and as someone with a wife and a young family, the interview brought it home to me.  Ultimately, it is about human beings and there has to be accountability here.  I wish her well.  Words fail me on this occasion.</p> <p>  We have to get to the truth of this matter and there has to be accountability.  People need to look into their hearts and do the decent thing.  Emma spoke about feeling safe but she has been failed at a human level.  That is why it is so important that we get to the truth.  On a human level, words fail me in terms of the impact this has had on Emma and her family.</p><p>All of our work, such as when we consider legislation, can seem very dry on paper.  When one wants to make a judgment call on big issues then it is good to reflect on Emma, Vicky and the other women because that is the real tragedy.  They are really the fallout of either poor legislation or poor administration, and the situation in which they find themselves should have never arisen.  I hope that the Government takes note of the interview this morning.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Ed Sibley, deputy governor, prudential regulation, Ms Derville Rowland, director general of our financial conduct function, and Ms Helena Mitchell, head of consumer protection supervision.  I will first briefly give an overview of the current economic environment and then turn to some of the specific issues that the committee raised in its invitation to me, including the tracker examination where we published our most recent report on 25 April.<br/><br/>The Central Bank is committed to serving the public by safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.  We operate as one bank, recognising the operational effectiveness of deploying the whole resources of the bank in meeting our goals.  For example, our macro-prudential mortgage measures contribute to both financial stability and consumer protection by guarding against over-lending and over-borrowing.  Equally, our work to ensure that financial firms are prudentially sound is essential if these firms are to meet their obligations to consumers and investors.  In these ways, consumer protection is embedded in all key aspects of our work through close co-operation between our central banking, prudential regulation and financial conduct pillars.<br/><br/>In terms of the macroeconomic outlook, we are currently experiencing buoyant domestic activity and a strong international economy, which has lead to a broad-based expansion in employment and an increase in earnings.  Our projections for the labour market indicate that Ireland is heading towards full employment, although some extra capacity is possible through broader participation in the labour market.  While the near-term outlook is positive, Ireland faces substantial tail risks.  These include hard Brexit scenarios, protectionist pressures and any change in the international tax system that would effectively penalise small economies as locations for multinational production activity.  In addition, a sudden shift towards tighter conditions in international financial markets is widely cited as a possible trigger of a contraction in international economic activity.  We think it is important that policymakers are mindful of such vulnerabilities in order to ensure that Ireland is resilient if any of these tail risks are triggered.<br/><br/><b></b>In terms of the Irish housing market, the increase in house prices seen in recent years in part reflects the strong increase in employment and the increase in aggregate household incomes, together with a low interest rate environment.  However, a primary influence has been the limited supply response even if there is some evidence of increasing levels of construction activity.  Our research points to house completions of approximately 23,500 units in 2018 and an increase of 28,500 in 2019.  However, these projections remain below the estimated housing demand of between 30,000 and 35,000 units per annum outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<br/><br/>On the composition of the housing market, second and subsequent buyers remain the largest single cohort of purchasers accounting for 45% of market activity.  We have seen a significant role played by non-household buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts that mostly operate in urban markets, which accounts for 14.3% of transactions.  We also highlight the fact that non-mortgaged transactions or cash transactions are also quite significant.<br/><br/>In terms of the mortgage policies of the Central Bank, this is now an annual process.  Last November, we released our review of mortgage measures.  Our assessment is that the system is important and appropriate in ensuring that the credit market does not lead to unsustainable dynamics in the mortgage market.  We look at credit developments every three months and we stand ready to respond to changes in credit dynamics.  Our assessment feeds into our policies on bank capital policies, both from micro and macro-prudential perspectives.  Behind all of this is the intention to make sure that both those taking out mortgages and those providing mortgages are better equipped to deal with any future shocks.<br/><br/>In terms of commercial real estate, we have seen the dynamics here moderate in recent quarters so that Dublin is no longer an outlier in terms of market activity.  However, Dublin remains at the heart of activity with 80% of commercial property transactions last year but transactions outside of Dublin are also rising.  What we have now is a record low in terms of vacancies.  While the stock of office space is visibly increasing throughout the city, it is also the case that Brexit is contributing to additional demand in the near term.<br/><br/>We know that a lot of the funding here is international in nature.  Having an international investor base for commercial real estate aids recovery from the lows in the market.  It also provides increased levels of liquidity and provides non-bank sources of credit.  This means that the risks in the commercial real estate market are internationally shared and are not concentrated in the domestic financial system.  At the same time, as part of a global system, it is important to recognise that if these flows go into reverse that this carries some risks here in terms of disorderly market price dynamics.  Having said that, when one considers the amount of debt in the system and the amount of adjustment since the last boom then one will see that the market is a lot more sustainable than it was.  At this point, the Irish banks have commercial real estate lending of just under &euro;19 billion of which 20% is non-performing.  It is important to note that the domestic banks, the capital situations of the banks and their resilience is far different than a decade ago.  It remains the case that this area is the focus of our supervisory approach, and it is part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.<br/><br/>The tracker mortgage examination is one of the prime remaining changes in terms of dealing with the legacy of the crisis, both between the tracker examination and our work on addressing the high levels of non-performing loans that remain.  In our most recent report, we have given the latest update in terms of numbers.  We remain committed to the follow-on work to makes sure, through our inspections and challenge, that all cases should be included are included.  We reported that as of the end of March the number of customers who are now included in these schemes stands at 37,100, which is an increase of 3,400 compared with the end of December.<br/><br/>  In terms of the scale of what is involved, by the end of March the payout was &euro;459 million - an increase of &euro;162 million since December.</p><p>Eighty-eight per cent of identified accounts have received offers of redress and compensation and the vast majority of the remaining cases will be dealt with by the end of June.</p><p> Provisions by lenders in respect of the examination now stand at &euro;969 million, of which &euro;626 million relates to redress and compensation and &euro;343 million relates to costs.  The total cost of this to the banks is virtually at the &euro;1 billion mark.</p><p> I mentioned that there will be some exceptions to the end of June.  That relates to those customers who we have had included in the scheme in recent weeks.  Essentially, it is down to the fact that we are finding some cases now.  In some of these cases, they can be paid out within the end-of-June timeframe.  In other cases, it will take a bit longer.  I would say, however, the supervisory phase of getting all customers included is reaching its end.</p><p> In relation to enforcement, we stated there are enforcement proceedings against six lenders.  We are including all possible angles, including potential individual culpability, in these investigations.</p><p> What I have given the committee in my submission is a process answer about all that we are doing but, of course, it remains the case that whatever financial compensation can be delivered will never make up for the personal impact on the families which have been most affected by this scandal, including those who have lost homes and properties.</p><p> The other leg of our work here is the issue about the culture of the banks because it is quite important for the future conduct of these banks that they take responsibility for building a consumer-centred culture.  This is a matter for the top level of these organisations, for the boards and the senior management, and we as regulators must have an effective toolkit in pressing for the development of a consumer-focused culture.  We will report on this in mid-year.  This culture report will feed in to our ongoing supervisory work.</p><p> Turning to the issue of non-performing loans, non-performing loans cause considerable distress to those who are having to grapple with unsustainable debts.  Of course, it is also a major issue for the banking system.  Ireland has been to the forefront over the past decade in dealing with this.  Much has happened in Ireland, both in terms of our work but also in terms of the legal system, which has been identified in many places as a barrier to resolving non-performing loans.</p><p> What we have seen here is a lot of restructuring of loans rather than loss of ownership.  The protection of consumers who have arrears has been a key priority throughout with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, playing a critical role.  According to our data, there have been 120,000 restructured owner-occupied mortgages, 87% of which are meeting the terms of the restructuring arrangement.  This shows restructuring has been possible and has played a big part in managing the non-performing loan problem.</p><p> In relation to loss of ownership, which always must be one possibility in a mortgage system, there have been just over 8,000 cases, where 5,500 cases have been from voluntary surrenders and 2,700 through court ordered repossession.  This has to be the last resort.  Restructuring, where possible, is desirable.  Let me emphasise that compared with the international evidence, the Irish system's ability to deliver many restructured loans has meant the numbers of properties lost would have been much higher without these efforts.</p><p> We continue to press on this issue because there is a clear risk to the financial system if the number of non-performing loans remain at an elevated level on bank balance sheets.  This creates uncertainty about the financial positions of the banking system.  While in good times that might not be an immediate issue, in any future downturn, if those non-performing loans remain unresolved, that creates a clear sustainability issue in the markets.  Therefore, it is important, here and across Europe, to continue to work to bring down non-performing loan ratios.</p><p> In the grand scheme of things, back at the peak of the crisis, commercial real estate and small and medium-sized enterprise loans formed the majority of non-performing loans.  At this point, much of that has been worked through.  Approximately, two thirds of the remaining non-performing loan balances are residential mortgages.  This is why it is important at this point to recall that we have a strong consumer protection framework in place here and all that will happen in resolving these loans is within the context of a strong consumer protection framework.  In terms of how the Irish banks have been handling these loans, there has been a mixed approach.  There has been loan restructuring, voluntary sales, use of the legal system and loan disposals through a sales process.</p><p> What we have now is an unusually large amount of loans which are in long-term arrears of over two years.  We continue to encourage anyone in this situation to engage with his or her lender because we have seen evidence that sustainable restructurings are possible in many cases.  Where a restructuring is not possible, I emphasise that the development of the Insolvency Service of Ireland has been an important innovation and this can be an important support to debtors in reaching debt solutions.  However, for those who do not engage either with their banks or with the Insolvency Service of Ireland - I remind all of those in this situation that there is much support for them - the legal system remains the last resort outcome.</p><p> Turning to non-bank entities, whether these are retail credit firms or unregulated loan owners, they hold 7% of owner-occupied loans and 11% of buy-to-let mortgage accounts.  Within this category, 2% of owner-occupied mortgages and 5% of buy-to-let mortgages are owned by non-regulated loan owners.  What is clear, however, is that these are not like for like.  The unregulated loan owners hold a disproportionately high share of the long-term arrears cases with half of their owner-occupied mortgages and three quarters of their buy-to-let mortgages in arrears of over 90 days.  In 2017, non-bank entities accounted for 148 or 10% of repossessions of owner-occupied cases.  On those repossessions, half were voluntary and half were by court order.</p><p> While it is only one option in the resolution of non-performing loans, loan sales can play an important role in transferring risks from the banks to other types of investors, which reduces the vulnerability of the Irish banking system.  It is important to emphasise that, no matter who owns the loans, all of our codes of conduct are afforded to debtors.  Ireland has been a leader through developing the credit servicing regime in 2015, which means that we have a way to ensure that consumer protection rights are enforced through regulating the credit servicing firms while not adding frictions to the sale process for mortgages.  It bears repeating that customers whose loans are sold continue to have the benefit of the same consumer protection regulations they had before the sale.  As the committee will be aware, we are currently reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the CCMA in the context of the sale of loan books.  This review provides an opportunity to assess whether any revisions to the code are necessary.</p><p> I will turn to the EU developments in banking regulation because there is a relevant initiative at present.</p><p>In March the Commission published a proposal for a directive on credit servicers, credit purchasers and the recovery of collateral.  The aim is to have a European approach to the sale of non-performing loans.  Across Europe the same imperative is shared more widely - that it is important for the banking system to have a lower ratio of non-performing loans.  It is important that one of these options, the sale of non-performing loans, be taken in a way that protects consumers.  Essentially, the European directive will arrive at a very similar system to what we have in place here where there is a distinction between credit servicing and the ownership of a loan.  The European directive will provide that the credit servicing firm should be regulated, but the loan owner will not require authorisation.  Essentially, the solution we have found in Ireland is being used as a template.  It should be the pan-European approach because regulating credit servicing firms will deliver consumer protection, while allowing the sale of loans to happen, which is important to the overall stability of the banking system.</p><p> I will now comment on the European deposit insurance scheme, the final leg in completing banking union.  We think it is important that it move along in the coming weeks and months.  Together with progress on capital markets union, the completion of banking union is important to allow the European Union to deal with future challenges.</p><p> On credit unions, we have a clear strategy and our vision for the sector is of strong credit unions in safe hands.  That underpins our statutory responsibility to ensure the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.  The past decade has seen many challenges for credit unions in dealing with the financial crisis, increased competition, the challenges to the business model, restructuring and increased regulation.  Considerable progress has been made, but significant challenges remain because of declining investment returns on assets which, in turn, interact with the reduction in the loan-to-asset ratio, low investment yields and rising costs.  People who look at this sector have made the consistent observation that not all credit unions have developed future business models that are robust to deal with these structural changes.  While there has been an increase in governance standards across the sector, this remains a key risk.  It is essential that sound governance and control systems be in place for the credit union sector.</p><p> As regulator, we support efforts to undertake the transformation of business model in line with our vision.  In 2018 we are introducing a number of important changes as follows: a refinement of our supervisory approach to strengthen core foundations; a review of lending to accommodate the future lending growth ambitions of the stronger credit unions as part of a balanced loan portfolio; a new chief executive officer forum to support advancement of the development of new business models; and workshops to support credit unions in addressing key risk vulnerabilities.</p><p> I hope this overview of some key topics has been helpful.</p></speech>

As we are doing this work, we have a significant number of very detailed work blocks under way with all of the lenders in the examination to ensure the correct customers are identified and responsibility is taken.  As we go through that very detailed work, some of which is complete, there may be additional smaller numbers or groups of customers who should be included.  We believe it is a very small amount.</p> <p>  I will outline the work involved to give the Deputy a flavour of how it can come about.  We have identified groups of customers that should be included for a particular reason.  However, we are actually doing verification work on the numbers of customers in a group.  We might have an unverified number of, for example, 200 customers affected by a particular issue.  However, we are going back to spot-check and recreate the data to inform us on whether 200 is the correct or incorrect figure.  In that work we have found the figure sometimes adjusts downwards and that it can actually occasionally adjust upwards.  It is with that verification that the number can adjust, as we have found.  Equally, we have closed out the known issues with some of the lenders; therefore, we think there will be no more movement, bar that verification adjustment with these lenders.  However, we are still in dialogue with others on issues that could result in an adjustment.  It is our view that the vast majority affected have been identified and we anticipate very small adjustments in the number.</p></speech>

It is quite frustrating that we are still talking about this issue and we have to because it is not yet resolved.  Professor Lane identified many other issues in his report that, hopefully, we will come to.  He has identified that the cost of the tracker mortgage examination has been &euro;969 million, which involves money costs but this has had a huge human cost also, and that it is fast approaching &euro;1 billion.  Obviously, we expect it to exceed &euro;1 billion by the time enforcement proceedings are concluded and other individuals are identified.  He also talked about looking at possible angles, including potential individual culpability.  At the beginning of this session, we talked about accountability in terms of health.  I demand accountability relating to financial scandals that have cost &euro;1 billion, some &euro;626 million of which was mostly wrongly taken from customers' accounts.  With the information the Central Bank has at its disposal at this point in time, is there any chance of there being individual accountability?</p></speech>

We have many very good lawyers in the bank and what they are essentially tasked with doing is investigating.  An investigation phase is taking place which involves trying to work out how this happened.  They have various information-gathering powers.  They can carry out interviews, go into these banks and look at documentation.  I do not think it is a good idea for me to speculate on where this will go in terms of individual accountability but in the absence of being able to speculate about that in respect of trackers, let me point out that one thing we have been saying in recent weeks and months involves the Law Reform Commission.  We wrote to the commission to say that a changed approach to individual accountability might be something for the Oireachtas to think about for the future.  The UK introduced this recently.  In the UK, essentially, the senior management of financial institutions must take responsibility.  It would not be a defence under that system for someone to say they did not directly write any letter or email authorising some inappropriate behaviour.  The head of or someone in senior management in one of these organisations must take responsibility for the conduct of the organisation.  It might be helpful if Ms Rowland weighs in on this issue.</p></speech>

Can Professor Lane confirm whether last Monday, Ulster Bank believed it was a bank holiday and, therefore, payments were not processed?</p></speech>

Whether it is here or elsewhere, probably the number one topic in financial regulation is IT.  When Dani&egrave;le Nouy was here last week or the week before, she probably made a similar comment.  We think banks need to make significant investments.  Cyber risk and cyber crime are increasing.  There is a shift towards digital provision of banking services.  During the crisis, many banks had to cut back on investment.  The world is in a situation that is not very good with regard to managing all sorts of IT risks in the financial system.  It is a big priority for us and other regulators.  Mr. Sibley will address how we are handling this.</p></speech>

That remains the case today.  We certainly have a degree of concern around IT resilience and the level of investment that is needed in some, although not all, of the banks.  I am very limited in terms of what I can say about the specific incident but I will probably be able to address the thrust of the Deputy's question.  Our overriding view is that customers of banks have a legitimate and rightful expectation that they can access their funds, execute payments and so on.  This is entirely dependent on the resilience and availability of the banks' IT systems.  Inevitably, over a long period of time, incidents will happen that result in IT outages.  This is part of the nature of IT.  We certainly look to make sure that those incidents are minimised and that when they do occur, they are fixed as quickly as possible and there is clear communication to customers around what is happening, how the quickly the issue will be addressed and that if customers are out of pocket, they will gain redress.  In respect of what we are doing with IT, and to follow on from the Governor's remarks, we recognise that this is a very significant risk for the financial system.  This is why we set up a dedicated IT risk inspection team in late 2014.  We have undertaken 19 inspections across the banking system since then and have issued over 150 findings in terms of requirements for banks to improve how they look at IT to make sure they are resilient in terms of security and the capability of the IT system improves.  We have issued 90 findings relating to the domestic retail banks, about half of which have been closed and about half of which are still open, so there is work to be done and we are making sure it is being done.</p></speech>

I think that speaks volumes.  Now we see that money has disappeared completely from people's accounts.  I imagine that there will be an investigation and, hopefully, there will be a response at the end of it.  Can I put a specific question that was put to me by customers of Ulster Bank last Monday - not Monday gone, which was a bank holiday, but the Monday before that?  I am informed that Ulster Bank's IT system believed it was a bank holiday even though all the branches were open and as a result of the IT system believing it was a European bank holiday, transactions did not go through.  For example, mortgages that were being called for by a bank to Ulster Bank did not actually happen.</p><p>Is the Central Bank aware that that happened on 30 April?</p></speech>

The final issue I want to discuss is the economy and the macroeconomic outlook, which I think this committee needs to focus more on.  The Governor did not say that the economy is overheating.  I ask him to inform the committee of the factors which inform the opinion that it is not overheating.  I am glad that he referred in his opening statement to the issue of non-mortgage buyers.  I have been in communication with Professor Lane privately about this.  I have major concerns about this.  The figures presented here today speak volumes.  Some 55% of home purchases are by non-mortgage buyers, with a sizeable section done by real estate investment trusts, REITs, which we facilitate generously through our tax codes.  This is having an impact and pushing ordinary buyers out of the market, people who rely on mortgages.  Has the Central Bank any projection of when demand is likely to meet supply?  We are currently behind on that.  The witnesses mentioned that the tax-efficient structures, the REITs, make up 14.5% of all home purchases during that period.  If we were to just look at the urban regions, such as Dublin, what proportion would they be?  REITs are not buying houses in Donegal, Leitrim or Cavan.  What proportion are these tax-incentivised structures buying up where there is acute pressure on house prices and demand?</p> <p>  There are concerns about commercial real estate, the true trigger to our economic collapse, which we do not pay much attention to.  I have written to the witnesses about my concerns with the super-geared business model of some of these businesses.  The statistics stand for themselves.  They are shocking and alarming.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that and also to comment on whether they believe that the increase in stamp duty has had an impact on dampening what we are seeing in the commercial market.  I have said this before at the committee.  I believe that we are in bubble territory with commercial property and, unless we get a handle on it, things could go very wrong very quickly with a change of international direction on the issue.</p></speech>

The question about the fraction of the Dublin market or urban markets, where REITs are obviously more important is fair, and while I do not have it in front of me, we can probably calculate it.  We can write to the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

I will come back to overheating first.  Unemployment is currently around 5.9%.  I said in the opening statement that one question is how low unemployment can go.  We think, and many members of the committee have probably thought about this, that Ireland still has a high rate of people who are not in the labour market.  If there were policies of many types that could bring people who do not currently find it possible to make themselves available to work or do not have the support to enter the labour force, that could help.  We as a Central Bank, and equally the political system, need to think about this in advance.  We are not overheating now.  We are seeing wages starting to go up, which is welcome.  It differs across sectors and regions but having some recovery in living standards is important.  We want unemployment to continue to fall.  We see revisions around the world about how low unemployment can go.  In the US, unemployment has gone below 4%.  This was not expected but is maybe evidence that the world has changed a little, that the level that it operated the labour market may be able to push unemployment lower.  This is silent on the quality of jobs.  We also have to ask if these are well paid jobs, the jobs that people want, and so on.  Our message is to think about if that day comes.</p> <p>  This is all dependent on the current good conditions continuing.  If Brexit goes badly, if the current trade disputes broaden, or international tax issues disadvantage small open economies, or, on the last point the Deputy made, there is a revision in international financial sentiment, there will be issues.  These are well-known risk factors which could derail this good outlook.  With overheating, the big question, which will be interesting for the Deputy for the rest of this year, is what the appropriate budget balance is when facing the risk of overheating.  I will work more on this in the coming months before I give my pre-budget advice.  I would generally flag that the debate here is maybe a little too narrow.  Trying to target a budget balance of zero will maybe not be enough.  The conversation about significant budget surpluses is not something I hear too much here.  I do not think it is an issue for now but in the next year or two, we may have a situation where, for the stability of the economy, running a significant surplus may be important.  That does not cut across anyone's desires for more public spending.  It is a question of balancing public spending with raising revenue to match it.</p> <p>  Turning to financing of both the residential market and the commercial real estate market, what is the alternative?  For the rental market, having large, professional investors can be a positive force.  Having a professional landlord institutional class, where they may not own very large portfolios, may have a better outcome for many people seeking to rent than having to deal with small-time buy-to-let landlords.  We all want a stable rental system where one can expect professional standards from the landlord.  Large-scale professional investors who buy up apartment buildings and complexes to rent them out can be part of what we want.  On leverage of these firms, banks are highly leveraged institutions.  The leverage of a private equity investor or investment fund would be less than a bank.  Banks, while they take on debt, are, through deposits, bank bonds and so on, usually more indebted.  The other issue is the consequence.  We care a lot about banks because we put our money in banks.  We have to keep depositors safe.  If some global professional investor decides to lend money to a big private equity fund and that fund gets into trouble, the losses are not for the general population.  They will be concentrated on those who took that risk.  It is a different type of risk.  It is a real risk, where there is some disruption in the international financial system and some of these companies may get into trouble.  The question is, if they get into trouble, what the systemic consequences are.  It is bad news for their shareholders and their bond investors but it is easier to mop up that type of problem than to mop up a problem where it is bank-funded.  Having diversified funding in the system is important.  I recognise that it increases competition for the individual in the short term, in the Dublin market, for example.  On the other hand, for the wider system, we should be cautiously optimistic about having professional investors who will play an important part in providing apartments and homes to rent.  That can be a positive development.</p></speech>

We are in alliance with our fellow regulators in terms of a rethink on how we strike a balance between banks making bad judgment calls versus embedded cultures of misconduct.  The culture report which we are doing now, which we will deliver in terms of the consolidated report to the Minister mid-year, is part of a global issue.  Regulators do need to rethink how they interact with these firms given the accumulated evidence and the many billions in fines, whether in the US, across Europe or elsewhere.  This is an important time for a rethink in terms of how these firms conduct themselves.  The firms, too, are also rethinking their operating structures because this crisis has been very expensive for them.  As regulators, we need to rethink how we manage regulation of conduct.</p></speech>

We will keep under review further cases where the conduct merits such a reaction.  This will remain an open prospect depending on what we discover as we look through cases in detail.  With respect to the Senator's question on previous enforcement actions, I do not have the particular sub-set of information available because since enforcement in the Central Bank was established there are more than 110 enforcement outcomes delivering more than &euro;60 million fines.  There are also disqualifications.  The enforcements relate to a wide variety of issues, some of which will relate to mortgage lending, conduct issues and so on, the public outcomes on which have been made available and are on the Central Bank website.  I am happy to write to the Senator with the detail.</p></speech>

In the United States, for example, the fall in unemployment to below 4% has been a welcome surprise and the Federal Reserve has started to raise rates.  This will always be a balancing act but I fully agree with the Senator that one should not wait until it is too late.  As to the risk of overheating, unemployment has declined to between 5% and 6% but I will not become too concerned about the labour market until it falls below 5%.  Even then I will have an open mind.  We are not there yet.</p></speech>

There is only one answer to the affordability crisis, namely, to further increase supply of affordable housing.  That depends partly on the market delivering and partly on the choices made by the political system.  There are many choices to be made.  As I noted in my opening statement, there has been an increase in supply this year and last year and there will be a greater increase next year.  However, these increases are not sufficient to address the significant mismatch between the numbers of people seeking a home and the scale of what can be delivered.  As I consistently state, there is a material risk of a reversal in house prices.</p></speech>

People are under pressure because they fear the ongoing increase in house prices.  On the other hand, as supply picks up and more and more houses are built,  we will have downward pressure on house prices in the coming years.  While there will be downward pressure on house prices in the coming years, it is not there right now.  The reason we have mortgage rules is to avoid the risk of excessive debt being taken on at exactly the wrong time.  Mortgages are often for 30 or 35 years and only those who are financially prepared can take on a mortgage at the moment.  This is not, therefore, solving the problem of affordability.</p></speech>

The precise balance of public and private provision is a political judgment on which I should not express an opinion.  There are many options available and politicians must work on them.</p> <p>  I return to the overheating issue because the last overheating episode was property driven.  What we are seeing now is not credit or property driven.  The wider macroeconomic position is being driven by other factors.  We must remember that multinational firms and commercial real estate investors are not relying on the Irish banking system.  It is possible to have a scenario where there is not a significant domestic credit issue but there is still a great deal of activity taking place in the economy that may prove to be unsustainable.  Overheating is a much broader issue than just the housing market.  While the housing market is important, it is not the only issue and we all need to think about that.  When we have broader types of overheating, the Central Bank will do what it can to respond but ultimately it will come down to fiscal policy because that is the tool available, especially for a member of a monetary union.  It is important to note that managing an overheating risk will be a fiscal issue.</p></speech>

We find that they expect an increase in house prices of approximately 15% over three years.  It is not the case, therefore, that they are expecting double-digit growth in house prices every year.  Many in the industry expect a single-digit increase this year.  It is not an accelerating market and we are beginning to see the Central Bank's rules bite more severely.  I do not expect double-digit growth every year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#K03000"><p>To address a broader issue first, we should all be much less concerned about trying to forecast and much more concerned with trying to manage risks.  As I stated, the market is expecting single-digit increases in house prices.  What we have to think about is what if the market is wrong and what if there is a reversal.  I believe a reversal in house prices is a material risk for several reasons.</p><p>Number one is time.  I agree that these may be over a two or three year horizon rather than a 2018 risk.  I am not saying this is for 2018.  Over a two or three year horizon, more and more houses are being built.  In the mid-2000s there was a very big house-building response in Ireland and the overhang of so much supply was part of the reason houses prices eventually tumbled so much.  Straightforwardly, more housing of different types becoming available will relieve the pressure on the rental market.  This is not just family homes.  Student accommodation is being built all around Dublin and this will take some students out of the normal rental market, and so on.  This will relieve pressure on the rental market.</p><p> With regard to interest rates I do not believe that multi-policy rates will move dramatically in the years to come.  The market does not think these will move dramatically but the rates relevant for mortgage funding are more like the five to eight year rates that banks can raise money at.  There is a risk that these can move.  More basically, we have seen a strong increase in incomes in Ireland from more employment in recent years.  The Irish employment story has been very strong and as we get towards lower levels of unemployment it will slow down.  Add into the natural slowdown the trade risk, the Brexit risk and the end of the cycles in the US and so on, and there are multiple reasons this kind of current positive momentum may go into reverse.  I am not expecting it but it is a material risk and should be planned for.</p></speech>

This is very important.  We insist on people paying downpayments because downpayments provide protection in case house prices fall.  If it is just a question of a slowdown in house prices we would be much more relaxed about looking for deposits or loan-to-value ratios, where we look for them.  This is to guard against house prices falling.  I say consistently that we should recognise this as a genuine risk and this is why it is important that we insist that our mortgage rules provide protection against actual downturns.</p></speech>

They will be mortgaged to the hilt for the next 30 years and Professor Lane has said there is a "material risk" that prices will actually fall in the next two or three years.</p></speech>

If a person is absolutely planning on taking out a mortgage now and absolutely planning on trading up in two or three years time, the person needs to recognise that risk.  For people, however, who are planning on living in that home for a sustained period of time, the fact that house prices rise or fall should not be a matter for over concern.  When people are trying to flip houses, however, and the kinds of stuff that happened in the boom of 15 years ago it means that they should not count on expected demand and a one-way only momentum.  For all mortgages now and for first-time buyers there is pretty much no lending above 90% so there is already a lot of protection there.  The system is a lot more resilient now.  I am troubled, however, by the temptation in some quarters to believe that it is one direction only.  Over time there will be a natural increase in house prices.  Over decade by decade house prices rise in line with the fact that GDP and incomes go up, but over a shorter period of time - as we have just spoken of - it is not a one-way bet.</p></speech>

We are still five months out from the budget but if there is fiscal space of more than &euro;3 billion - and this is not yet certain - would it be prudent to use all of that or does the Governor think there should be a scaling back of expectations and a more cautious approach to the budget?</p></speech>

There has been a lot of discipline and pain taken in controlling public sector pay.  It is important that there is an aspect of participation in the recovering economy with regard to the choices made by the Oireachtas.  It is freer now than it was before.  As the economy gets closer to full employment, and given that we have these significant tail risks, the level of our ambition should not be just to try to balance the budget, or to get close to it, but to move into significant surplus.  I would not say that running a very big surplus is necessary for the next budget and for 2020 and 2021 if these current good conditions continue.  If that is not the case then we should be levelling out at a zero budget balance or close to it but if these conditions continue the debate should be about reconciling all that the Oireachtas wants to do with running a significant surplus.</p></speech>

This relates to Permanent TSB's split mortgages and the fact that AIB's split mortgages are deemed to be performing loans under the European Banking Authority's single supervisory mechanism, SSM, technical definition.  What work is ongoing around the more than 4,000 split mortgages in Permanent TSB, which are performing according to the terms of the agreements, to be accepted in a technical sense as being performing loans?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#L01000"><p>I have been very clear for a while now on this issue and I am working with the European Central Bank to make sure that this clarity is communicated from an EU perspective.  This is not just an Irish issue.  Split mortgages can cure, absolutely, and can return to performing status from an accounting point of view.  This requires certain conditions to be fulfilled, including the condition outlined by the Deputy that the loans are meeting the terms of the restructure, and in how the warehoused element is dealt with in the accounting context.  They absolutely can cure.  This has been communicated to all firms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1640" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#L01100"><p>The current classification remains that - in the case of one bank - they can be deemed as non-performing by the SSM.  That is the reality.  In this bank's case, the warehoused element can be transferred at any time into the active mortgage, whereas in the case of AIB the warehoused element cannot be transferred in until the active mortgage has been fully repaid.  The fact that it is open to the bank to transfer that in at any time seems to be the issue.  We have a situation, however, where more than 4,000 Permanent TSB mortgage holders have done all the right things; they have taken the advice, they have engaged, they have reached an agreement with their lender and they are honouring the terms of those agreements, yet they are in the same basket of loans where nothing has been repaid for several years.  These homeowners face a sell off.  They are really worried because, according to the terms of the agreements, their split mortgages can be revoked at any time.</p></speech>

A lot of work has happened to restructure these loans to make them sustainable.  I completely understand why this is a sensitive topic and why people would be concerned in circumstances where they have a split mortgage.  There is absolute clarity with the relevant firms about the action required to cure these loans and move them to a performing status - to use a technical description - so they can be treated and classified within the banks' books as performing.  I cannot talk about a specific bank.  I am aware that Permanent TSB is to have its annual general meeting next week.</p><p>I imagine this would be a topic for discussion there and I hope through that process there will be more clarity for these borrowers but it is clear to all firms that it is relevant to what needs to be done to cure these mortgages.  Previously, there was concern that it was not possible to cure them but it is possible for these loans to cure and to return to a performing status.  Choices have to be made in what is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#M00200"><p>The banks are clear on what they need to do to meet that.</p> <p>  I will raise one other issue and come back in later to discuss tracker mortgages.  The definition of a "first-time buyer" in the context of the macroprudential rules makes a huge difference, particularly when the Government's help-to-buy scheme is considered.  In the case of a house on sale for &euro;400,000, if I am a non first-time buyer, I need a 20% deposit or &euro;80,000 whereas a first-time buyer requires 10% or &euro;40,000 and can then claim half that back under the help-to-buy scheme, which means the deposit required is &euro;20,000.  That is a dramatic difference.  This is not only because of Central Bank rules because the scheme is a significant factor as well.  What is the Central Bank's rationale for having such a different approach for non first-time buyers?  I am thinking of people who may have bought ten or 15 years ago and who may be coming out of negative equity or who might not have much equity but their homes are unsuitable because their families have grown and they need more bedrooms.  However, they are faced with the prospect of a 20% deposit requirement, even though their repayment capacity may be good and, therefore, they are stuck.  What does Professor Lane say to those people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#M00300"><p>I recognise that category.  This is why when the rules were designed, the negative equity situation was excluded.  People might have crawled into positive equity recently and this is why we allow a significant fraction of loans for non first-time buyers to be outside the loan-to-value ceiling.  Without that category, which comprises those who were hardest hit by the crisis, I would probably pick a tighter rule.  The fact that we have these allowances to be exceeded is a recognition of that category of homeowner who through no fault of their own were caught by the crisis.  That is why the system of allowances is in place for the second and subsequent buyer population.  It is in recognition of the many cases such as the Deputy outlined.  In some of the other correspondence we have had, it comes back to the same answer.  We recognise that one size does not fit all.  This is why these rules have exceptions to allow the banks to exercise discretion when they have clear reasons to do so.</p></speech>

They have a higher target price to achieve and it is harder to save for the deposit.  For somebody who owns a home, there is an offsetting benefit because he or she is building up equity.  When house prices increase, life is more difficult for first-time buyers but there is a build-up of equity for existing owners.  We have seen before - and there is global evidence for this - that there is a risk of procyclicality with a boom being amplified by people with equity in their homes deciding they have significant equity built up their homes and using that to take out a buy-to-let mortgage and adding to the pressure in the market.  The differential between the first-time buyer and the second-time buyer is based on that.  They have different exposure to house prices.  The existing owner wins when house prices increase while to some extent the first-time buyer finds it more difficult.</p></speech>

One is the issue of returning emigrants.  I have a number of cases of people who went abroad when the economy crashed.  They bought a property in London, for example, lived there for a number of years, sold it and returned home.  They do not have a huge lump sum and they never owned a property in this jurisdiction but they are deemed to be non first-time buyers.  Is that necessary?</p></speech>

The definition of a first-time buyer does not originate with us but we cannot have a different answer from the Revenue on this.  We can provide a more complete answer regarding the origin of how we define first-time buyers.</p></speech>

The Government's Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme provides for exceptions, including where someone owned a property in the State previously and he or she is divorced under a court order or party to a separation agreement and then buys a property which is the first since leaving the family home.  There are, therefore, a number of exceptions whereby even if one owned a property previously, one can be deemed to be a first-time buyer under this scheme.  However, under Central Bank rules, there are no exceptions nor are there under the help-to-buy scheme.  Life is complex and relationships break down.  Family homes are sold and people have to start again but they are deemed to be non first-time buyers.  The Central Bank should re-examine the position of these people under its rules and that of returning emigrants.</p></speech>

I look forward to the day that we do not have to take up time dealing with tracker mortgages examination because it is holding the committee back from dealing with other issues.  I would like to put a few questions to him about what the Central Bank thinks might be acceptable under its code of conduct for dealing with tracker mortgages.  I refer to somebody who initiated correspondence with a bank in January 2016 and has engaged constantly since then but who has to date received no information.  The latest correspondence on 10 October 2017 states the examination is ongoing and there is no timescale for completion.  There is a lack of communication, which is contrary to the Central Bank's expectations on how this debacle should be addressed.  Is Professor Lane concerned that some banks do not have the capacity to do what they need?</p></speech>

I would like the Senator to provide me with details of that.  I will make sure, as we do with all issues that come to our attention, to follow that up because that does not accord with what we have clearly set out in the framework and expect to happen.  We were clear that adequately resourced communications needed to be set up with customers and I am disappointed to hear about that.  As the tracker mortgage examination moved through to delivering a lot of results for people, it is true that some of the complaints by people who were concerned were not being progressed because they were waiting to hear the outcome of their cases.  Many people have received information and payments to date but we have been clear with lenders that we know and they know when we do not have an issue and they need to get on with dealing with complaints.  We have communicated that specifically to them and did so again recently.  We have also been in communication with the ombudsman to reiterate that we have no difficulties with some of these complaints being dealt with and it is only a narrow subset of issues that the lenders and the Central Bank are aware of which we must continue to keep under review.</p><p>The vast majority of complaints can be dealt with.  Lenders are aware of that and the FSO is now very clear about it too.  We do not expect them not to be answered.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for Professor Lane.  One thing that bothers me is whether the Central Bank is a bank for Dublin or for all the State.  With regard to unemployment, reducing unemployment and so forth, I am from Mayo in the west and there are vast areas that have huge unemployment.  It is up to 30% or 35%.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, spoke about emigration.  It is still a reality for most of the people in my area who cannot get jobs.  For example, there were 1,500 applications for 30 outdoor staff jobs in Mayo County Council.  I am concerned that Professor Lane's opinions are feeding into the concentration of the Government's policy, which will not address what is happening in the regions.  Without the regions we are not a full country.  Will he speak to that in terms of how important he considers the development of the regions is in the context of what is happening at present?</p></speech>

We now have a great deal more detailed data than we used to have so we have quite a good understanding on a county-by-county basis.  For example, we have detailed regional data in respect of mortgage problems, house prices and employment, and that feeds into our thinking.  We are mindful of regional differences but ultimately, at macro level, we have national policies.  What is necessary, not for us as the Central Bank but in terms of the conduct of government and in addition to striking the right balance at a country level, is an arsenal of regional policies to address the clear differences across the country.  Incidentally, when one looks back on the crisis one sees that the scale of the downturn was far more severe outside Dublin than in Dublin.  Dublin had a recession but it was in no way as severe.  There is a symmetry in what has been going on.  More broadly, we are seeing Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and the urban areas performing quite differently from more isolated areas.</p></speech>

Consider what is happening with the deferred tax assets, which are quantified at &euro;215 billion.  A sum of &euro;215 billion could provide a great deal of vital infrastructure in the west and rural Ireland.  Indeed, it could provide many homes to address the homelessness crisis.  Does the witness think there should be a sunset clause or a time limit on organisations and, in particular, banks being able to carry forward deferred assets?</p></speech>

From a financial services perspective and particularly from a bank's perspective we are looking through them now.  When we think about the level of capital a bank has we look at what is termed a fully loaded basis, which is stripping out those elements, including deferred tax assets that are being phased out, as something one could recognise as a strength from a capital perspective.  When looking at the strength of the banks' balance sheets and their capital positions we look beyond deferred tax assets.  In effect, from ours and a market perspective, the banks do not get credit for them because we are looking through them.  They are being phased out in terms of their treatment under the capital regime.  That is a different issue from the one the Senator raised, which is about what should happen with the profits that are being generated now by firms that had losses in the past and can offset those losses against future profits.  That is very much a tax and political question and I cannot give an opinion on that from the Central Bank's perspective.</p></speech>

I believe there is a threat there in terms of us losing control over our property market.  There is all of this activity but there is little to back it up, and we have little control over it.  For me, it is just adding to what the external shocks and threats might be in the future.  Professor Lane's report was very interesting, but it made me recall the time we heard that there would definitely be a soft landing.  Then there would be a whispered "bar an external shock".  We know what happened when we got the external shock and we did not have control over many of these things.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to a loss of control.  There is a balance there.  There is a recognition that we have an open border for the financial system.  That is locked into the meaning of the EU.  More broadly, the EU <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the world has virtually open access in terms of the global flow of finance.  People who think about globalisation think that a strong state is needed to counterbalance it.  The view is that the only successful way to deal with globalisation is to have a strong state, including a robust central bank.<br/><br/>We spoke earlier about house prices and so forth.  Many forces will influence house prices, commercial real estate prices, the role of real estate investment trusts, private equity firms and so forth.  There are many forces that can influence the level of prices.  It is not open to domestic control.  What is under domestic control is ensuring that the system is resilient.  Ultimately, we have options about deciding the amount of capital the banks must hold here and in respect of the mortgage rules the level of exposure of individual households to mortgage debt.  This is not true everywhere.  Ireland, partly because it had such a severe crisis, is much more advanced than other countries in recognising that the nature and volatility of having these open financial systems mean one must proceed on a safe basis by insisting on significant deposits, limiting loan-to-income ratios and making sure the banks have sufficient capital.</p></speech>

It is the "compared to what" situation.  On the role of the global finance system, there is a risk factor, but there is also a lot of insulation.  Previously, we had the worst combination, namely, that while there were foreign owned banks, a huge amount of the credit was provided by the domestic banks and that put the domestic system at risk.  Having a system where more and more of the finance in the Irish property system has an external risk attached to it makes it less risky.  It is a question of if there were a downturn here, who would bear the losses.  Increasingly, they are being loaded onto global investors who are better placed to take them.  They would not remain here, which is welcome.  Having openness to the global financial system has risk factors but also important benefits.  In any case, it is not a choice; we are part of it and it is a question of managing it.</p></speech>

We cannot take any of these things in isolation.</p> <p>  Does Professor Lane think it is right that the banks which we have bailed out and with which we have struggled and with which we on this committee continue to struggle can get away with not paying corporation tax for decades?</p></speech>

The decision on tax rates is clearly one for the political system to make, but nothing is cost free.  It is not cost free to have a situation where there are deferred tax assets.  Equally, if there is a decision to use a sunset clause in dealing with these matters, there will be consequences.  Any decision should be based on the analytics and also political judgments on who would bear what costs.  It is not a cost free decision to say that should be let through because of a sunset clause.</p></speech>

In November a Russian bank defaulted on $500 million worth of loans made through a Dublin office.  The IMF and the Financial Stability Board have warned about our exposure and there was some commentary on the issue in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times.  </i>Lawyers, accountants and bankers generated &euro;284 million in fees from hundreds of special purpose vehicles last year.  The growing use of such entities by Russian groups has come into sharp focus as investors track risks related to US sanctions.  Are we creating trouble for ourselves by marketing Dublin as a hub for shadow banking?</p></speech>

Ireland does play a big role in European activities of special purpose entities and different types of investment vehicle.  That is the reality.  For several years we, in the Central Bank, have worked quite hard to try to shine a light on that activity.  We gather information on much of it which most countries do not collect.  The Central Bank has published quite an amount of material, highlighting the geographical patterns and the role of Russian entities here.  It is something at which we have a responsibility to look and explain.  We are playing a big part in the international shadow banking work being done at the Financial Stability Board and so on.  The Central Bank is very alive in looking at it.  It goes back to the issue of the global financial system and the legal framework in place.  Ireland is recognised as having accumulated expertise among its lawyers and accountants on the operations of these vehicles.</p></speech>

I emphasise that it is mostly a wholesale trade.  The products are not being marketed to retail customers, to whom exposure would require a higher level of oversight.  Just because something is legal does not mean that the State is offering a moral judgment on the activity.  There is a considerable legal framework in place.  There is an anti-money laundering framework in place, as well as a sanctions framework.  The lawyers, accountants and everyone else involved in the industry have responsibilities to respect all of what is legally required in the anti-money laundering, the sanctions regime and so on.  It all takes place within a legal framework.  Investors in these products should have open eyes on what it is they are investing in.  Largely, the cases we have seen here have been high risk investments where the pricing has recognised the risks.  It is something that is located here, but it does not really interact dramatically with the Irish financial system, to which there is not an economic risk.  The reputational damage questions should be placed firmly at the door of the firms that are raising finance.  We are not endorsing any firm which raises money in Dublin.  They must respect the legal framework in place.  If they are raising money through public securities markets, we have a limited role regarding the prospectus, but it is quite a narrow function.  However, it is a significant issue globally.  We are to the forefront in being active participants in examining this area, at which we are looking carefully.  However, it is important to separate the financial risks from the wider issues of what it means politically and the global money trail.  Collectively, the world needs to do more in knowing about the global money trail.  The phrase "shadow banking" is very acute.  As far as I am concerned, everything should come out of the shadows; we should know what is going on.  Ireland has taken a lot of steps forward in that regard.  We do more than many other places, but, globally, there is a long way to go in ensuring what is in the shadows will come out of them.</p></speech>

I was not going to ask about the housing market, but I feel as if I must based on what he has said.  I do not think his analysis that the market may decline or lose ground in two or three years' time is earth shattering.  It will be reported as being quite a statement, but my view is that it is in no way earth shattering.  He has given the reasons he thinks it might occur, which is fair.  He has also said it is a consequential decision for any individual to buy a house.  We know that housing markets are invariably volatile.  Professor Lane has mentioned things that he thinks have improved the position or that will protect house owners that were not in place, even in the recent past, such as large down payments and levels of exposure to household debt, things the Central Bank can determine.  In Professor Lane's opinion there have been improvements in all of these factors.</p><p>However, when Professor Lane talks about managing risk versus learning hard lessons from the past, are there more things which we should be doing now based on his commentary that this may occur in three years' time?  Are there further policy measures that need to be taken to counteract what may be coming down the tracks?  What does Professor Lane mean by managing risk?  What steps is he taking or have all the steps been taken?  Surely this is the question.  From my experience, and I was here in 2008, commentary from governors of the Central Bank is important, but in the past it has fallen on deaf ears.  It makes for a newspaper headline and then the market quickly forgets it.  In the past Professor Lane's organisation has not taken concrete steps to make sure that people are not badly affected, so when he makes that statement I have to ask what exactly he is saying.  With that in mind, what prescriptive steps need to be taken by legislators and policymakers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1677" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#P00200"><p>That is a great question.  I completely agree with the Deputy that talk is cheap.  Historically, not just here but in many places, central banks come out with reports and after the fact governors will mention that they mentioned that such a risk existed on page 57 of some report.  For that to be credible in terms of our own policies if we think there is a material risk - and the Deputy used the term "material risk" earlier on - it should feed into our policies.  One thing that happened on a pan-European basis after the crisis is that every country now has what is called a macroprudential policy.  In Ireland we, as the Central Bank, have the lead role.  In some other systems that lead role might be allocated to the finance ministry, but here it is allocated to us.  One manifestation of that policy is the mortgage rules which we have talked about.  If I believed the risk was zero, I would not be looking for deposits on houses or loan-to-income ceilings.  That is one example.  If the risks got more intense, we could recalibrate those measures.</p> <p>  Let me emphasise that every three months we also have to decide on what is called a countercyclical capital buffer.  Much of the global effort says that as cyclical risk goes up, national central banks and national regulators should raise the capital requirement on banks.  That is an option open to us and we can do it every three months.  If one goes back to 2004, 2005 and 2006, there was a paralysis not just here but everywhere.  People were recognising that something was going on but were saying that they would think about it and that they would perhaps delay acting.  We now have a mechanism that allows us to move more quickly.  This is something which we review every three months.  Every three months we publish our assessment on our website.  We decide whether we need to start raising this buffer, which will raise the amount of protection in the system.  We can be held to account because we now have an extra policy instrument and we are committed to using it when we think it is necessary.</p> <p>  That covers our own policy.  Let me come back to the situation more broadly.  I have now told the Deputy that a lot of what is going on is not coming out of the domestic credit system, so it is outside of our direct regulatory control.  For broader types of overheating, the responsibility will be on fiscal policy.  I broadly believe that where the spring statement signalled the 2019 budget should be in terms of the overall balance may be okay for 2019 but, if these pressures continue to build up, seeking to run a significant surplus will be part of risk management.  The risk management will partly be on us, but there is a heavy responsibility on fiscal policy for it to run on a prudential basis. </p></speech>

In the context that it is certainly plausible that we are closer to the next downturn, which we certainly hope is not as severe as the last one, than we are to the start of the financial crisis, it is really important that we recognise that as a risk.  That is important context when we are talking about non-performing loans and the need for continued repair in the system to address that particular risk.  If we go into the next downturn with a significant number of non-performing loans in the system it will be a problem from a prudential perspective.  We also need to make sure that consumers are protected to the maximum in addressing that issue.</p> <p>  The other aspects we think about from a risk management perspective include looking differently at the business models of financial services providers today than we have done in the past.  We are looking at them through the cycle.  Are they sustainable over the long term?  We have done a huge amount of work but there is more to be done in terms of resolution planning.  How do we deal with failing firms in the system, perhaps not with the systemic issue but with individual firms?  How do we make sure not only that there is sufficient capital in the system but that there is bail-in-able debt so that the first to feel the pain is not necessarily the taxpayer and that we can resolve firms in a way that does not cause significant externalities more broadly?</p></speech>

What I am saying is absolutely not rocket science.  It is fairly obvious.  We have fairly obvious risk factors now.  It is hard to quantify how likely they are to occur, but given that there are fairly obvious risk factors here, we have to manage the consequences of those risks and accept that we cannot do much about some of them.  For example, if there is going to be a global trade war we cannot control that.  We have to make sure that if those risks come to pass we will be able to deal with the consequences.</p></speech>

The Governor understands the question and he has answered it.  It is incredibly important that, if he makes a statement similar to the one he has made today, he assures people that he has thought about what has happened in the past and what needs to occur within his organisation to prevent the same kind of catastrophe for individuals occurring again.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that it remains for the full universe of the policy to be explored.  There may be existing instruments which have not yet been put into Irish legislation.  I will mention one such instrument, which is called a systemic risk buffer.  A systemic risk buffer is where we think that there is some particular type of risk facing the economy, which is not cyclical, so we tell banks that they need to hold extra capital if they are lending to a particular sector because we think that sector is especially risky.  That is something which is allowed for in European legislation but which has not been put through the Irish system.</p></speech>

That is probably an interaction to be had between ourselves, the Department of Finance and so on.  Whether that type of instrument should be brought in is a live issue.  There are broader issues about commercial real estate, which we talked about earlier on.  Given the role of non-banks in funding commercial real estate, what other measures should be looked at at a European level in that regard?  More broadly, globally banks are less and less important than market funding.  We can impose capital ratios on banks, but what can we do in respect of market-type investment in terms of stabilising the system?  There is a lot of ongoing discussion about that.</p><p>I would not want to claim that every instrument has been worked out but we have got a lot more than we had.  The most important message is that the capital ratios of the banks here and across Europe are far higher than they were.  Their dependence on unstable funding is much less than it used to be.  The fundamentals are very different.  It is much safer now than it was previously.  We would also be much more interventionist, maybe, than was historically the belief 15 years ago.</p></speech>

Maybe I am exaggerating but I do think so.  Professor Lane's answers give me confidence with regard to what the Central Bank is doing.  It is his belief that there is a reasonable chance of a downward correction.  Ten years ago, if the Governor of the Central Bank came in here and made that prediction, he would have risked being fired.  I had to ask the question.  It is good that Professor Lane is verbalising his honest opinion with regard to the market.  I am not so sure that would have occurred ten years ago.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the part of Professor Lane's opening statement that dealt with the macro-economic outlook.  He touched on the issue of broader participation in the labour market but did not elaborate on it.  What policy measures, in his view, need to be taken to allow for broader participation?</p></speech>

The ESRI, the Government's own economists and various academics, especially in institutions like UCD, have worked a lot on this.  Ireland is unusual in having many adults who, in other countries, given their characteristics, might be expected to be working or not.  I can give a list of issues to think about but the precise programmes would require careful analysis.  There are people in the ESRI and elsewhere who could give the members more guidance on that.  Do we have a childcare system that allows parents with young children to enter the workforce?  Are we doing enough for people who do not have the correct skills?  Although it is less of an issue now than it used to be, there are people who do not have enough educational skills.  There may be people who have had particular health issues such as people with disability-----</p></speech>

One area in Ireland in which we could add to the labour market is by bringing in people who currently find it is not possible to work for different reasons.  That is a much broader population than the unemployed.  Many people are not registered as unemployed who might, if conditions were right, be interested in being able to work.</p></speech>

These issues are always there.  When we are at full employment, the consequences for the economy may be different.

It is half full as far as I can see.  For Professor Lane to use the phrase "buoyant domestic activity in a strong international economy", considering where we were not too long ago, is very positive.  However, he tempers it.  There is a balance with regard to what he sees as the dangers and risks.  The issue that pops out at me is the shifting in international tax regimes.  Tax regimes by their very nature evolve.   We know about the measures we have seen in the past ten years when it comes to the US, transfer pricing or the efforts throughout the European Union and within the Commission to harmonise tax codes, etc.  Is Professor Lane talking about something different, something else that is on the horizon?  I will ask him again, although I am not asking him to be prescriptive, if there are things we are not doing in this House that we should be doing when it comes to what he sees as the dangers.</p></speech>

Clearly, some of the driving forces here are global.  Global corporations are accounting for a larger and larger share of the world economy.  The profitability of some of these corporations is unprecedented in global history.  There is a global interest in finding a viable global tax system which ensures that these corporations pay taxes in a way that is acceptable to political systems all over the world.  That is a common background which the IMF and others will repeatedly comment on.</p></speech>

Then, in terms of designing a policy response, maybe for viability reasons the relevant group is that of the advanced economies globally, for which the OECD is the forum.  The OECD has 30-something advanced economy members and this is where a lot of the tax reform is leading.  The position of the Irish Government is that it is the best forum in which to work on this issue.  Within the EU we see local variations on it and this is an area in which countries have a lot of autonomy.  We have just seen the new tax Bill in the US since the end of last year.  The net impact of that tax reform is still unclear.  There is a lot in it and many corporations are still working out their strategic response to it.  It is partly the US tax Bill and partly it is the final outcome, for example from the OECD, on digital taxation.  Partly it is the question of whether there will be an EU dynamic within the OECD dynamic.</p><p>This is a constant issue.  It is coming back to policy actions.</p></speech>

These global corporations operate in many countries and I do not think we can ignore this global momentum.  Rather than just say we will be concerned about our own tax system, I advocate being an active contributor in the global debate.  We are experts here.  We know a lot about global corporations because they are here.  The technical experts here know a lot and can add a lot to that global debate.</p></speech>

If he sees this going in one direction, he should quantify effectively what we will lose in tax revenue and project it over ten years, and if he sees a point where it is extremely damaging for our overall tax revenue and what we are taking in surely he has to say, hang on a second, this is a massive amount of what we use for public services and other expenditure and we need to draw the line here.  Am I reading Professor Lane correctly?</p></speech>

This is something on which many people have the same message.  Later this year when I write my annual pre-budget letter to the Minister I will address corporation tax.  It is not really a question of projection because that conveys some degree of certainty that is just totally impossible to have, but so long as there is a risk that some corporation tax revenue may not be relied upon in the future then the answer is to allocate some of it either to reducing the national debt or to building up a rainy day fund.  The answer is really the same.  We are in a world of uncertainty.  We know what happened with the construction-related tax revenues 15 years ago, but now in relation to corporate tax revenue some probability has to be given to the fact that not all of this tax revenue is necessarily sustainable.  There are different strategies on this but when one has global corporations contributing to our corporation tax base we have to take this global perspective on it.</p></speech>

I wish to touch on a few topics very briefly.  In terms of the non-performing loan classifications that were touched on, and those in the State who have split mortgages and are meeting the terms of their restructured arrangement, they look to the Central Bank as well for their protection and to act as a watchdog for their rights.  Loan sales are being undertaken in the State whereby those individuals are categorised in the same bundle as people who have not met with the bank or discussed their case with the bank in almost a decade in some cases.  With the engagement banks have with the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, what level of protection can the Central Bank offer those people who dealt with the bank originally, who met the terms of the restructure and who do not want to deal with a vulture's agent?</p></speech>

As I referenced earlier, there is absolute clarity, including for the banks, as to what is required for the loans to be classified in a different way - to move from a non-performing loan to a performing loan or from securities to another term.  The banks are clear on what needs to happen and they have choices as to how they go about it.</p></speech>

There was major disagreement between two particular banks over the classification.  Why is that the case when Mr. Sibley says there is clarity?</p></speech>

I have been clear throughout in terms of my engagement with the firms that these loans can cure.  They need to be treated in a consistent way, and included in that is both the bit that is being repaid, where capital interest is being paid, and what is called the warehouse.  There is a requirement for consistency in the system in terms of how that happens.</p> <p>  A question was raised into the SSMs and because there are variations of this type of restructure in other jurisdictions it took some time for us to land on a final perspective that could be consistently applied beyond just Ireland.  Probably the last time the banks were in, that process was still under way.  Subsequent to that we have written to the banks and it has been confirmed to them that they can cure loans in the way I have said all along, namely, subject to certain conditions, including those that were discussed earlier around the performance of the bit that is being repaid and the treatment of the warehouse element.</p></speech>

I can fully understand why there are concerns but I emphasise that in terms of our consumer protection codes the approach that we take to consumer protection travels with borrowers in all circumstances where there are splits or in other circumstances.  They are not dependent on them being in the banking system.  We work very hard to make sure they are all okay.</p></speech>

At times it can even be difficult to get basic information.  We as a committee need to follow that very closely.</p> <p>  In terms of the tracker scandal, as we approach payments of &euro;500 million by banks, what has the Central Bank learned from this whole process?</p></speech>

We have obviously learned from the trackers but as I said earlier, globally, there are so many misconduct scandals.  I encourage members to look at what is going on with the commission in Australia which has had quite an impact in recent weeks.  When one looks at the history of consumer protection, one focus which remains necessary is whether customers are getting the right information and if they are being sufficiently financially educated to make financial decisions.  That is not enough because there will always be asymmetry between the big financial firm and the individual, so the focus must be on the conduct of the firms and whether they are conducting themselves in a way that is fair to consumers.</p><p>This is why last year the Central Bank created a dedicated financial conduct pillar to ensure consumers and investors are protected appropriately and that markets are properly run.  Ms Rowland leads that as director general of financial conduct.</p></speech>

Not just this jurisdiction but many others are looking at how we can further strengthen the regulatory frameworks.  At the end of the day, responsibility for fair conduct rests with the providers of the service to the customers.  What we have seen in Ireland and in other jurisdictions is that there is not much trust in the behaviour of the banks towards their customers.  This is a global phenomenon.  Accordingly, it is right that we further heighten the focus on the way products are sold to customers, such as looking in great detail at the behaviour that informs how they are sold.</p> <p>  A report on culture will be delivered in the middle of the year.  Culture informs the motivations and results in the behaviours one sees.  Does one have the right tone from the top of the organisations when one is designing and selling a product?  Have the highest levels of the organisation decided what benefit this product will be to the customer and what is the right customer segment for it?  Is it in fact being sold to the right customer segment?  Are front-line staff being rewarded for delivering good customer outcomes?  Are the right kinds of staff being promoted for this kind of behaviour and are they rising up the ranks?</p> <p>  In large organisations, one wants to see the whole of the system working in an integrated way from boardroom decisions right down to the provision of the service to the customers.  We need to further strengthen our approach to ensure that it is structured and clear when we look at product governance and oversight, as well as closely examining the way which products are sold and if they are appropriate.

Was the Central Bank shocked at the way banks were treating their customers through this process?</p></speech>

The risk factor was recognised by the Central Bank and warnings were issued.  The warnings should have been enough.  The banks needed to handle their customers coming off fixed-rate mortgages correctly.  We introduced a consumer protection code in 2006 which essentially stated that, in handling financial contracts with customers, the banks needed to put the customer first.  The scale of ignoring that has been a shock.</p> <p>  The way financial regulation is supposed work is that much happens through prevention.  Some elements of this were caught.  We think the scandal would have been even bigger without some of the actions taken several years ago.  Eventually, we flipped it around.  Instead of the banks just working on a point where we see a problem, it is up to them to prove where they do not have a problem.  We assume all mortgages have to be examined.  When we went universal in 2015, we said it was not enough for us to follow up where we see a problem.  What we have seen over the course of the examination - this is why the numbers have climbed - is that some banks have taken a narrow approach trying to limit the scope of it.  Only under sustained probing over the past several years has this examination widened sufficiently to ensure all of those who are included should be included.</p> <p>  There are two parts to it, namely, the original problem and how the examination went.  It should have gone a lot quicker.  It would have gone a lot quicker if some banks had a more consumer-focused attitude as opposed to being overly defensive.</p></speech>

The shareholders in these banks will be following up on the costs of dealing with this issue.  We have enforcement investigations which include both institutional and individual angles to them.  As Ms Rowland said, for the future and as part of a politically acceptable regime, we have heard repeatedly about accountability.  The accountability of individuals would be more extensive under this senior manager type regime where responsibility has to be fully accepted by those leading these organisations, even if they may not be personally or directly involved in some cases of mishandling.  If one is responsible for an organisation of tens of thousands of people, one needs to be accountable.</p></speech>

How material are they for the health of the banking system&rsquo;s balance sheets?  Has the Central Bank a measurement for this?</p></speech>

Typically, we look through them in any event on what is called a fully-loaded basis to examine the true financial strength of a bank.  In that regard, the capital position of the banks with the deferred tax assets would be sufficiently robust without them.  It is not a cause for concern to us from a capital perspective.</p></speech>

We also examined the global approach.  Ireland is a leading participant in the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, mechanism to ensure that there is a global approach to taxation and that there is no erosion of sovereignty in terms of Ireland setting its own tax rules.  In terms of loss of income and risk to the economy regarding this proposal, is the Central Bank discussing this in any shape or form with its European counterparts?</p></speech>

As digital activities can be allocated across jurisdictions, there needs to be an international answer.  We have to learn to live with that.  It is no surprise that there is a range of views in Europe.  There are those who believe it is imperative that tax rate decisions remain a national decision.  Then there are those who would prefer to move towards a more harmonised and consolidated tax base.  That is essentially a political judgment.  Central bankers do not overly discuss tax issues.  We recognise the distance between what is the responsibility of political systems, which is tax, and what is our responsibility, which is the financial system.</p><p>This issue is really high up on the global agenda and the ideal forum for dealing with it is the OECD.  We will have to see what it comes up with but it may lead to a revision of what happens here.</p></speech>

Is it the responsibility of the Irish Central Bank, if it sees a policy being devised in Europe that could present a real threat to our economy but where that risk is not being quantified before policymakers make a final decision to implement it, to respond as guardian of our financial system?</p></speech>

We did so when the new US tax laws were proposed.  If anything else is proposed, we will examine its implications for our financial system.  Tax is a big issue, especially for this economy given the size of the multinational sector here.  We absolutely will do that.  It is important to recognise that tax systems are partly based on principle or philosophy, regardless of any impact assessment.  If there is a philosophical decision made that tax systems should behave in a certain way, one must live with that regardless of the impact assessment.  Decisions do not always wait for impact assessments.  The reality is that decisions may be made using a values-based approach rather than on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

We have a lot of options, from fitness and probity to taking enforcement cases.  In the tracker mortgage examination, the first priority has been to identify the customers who were affected - they number 37,100 - and to ensure the payment of compensation and redress to them.  That work is ongoing, with &euro;459 million having already been paid out to customers and more to follow.  As part of that examination, a separate approach to this is to take enforcement cases which require a forensic investigation into the conduct of the lender to establish if it has broken the rules, the evidence to support that and the participation of individuals.  That must be a rigorous and detailed process so that we can bring those cases properly through to fruition.  The Central Bank has a good track record on enforcement cases, having concluded more than 100 already, all of them made public.  We do take fitness and probity cases and have prohibited people in the past and I am quite certain that will continue.  We are very committed to that.</p></speech>

I would contend that this would not have happened at all were it not for the relentless pressure from this committee on the Central Bank and on the various banks that we hauled in here, month after month.  Eventually, the Minister for Finance called Professor Lane into his office and that is why the numbers have increased.  There is no other reason.</p></speech>

As I have said repeatedly, the Central Bank operates on a confidential basis with the banks and often we cannot disclose information.  This committee has been incredibly helpful in shining a public spotlight on the issue, especially with the testimony of those who were harmed by the tracker scandal and the testimony of various representatives from the banks.  We learned quite a lot when we heard how they talked to this committee.  This committee has been very helpful but it is also the case that behind all of that, the mechanics of how this is happening is through the work of the Central Bank.  In October, when we had the interaction with the Minister, the outcome was that the banks were reminded of the need to comply with our examination.  The framework has been our examination, which we designed.  Essentially, that has been consistent throughout and has led to this outcome.  This committee has played a very important role but, essentially, it reinforced the process that was already in place and which remains in place, namely, our examination.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has all of the information at its disposal, in terms of the wages people are earning, rates of unemployment and so on.  What recommendations did the Central Bank make to the Government?  It has laid a lot of blame on politicians today.  We heard Mr. Tony O'Brien of the HSE say at committee that it is a matter for politicians to come up with health policies.  When it suits the Central Bank, the HSE and other organs of the State, they try to lay the blame at the door of politicians.  As I said, the former Minister for Finance said in 2010 that there was a requirement for 25,000 new houses per year.  In its statement today, the Central Bank predicts that approximately 23,000 houses will be built in 2018 and up to 30,000 in 2019.  Almost ten years after the former Minister made that statement, we are getting up to the required level of house-building.  What recommendations did the Central Bank make to the Government at that time?  Did it outline what the Government needed to do to ensure that the required 25,000 houses per annum were built so that we would not be in the situation we are in today whereby in places like Dublin, nobody can buy a house?</p></speech>

No matter who was involved in these conversations back at the worst time of the crisis, it is an interesting issue and interesting for the future as well to think about this matter.  There were concerns back in the worst of the crisis that maybe not enough was being done in terms of investment for the future.  Clearly, in terms of the overall austerity, public investment took a big hit during the crisis.  One of the lessons for the future is at what level of austerity does one cause long-term damage.</p> <p>  In terms of learning from how the crisis was handled, it was important for Ireland to do a lot of fiscal consolidation.  Clearly, one of the potential cost factors was excessive pessimism about the future.  Those were some very dark days.</p> <p>  In terms of reasonable expectations and taking a long-term perspective, we can continue to look back and assess that.  We have ended up in a situation where there is a supply deficit and although housing and construction are moving more needs to happen.  There is some supply response now but it is an ongoing challenge.  The instruments for dealing with that remain with the other arms of the State and not with the Central Bank.  Our role is to keep the financial system safe and protect consumers, and through our mortgage measures we are doing so.  The construction industry and policies towards construction involve genuine political choices.  It remains the responsibility of the political system to make those choices.</p></speech>

First, how does one ensure more affordable houses are built?  That will done by using a mix of private initiatives and public policy.  Second, there is the cost of mortgages, which this committee has focused on before.  We are seeing a bit more competition in the market and Mr. Sibley will comment on the matter.  As the economy recovers and confidence levels in the economy rise then the prospects for more competitive pricing improves but that is a separate issue.  There is only a certain number of houses available to buy.  If we make credit policies easier, it will not result in more houses being available for purchase. </p></speech>

The PTSB has told us that it cannot lend to developers to develop houses.  If a person has two sites he or she cannot get funding from the PTSB to build two houses because of the regulations that the Central Bank has put in place.  Basically, lending is limited.  An ordinary person or small developer who wants a mortgage has a limited number of places to go other than to vulture funds.</p></speech>

An important lesson that has been learned from the crisis is that the role of debt financing for construction must be in proportion with equity finance.  We cannot have a situation where the construction industry is overly reliant on bank debt.  That causes a problem especially when the retained earnings of many construction firms have been wiped out by the crisis.  There is a financial problem but the answer is not for the banks to lend more money without equity.  The answer is that we need more sources of equity funding for construction and we have seen that through the entry of large construction firms, which raise money on the stock market.  It is welcome to have more equity funding coming in.  This is the genuine reason the housing supply response has been slower than in the past.  The answer is not to make bank debt financing easier.  The answer has to be, in part, more equity financing.</p></speech>

First, the firms acknowledge that the Central Bank has been in touch.  However, they still refuse to come in here.</p><p>It is hugely important that they come in to explain how they operate and so on.  As long as they do not, the customer is badly served.  Customers are complaining to us about the treatment they receive at the hand of credit servicing firms, which are being dictated to by vulture funds.  In his opening statement, the Governor referred to how effective the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is in the context of the sale of loan books.  I want to bring to his attention again the fact the vulture funds or credit servicing firms seem not to give a damn about the code of conduct.  I have received numerous complaints from customers.  For example, a credit servicing firm was asked for information on the make-up of a portfolio and the amount that was originally paid into the bank before it was sold to be managed by a vulture fund and, in turn, the firm.  To this day, it has not responded to that client.  There is nothing in the portfolio bar properties and the client has no information.  The firm wanted to sell all the properties and the client said that was okay.  The firm came back to him last week and said it wanted &euro;175,000 from him.  He does not have a penny.</p><p> In another case, the client has been harassed so much that he had to pledge his sister's pension fund to them.  I have been present at some of the interactions and it is anything but pleasant.  Dealing with banks is not pleasant but dealing with these servicing agents is the worst that I have witnessed.  Professor Lane referred to EU developments in banking regulation and said that Ireland is an example for other countries to follow.  It is not and I appeal to him to examine this issue.  When he drills down into the detail, he will find the greatest blackguards ever in those firms, and they are acting on behalf of vulture funds.  What additional powers can be inserted into the code of conduct?  What insistence can the Central Bank put in place that the funds deliver on the code because that is not happening?</p></speech>

The initial phase was to authorise these firms and ascertain whether they were meeting our regulatory requirements.  The follow-up has been to ascertain whether they are respecting the codes that they need to operate under.  The level of protection for consumers is different from the level of protection for someone, say, with an investment portfolio but perhaps Ms Rowland can provide an update.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1778" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#V00300"><p>The consumer protection framework in place travels with the loan.  All the protections of the CPC and the requirements to treat people fairly embedded in it travel with the loans and they are required to be adhered to.  The protections of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears also travel with the loan and because this is an area about which there is considerable concern and because we are also concerned about the risks, we have conducted on-site inspections in the credit servicing firms, particularly focusing on the issue of people's homes and how they are being treated in compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Given our careful scrutiny of that, I am interested in the Chairman providing us, as he said he would, with any information about requirements to pledge people's pension funds or otherwise because we will take that into account.  One of the key parts of the framework is that no implementation of an instruction from an unregulated loan owner that is in breach of the regulatory requirements is permitted.  If anyone acts in that way, we will take that seriously.  I want to be clear that we are carefully looking at inspecting compliance with the code.  One of the key foundation stones of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears relates to people's family homes - if one only owns one property, that is probably covered as well - and that requires sympathetic, speedy but respectful resolution, where possible.  We do not tolerate harassing behaviours and the code provides for that.  Where the Chairman has information in this regard, we would welcome it because it is something we take seriously.</p> <p>  We have also separately been asked to conduct a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to ascertain if it is optimally effective as the problem moves on, and we are committed to this.  As part of that, we are looking at the on-site inspections of their conduct, particularly with respect to family homes.  We are also speaking to the Insolvency Service of Ireland to gain its insights into what is happening in its sphere and to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, because it is important that we examine this from a number of points of view to see if anything else can be done and if the problem has moved on.  We are committed to work in this area.</p></speech>

I write to someone in December and he or she does not bother answering me.  Is it not a basic courtesy to go back and forth?  That basic courtesy is not being afforded to clients of vulture funds and that is a problem.  They are turning to us for protection.  I am turning to Ms Rowland and she is wrong in respect of unregulated entities and having a solution with the front-of-house being the service agent.  It is not working for people.  I will give her the detailed information.  I know it is true because I have been working on cases myself.  I pointed out previously when the officials were before the committee that other members have contacted service agents directly and have had the same experience trying to defend individuals who are making a legitimate case to them.  I will come back to Ms Rowland on this case.  I ask the Governor, however, to reflect on this issue in the context of what he said about European developments and the code of conduct.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about receivers in this context.</p></speech>

In recent weeks and months, especially since the Bill that Deputy Michael McGrath proposed, we went back and re-examined the matter, root and branch.  A natural starting point is to ask why regulation is not in a position to deal with it.  Indeed, that was the reason for the initial establishment of the Central Bank and indeed the Department of Finance.  The conclusion, a number of years ago, was that from the point of view of consumer protection the credit servicing firm is the correct level to do it at.</p></speech>

Nothing extra would be delivered by regulating the owners themselves.  We went back and looked at that, because it was our view.  It remains our view.  We have examined the issue up and down.  We are talking about reviewing how credit servicing firms are regulated, and the answer remains that for consumer protection purposes, regulating the credit servicing firms can be effective.  Nothing extra will be added by regulating the owners.</p> <p>  I am aware that this is a long-standing issue.  We have looked at this from the consumer protection point of view, and nothing extra will be added by regulating the owners.  The issue concerns how these firms interact with those who are in distress.  Anything that consumer protection can deliver on that question can also be delivered through the regulation of credit servicing firms.  We have been carrying out inspections and we have not seen these problems in terms of consumer issues.  Investors were mentioned earlier, for example, someone who might have an investment portfolio who may not fall under the consumer code.  It is still relevant in terms of correct conduct, but we believe that this distinction is important, and that, for consumer protection purposes, the credit servicing firms are the appropriate venue.</p></speech>

A lady writes that listening to politicians talking about vulture funds over the past few days has been infuriating, and that some have no understanding of the process, never mind the paralysing effects on human beings.  This lady's family home is involved in this.  She goes on to explain that while her personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, was negotiating with the bank - AIB in this instance - it sold everything to a vulture fund.  The stress and suffering is unnecessary, she says.  She has had five psychiatric hospitalisations since 2011.  That is the type of negative impact that this is having on the lives of citizens.  In that instance, as in many others, this code of conduct does not work.  That is the point I am making.  It is very difficult for the individual to deal with these people.  They never expected to be in this position, and they are not getting the protection of the State as they try to work their way out of these loans.  I ask the witnesses to consider that.  That is the evidence I am giving.</p></speech>

I agree with the Chair that there is an issue of unfamiliarity.  If one had a loan with a nationally known bank here but the loan is subsequently sold to someone else, it will create some uncertainty.  However, regardless of who owns the loan the same legal framework and the same codes apply.  The same consumer protection framework is there, no matter who owns the loan.  This is the fundamental issue.<br/><br/><b>Chairman:</b>Professor Lane is missing the point.  I am not arguing that the code of conduct is not there.  I am saying that, whether it is a vulture fund or one of its agents managing the mortgage on behalf of the fund, no heed is paid to the code.  Who will the affected person turn to?  There are many others on record.  Who will they turn to in order to have their rights acknowledged?</p></speech>

That is what we are finding.  For people who are suffering from having distressed debt, the wider framework has many supports for individuals.  Perhaps negotiating the situation is not entirely obvious for those people, but the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, Abhaile and the Insolvency Service of Ireland are available and I would advocate that anyone in this situation should try to avail of those supports.  The codes of conduct and the consumer protection framework is what we can deliver on.  In some cases there will be the prospect of restructuring.</p><p>In other cases the insolvency service can be effective while in other cases, which I hope would be a last resort, whether through voluntary surrender or through the court's system, there will be repossessions.  All of that does not change no matter who owns the loans.</p></speech>

I have read out one email - I have loads of them - and I gave Professor Lane examples of the others.  I acknowledged the code of conduct and everything else that is there.  The point is that these funds and the banks know the code of conduct is there but they ignore it.  For example, Professor Lane said to me that restructuring would go on.  In one case the woman was attempting to restructure in the middle of negotiations and the bank sold the loan on to a vulture fund.  I am asking Professor Lane to deal with the reality we face here and the questions we are being asked by the constituents we represent.  I am being told that this is not working.  God forbid that any other European state would take on these unregulated vultures and have them dress up their shop window with a regulated agent.  It is not working.</p></speech>

We should be stopping it.  The Central Bank of Ireland and whoever is responsible for the code of conduct should be kicking these firms around the place to acknowledge it and protect the rights of citizens.</p></speech>

This is a fundamental point because it comes back to the legislative proposal.  There is a set of issues which is basically procedures.  Are the procedures fair, civilised and reasonable?  That is what a code of conduct is about.  Is the process for code of conduct for mortgage arrears fair, civilised and reasonable?  It is not about the nature of the final outcome.  The final outcome, whether it is a restructured mortgage, whether it leads to repossession or whether it is the individual going to the insolvency service, does not turn on the code of conduct.  If the Chair is referring to what the outcome will be, that is a wider issue.  Let me again point out that fundamentally the Irish system has put in a lot of support for the individual.  It is about the insolvency service.  It is about the support the advisory services make available to people in deep distress.  It is not a code of conduct issue.  We are saying that the credit servicing funds are under a code of conduct.  We are saying that from what we see in our inspections they are respecting those codes of conduct.  I do not think the Chair is talking about that but about the kind of outcomes that will be delivered.</p></speech>

They are not acknowledging the code of conduct in dealing with people.  They are not even civilised in their exchange with individuals.</p></speech>

We look at all information we get.  We are supervising these credit servicing firms and we take that very seriously.  What I am telling the Chair is that on the basis of we have seen so far we have not seen a systematic violation of these codes of conduct.  I ask Ms Rowland to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#BB00800"><p>I want to add to that because there may be people listening who are worried.  We all acknowledge how worrying it is for people who are in distress or worried about paying their mortgage or who may be in arrears.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the consumer protection code apply equally, whether one's loan is owned by a bank that is regulated or sold to an unregulated loan owner.  The protections of the code travel with the sale of the loan.  People are entitled to expect the full adherence to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the consumer protection code whether they are dealing with a regulated bank or whether their loan has been sold to an unregulated loan owner.  It is important that people realise that and engage to the maximum extent because the code of conduct represents the Central Bank of Ireland working to the maximum it can within the framework of the State as it is currently structured.  The example that was given was a proposal coming from a personal insolvency practitioner which means that the case has sadly reached the stage where it is in the phase of the insolvency service trying to support somebody to come to a sustainable solution.  It is important to know there are a number of actors in the system of the State to deal with that.  People have the support of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and I know the insolvency service is concerned with being as active as it can in that.  The protections travel, notwithstanding where the ownership of the loan rests.</p></speech>

That decision was made.  We will, of course, take on board the views of the Central Bank of Ireland as to how best to do that but that decision was made in principle and it will be put into effect.  What I have not heard from the witnesses is what the downside is of regulating funds and loan owners.  Perhaps the witnesses will give us their views on that.  I heard previously from the director of consumer protection, Mr. Bernard Sheridan, that the preferred approach of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the time of the credit servicing legislation, was that loan owners be regulated.  I have that in writing.  I think the witness is indicating that was not the case.</p></speech>

The letter Deputy Michael McGrath received from Mr. Bernard Sheridan said that the preferred position of the Central Bank of Ireland, when this issue first came up, was to regulate the loan owners.  That was also the position of the Department of Finance.  At that point, and as a result of the consultation process before that Act was passed, the conclusion, which I think was shared one by us and by the Department of Finance, in respect of the practical issues about regulating the loan owner versus regulating credit servicing would have been that consumer protection can be delivered just by regulating credit servicing.</p></speech>

If we saw that there would be an advantage, I would say it but we have gone up and down on this.  We have looked at everything from every angle and we do not think it will deliver any extra protection for consumers by regulating the owners.  There is a separate issue about accountability which I think is-----</p></speech>

It is not an infinite cost but they will have to go through the process of setting up a legal entity here in order to do so.  I am not saying it is a gigantic cost but it is a cost.  I do not see an upside in terms of delivering a different outcome for customers.  My honestly held view is that I do not think anything extra will be gained.  This is also the conclusion across Europe and that is why this European directive is there.  That is important.  It would put us in an unusual position where the State would be saying it is deviating from this emerging European norm by not only regulating credit servicing but regulating the owners.  We will live with any legislation that is passed.  We can think about the practical consequences of that but it will not change the fundamental which is that mortgages operate within a legal framework.  We have a responsibility in terms of fair process through codes.  We can all look at the insolvency process where a lot has happened and ask what else can be done there but in the end that legal framework will not be changed based on whether these ultimate owners are regulated or not because what does that mean?</p><p>It means that they will set up a legal entity here.  The ultimate shareholders of everything can be global.  Ownership is about the behaviour of the regulated entity.  Regardless of whether it is a credit servicing firm or becomes a retail credit firm, ultimately it has to comply with our codes.  That is already true for credit servicing firms.  It is not the case that consumer protection will differ if we require those who wish to buy up loans to become regulated here.  That would not provide anything extra.</p></speech>

The reality is that if my loan is sold to a fund, it will make all of the key decisions surrounding it.  Such a fund would be beyond the reach of the Central Bank.  We heard a while ago about ongoing inspections with the credit servicing firms.  The credit servicing firms are the conduits and channels of communication between the borrowers and the lenders.  They do not make decisions.  When we contact them in our capacity as public representatives, they say they will pass on what we have to say to the fund that owns the loan in question and we are eventually informed of the decision made.  There are no inspections and no powers of investigation or enforcement.  The people who control loans, businesses and homes are accountable to nobody.  That is the current position.  The Central Bank can hold the credit servicing firm to account, but it cannot hold the people who are making the actual decisions to account.  I cannot understand the Central Bank's reluctance to embrace its powers and deal with these matters.</p></speech>

If we can do this to the credit servicing firms that are engaging directly with the debtors for consumer protection, what would be added by interacting in the way the Deputy is advocating?  If the loan owners were regulated, we would be able to inspect a legal entity established by the funds, but we would be doing so within the same framework.  We would be assessing whether the codes were being respected.  I remind the committee that we regulate non-banks for conduct, not for prudential reasons.  That is the fundamental issue.  It is not the case that if we regulated for consumer protection purposes any entity that they would be compelled to set up, the outcome would be different.  The Deputy played a lead role in passing the credit servicing Act.  It was hoped beforehand that there would be voluntary compliance.  The passing of the legislation was an act of leadership by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Typically, they do not do the mainstream most popular forbearance measures of arrears capitalisation, term extension, interest only and so on.  They just do not do them.  I am dealing with these types of cases.  I have written to the bank about Tanager, which involves a group of customers who had arrears several years ago and have had consecutive years of making their repayments 100% in terms of interest and capital.  They have asked can they recapitalise those old arrears, put them on the mortgage and spread them out over the remainder of the term, and the answer they have got is: "No.  We do not do arrears capitalisations".</p></speech>

We can certainly provide more information on that.  The question is whether the proposed legislation addresses that problem and whether it can force the currently unregulated entities to drive through specific restructuring.  That is where-----</p></speech>

Is Mr. Sibley open to and will he invite submissions on a review of the code?  Will he examine the provision whereby a lender only has to consider the restructuring options that it offers?  This was a key change in the 2013 code and it lets these funds completely off the hook.  They can say they will not do arrears capitalisation, interest only, split mortgage or term extension arrangements.  They can say no alternative arrangement can be agreed and that the options are voluntary sale, voluntary surrender or court proceedings.  That is the reality of what is happening in practice.  Will Mr. Sibley take submissions on a review of the code and will he specifically look at clause 39?  My iPad has just locked out, but under clause 39 they are not obliged to examine the appropriateness of the full suite of forbearance options?  They could say: "We just do not do them".</p></speech>

As I said, we are already undertaking one element of it that we believe is very important, which is a review of the credit servicing firms and their compliance with the provisions of the code.  They are prohibited from putting into place an instruction that is in breach of regulatory requirements.  That means if an underlying loan owner tells them to breach the code or gives them an instruction to do so, they cannot and we can hold them to account for their conduct in that.  If an underlying loan owner reaches out and starts engaging with customers, then because of the framework, they too can be held to account and brought into regulation.  We are also looking at getting insights from, as I have said, the insolvency service and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  We will consider anything the Deputy wishes to suggest to us and, as we want to get on with work, I ask that he would make any such suggestions sooner rather than later.  If we were to propose any changes as a result of this, I want to be clear in pointing out that we would have to then undertake a consultation, as per our normal framework.  Therefore, there would be a later opportunity to consult on any proposals.  However, we would certainly take on board any suggestions at this time.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to clause 39, which is a reference to mandating the actual provision of different options.

The code of conduct cannot mandate a particular way of handling a loan.  The legal framework provides for the decision making power to lie with the owner and that will remain no matter who we regulate.   It is not the case that we could mandate a loan owner where, for example, it must offer splits or must do X, Y and Z.

We have not seen that so far.  What are the exit strategies for these funds?  It is not the case that the exit strategy is to repossess every house that is possible.  I would point to them having restructured loans that generate some degree of income, which then can allow an exit through securitisation, for example, of restructured mortgages.  We have reported that the number of repossessions, either voluntary or by court order, by these firms remains very low.  It is not the case that repossession is the primary strategy.</p></speech>

To follow up on the regulation of both the service agents in the country and the funds, from my perspective, the name &quot;funds&quot; is a bit of a misnomer for many of these funds.  They borrow from funds in American and they then invest in the Irish market.  They are not funds; they are basically loan sharks, which are 100% geared.  They come into the Irish market.  Some of them are funds, and some of them are based here and some of them are based abroad.</p><p>In the opening statement provided to the committee, the Governor made reference to: </p><blockquote>foreign capital flows into the commercial property market that are the result of the global search for yield in the current low interest rate environment are vulnerable to a sudden stop or even a sharp reversal should there be an adverse shift in global financing conditions.  In turn, this could generate disorderly property market price reversals. </blockquote> <p>I have two questions on that.  I understand the type of regulation the Central Bank does of these service providers is effectively desktop based.  I would have thought these service providers should be required to make returns to the Central Bank.  It regulates them, therefore, I assume they deal with most of the restructuring.  They should be making returns to the Central Bank like any other institution regarding what they are putting in place.  I would have thought the Central Bank should have had people physically out conducting audits, as would happen with any other normal institution.  I understand the Central Bank does not regard them as material in terms of their individual size relative to larger institutions when in fact they could be quite significant.  </p><p>From my perspective, their current footprint is quite astounding.  I am based in Limerick city and these funds are involved in most of the developments, ranging from housing estates, commercial developments to apartments, taking place there.  Does the Governor have a concern about stability in terms of that property creep?  We are talking about regulating these entities.  I would have thought there is sufficient provision in terms of the powers the Central Bank has over the service providers to get that level of information, and to heavily regulate them in the same way that it regulates the other financial institutions or even more so because of the threat they may pose to the stability of property market.  </p><p>Another issue I have found is that many of these funds are appointing receivers.  They may have typically bought a fund from someone else, a bank or from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and then they suddenly appoint a receiver.  What powers does the Central Bank have over the receiver?  Could a fund, which is in some way regulated through the service provider, suddenly appoint a receiver to call in the loans it has in order to sell a large amount of property, and by doing that, would they be bypassing any form of regulation?</p><p>There is a looseness in the regulation of such service providers that is within the power of the Central Bank to address in a more prudential-----</p></speech>

What happened is that they came in suddenly, bought property and loans for half nothing and suddenly realised they were sitting on a goldmine.  They are holding on to the property.  I see too much of this on a day-to-day basis.  Does the Governor have concerns over the pervasiveness of disposal agency activity in the property market in Ireland, bearing in mind stability, consumer protection and control over the rental market?  A myriad of issues arise but they are all linked.  What is the Central Bank doing this regard?  If it is identifying that there could be disorderly property market price reversals, effectively owing to the activities of vulture funds here, what is it doing to address this to ensure they do not happen?</p></speech>

Our attention is very much to ensure the local banks are appropriately provisioned and hold appropriate capital against commercial real estate here so that if there were a fall in prices, the Irish banking system, on which we all rely for daily business, would remain okay.  It is to ensure that if some bunch of global investors loses money, we will be less concerned and a systematic risk will not be imposed here.  For the Irish financial system, it is a net positive to have the entry of international finance providing extra funding here.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath asked how much the balance of the different types of resolutions was inherited when they bought the books and how much reflects what they are doing on an ongoing basis.  We can look at that question but we do receive information from these firms.</p></speech>

It is not a prudential motive because these agencies are not taking money from Irish depositors.  They do not pose the same systemic risk, which is why we prudentially regulate banks and so on.  The nature of the regulation is very different.</p></speech>

The Governor referred to market price reversal and a material risk that there could be a fall in property prices over the next two or three years.  What price increases or decreases are built into the Central Bank's economic projections for the next two or three years?  What is the percentage?</p></speech>

We then go through different downside scenarios.  Therefore, the reversal in house prices is in the category of a downside scenario.  What we publish in our forecasts is macroeconomics, including what will happen to GDP and consumption.  We do not forecast house prices.  What we do is try to understand the beliefs of those involved in the market.  Fairly consistently, based on a three-year horizon, the figure is around 15%.  This is based on adding up the figures over three years.</p></speech>

There is obviously more room for prices to grow quickly when coming from the bottom of the crisis but, as we get closer to fundamental values, more constraints kick in.

Does the Governor believe there are early signs that the housing market is overheating?  By how much would property prices have to increase before the Governor would be concerned that the property market is overheating and that we are moving into territory that might see a reversal in the price of houses?</p></speech>

At what rate would the Governor be concerned that the property market is overheating?  Are we seeing early signs of that as we speak?</p></speech>

That is not overheating.  It is a balance between what is going on in the economy.  This year, we expect employment to grow strongly and we expect wages to go up.  We are not expecting serious interest rate movements this year.  The economic conditions remain strong.  That will support some movement in house prices.</p></speech>

This is not an absolute statement because it depends on the state of the economy.  Under the good economic conditions we have, some degree of price increases will remain in line with fundamentals.  Honestly speaking, I think it is probably fair to say that if we saw national house prices growing in double digits again this year, I would be looking at that.  It depends-----</p></speech>

It is compared `with what is going on with employment, wages, interest rates and housing supply.

What is the view of the Governor on Brexit and where it is at?  What are the implications for the Irish economy on the financial, economic and social sides?  What is Professor Lane's view as Governor of the Central Bank?</p></speech>

We are drawing strong consensus across many agencies on the view that if we take a ten or 20 year horizon, this change is very regrettable.  In the end, however, it is a loss that will be absorbed by the general improvement in the economy.</p> <p>  The greater concern for us is disruption if it turns out that the Brexit negotiations end up badly.  Right now, there is considerable market confidence that a reasonable negotiation will happen, that there will be a reasonably soft Brexit, that there will not be massive disruption to trade and so on.  In the context of a soft Brexit, the world is prepared for that.</p> <p>  The risk factor is if it turns out that no deal is concluded or if it is a deal with serious trade restrictions.  In that case the way this will affect us depends on how it will affect the UK.  The question is whether the UK is going to suffer a severe slowdown because of a bad outcome.  If the UK suffers a slowdown, it is bad news for us.  However, much else is going on in the Irish economy.  We usually think about this in terms of the 30% rule.  If the UK slows down by one percentage point, then 30% of that will pass on to us.  It is not one for one.  We are not so integrated with the UK that it is a one-for-one relationship.  It is negative for us but it does not overwhelm the domestic economy or our interaction with the USA or the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

I am rather alarmed by some of what we have heard today.  I want to clear something with the Governor.

It also covers up to &euro;3 million of turnover of small businesses.  All those protections apply.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears applies to a family home.  It also applies where a person owns a property.  That may not be the house the person lives in all the time.  It could be a buy-to-let property, for example.  If it is the only property the person has, it is covered in that code as well.</p> <p>  We also have regulations that cover lending, principally to small and medium-sized enterprises.  They provide protections and how they should be dealt with in the course of any engagement.</p></speech>

I want to get at this in terms of accountability.  All of these cases are unravelling in terms of how small businesses, farmers, homeowners and those who have bought a second house are being treated by vulture funds.  I want to know about this for the future.</p> <p>  We are dealing with tracker mortgages in the main now.  I can see down the line where we will be dealing with this.  We are dealing with it at the moment but this will gather pace in the coming months and years.  I want to know where the buck stops when it comes to the consumer protection role in terms of having the proper measures in place and when it comes to implementation as well.</p> <p>  There is an alarming disconnect between the stories we are hearing and what is coming from the Central Bank.  Where do people go when they have a problem with vulture funds?  I will offer one instance.  Will the Central Bank representatives tell me where someone like this could go?  The person has the vulture fund calling to the house, ringing all the time and harassing all the time.  The people involved had bought a second property.  It is a case of the fund agreeing to stop harassing the woman if she signs over the family home.  The thinking is that the woman will be fine then because the fund will not bother her anymore.  She can live in the property for as long as she is alive.  Then when she is dead, the fund will take over the property.  That is the solution being provided.  What would the Central Bank say to that woman?</p></speech>

That is prohibited.  If the case involves a buy-to-let property, the person should not be dealing with the woman directly.  The funds can only operate in the legislative framework through the regulated entity.  They cannot operate directly.  If that is happening, it should not be happening.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh asked about the protections.  Let us suppose the case involves a buy-to-let property where the person owns more than one property.  The protections of the consumer protection code would not permit harassing behaviours or threatening or menacing behaviours.  That would not be permitted as a way of engaging with the consumer.</p> <p>  This is the approach even in respect of a buy-to-let property if it is in addition to the family home.  The aim of the engagement as envisaged by the code is constructive.  The idea is to assist and to come to resolution.  There may be cases involving an unsustainable situation, unfortunately.  None of the behaviour, however, should be threatening, menacing or harassing, as described by Senator Conway-Walsh.</p></speech>

Rather it is done verbally.  How does the Central Bank know through its investigations what is happening when things are done verbally?

I am asking about cases where the vulture fund is not willing to negotiate with small businesses and receivership has been instigated, or a building is sold from under the business and the owners are forced to sign a lease for multiples of what the property's value had been.  I am not referring to non-performing loans but loans where the interest was being paid.  The main aim of the vulture fund was to take the building and make as much money as it possibly could.  I am also concerned about the risk to jobs in the small businesses which experience this behaviour from vulture funds.</p></speech>

If there are concerns that what is happening is a violation of their contract, people should go through the legal framework to resolve them.  That goes beyond consumer protection.  There is a recognition that the legal route is inappropriate for individual consumers and the system is better off having an ombudsman and a regulator to protect consumers, but commercial transactions are legal contracts.  If there is something the small business feels is at odds with its contractual rights, the courts are the framework.</p></speech>

The legislative approach is fairly recent.  The first thing was to put in a strong authorisation framework, and we play a rigorous gatekeeper role.  The fitness and probity of the individuals leading these firms was scrutinised.  The legislative framework does not contain a strong capital requirement and is more orientated towards being a conduct framework.  Part of the foundation of that is a requirement to have robust governance and appropriate risk management to ensure they deliver appropriately in terms of their conduct role, particularly when engaging with consumers.  They have to have clear structures and organisational competence to show they are well organised and resourced so that they can comply with regulation.  We put additional regulatory requirements on them and we have been implementing our supervisory strategy.  This has culminated in on-site inspections to ensure we have a very informed view of their compliance.</p></speech>

If there are more in the future, the sector will get bigger and we would have to add resources for effective supervision.  We are continually reviewing the position.  In recent years we have seen a fairly big increase in bank staff and the target for the end of 2018 is nearly 1,900, having been 1,500 when I arrived in 2015.  We are prepared to increase the number and have made a lot of effort to add staff when we need to.  We are not bound by an embargo or limit.</p></speech>

I am concerned that it is looking at vulture funds through a very narrow prism and from the point of view of the need to protect banks and financial institutions.  I am worried that farmers, small businesses, homeowners or people who have bought a second home are being sacrificed as a result.  The governor said that, were there to be a banking collapse, there would be less of an impact for vulture funds than for regulated entities.</p></speech>

The tax situation faced by these funds is for the Oireachtas to decide and that can evolve over time.  Clearly, in the more favourable regime they used to operate under, the price they were willing to pay for these loans was influenced by that tax regime.  Every year it is at the discretion of the Oireachtas to change that tax system.  That is part of what is possible from the Oireachtas.  The taxation of any type of investor is entirely up to the Oireachtas.  There will be an interaction with the value they are willing to pay for a loan but the impact of that tax is a normal calculation one always makes when one taxes anyone.</p></speech>

There is no trade-off with the consumer protections that are afforded to loans that have been sold to these funds and we take the discharge of that mandate seriously.  There is no lessening of the protections that are afforded to consumers.  They apply equally.</p></speech>

When I say that, I mean that what we care about is the safety of Irish society.  If the investment fund loses money, we are not exposed.  If banks lose money, as Mr. Sibley stated earlier on, part of the post-crisis reforms mean that where an individual bank gets into trouble, we now have a structure and a plan to be able to shut that bank without causing losses to the taxpayer.  Ultimately, if the whole banking system is in trouble, there are scenarios where the Government would have to step in.  The risk to society is through the banking system.  Having a role for non-banks means it is less likely that all of the lending risk in the economy is in the banks.  I do not care about banks, as such.  We work for the public.  We do not work for the banks.  If the banks are unstable, however, there are social and taxation consequences.</p></speech>

I have listened attentively from 10 a.m. to what the Governor had to say.  That statement and how the Governor now balances it in terms of society emphasises the difference between the Central Bank and myself and, I believe, the Oireachtas Members because our task here is to put people front and centre.  One might apply, in legislation, the so-called lesser evil for the greater good, and it would seem from how the Governor describes events and the regulated entities that that is not the case in the bank.</p> <p>  Let me explain.  Over the long weekend just gone, that lady, Yvonne, was jailed because of the efforts she was making to keep her family home, and to this day she is in jail.  In Iceland, the 26th banker was jailed since 2008.  I have listened to the Central Bank state time and time again - Ms Rowland said it a moment ago - that the regulation and rules travel with the loan as it is sold on from the bank to the vulture fund looked after by the regulated entity, but the Central Bank is not listening to what is being said, certainly, in what I stated to the Governor earlier.  As Chairman of this committee, I and other members are trying to convince the Governor.  It may travel but they completely ignore it.  We have given the Governor examples and I will follow up on them in writing.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh talked about the vulture fund representative knocking on the door of the individual concerned.  I can tell the Governor that in my own constituency the same happens but they might use another person, such as the receiver, connected with the regulated entity who is almost independent of the regulated entity.  Essentially, what is happening is they are running rings around the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I ask the Governor to listen to us.  I am not making up the story.  I do not believe any other member is making up the story.  It is fair to say from what I and others know that they are running rings around the Central Bank to push people out of their homes.  When they turn up at the door, it is a frightening experience.  When the letters come through the door, the occupant does not know what to do.</p> <p>  The Governor rightly mentioned earlier that there are supports, such as Abhaile.  Will the Governor tell me what Abhaile does?  Here is what it does.  It will give the person a voucher for legal representation.  The person is waving his or her voucher for &euro;100, &euro;250 or whatever and across the desk from him or her before the court is a senior counsel, a barrister and a solicitor all staked against the individual.  That individual's only recourse is to ask us for help and our recourse is to explain this to the Governor and ask him what he will do.  Having listened to his explanations today, I have to tell the Governor that he is not listening.  The Governor has missed the point about the sales to these vulture funds and how they are regulated.  I firmly believe what Deputy Michael McGrath is trying to achieve in terms of regulating the funds themselves is the proper way to go.</p> <p>  Will the Governor consider after our meeting the points that we have made out of our experience with customers who are affected by their loans having been sold on to vulture funds?  Will he tell me in short sentences what the regulated entity reports to him?  I refer not to the Central Bank looking for information but to what they are obliged to report to the Central Bank.</p></speech>

We are public servants.</p><p>We have only one mandate, namely, to serve the public by delivering on the requirements set for us by the Oireachtas to protect consumers and ensure financial stability.  That is the only motivating force for what we do.  In delivering that mandate we have to make assessments of the prudential health of the banking system, in addition to conduct.  We have the same motivation as Oireachtas Members, namely, to do what is best for the people.  That is all we care about it.  We have listened carefully to everything members have said and take correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas very seriously.  We go to great lengths to be as complete and comprehensive as possible in following up on matters communicated to us.  It is helpful to us to receive information from Members on issues of conduct and whether the banks are behaving correctly.</p><p> I find the Chairman's comments on receivers and perhaps other agents interesting.  If members explain what information they are collecting in that area, it will be interesting to think about the issue.  If something is being used as a kind of an escape route around code of conduct, we can examine the matter.  We can pursue any matter related to conduct.  Ultimately, however, the issue is one of outcomes.  Will the bank in question restructure a debt?  Is someone-----</p></speech>

Compared with many other countries, the Oireachtas has, over a number of years, put in place many elements, all of which are open to question.  If Members informed us that Abhaile was not providing sufficient help or that the insolvency system was not working in the way the Oireachtas had intended in legislation, all of this should come under continuous review, given the change in the market and the likelihood of more sales.  However, if the ultimate issue is about what outcomes there will be, that is all within the legal framework.  I do not believe there is any distance between us in that regard.</p> <p>  We listen to Members and have to ask what we can do in terms of consumer protection.  To respond to Deputy Michael McGrath's point on that issue, if we believed we could deliver more by directly regulating the loan owners through some other vehicle, we would be happy to say that, but our honest belief is that the parameters of consumer protection can be delivered through regulating the credit servicing firms.   In terms of conduct, we have open ears.</p></speech>

To return to my earlier example, the individual in question informs me that he has tried time and again to engage with and contact the lender but nothing has happened.  This wears borrowers down.  They become worn down by the ducking and diving in which regulated entities, namely, the agent, engage.  This is the cause of greatest concern to borrowers because they want to deal with the issue but cannot do so.  I ask the Central Bank to focus on this matter.</p> <p>  I want to question Professor Lane about the courts.  While the number of repossessions is low, that does not mean that only the odd repossession case is turning up in court.  I attend sittings of the registrar's court and other courts and they are backed up with cases.  The master's court may deal with 40 or 50 cases in one sitting.  All the banks and their representatives are doing is stalling the ball until they squeeze the borrower to the point where he or she agrees to voluntary surrender.  There is nothing voluntary about such surrenders because the borrowers have been squeezed into agreeing to them.  I ask the Central Bank to examine the role of these agents and the work of the vulture funds and determine for itself whether its understanding of the position is correct or whether it agrees with me that there is a case to be answered.  Will Professor Lane give an undertaking to examine the agents who are representing the vulture funds?</p></speech>

Credit servicing firms fall within the regulatory supervision of the Central Bank.  We have a range of means of supervising, including on-site inspections.  The issue of correspondence is interesting in the context of the review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  If more direction is required regarding expectations about answering correspondence and so on, we can examine that matter because it falls within the remit of conduct regulation.</p></speech>

These house were not in the agent's portfolio, yet representatives of the agency in question visited the estate and knocked on doors.  That is the carry-on Members experience on the ground.  As I outlined, in one case a representative of an agency knocked on the door of an elderly person and asked the person to leave the property within one or two weeks, even though negotiations were ongoing with the local council.  I ask Professor Lane to examine that matter.  I will submit all of the material in my possession to the Central Bank and hope other members will do likewise.</p> <p>  I have some questions about the credit union sector.</p></speech>

Professor Lane indicted that the Central Bank had a clear vision for the credit union sector in terms of what credit unions should do, how they should be regulated and so forth.  He noted that credit unions had dealt with the effects of the financial crisis.  How does the Central Bank's vision for the role of credit unions align with the vision of the credit union movement?  As has been well documented, a statement was made in the Seanad that sorting out the credit unions would cost &euro;1 billion.  The cost has been nowhere near that figure.  Professor Lane noted that the credit unions had dealt with the effects of the financial crisis.  Is it correct that they did so with their own money?</p></speech>

They have an important role to play in Ireland.  They have a hugely important role to play from the perspective of financial inclusion and I hope they will thrive long into the future.  They face several challenges and this committee has shown a very strong awareness of those challenges.  The Central Bank is absolutely committed to working with the sector in addressing those challenges.  The level of engagement and support that we give to the sector, some of which the Governor referred to in his opening statement, is well beyond any other sector that the Central Bank regulates.  Through the work of the member bodies, the individual credit unions, the Central Bank and other agencies such as the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, the sector has delivered a huge level of safe restructuring and dealing with those credit unions that were at the very weaker end in a way that has protected members' funds and protected the services of credit unions into the community in a strong way and without recourse to taxpayers.  On the overall number that was given, I was not around during the period when stress-testing was undertaken on the credit union sector, and I assume it was a stress-test rather than a prediction.  As with any of these things, it has not played out quite like that.  Instead the credit union sector, through the hard work of many constituent parts, has addressed some of the fundamental weaknesses-----</p></speech>

From the Central Bank's perspective, and consistent with what we see across other sectors, we hope to see the credit union sector thrive, for it to serve its members well and that its members funds are protected.  Specific business models, either on an individual or overall basis, is something for the leadership of the sector to come up with.  We are very supportive of it and have a business model development team that works with the sector on the area but it is not for the Central Bank to opine definitively on what the credit union business model should look like, whether individually or collectively.</p></speech>

The current discussion with the regulator refers to the age profile of credit union members and so on and the need to bring in newer members.  However, there is a slow approach to sanctioning new types of business and new ways of doing business.  One will not get young members in if one has not got the range of packages to sell to them or the technology to manage their affairs.  In the example of the &euro;700 million of credit union funds that was recently sanctioned to go into the voluntary housing sector, does the Central Bank recommend the special purpose vehicle on that or is it the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

Typically, at the moment, it is quite fragmented.  Through work done by this committee, there is a focus on longer-term lending as an example.  The proposals tend to lack some depth and really well thought through plans on what it means for the overall business model of a particular credit union or the credit union sector as a whole.  It is very much focused on individual product development rather than considering what it means for the credit unions.  In the discussion on longer term lending and investment, it is critical that the credit unions think about both sides of the balance sheet.  They are talking about very long term products, in excess of 20 to 25 years in some cases, where their funding is on a demand, instantaneous basis.  There is a need really to think through how the product development fits in with an overall mix of business and how it works on both sides of the balance sheet.  It is also important that the sector as a whole coalesces around this common vision because it is very difficult for an individual credit union to be particularly innovative or to offer some of these services that require a great deal of infrastructure by which to operate and offer in a competitive way, and that brings us into more of a shared services model.  We have not seen the vision from the sector as a whole.  We see some very good managers who try to move their individual credit unions forward and some high level proposals come from the centre, but there is not enough thinking through as to how this will work overall.</p></speech>

Each one responds to its own community in a way that feeds into that market.  The fact they came through the financial crisis in the way they did and are now restructured in the way that they are shows that there is a willingness within the credit union sector to restructure and to repackage the products they put on the market, but that those products might differ because of the demand in each county or each credit union area itself.  It is not as if one can achieve the same set of regulations as one would do with banks because it is a completely different movement.  I often question whether the regulation of credit unions should be within the remit of the Central Bank.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.1975" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#KK01100"><p>To be absolutely clear, I largely agree with what the Chairman has described except, perhaps, for his final point.  There is a proportionate approach to the regulation of credit unions.  There is both explicit and implicit proportionality.  Our work in the credit union sector is to focus on those areas of highest impact and highest risk.  With the exception of those which are in trouble from the sustainability perspective, we are essentially looking at the smaller credit unions on an off-site basis.  We get their returns and engage with them through seminars and speeches.  We have a minimum expectation in what we expect from them.  The intensity of our supervision is much lower.  Connected to that is the expectation that they are not doing things that are particularly exotic or innovative.  Typically, they will not have deposits that go beyond the deposit guarantee scheme and we would not expect them to engage in significant longer-term lending and so on, because they are small, very local and should be ensuring that they are protecting their members' funds and delivering on their purposes.  As the credit unions get bigger or they look to do more, such as longer term lending, invest or hold higher numbers of deposits, then our expectation grows both in some of the requirements we put upon them and also in the level of our intensity of our supervision.  There is a natural tiering and proportionality of our supervision.  We absolutely expect that they will serve local members' needs - that is the purpose of the sector and we are very supportive of it - but it is different where they are discussing getting into more sophisticated products that are very costly and complex.  There was a lot of discussion about mortgages today.  In some respects, people think they are simple but they are complex products that have many costs associated with them.</p><p>If a credit union wants to start lending longer term and doing mortgage lending then it needs to have a degree of scale or access to scale, so either it is large enough to do it itself or it has access to some kind of shared services model.  We are working really hard with the sector.  There is a business model development team and we are meeting the CEOs.  Individually the registrar meets them through the seminars.  The level of engagement we have, not just because we are supervising them but in all manners of ways to try to support credit unions' development and growth, does not compare to any other sector in which we are engaged.  It is so much more.</p></speech>

There are individual issues, as Mr. Sibley has said, but credit unions should be encouraged because they are responding to local demand and need.  They know their customers.  The opposite to this is the banks, who do not know their customers.  They are exiting and they are gone.  What we will be left with is credit unions fulfilling the role of community banking.  That really is what we will have.</p> <p>  I ask the Central Bank to understand what credit unions are all about and understand where they have come from.  Recently I addressed the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, AGM in Kerry.  The registrar was also there.  I have to say the difference between the AGM of the credit union movement and the AGM of a bank is considerable.  Credit unions are there and they want to work.  Many of the people involved are volunteers.  They serve the local community.  Over the years they have done a fantastic job.  I want to see a structure in place that allows them to respond to the new marketplace that is developing, and to capitalise on the fact that greedy banks are retreating and there will be nothing left in the parish now only a credit union.  That would be a good day for local people, provided the Central Bank gives credit unions the tools necessary to compete and do the work.</p> <p>  This is coming at the end of a long day so I will suggest to the committee that on another day we will have only the registrar before us and we will go through everything in detail, because I believe the credit union movement is important enough to have a separate session on it.</p></speech>

I have been at the ILCU AGM.  I was there last year.  We are absolutely committed to working with the credit union sector to deliver on a shared vision.  There is work to be done in this respect and we are committed to it.</p></speech>

I still get letters from people who do not know where they stand with their bank.  They receive correspondence which states the bank is looking at the matter and will come back to them in 60 days or whatever it might be, and the bank still has not made a decision on the case or cases.  At the first meeting we had with the Central Bank the figure might have stood somewhere around 10,000 or thereabouts and now it is 37,100.  I believe more will be added to this.</p> <p>  I have a general question but I will mention a specific bank.  AIB is now the owner of EBS and it is handling all of the mortgages of that entity with its own.  Is the Central Bank satisfied the figures are all out now and there is nothing in the separate entity and make-up of mortgages that has yet to come out?</p></speech>

The responsibility is there, no matter who has these loans at present, to fulfil our expectations.  Regardless of who is the current owner of the loans all of them are within purview.  Week by week the number of unresolved cases is shrinking.  As we have indicated, we believe a lot will be done by the end of June, but we will continue to pursue every case we think needs resolving until they are all in.</p></speech>

There may be some additional but much smaller increase in the figures.  We have some matters that are still open and under scrutiny and discussion, but we know what they are and the lenders know what they are and they are being dealt with.  We have had specific conversations again recently.  We have these regularly to be clear there is no reason the vast majority of complaints or concerns from customers cannot be proceeded with, because we know a lot of the decisions.  The banks certainly know where areas are clear and that they can deal with them.  They have been told this and they are very specifically aware of it.</p> <p>  I said earlier today that we have spoken to the ombudsman about this because there is no point in keeping complaints on hold when we know the outcomes.  We have been very clear they are included, and the framework from the very beginning made very clear the banks were expected to have contact units for the public to give them information.  It is no answer to us now, when there is no ambiguity, that they are giving answers to the public that are about holding on for some event.  The areas in which we are in discussions or looking at are very clear, but there is a vast number of areas on which we are not in discussions, and if people have made complaints about those issues they can be put through the system.  This is what we expect.</p></speech>

It is as we check issues.  In some of the work we are doing we are recreating the actual groups of customers to check it was done properly.  It is in this checking work that the figure may vary.  In some of the examples I have used the number has actually been less than the estimates.  Occasionally the number is only slightly greater than the estimate.

Ulster Bank was required to make a commitment, in similar terms to the framework put in place in the UK, to its customers to refund the complex fees that were levied on its customers.  I believe it has written to the committee giving some information on the number of customers it has identified and refunded fees to.

We have the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, report and therefore we now have a handle on the scale of this new form of finance.  It is very substantial at approximately &euro;1.5 billion across approximately 126,000 PCP arrangements.  The report we have contains good recommendations.  The stand-out point is the fact that affordability checks currently do not have to be done, therefore, background checks on the consumer are not done, and there is no assessment whatsoever of the affordability of the product.  There is a very obvious gap in that regard which needs to be corrected.  Whose job is it now to bring about the application of the consumer protection code to PCPs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.2021" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#MM02700"><p>I will say a couple of things on that and then hand over to Ms Rowland.  We have studied this, and the CCPC has studied it.  A range of issues arises, one of which is that this is a new form of finance.  When we have a new form of finance which is superficially attractive to many people, we must ask if there are hidden risk factors.  This is more developed in the United Kingdom.  Some of the concerns are not intensive here.  The funding of the PCPs is not, by and large, coming from the main Irish banks so the concern that this poses a financial splitting risk is not really present here.  For many individuals, we have looked at the question of financial gain going through a PCP versus a car loan and so on.  It depends on individual circumstances.  On average, it is quite finely balanced.</p> <p>  We then come to the consumer protection issue, which is people who may not run through the calculation an accountant like Deputy McGrath might make in terms of calculating the financial pros and cons and the protections available to them.  I will hand over to Ms Rowland shortly but I want to say that this is not a simple because buying a car is partly non-financial.  We also want to have consumer protection in terms of whether the person is being sold the car they were promised, whether all of that is in order and assessments about wear and tear.  All of those are non-financial issues which, typically, would not be a Central Bank issue.  On the other hand, there is a financial component to this, as the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  There are no easy answers to this.  The current legislation is clear that we do not regulate hire purchase agreements but we have been thinking about it, so I will ask Ms Rowland to expand on that.</p></speech>

What we have here is a position where the credit is usually sold on the garage forecourt in the car dealerships.  The credit intermediary is currently regulated by the CCPC.  It is also responsible for the sale of goods in terms of consumer provision of goods.  That is where we find that the provision of the good - the car - is fairly intermingled with the financial service because some of the terms and conditions of that hire purchase agreement can be to do with servicing, the mileage etc.</p><p>The worry in this regard is that one could end up with a patchwork quilt of regulation which might not deliver an optimal outcome for the consumer.  One might find providers saying that the issue is the condition of the good, not the way in which the financial product was sold.  We would see a big risk in unpacking that and putting it into separate areas.  The key observation for us it that we have a very limited role under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  We have some hire purchase responsibilities relating to what should be in the contract, but we do not actually authorise any of the regulated entities in the area of hire purchase because anybody can provide that service.  The question the Deputy asked at the beginning was about the consumer protection code.  It is mentioned as one of the solutions in the report.  It cannot actually be extended to this area under the current legal frameworks because the code travels with authorisation from the Central Bank and we do not authorise hire purchase providers.  There are a couple of things to think about with regard to any solution which some might desire be put in place.  Responsibilities for the sale of the car, which in inextricably linked with the condition of that car, and for the seller of the finance sit with another agency at the moment.  Of course, we are happy to take part in any fact-finding, solutions or discussions that would be of benefit.  That is why, at the moment, it would not even be legally possible to put the consumer protection code into use in this area.  It is because we do not authorise those entities.</p></speech>

It is currently on the legislative calendar as part of the Markets in Financial Instruments Bill 2018.  It is a fix for the consumer credit register in order to include information on these hire purchase providers.  That also means that, when credit firms are making a loan agreement, they will know if the individual has other outstanding debts.  That can help the firm make a decision about whether a car loan is appropriate, given that they would be able to see the debts which would be on the register.  There will be extra information.  The firm selling the personal contract plan, PCP, will have extra information about the credit situation of the individual and that will help in the future.</p></speech>

The fact that there are no protections is being exploited.  No affordability assessment has to be done.  We do not have any statistics on default levels or arrears levels, do we?</p></speech>

We are looking at the issue and will be doing quite a bit.</p></speech>

For the sake of completeness, I know that the CCPC has announced that it is undertaking a financial education initiative on this issue in order to inform people about the product, its features and some of its risks.</p></speech>

I would briefly like to encourage the Central Bank to continue its efforts towards the development of a single European market in financial services from a consumer perspective in respect of insurance, mortgages, small and medium enterprise, SME, borrowing and so on.  We do not currently have it.  We have questioned European Commissioners and so on here.  We are aware of the current state of play.  Any support that could be lent to that development would be positive.</p> <p>  On commercial trackers, I have had correspondence with the Central Bank and have passed on certain information which I have received.  Is it fair to say that there is currently no investigation or examination into whether some of the characteristics of the tracker mortgage scandal also apply to commercial borrowings linked to, for example, EURIBOR; in other words tracker-type commercial loans?  Are there any concerns at Central Bank level that customers were wrongly taken off of such loans or had terms changed?</p></speech>

We have undertaken a review of the main SME lenders in order to assess their treatment of lending to SME customers.  The kind of information at which we have been looking in that regard is the kind of information the Deputy has provided to us including contracts and the terms and conditions of those contracts.  We are looking at these to see whether cases are commercial disputes which involve permitted interpretations of the legal contract.  It may be the case that an interpretation is unfortunate for a person in business, but we cannot interfere with those kinds of cases.  We are also looking at the outcomes of court cases, complaints made to the lenders and the data the lenders have in order to come to an assessment on the issue.  That is under way at the moment.  We are looking at that to see whether issues arise.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland staff members continue to report issues.  We are getting emails from former customers of First Active who are now customers of Ulster Bank.  Customers of EBS are also sending in significant complaints.  I know the Central Bank is continuing to focus on them.  The point is coming quite quickly at which we will need to give people definitive answers and definitive conclusions.  They may not be the ones they want to hear, but people deserve to know the final position pretty quickly so they can then take the matter further through the process if they so desire, whether that is through the Ombudsman or the courts.  As the Chairman has said, some of the lack of engagement, lack of response and lack of information which individual customers are getting from lenders is not satisfactory.  The Central Bank owes it to them to reach a conclusion, as it appears to have done on the AIB prevailing rate.  It is supporting the bank's interpretation in that case.  The Central Bank should be up front and tell people so that they know exactly where they stand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.2044" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#NN02000"><p>I will say a couple of different things.  It is true that in the case of AIB we already communicated that we reached a conclusion.  It is not our view that we support the bank's interpretation, but that, from a systemic perspective, we could not interfere in the decision it had made about its interpretation of the customer journey in the contracts.  I completely agree with the Deputy that people deserve to know as soon as possible in cases where a matter is not going to be contested further.  I said earlier that we and the lenders know where there are no issues between us and they have been instructed very clearly to get on with replying to people on those issues so that people can have their complaints brought forward.  The Ombudsman is aware of that so that the system can work and so that complaints can be dealt with.  The matters with Permanent TSB are not yet closed.  They are still under discussion and we do not propose to take any action with any further or different staff issues in Bank of Ireland.  I will be clear on that as well.</p></speech>

My suggestion to the Central Bank would be to write to these regulated entities, the credit servicing firms, of which there is only a small number, and to ask them to provide information on the forbearance agreements they have entered into for their customers, which are the funds and the borrowers.</p><p>Would the witnesses be agreeable to doing that?</p></speech>

If they offer a range of alternatives, they have to offer those to each customer.  That is part of our regulation of these firms.  We also said, as I indicated, that we know at each reporting date the nature of their different types of solutions.  The element that we said we would have to come back to the committee about is the balance between what they inherited versus what they have done.  We can look at that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.2048" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#OO00300"><p>The Central Bank can ask them for that information.</p></speech>

The information that we gather is important in how we regulate these firms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-10a.2050" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018051000002#OO00500"><p>On the other point which the Chairman made about small and medium enterprise, SME, loans, we have no data on the quantum of SME loans that have been sold to these funds, on arrears levels and so on, or we certainly have not been able to access it.  We have that for mortgages.  It is published on a quarterly basis.  We do not have it for SMEs.  That should be sought and provided.</p></speech>

This could apply to many people in the SME sector too.  I am sure the Central Bank would agree that everybody should have a good and well-funded pension.  Members of the Oireachtas recently received a lot of mail from staff of Irish Life, where the defined benefit pension will be wound up.  The pension has &euro;1.3 billion in assets and has &euro;240 million accumulated in savings.  It is a well-funded pension.  They feel that, if their defined benefit pension comes to an end, this will escalate to other defined benefit pension schemes and that will leave people with just the State pension if that happens.  It would be a shock to the system.  It is extraordinary, when one thinks that Irish Life's business is selling pensions to people, that it will bring to an end its own staff's defined benefit pension.  How does the Central Bank feel about it?  Is there anything that the Central Bank can do about this?  Have the witnesses any thoughts on it?</p></speech>

The one area of the financial system that we do not regulate is pension funds.  There is a different regulator for pension funds.  As part of a new European system, we are starting to gather more information from pension funds.  In general, this issue will be important for Ireland.  The Government has been developing it for years.  There have been many reviews about how to build a sustainable occupational pension system so that people do not just have to rely on the State pension system.  There are huge political issues there with the balance between individuals versus their employer and the appropriate rate of contribution, whether compulsory or opt-in.  There is a huge range of issues which I would hope that the political system finalises sooner rather than later.  Pre-crisis, we had a partial answer for some of this in the State system, with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but that was blown away by the crisis.  We have to rebuild.  Post-crisis, this is a case of focusing on these issues which do not manifest themselves in a crisis or year by year.  This is one of the biggest financial issues facing the country.  It is not just about one employer and its workers.  It is very broad.  It is a fundamental inter-generational issue here and elsewhere.  It is not a good system if workers rely on their employer to provide a pension.  We saw with Waterford Crystal a number of years ago, and so on, that it is not a good system to have what we have here, which is a very fragmented pensions industry where there are many specific pension funds.  Coming up with a national policy on this is important.</p></speech>

This is not a financial regulation issue.  Pensions are part of the future financial stability of the country.  We have an ongoing interest in how this plays out.  It drives savings behaviour and so on.  It is important to all of us, including the Central Bank, but we do not have that regulatory role which we have elsewhere.</p></speech>

I know it was long but there are many issues that confront us which we have to deal with.  The clerk might take up the discussion on the credit unions for the future.  We might have a fuller engagement on that.  In closing the meeting, I referred earlier to the case of a young woman who has been jailed since the long weekend, Yvonne Walsh.  I strongly appeal to the financial entity and those that represent her in court to visit her in jail and bring about a resolution to the problem.  No one wants to see a young mother in jail in her efforts to protect her family home.  It is not what this country stands for and we do not want it.  I thank everyone for attending.</p></speech>
