    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#A00100"><p>I thank the members for participating in today's committee meeting, in line with the exceptional circumstances and measures we have to take due to Covid-19.  I hope this will be the last meeting during which we are restricted to two hours and will have longer periods during which we can discuss our topics from next week.  All members attending a meeting are required to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  Members are required to practice good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others when attending.  They should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, if members are physically present, except when speaking.  I ask for their full and continuing co-operation in this matter.  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received Deputy Matt Shanahan and Senator Marie Sherlock.</p> <p>  Tody we will consider the pre-legislative scrutiny of the control of exports Bill 2021.  The EU operates a system of export controls that form part of a multilateral framework to support global security by preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, promoting regional stability, preventing terrorism and protecting human rights.  EU controls apply to military equipment and dual-use items.  While EU instruments apply, trade and military equipment is a national competence and, therefore, export controls must be provided for in national legislation.  The proposed legislation is designed to ensure there are adequate powers of enforcement in Ireland and international obligations are respected.  To explain the provisions of the general scheme of the control of exports Bill in detail, I welcome, from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Dr. Eamonn Cahill, Ms Carol Toolan and Mr. Matthew Geoghegan, who are participating remotely.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#A00200"><p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for their invitation to discuss pre-legislative scrutiny for the control of exports Bill.  I am joined by my colleagues from the trade licensing and control unit in the Department, Ms Carol Toolan and Mr. Matthew Geoghegan.  I will briefly summarise the nature and purpose of export controls to provide some context, followed by the rationale for upgrading the current Act and then briefly outline the main provisions in the new Bill.</p> <p>  Export controls are a multilateral, global mechanism designed to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction preserve regional stability, prevent terrorism and protect human rights.  Export controls are rooted in the work of a number of multilateral non-proliferation regimes such as the Missile Technology Control Regime, the chemical weapons convention and the most significant from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, due to its focus on technology, the Wassenaar Arrangement.  Technical experts in the regimes maintain and update, on an on-going basis, lists of items within their remit that should be subject to export control by the participating states.</p> <p>  Export controls generally take the form of a legal obligation on exporters to obtain prior authorisation that is, an export licence, from the national competent authority in a state for the export to third countries of certain designated goods that is, the listed items.  The success of export controls is predicated on uniform and consistent implementation on a multilateral basis.  A published list of controlled items is a prerequisite for achieving this objective.  A list-based approach also provides regulatory transparency and certainty for exporters. </p> <p>  However, achieving the multilateral consensus required to update a list and then giving legal effect to that update inevitably entails a time lag between the need for a new control becoming apparent and the implementation of that control.  Therefore, the regulations also make provision for controlling the export of items not currently on the list, under specific and exceptional circumstances.  These are so-called catch-all controls and are intended as a temporary bridging measure, until an item can be included on the list.</p> <p>  One further important consideration in terms of the regulations is they should be targeted and proportionate, and endeavour to mitigate the risk of unintended consequences.  This is especially important when the regulations apply to SMEs which can be disproportionately impacted by the regulatory burden due to their limited resources and inability to benefit from economies of scale in ameliorating set-up and ongoing operational costs.  To this end, export controls are designed to minimise the burden on reputable exporters engaged in legitimate, low-risk trade.</p> <p>  The legal framework for export controls in Ireland is established in a number of linked national and EU instruments.  The two key EU instruments in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion are as follows.  The first is EU Regulation 821/2021 setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items.  Trade in dual-use items is an EU competence and this regulation has direct legal effect in all member states.  However, member states are obliged to establish in national legislation effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties applicable in the case of infringements of the provisions of the regulation.  The EU regulation also provides member states with discretion to adopt certain additional measures in their national legislation. </p> <p>  Dual-use items are defined as products and components, including software and technology, that can be used for both civilian and military applications.  The regulation explicitly identifies 1,850 types of dual-use items, spanning ten categories, which I will not read, because of time, but it is clear the breadth and range of items in the scope of the regulation.  Of particular note in the Irish context is that many mainstream business ICT products are classified as category 5 dual-use items, by virtue of the fact they incorporate strong encryption for data protection.  These items include data storage, networking and IT security products, both hardware and software. </p> <p>  The second key EU instrument is the Council Common Position 944/2008, defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment and most recently amended in 2019.  The categories of military technology and equipment to which these rules should apply are set out in the common military list of the EU.</p><p>The Common Position sets out the eight criteria against which licence applications should be assessed.  Control over the export of military equipment is a national competence and the Common Position does not have direct effect in member states.  Therefore, its provisions must be given effect by national, primary legislation.  The national legislation comprises the Control of Exports Act 2008 and a number of statutory instruments.</p><p> The Department as the national competent authority for export controls is committed to providing a robust, transparent export control system and is proposing to bring forward new legislation to update the Control of Exports Act 2008.  The Department&rsquo;s overarching goal in bringing forward this legislation is to mitigate the risk that controlled items could be exported from Ireland and used to cause injury in regional conflicts or to violate human rights in third countries.  Therefore, the Bill is designed to ensure that Ireland has a comprehensive and robust legal framework for regulating the exports of controlled goods and in particular, to ensure that the Minister, currently, An T&aacute;naiste, has comprehensive and effective powers of enforcement.</p><p> The current Act must be updated to reflect the significant advances in technology, new developments in business practices, updates to EU instruments, and the evolved geopolitical risk landscape.</p><p> The main provisions of the Bill are detailed as follows.  The Bill will repeal and replace the Control of Exports Act 2008 and will establish the national strategic export control list, that is, a list of goods, services and technology subject to export controls.  The national list will include all items on the EU Common Military List.  However, the national list may also include other items of equipment or technology that are to be brought under control nationally, in advance of their inclusion on an EU list.  </p><p> The Bill will provide a solid legal basis for regulating the control and export of services as well the export of goods.  </p><p> The Bill will ensure that the Minister has an effective enforcement capability and will provide authorised officers of the Department with more effective powers for investigating potential infringements of the controls and will ensure that the penalties for infringements of the regulations are proportionate, graduated and dissuasive.  </p><p> The Bill will provide for the use of administrative sanctions for non-compliance with export controls.</p><p> The Bill will ensure that the Minister has a robust legal basis for administering export controls, such as for example, setting terms and conditions and reporting obligations associated with export licences.</p><p> The Bill will include a provision to exempt from licensing requirements the temporary transfer out of the State of military equipment, including firearms, by the Defence Forces or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when necessitated by operational requirements, for example for training, maintenance and repair, and UN missions.  However, such items being sent abroad for disposal, whether for sale or for destruction, will be subject to a licensing requirement.</p><p> The Department has been engaging with the Office of the Attorney General including the office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of the Bill.  Important legal questions have arisen and are being systematically addressed, for example,on the unique interplay between national and EU competence in EU export controls and the mechanism for handling appeals.  The Department is consulting with othert Departments and State entities, as appropriate.</p><p> As a result of these engagements, considerable progress has been made, both in terms of refining the Department&rsquo;s policy objectives, as well as drafting the body of the full Bill.  It is the Department&rsquo;s desire to have a full draft of the Bill available for publication during the autumn session.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee, for their attention this morning.  My colleagues and I look forward to answering their questions on this important piece of legislation.</p></speech>

I remind members participating remotely to use the raise hand feature so that I can see who wishes to contribute and, more important, when the contributor has finished speaking for him or her to lower the hand.  We have a rota system. The first person who has indicated is Deputy O O'Reilly who I now call and she has 14 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and our witnesses for coming in and for the comprehensive presentation.  This is very technical, so I have written my questions down to ensure that I can keep some order to them.  My first question relates to the ten categories that are listed, which Dr. Cahill has informed us are in the region of 1,850 and there are 50 types of dual-use items.  Can Dr. Cahill give our committee some examples of what type of items we are talking about?  He has mentioned 1,850 different types.  I would just like to know what would be on this list, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy and I will do my best.  The Deputy is entirely correct in that this is a very technically complicated area both in terms of the legislative framework we have to operate in as well as the actual items at the centre of all of this.</p> <p>  Before I attempt to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the list is fully in the public domain.  That is a key element of their mechanism to ensure that there is maximum transparency.  The list is written in very technical terms by engineers and technical experts specifically for the purpose of removing any ambiguity so that any potential exporters should be fairly readily able to identify whether or not their items, based on their performance characteristics, come within the scope of the regulation.  </p> <p>  To try to put some colour on this for the Deputy, as she has noted, the range is vast.  It ranges from materials and chemicals that could be used for producing chemical weapons or explosives but which also have very legitimate industrial and agricultural applications.  I emphasised in my presentation the importance of the information and computer technology, ICT, category 5.  The equipment that the Deputy has in her office and around her in data storage, firewalls, and anti-virus products, many of which have fairly mainstream business applications, are subject to export control.  To be frank, this is almost a legacy of the Cold War era in the concerns about items with strong encryption getting into certain parts of the world with the potential for them to be reverse engineered and so forth.  Those are the bulk of the items that are exported out of Ireland.</p> <p>  As to equipment and machines, items, for instance as are much in vogue at the moment, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, ABS, manufacturing 3-D printing machines, can be used to high precision and even more mainstream computerised numerical control, CNC, machines, or working metal in the production of high precision components.  There are also things as mundane as pumps that might be used in a food production environment in a factory for moving slurries around, which have to have a Teflon non-corrosive coating on them for obvious hygiene reasons.  Those same pumps also tend to be the types of things one needs if one is cooking up chemical weapons because the Teflon prevents the acids corroding them, and so forth.  </p> <p>  It is quite extraordinary and shocking when one goes through the regulation first just to see how many fairly common or garden industrial items can be put to nefarious purposes if someone is sufficiently creative and so minded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#B00500"><p>Part 3, the section on military controls, states that the Bill seeks to set high common standards for the management of and restraint in the transfer of military technology and equipment.  Key to that, the general scheme tells us that this is &ldquo;to prevent the export of military technology and equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability&rdquo;. This is a very lofty and noble aspiration.  I am curious to know how that would be achieved.  Can Dr. Cahill give the committee some examples of the type of internal repression, international aggression and regional instability that he is referring to?  Would Dr. Cahill consider and count the Israeli repression of the Palestinian people as an internal repression or as international aggression?  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy. First, we have a procedure for assessing the licence applications and an integral part of that is consultation in the first instance with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs who can clearly give us their perspective as to the situation on the ground in particular destination countries.  The types of areas that are of concern in the context as alluded to by the Deputy are the most apparent or obvious regions where there are ongoing conflicts.  These include the Middle East, Yemen etc.  Areas like that will obviously be to the fore when assessing licence applications in respect of those destinations.  We would also consult with our colleagues in the licensing authorities in the 26 other member states as well, because as I mentioned, it is critical that there is a consistently uniform approach internationally on this.  There is no use one member state taking one particular view and another state taking another one.</p> <p>  In assessing whether a licence should be granted in respect of some of those sensitive areas, a great amount depends on the nature of the item itself and the potential for it to be used for a non-civilian purpose.  In other words, this is the potential for the item to be used directly or for it to be instrumental in conflict, in aggression and in the infringement of human rights and repression of citizens and so forth.  It is very hard to give specific examples.  Everything, by legislation, must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  As I said, we consult, as appropriate, with experts.  Our Department staff are not experts and do not have responsibility in international relations so we would seek input, as appropriate, from the relevant actors.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#B00700"><p>Am I correct in saying that the guidance, in the first instance, comes principally from the Department of Foreign Affairs?  I understand that there are international considerations, etc., across the European Union but in the first instance the advice and guidance that Dr. Cahill's Department would seek in this comes from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#C00100"><p>All licence applications are automatically forwarded to the Department of Foreign Affairs and, obviously, we pay huge heed to the observations it provides, in particular where it expresses particular concern.  However, to be clear, at the end of the day, my Department is the national competent authority so we will make the final decision as to whether to grant or to deny a licence application.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#C00200"><p>In appendix 2, on assessing licensing applications, the Department states that 22 export licences were denied in 2020 and 38 were denied in 2019.  Could Dr. Cahill give us the reason for those denials?  I note that in his presentation he mentioned concerns about end use, protection of human rights, the risk of diversion and EU sanctions.  Are there specifics on which he could elaborate to give us a broader picture of what it is the Department is referring to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#C00300"><p>I will do my best.  The Deputy will appreciate, I hope, that I cannot get into too many specifics and we cannot talk about individual cases or licences.  The first point to note is that our statistics show huge variability from year to year and, as the Deputy pointed out, there was a significant change from 2019 to 2020.  A lot of that is a reflection of the relatively small scale of the Irish economy.  Different patterns or exports by a small number of exporters will have a huge impact on the statistics.  The 2019 figures represent a spike.  They were definitely out of kilter with the figures for most years.  The reason for that is very much related to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Yemen that came to the fore in that timeframe.  The Deputy may well be aware that there was a United Nations panel of experts report which made explicit references to state actors involved in war crimes and the overall humanitarian crisis there.  On the back of that, a number of licences were denied, and that caused the spike in that year to which the Deputy alludes.</p> <p>  More generally, our denials are for a range of different considerations.  Certainly, a key one is the risk of diversion, that is, the potential that something could be transferred to a military end user in the destination country.  That concern is exacerbated if there is an active regional conflict under way.  Human rights are another important consideration if there is active repression or if there are humanitarian crises in the general area.  I think we make denials under most of the eight criteria set out in the common position over the course of a year, which very much comes down to the particular destination and the nature of the items in respect of which the export licences are being requested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#C00400"><p>In head 5, under the section Offences and Penalties, subhead 14, it states that "authorised officers will have discretionary powers to impose administrative penalties in lieu of criminal prosecutions for violations of control of export laws".  Could Dr. Cahill give us an update on this?  To me, that is fairly wide-ranging.  I am not suggesting at all that any person involved would come with the intent of abusing it, but the potential is there, so what checks and balances will be in place?  Being able to use a discretionary power to impose an administrative penalty in lieu of a criminal prosecution is a fairly heavy-duty power.  What sorts of checks and balances will be there for these authorised officers to ensure that they exercise that discretionary power hardly at all?  It has to act as a deterrent, but there surely must be some checks and balances in place to make sure that this quite substantial power is not abused in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#C00500"><p>It is fair to say that one of our motivations to bring forward this new legislation was to give a broader portfolio of responses to infringements.  Under the current Act we are very restricted.  We have only the nuclear option of an actual prosecution and, given the nature and the diversity of exporters we are dealing with and the range of different infringements that can be encountered, we felt that that was unduly restrictive.  To give the Deputy a flavour of the exporters we deal with, at one end of the spectrum we deal with large multinationals involved in multimillion euro export transactions.  They have in place dedicated trade compliance departments.  They are very sophisticated internally and so on.  At the other end of the spectrum we deal with SMEs and indeed micro-enterprises, which may have literally two or three individuals to ten people, so they are in a very different place, yet they are still obliged to comply with the same overarching regulations and so on.  From time to time we will come across companies that have breached the regulations purely because of a lack of awareness rather than by any criminal intent, so it is appropriate that we work with them to help them to come into compliance, hold their hand, essentially, and help them navigate through the regulations.  There is a spectrum of different potential infringements, not all of which warrant the resource commitment, and I stress that the resource commitment of mounting a prosecution is very significant.  That is why we are seeking to have a broader suite or portfolio of responses to the different scenarios to reflect better the diversity of exporters we encounter out there.  The authorised officers will be officials of the Department, so there will be internal checks and balances in the form of formal procedures and guidance documents for us in order that we have a consistent approach to determining whether something warrants a slap on the wrist or something much more serious, up to and including court actions.</p></speech>

I would not like to think - and I am pretty sure it was not Dr. Cahill's intention to give this impression - that somehow this authorised officer might look at a situation and think that because criminal prosecution is very expensive and heavily resource-dependent, he or she will go for something else.  The resources need to be made available if a criminal prosecution is what is required.  I will give Dr. Cahill an opportunity to clarify if the Chairman agrees because I think my time might be up.  The Chairman might indulge us with that.  I would be a little disturbed if what was driving this were resource constraints rather than the necessity to warrant a criminal sanction.  Dr. Cahill might want to clarify that.</p> <p>  To be clear, are the authorised officers people within the Department who are overseen just by the normal departmental procedures or are they subject to separate ones, given the power they will have?</p></speech>

I certainly do not mean in any way to imply that the availability of resources or staff would be in any way a consideration in deciding how to respond to a potential infringement - quite the opposite.  The Department has been investing extra staff in this area in the past two years.  It just goes back to the fact that responses need to be proportionate and relevant to the level of infringement that has been encountered.  What we are in essence talking about is potentially writing to a company and giving it a timeframe - six months or three months - to put in place a more rigorous and more robust internal compliance programme.  If at the end of that time we are satisfied that it has achieved that target, that would be a satisfactory outcome.  Absolutely, the decision to pursue an action through the courts would be exclusively and entirely determined by the severity of the offence and the evidence to take forward that case.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's final question, she is correct that the authorised officers will be officials of the Department appointed by the Minister of the day.</p></speech>

I note that the briefing document for today's meeting refers to the need for regulations to be minimal in terms of burdens placed, particularly on SMEs, given their limited resources, which I think everyone would agree with.  In addition, I note that the document states that many mainstream business ICT products are classified as category 5 dual-use items under the EU regulation.  Can the witnesses advise what impact this classification is likely to have on SMEs in Ireland?  Can they estimate how many SMEs are involved in exporting such products?  Could they also inform me if the burden imposed by these regulations will be very challenging for many SMEs?</p></speech>

As the Senator rightly identified, the SMEs have particular issues.</p><p>The biggest issue for SMEs is becoming aware that their items may be within the scope of the regulation.  The burden of applying for a licence is minimal.  We go to great lengths to help companies to navigate through the application process and so forth.  Over the past year or so, we have put a bit of effort and resources into greater outreach, focusing specifically on the sector.  We produced an online five-minute video and we also have a booklet, which I hope is written in relatively plain English, to help companies to come to terms with how they may be impacted.</p><p> I was asked about the number of companies.  It is very much those in the high-tech ICT space that are exporting outside the EU.  Most of the items can move freely within the Single Market.  Indeed, there are provisions that essentially white-list a number of key markets, including those of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and so forth.  There are many measures we can bring to the attention of SMEs that will greatly reduce the overheads and burden.  Even where they do have to apply for a licence, there is a relatively straightforward process from their perspective.  We have an online system.  The company does a once-off registration and then it just uploads the relevant information on a case-by-case basis, or as each export comes up.</p></speech>

I am aware that there was consultation in 2019 whereby the Department sought submissions on updating the 2008 Act.  Could he inform us about that consultation?  How many submissions were there?  To what extent were the submissions taken into account when drafting the Bill?</p></speech>

We did not receive a great number of submissions.  One reason was that the proposed legislation has a minimal impact regarding the licensing for reputable exporters.  The licensing regulations and application procedures will, by and large, be as before.  The main changes relate to our ability to respond to potential infringements, investigations and so on.  It is primarily a question of the enforcement element, which should only be of academic interest to the vast majority of exporters, who are extremely compliant.</p> <p>  As part of the RIA, we applied good practice in respect of identifying where the proposed regulations need to be modified or whether particular exemptions or other measures need to be built in respect of SMEs.  It would be neither appropriate nor possible to include exemptions from the regulations for SMEs regarding export controls but we are conscious of the need to put a particular emphasis on helping them.  We have put a lot of effort into outreach over the past 12 months.  We are always keen to find fora in which to engage with companies one on one as well as collectively.  We are always happy to meet representatives of companies one on one in our offices.</p> <p>  To answer the question, we have made considerable efforts to help the sector.  It should not feel in any way disadvantaged or disproportionately impacted by the new legislation.</p></speech>

Could he give us a briefing on that and its relevance to the legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#D00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The genesis of export controls globally probably dates back to shortly after the Second World War.  The controls took off during the Cold War.  As the Deputy can well understand, it was very much about the western powers wanting to make sure that nuclear technology and other weapons of mass destruction, and affiliated technologies, did not get into the hands of those who would use them for nefarious purposes.  Several of these informal groupings emerged over the period, whereby various like-minded countries came together to work to help to identify lists of technologies and items that they felt should be kept under some sort of control to prevent them becoming freely available on the global stage.</p> <p> The Wassenaar Arrangement is the arrangement most relevant to Ireland because it covers the technology gamut, certainly including ICT but going well beyond that to include machinery and so forth.  Approximately 42 states participate in the Wassenaar Arrangement globally, including all the major powers, such as the US and Russia.  It is not an international body in the sense of the UN or anything like that; it is very much a more informal body.  Its primary activity involves technical experts from the participating states coming together for intensive discussions.  They thrash out the precise technical specifications of items that should be subject to control.  The items on the published list, which I mentioned, are not identified only at the level of their overall functionality but also down to the level of their individual performance characteristics.  For pumps, it would be to do with their throughput in cubic metres per second and so forth.  For electrical items, it would be about their power characteristics, frequency responses and so forth.  It is highly technical.</p></speech>

I get the gist of it.  There are 42 participating countries, including most of the western countries and the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; nations, for want of a better word.  In Dr. Cahill's briefing document, he states the 2008 Act does not refer to transit or transmission.  Was that, or is it, a major loophole?</p></speech>

Actually, I think there is a slight typographical error in that the text should read "trans-shipment" rather than "transmission".  It should refer to both transit and trans-shipment.  It was primarily a question of the major trans-shipment hubs in Europe that would be relevant to Ireland.  Ireland is not a trans-shipment base in the way that certain central European cities and ports are.  I am not aware that there has been a loophole or that there have been any practical implications for us over the past 12 years.  Nonetheless, in terms of completeness and so forth, we are conscientious about making sure we do a thorough job and cover all the elements in the new legislation.</p></speech>

Several review and appeals mechanisms are involved.  Those who are impacted have 21 days in which to lodge an appeal, for instance.  There is a specialised external appeals panel and an internal review by a senior officer in the Department.  Are there time limits on how long the reviewers and panels can work?  If there is a grey area and a restriction is placed on an export such that it takes forever for the review or appeal to take place, the exporter will be out of pocket, to say the least, or may lose business.  He or she may be quite legitimately involved in business.  Where we are giving powers to authorised officers and so on, are there any constraints on, or limitations to, how long it takes for the appeals panels and internal and external reviewers to carry out their work?</p></speech>

As Dr. Cahill said, we are currently going through the appeals side of things with the Office of the Attorney General to sort out and tighten up the timeframes.  The idea behind the internal review is to address the fact that the exporters may need a timely response, as referred to by the Deputy.  The internal review would offer them a quick and less expensive way of having either their licence or a compliance notice checked by an officer of a higher level, or a different officer, just to have a different point of view on it.  The external panel is a matter on which we are also going into detail with the Attorney General to determine how it might operate in respect of timeframes and so on.</p><p>The idea behind that is to offer an independent mechanism for the exporter so the decisions of the authorised officer, or of the deciding officer in the case of licences, would be reviewed by somebody completely independent and external to the Department.</p></speech>

This is something we have come across previously in other legislative measures and I was concerned about appeals and reviews.  I am glad to hear that the Department is conscious of it and working on it.  That is good.</p> <p>  Cybersecurity is mentioned quite a lot here.  Could the witnesses expand on their thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#E00300"><p>I will take that question.  Cybersecurity is very topical in terms of the implications for human rights in various quarters at present.  A very important development on that front is that the new EU dual-use regulation came into effect on 9 September.  It is a replacement of the previous 2009 regulation.  Probably the single biggest advance in the EU regulation is a new focus on human rights and the potential for cyber surveillance technology to be exported to Europe and be used for repression and so forth.  There are new additional measures in the regulations to control those exports.  As that regulation has direct effect in all member states, the measures automatically apply in Ireland as well so we can inherit those powers automatically.  Nonetheless, the EU regulation provides member states with discretion to go further and to introduce additional controls in their national legislation, and we are proposing to do that in the current legislation.  Essentially, we want to take advantage of all discretion opportunities we are given by the EU regulations to provide additional control and to ensure we have a belt-and-braces approach on all fronts.</p></speech>

Is that the case?</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the companies that are here.  However, I will make an important clarification for the Deputy.  The word "cyber" has taken on very negative connotations in the recent past.  It is assumed to be synonymous with people doing nefarious things.  Strictly speaking, cyber simply means relating to the computer systems.  There is a very big and burgeoning cybersecurity industry in Ireland, but cybersecurity is quite distinct from cyber surveillance.  We are always very conscious of that.  The technologies being exported by companies here in Ireland are legitimate items intended for legitimate applications.  They do not have the potential to be misused in the sense of the cyber surveillance that underpins the EU regulation.  There are a couple of well known, high-profile products around the world that are designed specifically for use in surveillance ways, and the Deputy will probably be aware of some of the media coverage of that in recent months.</p></speech>

I note that 135 individual military licences were issued in 2020.  That was almost three times the value of the number issued in 2019, when there were 99.  That is a massive increase.  Could the witness comment on that?  Why is that the case?  It is striking that it went up that much in a short period of time.</p></speech>

That is a reflection of the small number of exporters.  In the military space we have a particularly small number of exporters.  Particular success in terms of sales for them and particular patterns of exports changes can have a disproportionate impact on the statistics.  I would not necessarily say that it is a trend.  It is just a particular spike in that year.</p></speech>

It appears that technologies evolve very fast and the uses of different data or electronic means also evolve very fast.  How do the witnesses keep the list up to date with the potential applications that people can find as we move to the Internet of things and so forth?  It seems that it is going to be a constantly moving target and one could almost conceive of any product having a potential use in the hands of particular groups.  How does that work?</p> <p>  I know that at EU level there has always been this issue about national competence versus EU competence.  There has always been a to-and-fro tugging as to whether there should be overriding EU competence for larger transactions, whether one can appeal from one to the other or whether national competence in certification or licensing in one country should prevail in other member states.  Has that been an issue of controversy in this territory or how does national competence and EU competence overlap?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamonn Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021092900002#E01300"><p>In response to the first question, the Deputy has identified one of the biggest perennial challenges in the export control space, which is keeping on top of advances in technology.  It is not just advances in technology.  There is no limit to human ingenuity when it comes to re-purposing ostensibly safe items to cause harm or to use them in improvised devices and so forth, so that is a constant challenge for us.  The EU has in place a fixed framework for updating lists annually.  That is quite efficient and can track changes in technology relatively quickly.  However, as I alluded to in my opening statement, there is an additional mechanism to give additional flexibility and to aid responsiveness on the part of competent authorities, these so-called catch-all controls.  If we become aware tomorrow that somebody is about to export a widget from Ireland that is currently not subject to controls, we have extraordinary powers to intervene in the short term and prevent that export taking place, with a view to ultimately getting that list formally incorporated on the list for future controls.  It is not a perfect system, but vast effort is being put into making sure the lists are updated in as timely a fashion as possible and, as I indicated, there are alternatives for exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>  The EU competence versus national competence issue is another key challenge for us.  First, in the dual-use space it is very clear that it is exclusively an EU competence, so the policy is set at EU level.  However, the implementation of that policy is a member state competence so one gets into issues there regarding whether member states are implementing things in a consistent and uniform fashion and so forth.  Again, there are mechanisms in place to support that.  Member states co-ordinate with regard to licences that they deny, for example, to prevent exporters engaging in licence shopping.  If they are denied in one country, they cannot then obtain one in another member state.  The situation is very good in respect of consistency and uniformity in the dual-use piece.</p> <p>  The military area is more complicated.  As we said, it is a national competence and different member states have different political and policy views about exports of arms to different parts of the world.  The common position is supposed to address that and bring all of us onto a common converged approach to that, but it is not legally binding and different member states have taken different approaches in the past with regard to exports to some areas in which there was conflict under way.  Obviously, Ireland does not have an arms industry in the way that many other member states have, so it is of lesser concern for us but it is something we are very conscious of.</p></speech>

The lists will be very clear regarding the dual-use and with the national strategic list of what is currently in play.  Head 11 will be a similar catch-all to the dual-use catch-all and will allow us to intervene.  Then there is the possibility of adding further items to the list when new technologies emerge that will need to be added in the future.</p></speech>

It was specifically requested by a member that we would contact the Secretary to the Government and I am pleased that Mr. Fraser has joined us.  He is very welcome to the meeting on the specific issue as raised.   </p><p> The format of the meeting is we will hear opening comments from Mr. Fraser and then proceed to a questions and answers session.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I know that any such direction will be immediately complied with.</p><p> For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as do witnesses who are physically present.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.</p><p> I welcome everyone to the meeting and trust that all of our future meetings can be exclusively based in this room as Covid restrictions recede.  I now invite Mr. Fraser to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

My involvement in this was exclusively in respect of my role as Secretary to the Government.  The Chairman will be aware, but other people may not know, that I have two roles.  My role as Secretary to the Government involves management of Government meetings, in respect of which I work with a small team of civil servants in the Cabinet secretariat, which looks after the agendas, memorandums, decisions, minutes and follow-up that is required.  This is an important part of Government work and one that is not often discussed although it has been in place for decades.  It is a traditional but rigorous process around Government meetings.</p> <p>  In terms of this specific Government decision, it was made at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, 27 July.  In terms of process, on the preceding Friday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, circulated a memorandum to his colleagues stating that he proposed to seek approval for ambassadorial appointments and a special envoy, but he did not include the names in the memorandum circulated on that Friday.  We produced a briefing note, which goes to the Taoiseach and other people, outlining what is on the agenda.  The final agenda for that meeting included 41 items.  The briefing note would have stated that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, would bring the names to the meeting.  In the event, before that meeting, on the Monday evening at 9.24 p.m., I received an email from the Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs with the final memo, which is entirely normal.  I get the final copies of memos from Departments because we need to have them on our file for the Cabinet meeting so we can make sure the correct memorandum is there and to make sure the correct decision is made and so on and so forth.  The following morning, I sent that final copy of the memorandum to my colleague, the assistant Secretary to the Government and to my private secretary.  That was because they are in charge of the paperwork for the Cabinet meeting.  They would have ensured they were with the Cabinet papers for me going to the meeting.  As it happened - not as it happened, but further to the process - the Department of Foreign Affairs would have sent a copy of the final memo at assistant secretary level the following morning.  I can get the exact time, but I think this is happening at 9.21 a.m..  That is when I forwarded the memo and, I think, 9.41 a.m. is when the Department of Foreign Affairs sent us the memo for the second time effectively.  Finally, the Minister did what he was supposed to do, that is, he brought the final memo to the Cabinet meeting.  He brought it in-person, with all of the names of all of the ambassadors to be appointed, which, as the committee will be well aware, included my name, and the special envoy.  That was distributed to the members of the Cabinet at the Cabinet meeting on 27 July.  The Government then approved the Minister's proposal. </p> <p>  That is what happened.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I will now open the meeting to members of the committee, starting with Senator McGreehan on the basis that she is substituting for Senator Wilson who raised the specific issue, following which I will call Deputies Brady, Gannon and Clarke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021092900002#B00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Fraser and thank him for attending the meeting.  I will be reading from script provided to me by Senator Wilson.  I have not attended previous meetings of the committee on this matter, but I have attentively followed them.  When the Minister, Deputy Coveney, first appeared before the committee on 31 August, Senator Wilson asked him a series of specific questions relating to the preparation and submission of the Cabinet memo.  Among the questions asked was a question as to whether the contents of the memo had been discussed with the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet secretariat in advance of the Cabinet meeting and if the memo and its contents were brought to the attention of the programme managers and-or political advisers in the offices of the Taoiseach or the leader of the Green Party?  In response to that question, the Minister, on page 24, paragraph 2, of the committee report, said:</p> <blockquote> 	As to whether the contents of the memorandum were discussed among Secretaries General, I do not think so.  Certainly, if the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach knew about this, I am sure he would have raised it with the Taoiseach.  </blockquote> <p>On 6 September, the Department of Foreign Affairs released the papers related to Dr. Zappone's appointment.  That bundle of documents contained a reference from 26 July described in the index of an email as, &quot;email from sec-gen to the Department of An Taoiseach&quot;.  The index states this was the email sending the memo to the Government as an attachment.  It also says there is no message or text in the email.  The email shows it was sent from the email account of Mr. Niall Burgess, who was then Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the email address of Mr. Fraser at the Department of An Taoiseach.  That was sent on Monday, 26 July at 21.24.  The email subject line references final HOMs memo.  Senator Wilson would like to know from Mr. Fraser if the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was correct when he said, &quot;.....if the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach knew about this, I am sure he would have raised it with the Taoiseach.&quot;.  When the email was sent on Monday, 26 July at 21.24, was there already a version of that memo on the e-Cabinet system?  The subject heading describes the attachment as &quot;final HOMs memo&quot;.  What does HOMs mean?  I presume &quot;final&quot; means there was an earlier version.  Was that email on the e-Cabinet system?  What are the differences?  Did they include the naming of the person to be appointed special envoy or was that name only identified at the Cabinet meeting on the following day?  Did Mr. Fraser see the memo sent as an attachment by email on Monday, 26 July at 21.24?  As there is no text in the attached email, we would assume that Mr. Fraser and his colleagues, were expecting an attachment to arrive from the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs at that time.  When was that email opened by Mr. Fraser, or his colleagues, and what was done with it?</p><p>I have asked plenty of questions.  I would be grateful if Mr. Fraser could reply to some of them.</p></speech>

Members will be aware that some of the issues raised have been addressed by Mr. Fraser in his opening statement.  Nevertheless, for clarity, we can take it that the questions asked by Senator McGreehan are now posed to Mr. Fraser.  I ask him to respond to them, notwithstanding the fact that he has already dealt with some of the issues.</p></speech>

I did address some of the issues raised, so I am at risk of repeating myself.</p> <p>  There are two versions of the memo to which the Senator referred.  The first version was sent out on the Friday.  It was made clear to members of the Government - it goes to everybody - that the Minister was going to propose appointments of ambassadors and a special envoy but no names were included.  The final version of that memo was then brought to the Cabinet meeting by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Tuesday, which is exactly the correct procedure.  It was circulated to the members of the Government on the Tuesday morning.  The email to which the Senator referred, that was sent on the Monday night, was a final draft of the heads of missions, HOMs, memo.  In my mind, and I am sure in the mind of the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, it was a memo about ambassadorial appointments and heads of missions, HOMs.  It is absolutely standard that I would be given a copy of such a memo in advance.  It could be the day before or on the morning of the meeting, just so that I have it with the papers for the Cabinet meeting.  As I said, I sent it on to my two colleagues in the Cabinet secretariat.  They would have put it on my file, so that it was on my file for the Cabinet meeting.  That is what happened.</p></speech>

I think the timeframe, as outlined by the Secretary to the Government, accords with that as per the questions asked by Senator McGreehan.</p> <p>  I will move on to Deputy Brady, followed by Deputies Gannon and Clarke and Senator Craughwell.  I call Deputy Brady.  On the basis that we have had statements in the past, and having regard to the subject matter of the meeting and the specific reason for which the Secretary to the Government is here, I ask that members pose questions in a direct and concise way, as indeed, Senator McGreehan did.</p></speech>

I will not get into commenting on what happens at Cabinet meetings.  I do not know anything about that stuff.  On the specific point raised by the Deputy, which is not within the remit of the committee and not within the remit of what I was invited here to talk about, I was asked to investigate that leak.  To be honest, of course, I wish people would not leak from Cabinet.  However, I was asked to investigate that leak.  I have not been able to find out who did it.  I am not optimistic.</p></speech>

It has been cited that Mr. Fraser has headed up an investigation into the leaking of confidential information from Cabinet.  Therefore, it is most important that as we have Mr. Fraser here, we take the opportunity to ask him about what I think is a very serious matter of the leaking of confidential material.  It has been cited that Mr. Fraser has been tasked to head up an investigation into the leaking of confidential Cabinet material into the public arena.</p> <p>  I am asking specific questions.  He has headed up investigations in the past.  He has been tasked with heading up the investigation into the leaking of private information around the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.

I wish to read into the record that our agenda today states that we will be engaging with Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach on the appointment of UN special envoys.  In doing so it is important to understand the culture in which these special envoys or other top-level positions are allocated.  Some of my questions will pertain to culture within the Department and I will be standing firm that such questioning should be allowable under the terms of the agenda.</p> <p>  When did Mr. Fraser know exactly that Katherine Zappone was going to be appointed as a UN envoy?  Did he know before they got the memo?  Had he heard it?  Had there been talk?</p></speech>

It is possible it was mentioned to me.  I genuinely do not know.  The first time I knew for certain was on the night I got that memorandum.  I had no involvement in it.  I am happy to talk on the Deputy's questions on culture and all that because they are very fair questions.  It is possible it was mentioned to me but it was not something I was dealing with.</p></speech>

This was to be our third.  Mr. Fraser says it may have been mentioned to him.  He is our most senior civil servant and is going to be an ambassador.  He is saying it may have been mentioned to him but he does not remember the context in which it happened.</p></speech>

I do not work in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Deputy understands that.  He has seen the FOI.  I had no involvement in any of this until the Cabinet meeting.  Because Katherine Zappone had worked for the Department of Foreign Affairs in the past, it would not have seemed unusual to me.  I really had no engagement with envoys.  The question of culture etc., I accept and am happy to explore honestly with the Deputy but I was not involved in this appointment.</p></speech>

I might have become aware a couple of days earlier.  There was a blank memo on Friday.  It was not registering as a big thing with me.  I know this looks like a big thing in hindsight.  It would not have registered as a big thing with me.  It was foreign affairs business.  That is the honest answer.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on that.  When did the Taoiseach become aware that Mr. Fraser had become ambassador to the UK?  Was it at the meeting when Katherine Zappone was appointed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021092900002#E01800"><p>That is a different process from the one the committee has been discussing.  I am sure the Deputy wants to know the full story so I will tell him.  I was appointed to this position in 2011.  It is a seven-year term, following which I either retire -  despite the ageing the committee is helping me through, I am too young to retire - I get transferred to another Civil Service role or I get a job in an international organisation.</p> <p>  My seven-year term was up in 2018.  I got a three-year extension from the Taoiseach at the time.  That was really because we were doing Brexit and it was heavy stuff at the time.  I have a lot of background in that.  The extension was up in July of this year.  I discussed it with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and we agreed I would do one more year, mainly because of the pandemic.  With leave and whatever, I probably would have been leaving in January or February.  I do a lot of work on the pandemic and various things.  We agreed I would do another year.  The Government formally agreed to that early in July but I also felt it was time for me to move on.  The options are another job in the Civil Service, retirement or an international organisation.  I have had various discussions with the Taoiseach.   I discussed it with the T&aacute;naiste, with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, because he is the Minister with responsibility for the public service.  I had some discussions with the Secretary General of Foreign Affairs.  It is a Civil Service position in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Obviously, I discussed it with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who offered me the position ultimately.  That process has been under way for a good few months.  Somebody cannot be moved out of a job like mine without careful planning.  There is a lot of personal stuff for me, family and whatever else.  It is not nothing.</p></speech>

I am not sure if his expression was one of regret or relief at not being invited to Merriongate .</p> <p>  Mr. Fraser said this looks like a big thing in hindsight.  That is part of the problem.  It is a big thing in hindsight and it was a big thing at the time.  Mr. Fraser is a very experienced civil servant but, based on the two occasions the Minister has been before this committee, something is very striking.  Let us be adults and not be disingenuous.  I quote from the Minister, who stated, "names are not necessarily included as attached to appointments out of fears of leaks or whatever before that Cabinet meeting".  It is not a topic I wanted to dwell on but given we have the opportunity, we may draw slightly on the vast experience of Mr. Fraser and his team.  He mentioned in his opening address, which we did not get a copy of, that there is a traditional attitude within the Department.  While he is moving on to become the UK ambassador and drawing on his vast experience, what impact does he think that traditional attitude has on appointments like this? </p> <p>  In terms of where we go from here, we know there will be further scrutiny of any ambassadorship or envoy from now on because of what happened around the appointment of Katherine Zappone.  What recommendations would Mr. Fraser make, based on the experience he has?  </p> <p>  Given how the information got into the public domain and how this scenario played out, does Mr. Fraser think we are now less likely to be able to recruit somebody for a job like special envoy?</p></speech>

I was talking about the traditional process.  I mean an administrative process.  We have paper agendas, paper memorandums and paper decisions.  We keep minutes.  Records of minutes are approved by Cabinet the following week.  That is what I meant by a traditional process.

The process is very good.  From my point of view, the most important thing is that it is clear that the members of the Government have the paper in front of them.  They can get it by e-Cabinet but it is clear what the paper is, it is clear what the decision being sought is and it is clear whether the decision is approved, changed or rejected.  It has to be clear.  That decision then has to be disseminated by me after the meeting and minutes have to be done, which are basically the collection of decisions.  It is really important that our process is clear and that everyone knows what the Government has considered and what it has decided.  That is why we are so fussy here on the paperwork.  I am only talking about the paperwork.  I am not talking about some traditional 1990s or 2000s attitude to how work is done or anything like that.</p></speech>

In due course, no doubt hopefully from the Deputy's point of view, she will serve in government and she will see that.  She will know what she has decided.  There will be members in the Opposition who will disagree with her decisions but nobody will be disagreeing with what was decided.  My job is to make sure that what was decided is clear.  There is huge opposition to the decision we are discussing today, but nobody is in any doubt about what was decided.  I do not want to dwell on that point, but I wish to make it clear that I was not talking about an attitude or a culture.  I am just saying that we have a very robust process.  It is old-school, but it is very robust so everyone knows what happens.</p> <p>  The Deputy made another point, which is a fair one.  I was only trying to explain.  I can imagine people asking, "Why does this fellow not know all about this, given that this is the only thing we have been talking about?"  I am not saying it is a trivial thing on its own merits, all I am saying is that it was not a big item in my mind in a 41-item agenda for the Cabinet.  I probably get 80 emails a day.  There was all sorts of stuff going on and it was the last week of the D&aacute;il.  This was nowhere near the top of the things I was thinking about.  That is not to say that on its merits, if people do not like it, that it is not a legitimate thing, but also, as always with something like this, a series of things happened afterwards, and we all know what they were, which made it seem bigger and bigger.  Always, with hindsight with a thing like this, it is harder to perhaps understand why it was not seen as a big deal at the time.  That is the only point I am trying to make.  I am certainly not suggesting that anyone thinks this was a bad thing on its merits, regardless of anything else that happened afterwards or beforehand as it turns out.</p> <p>  In terms of the recommendations I would make, the things the Government is doing are the correct things to do.  There is a review of the envoy thing, and the committee has been asked for its views on that, and I think they should be done through public competition, as the Taoiseach has said.  That is probably the attitude of the Minister, and that is probably in the review as well.</p> <p>  As to whether it will deter other people, it might.  However, probably the best way to do these things is through open competition and that way does not deter people because they can see how it happens.  Hopefully, it will not deter people.  It is not necessarily a bad idea to have an envoy for LGBTI rights, freedom of expression or anything else, so I hope it does not have that effect.</p></speech>

I fail to see how Mr. Fraser can reconcile a process that is currently in place, which has led to the current scenario, with an open competition, without the applicants' names and details also finding their way into the public domain before a decision is made.  Do there not also have to be substantial and meaningful changes on the side of the process and those involved in the process?</p></speech>

It is good of him to appear before the committee.  He spoke a great deal about process and procedures.  Indeed, he spoke at the finance committee in June 2021 about his belief that process and procedure are the way we should do business.  I assume that, as the most senior civil servant in the country, he is an expert in process and procedure.  Has he at any stage briefed Ministers, senior advisers and senior politicians on the importance of process and procedure when it comes to appointments?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

The Cabinet Handbook and the material that Ministers are given when they take office at the first Cabinet meeting of every Government contain all the process and procedure.  Then, of course, I speak to Ministers from time to time.  They might have questions for me about process or procedure, and I might have advice about how a thing works.  People understand what the process and procedures are.  They are not terribly complicated, to be fair.</p></speech>

Does he have a role in adjudicating whether something can be deferred to the next Cabinet meeting because it is not urgent?  Second, with respect to the Zappone appointment, did Mr. Fraser not feel that it had not gone through the process and procedures and that it needed to be delayed for a couple of days?</p> <p>  By the way, I agree with what Mr. Fraser said, that at the time the decision was made this was not a major item of discussion.  However, it is the little things that get us every time.  I would be interested to know what he thinks about that.</p></speech>

They are political appointees.  They have a meeting every week at which they do political stuff.  Obviously, I am involved in Government business and I attend the leaders' meeting, as it would be called colloquially, which is actually a Cabinet committee on Government co-ordination.  That happens most weeks and I attend for most of that, although not all of it.  I do not get involved in party political stuff or the like, so I am not as involved in some aspects as one might think.  Each Government is different, of course, for all sorts of reasons.</p> <p>  In terms of a role on deferral, if I thought a thing was not ready, I would certainly advise the Taoiseach.  I would not allow something to be done if procedure was not followed.  There is an urgency procedure, of course, and ultimately it is the Taoiseach, not me, who decides what comes to the Cabinet.</p> <p>  As regards this particular situation, the procedure was followed.  A memorandum was circulated before the Cabinet meeting which indicated that there would be ambassadorial appointments and a special envoy on the agenda for the following Tuesday.  The Minister was to bring the names to the meeting, and he brought those names to the meeting.  There was no procedural problem there.  The problem, as everybody knows, is that the Taoiseach was not aware of this.  That is not a problem with the procedure.  It was just a mistake, and that mistake has been acknowledged and apologised for.</p></speech>

It seems to me that he discussed it with the Taoiseach and the Minister and that everybody said: "Yes, you are doing a great job.

A senior member of the Civil Service was appointed to a foreign office, that is, an ambassador's role, apparently without any public competition or any appearance before the Top-Level Appointments Committee for civil servants.

Effectively, from my point of view, as I said, under the terms of my original appointment as Secretary to the Government and Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, when my term is up I will transfer to another position, retire or go into an international organisation.  It is a transfer, and therefore, a reassignment, for me within the Civil Service.  It is not a promotion, or anything like it.</p> <p>  I note the Senator's characterisation of this.

I have always found you very straight.  However, Mr. Fraser is on record as being adamant about process and procedures.  Process and procedures is what we are talking about here.  One cannot ring-fence one appointment from that day and forget about the other two.  Three appointments went before Cabinet without process and procedure that is transparent and in the public domain.  I am sorry if that upsets you, Chairman, as I respect your position here and the job you are trying to do.  However, I also understand that we cannot demonise the Zappone appointment without examining every other appointment that was made at that meeting.  I am sorry, because as I said on the record, I believe that Mr. Fraser would be the ideal man for the London job.  His work in Northern Ireland and for this country has been exceptional.</p></speech>

All I can say is that ambassadorships are Civil Service roles.  The process is effectively, from my point of view, a reassignment within the Civil Service.  We reassign public servants all the time.  I do not believe it has anything to do with the special envoy process whatsoever.  I came into the Civil Service through a competition and every promotion I ever got was through a competition.</p></speech>

It concerns all Ministers' telephones.  We have been asking about it for a while, and I was told at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications the other day, that all Ministers' telephones are encrypted.  The issue of the Minister for Foreign Affair's phone being hacked is a very serious one.  Would Mr. Fraser regard it as being up there with a national security issue that needs investigation at the top level of cybersecurity in this country?</p></speech>

I do not think many of his questions today were relevant.</p> <p>  I actually came here today surprised that Mr. Fraser was coming in.  I thank him for coming in to answer our questions.  Clearly, he answered all the questions perfectly.  He has shown our committee great respect.

He said:</p> <blockquote> 	This was, by the way, in the Cabinet memo, but it was not spotted by some people.  I have the page from the Cabinet memo in front of me, which mentioned a special envoy for freedom of opinion and expression in terms of an appointment.  It outlined in brief terms what that was about and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence requested the approval of Government for the appointment of Katherine Zappone as that special envoy.  It was actually in the memo. </blockquote> <p>Perhaps I have it wrong.  I know that Mr. Fraser cannot necessarily answer this question but it must be that the Minister was referring to the second memo that he brought personally to the Cabinet meeting.  However, we understood, when he gave that information to our committee, that he was referring to the first memo.  In his second appearance before the committee, he apologised for being sloppy.  Perhaps this was one aspect of his sloppy evidence.  Is that Mr. Fraser's understanding?</p></speech>

He said it was not spotted by some people.  I do not know how we will clarify that point.

This relates to some of the concerns about leaks from Cabinet, and specifically, the investigation into the leak regarding the report on the mother and baby homes.

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.</p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Fraser on his appointment as an Irish Ambassador and I understand that he is the third non-career diplomat to be appointed as an ambassador.  I may be incorrect on that point but I am aware of two other such appointments.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised the process and I do not wish to personalise this issue by referring to Mr. Fraser&rsquo;s own appointment but the Secretary General said that it would be good, in the future, were EU, UN or Government special envoy positions generally to be advertised for open competition.  I suppose there has been a movement generally in that direction in the Civil Service.  I appreciate that there is a very significant difference between an envoy, which is a temporary part-time position, and a position as an ambassador, which Mr. Fraser said was a Department of Foreign Affairs position and then immediately clarified to the effect that it was a Civil Service position.  </p> <p>  How are such positions currently advertised and who may apply?  I am not talking specifically about the London position.  Obviously, for the entry-level positions in the Department of Foreign Affairs, any Irish citizen can apply.  There are many Irish citizens in senior positions within the European Union&rsquo;s diplomatic corps, namely, the European External Action Service and in UN missions across the world.  Can they apply or is this competition confined to members of the diplomatic corps or is it confined only to civil servants?  Who may apply then for such positions and how are they advertised?  If that is not clear, given that Mr. Fraser has made the recommendation, which I understand was a personal opinion, that there should be clarity going forward on how envoys are appointed and that a process should be put in place, does Mr. Fraser believe that a similar process should be put in place and perhaps that there should be a greater openness to external applicants for ambassadorial positions?</p></speech>

One can get into the Civil Service, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, at every level.  In most Departments, one can do that all the way up to Secretary General and in most other Departments, at least up to assistant secretary level.  There are opportunities.  I am aware of people who had applied for jobs from outside of the Department of Foreign Affairs at a senior level who have probably got them and who will then end up being appointed as ambassadors.</p> <p> The process for assigning heads of mission posts in the Department of Foreign Affairs is a very complex one which the Secretary General in the Department of Foreign Affairs carries out, not me.  I was involved in this one but I am not generally involved.  In fact the Chairman of the committee, as a former Minister, probably knows far more about this matter than I do.  </p> <p>  Returning to the Deputy&rsquo;s point, there are good people outside of the Civil Service and they can apply to come in at the level described.  I believe I am correct in saying that our ambassadors have three or four grade levels, depending on the size of the mission and it is very possible for people to enter the Civil Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs at any of those levels.  While perhaps one will not be appointed as a head of mission on one&rsquo;s first day, one certainly can become a head of mission quite soon thereafter.  That talent pool is in fact available to the Department.</p></speech>

The way that it is probably done is that people work in headquarters for a while first and then they end up working abroad.

I share that view, but my views are irrelevant.  Mr. Fraser went on to say then that he did not think that the names were available to anybody until the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, brought them to the meeting.

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members who are attending remotely of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.

Effective transposition of any EU directive requires a thorough understanding of the local and national context and that is so with respect to EU Directive 2019/1937, which is being transposed by way of this amendment Bill.  As part of its first session, the committee heard testimonies and contributions from Mr. John Wilson, Mr. Noel Grace and Mr. Philip Brennan of Raiseaconcern.  All those contributions pointed to the need and value of a protected disclosure regime in the public interest and in the interests of those directly involved.<br/><br/>As a representative body of lawyers, the Bar of Ireland is not as concerned with the rationale and policy behind certain legal protections and will leave that space for other capable invitees, some of whom are with the committee today.  Instead, our submission has focused on ways in which the proposed 2021 Bill could be improved from a legal drafting and utility point of view.  Clear and effective legislation makes our jobs as lawyers much easier when advising clients.  It has the potential to prevent or reduce disputes, remove uncertainty and empower individuals.  Therefore, the purpose of our contribution is to highlight particular areas which we believe could be improved as well as some areas which we fully support.  These are set out more comprehensively in our written submission but our key observations can be summarised as follows. The first observation relates to the definition of a worker.  The council is of the view that the proposed Bill could be improved by a more comprehensive and inclusive definition for the persons entitled to whistle-blowing protection.  Therefore, the council recommends that the term &quot;worker&quot; be replaced by &quot;reporting/disclosing person&quot; and to enumerate the term a &quot;reporting/disclosing person&quot;, as is the model of the Protected Disclosures Act and the proposed Bill at present, with the various categories of persons who ought to be caught by the protections.  The reason we say this is that jurisprudence and other statutory definitions of &quot;worker&quot; general relate to relationships narrower than what is envisaged in the proposed Bill.  The expansion of the understanding of &quot;worker&quot; to include a shareholder or applicant for a role is of some concern on the basis that to stretch the meaning of &quot;worker&quot; beyond its traditionally understood meaning could result in persons who would otherwise be protected not believing they classify as a worker and therefore not making a protected disclosure.<br/><br/>I will speak now about the treatment of interpersonal grievances.  As the committee will be aware, the EU directive and purpose of the amendment relates to breaches of EU law, and the wide scope that entails.  Head 5 of the Bill sets out an exclusionary definition taking inspiration from recital 22 of the directive on the issue of interpersonal grievance, as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	A matter is not a relevant wrongdoing if it is a matter concerning interpersonal grievances exclusively affecting the reporting person, namely grievances about interpersonal conflicts between the reporting person and another worker and the matter can be channelled to other procedures designed to address such matters. </blockquote> <p>The council, in principle, welcomes the addition of this exclusion and expects that it will provide much needed clarity to certain disputes.  The use of the word &quot;exclusively&quot; is important as it narrows the scope of the exclusion.  Therefore, for example, an employee could be protected if they made a disclosure concerning their boss who they claimed was bullying them if they also believed and disclosed that the boss was bullying other employees.  This type of disclosure is not captured by the exclusion and would arguably be a protected disclosure depending on the particular circumstances.</p><p>The council recommends that efforts be made to clearly define the term "interpersonal grievance".  Failure to provide such a definition could lead to differing views amongst employers and employees as to what qualifies as interpersonal.  The legislation should provide for an objective definition with less room for individual interpretation.</p><p> The council advises the repeal of section 13(2) of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which creates a mandatory exclusion on persons bringing a claim to the Workplace Relations Commission for redress for having been dismissed or penalised at work and a tort claim in the courts based on detriment suffered by them arising out of their making of a protected disclosure.  This section goes too far in preventing a form of double recovery by a whistleblower.  It is possible to envisage a situation in which a person has been dismissed for whistleblowing, but against whom a detriment is also caused.  It is more in keeping with the purposes of the directive for the availability of remedies to be maximised.  We recommend that this provision be repealed, particularly as the courts are well equipped to address legal issues concerning the crossover of reliefs with the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p> Head 9, subsection (11) of the proposed Bill seeks to amend section 6 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which provides for a public disclosure by a worker to their employer, and states: "The reporting person shall cooperate, where required, with any investigation or any other follow up procedure initiated in accordance with the proposed section 6(9)(d)."  This subsection is vague as to what type of co-operation is envisaged.  Further, the consequences for such a failure are also unclear.  While the Council approves of the general approach in heads 9 and 10 of the general scheme, it is concerned about the ambiguity within the proposed sections, as I have set out, which could benefit from greater clarity as the proposed Bill is progressed.</p><p> The Council supports the creation of the protected disclosures office.  This is in the interests of an efficient and whistleblower-friendly regime, identifiable by the public through appropriate awareness raising and adequately resourced.  The council views this as especially worthy development in light of the increased complexity and range of regulatory matters over which protected disclosures can now be made under this new regime.  As the directive aims to cover breaches of European law in a number of complex areas, including public procurement, animal and food safety and many others, the council expects the protected disclosures office will act as a safe and effective clearing house, which would simplify the process for potential whistleblowers.</p><p> Finally, the council recommends the provision of legal aid to certain persons making or contemplating making a protected disclosure given the complexity and sensitivity of this area.  The council views the provision of legal aid and psychological support as consistent with the ethos of the directive, which seeks to empower would-be reporting persons into making a fully informed decision as to whether they will make a report or protected disclosure and for them to be supported thereafter.  We look forward to engaging with the committee and our colleagues here on this important discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.303" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#B00200"><p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, welcomes the opportunity to appear before the committee to discuss this important draft legislation.  I am joined by my colleague, Ronan Kennedy, and we thank the committee members for their invitation.  The ICCL has previously made written submissions on the draft heads of Bill and I will use this opening statement as an opportunity to offer a summary of the main points of that submission.</p> <p>  Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.  Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enshrines the same rights.  That article emphasises the freedom applies to information and ideas of all kinds.  These key human rights instruments and principles form the basis of the ICCL&rsquo;s submission on the Bill.</p> <p>  It is worth reiterating from the outset that Ireland enjoys, as Mr. Clarke acknowledged, a high standard of protection for whistleblowers in a comparative perspective.  The 2014 Act is often cited in policy and academic literature as being effective for the protection of whistleblowers.  EU Directive 2019/1937 offers an opportunity for the Oireachtas to go further in the protection of those who make protected disclosures. Whistleblower should, however, be seen as a regulator of last resort.  Effective oversight is a more responsible manner for the state to prevent wrongdoing.</p> <p>  The ICCL has had the benefit of seeing the earlier session.  It is important for us to acknowledge that in our work, we see the value of whistleblowers in many areas of policy on an ongoing basis, not least with regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the technology sector.  It is the view of ICCL that a number of opportunities to strengthen the 2014 Act have, unfortunately, been missed in the process of transposition thus far.  Steps can and should now be taken to remedy this.  Our submission contains a number of practical recommendations to improve the legislation.  I will briefly outline them now.</p> <p>  First, it is our recommendation consideration be given to including in the eventual Bill an explicit recognition of the value of whistleblowing outside of the context of employment and work as provided in the UN Convention against Corruption to which Ireland is a party.  This could allow the inclusion of categories of whistleblowers such as patients who blow the whistle on wrongdoing in hospitals or parents who might witness wrongdoing in a school.  We very much concur with the points made by the Bar in Ireland about the problematic definition of "worker" in the current draft.</p> <p>  Second, we suggest that the existing text contained in the draft heads designed to amend section 10 of the 2014 Act, should be altered to provide protection to those who seek to disclose wrongdoing or information which is in the public interest, regardless of their relationship to the organisation they are reporting.</p> <p>  Third, the ICCL recommends the decision to derogate from the directive by limiting the requirement to establish internal whistleblowing channels for private sector firms with fewer than 49 employees should be reversed.  Small companies should be in a position to put in place the requisite policies.  The ICCL, which has 13 staff, has such a policy in place.</p> <p> Fourth, head 8 should be amended in order to ensure legal entities are obliged to investigate and follow up on anonymous disclosures where sufficient evidence is provided to act.</p> <p>  Our final recommendations relate to the proposed disclosures office.  The ICCL submits that further consideration should be given to how this office could potentially examine protected disclosures arising outside of work and employment.  Failing this, the office should be required to report to the Minister each year on the number and type of disclosures it has received, in addition to the investigative status relating to them.</p> <p>  Finally, the disclosures office should be tasked with providing a one-stop shop for whistleblowing information and support that could complement the existing resources in place, such as those offered by Transparency International Ireland and others.  Article 20.3 of the directive contains a specific commitment to the provision of psychological support for whistleblowers and this should be included in the eventual legislation.  It is the view of the ICCL that a commitment to resourcing these supports, as well as the provision of appropriate legal aid, is essential.</p> <p>  In choosing to derogate from a number of areas of the directive, the Oireachtas might pass up the opportunity to set a gold standard for protected disclosure internationally.  We are choosing, unfortunately, to ignore a number of key provisions of international conventions to which Ireland is a party, including the UN Convention against Corruption, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the final version of the Bill respects those conventions to which Ireland is a party and is amended by this committee and the House in such a way as to ensure that the right to freedom of expression is to the forefront of an enhanced whistleblower regime in this jurisdiction.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Orla Keane, general counsel for the Mental Health Commission and the decision support service and Joanna Macklin, decision support service senior panel manager and protected disclosures officer and recipient.</p><p> As part of the MHC's strategic plan up to 2022, our vision is the highest-quality mental health and decision support services underpinned by a person's human rights.  We welcome the introduction of clear and enhanced protected disclosure procedures that will assist in protecting these individual human rights and bring us forward into a more transparent Ireland.</p><p> The principal functions of the MHC under the Mental Health Acts are to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in our approved centres.  As a regulator, we welcome any legislative provisions which will support staff and other parties to raise concerns about the safety and quality of care for patients and other vulnerable service users throughout our country.</p><p> The remit of the MHC was extended by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides for the establishment, we hope, of the decision support service.  The latter will support decision-making by and for adults with capacity difficulties and will regulate individuals who are providing support to people with capacity difficulties.  It is the MHC's hope that this Bill will result in a continuing of the change in attitude to protected disclosures in the workplace by ensuring there are sufficient safeguards and protections.  Organisations in that way will be less apprehensive of the possibility of false or vexatious disclosures and, most importantly, individuals will be empowered to expose wrongdoing without fear of retaliation.</p><p> In considering the general scheme of the protected disclosures (amendment) Bill 2021, we have confined ourselves to commenting on matters within our remit.  In that context, the MHC welcomes the retention of the existing obligation that all public bodies must establish internal reporting channels.  This is in line with section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, which requires all public bodies to have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights in carrying out their functions.  The MHC recommends that there be the possibility of local authorities and smaller public bodies pooling resources and sharing internal reporting channels.  After all, it is our State's money and it is possible to do it.  We have seen it in other areas.  Over the past ten years or more, there have been increased obligations in the area of compliance.  This proposal would allow for centralised expertise, increased efficiency, assistance with training and reduced costs for smaller agencies and, ultimately, help the person who wants to try to identify the wrongdoing.</p><p> The establishment of a protected disclosures office within the Office of the Ombudsman is a further proposal that the MHC especially welcomes.  This centralised system is critical and should ensure consistency in reporting, investigation and communication.  In addition, the MHC believes that this centralised office could provide supports to and guidelines for public bodies and people who want to identify wrongdoing.  At the same time, it may be appropriate to make strengthened provisions for public bodies to decline or to redirect a protected disclosure where they do not believe it is within their remit.</p><p> The MHC notes that a number of issues need to be addressed: clarification on the issue of legal aid, the limits to liability of reporting persons, the timeframe for disclosure of a wrongdoing, limiting protected disclosures from job applicants and establishing more details on penalties under the Bill.</p><p> The MHC supports the transposition of the directive through the proposed amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act, which shall enhance the protections and scope available.  We hope that doing this will continue to develop a more transparent, open Ireland where wrongdoing is identified and eliminated.</p></speech>

I found them very useful.  I will start with Mr. Clarke on a number of things he mentioned that I found quite interesting.  He mentioned that the definition of "worker" is too narrow.  I, too, am concerned about that because it seems to be silent on people working for voluntary organisations, external contractors, directors and so on.  I assume from what Mr. Clarke said - and this is my view but I am interested to hear his - that he would be in favour of expanding that definition to include these types of workers.  I am interested to hear his views on journalists as well.  He might be aware, with recent things happening-----</p></speech>

However, I will make the point that, as things stand, workers are protected under the protected disclosure regime currently in place.  Because the new changes will expand that to situations that are not traditionally associated with workers - shareholders, members of a board and potential employees who are merely job applicants - the general scheme attempts to deal with the directive as the directive is, so it deals with the new areas that are set out in the directive.  There is nothing stopping a legislature going further than the directive because the directive simply sets out the goals of the European Union legislation.  There is nothing stopping the Legislature from using the opportunity it now has before it to expand the various types of persons it wants covered in a protected disclosure regime.  I noted in the contribution made by the ICCL that it has given an example of somebody who might be in the health service as a patient and who might have a disclosure they want to make.  The benefits of having a definition of a reporting person which includes within its enumeration a worker mean that the Legislature can now, or even at a future date, easily include other persons it wants to enjoy the protections of protected disclosure.  Therefore, we think it is just more sensible from a drafting perspective to have a cleaner version called "reporting person" and to include in it a worker and other persons, as in the directive, which effectively involves three other persons, and then the Legislature can decide if it wants to expand that further now or at any future date.</p></speech>

It should be clear that this could have the power to reject disclosures where circumstances such as bullying and unfair discriminatory treatment or dangerous working conditions arise.  When somebody attempts to reveal wrongdoing, there is often a reflexive reaction on the part of those against whom the allegation is made, and they would be concerned about this.  I worry that it offers an easier mechanism to dismiss the concerns because the whole concept of an interpersonal grievance is not that clear-cut.  Does Mr. Clarke share my concerns in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#C00500"><p>The first point I will make is that, in fact, Article 22 of the directive simply states that "Member States could decide to provide that reports concerning interpersonal grievances exclusively affecting the reporting person" could be excluded, so there is no mandatory obligation on the Legislature to include interpersonal grievances at all as something to be excluded.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that sometimes in employment law grievances can overlap with disclosures of wrongdoing.  For example, somebody could have had a previous grievance or may have a protected disclosure that has newly come to light to him or her and may try to bring it in as part of his or her interpersonal grievance.  We have a concern that employers might attempt to shoehorn what is effectively a protected disclosure into a grievance procedure and, therefore, the protected disclosure may not come to light.  We think, therefore, that if the Legislature decides to include interpersonal grievances, which is within its discretion, this would need to be defined very tightly in order that it would cover merely a clear interpersonal grievance between one person who is a worker and another worker and that it would not have any sort of tailing into a protected disclosure.  Obviously, the spirit of this regime is to encourage reporting.  We would not want to have anything that might discourage that at all, particularly in the case of somebody who, as I said, may be involved in a long-standing interpersonal grievance but has new issues to bring to light.</p><p>The Deputy gave a good example.  One could think of a situation whereby somebody raises a grievance in respect of bonuses or expense claims.  That may feed into some sort of financial impropriety.  It is important that an employer could be able to not use interpersonal grievances to avoid dealing with bigger issue.</p></speech>

In some ways it leads me onto my final question for Mr. Clarke.  Obviously, one concern many people have for those who make protected disclosures is the financial resources that a person must have to win the redress.  That is an obvious a matter of concern for people who make protected disclosures.  The income of an individual who is considering revealing a perceived wrongdoing should not weigh on his or her mind.  The reality is that it does, however.  I ask Mr. Clarke for his views on this.  Does he think that access to free legal aid for whistleblowers would help them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#D00300"><p>That is clearly something that we are concerned about.  Recent history has shown us that persons who make protected disclosures can have an uphill battle to bring those disclosures to bear.  Also, they are sometimes isolated and incur great financial expense, particularly if there is retaliation brought to bear upon them.  Having the added problem of having to resource a potential case against another party that is well funded and well able to carry on a battle through the courts or elsewhere means that a person could be dissuaded from bringing forth a protected closure because he or she knows that there is a long battle ahead.  There is a high price to pay, both personally and financially, because of making a protected disclosure.  We feel that not only should psychological support be made available to persons who make protected disclosures, but that civil legal aid should also be available to them.  We use a recent example of where Minister, Deputy McEntee, has allowed the civil legal aid to be used by victims of sexual crime, so that they could get legal advice.  There is precedent for extending civil legal aid to cover vulnerable persons.  Often, persons who are making protected disclosures, in our view, could also be classified as vulnerable persons.</p></speech>

It follows on from what Mr. Clarke stated to the effect that many people who make protected disclosures face an uphill battle.  Last week, some brave people who faced just such a battle were before the committee.  We heard their individual stories.  One thing that came across quite strongly was how protracted and arduous the process was for the individuals in question.  Given that Mr. Herrick has represented whistleblowers, I assume that he would accept that it can be a long and arduous process for people.</p></speech>

We would be minded in this regard of the contribution of our colleagues at Transparency International Ireland and the research they have done on the low proportion of whistleblowers whose cases reach successful resolutions.  My colleague, Mr. Kennedy, might have something to add about our recommendations in respect of the process.</p></speech>

I would be interested in Mr. Herrick&rsquo;s views.  I have some concerns regarding section 8 of the principal Act.  The general scheme contains a provision which attempts to remove the right of a public sector worker to make a protected disclosure to the responsible Minister and the corresponding protections that that worker would get.  Given that the principal Act allows such a worker to make a protected disclosure to the relevant Minister, does Mr. Herrick believe that the internal process of investigation was either insincere or was entered into bad faith?  One had, in essence, another avenue to blow the whistle if one felt that the internal process was being deliberately dragged out or handled in a stage-managed way.  The proposed Bill will remove that avenue, meaning that in most circumstances one would first have to exhaust the internal processes and procedures before going external.  We have heard the stories of brave people who have come forward to make protected disclosures.  However, people are only human.  As we know, many whistleblowers have often faced penalisation.  We, as human beings, can only take so much.  Would Mr. Herrick agree that this would provide an additional barrier and that many whistleblowers would likely give up before ever reaching the point of going external?  I would be interested in his views and those of his colleague on that matter.</p></speech>

Our submission comes from the stepped support perspective whereby internal channels should be the first port of call.  When these are exhausted or seem to be ineffective, the matter should then be escalated to external channels or to the general public.  I agree that in the context of the reporting mechanisms, the bar is potentially set too high to be able to move to an external reporting channel.  The new proposed protected disclosure office could have a role to play in that regard.  Some of my colleagues made submissions and raised the possibility that protected disclosures could be made directly to that office and not, for example, directly to a line Minister.  The bar is potentially set a bit too high in that regard in the draft Bill, as it stands.</p></speech>

This is an area where the Bill could go further in terms of mandating bodies to investigate anonymous disclosures, acknowledging the acute vulnerability of many people who might be in a position to make disclosures.  Stronger protections for anonymous disclosures and encouraging anonymous disclosures would be an important procedural safeguard that could be put in place.</p></speech>

It would lower the standards not to have that direct reporting to a Minister.  If anything, it is a case of &ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&rdquo;.  I have concerns in that regard.  I would be concerned that it will lower the standards.  It also goes against Article 25.2 of the EU directive.  I have concerns that standards will be lowered if the option of reporting to a Minister is removed.</p> <p>  I have question for Mr. Farrelly.  I have met with a number of whistleblowers in recent years.  Many of them have told me about the huge toll the process has taken on their mental health.  Some people felt &ndash; and you do not have to meet with a whistleblower to hear this &ndash; that their lives destroyed and that their careers were ruined.  It is difficult to watch people who sought to act in the public interest suffering such personal hardship.  We often hear about the importance of mental health, but what we need to see now are the necessary resources being put in place in that regard.  Could Mr. Farrelly describe the psychological damage that he has seen people who have made protected disclosures endure?  Access to free and independent psychological services, especially for those lower down the income ladder, could help ameliorate that damage.  How could that be dealt with?  I feel strongly that psychological services should be free for people who are doing something so good for the public interest.</p></speech>

An individual who identifies wrongdoing often goes up against people who usually have power and authority.  In my previous career as Charities Regulator, I saw wrongdoers at work.  Wrongdoers will use any tactic and to press down upon someone who identifies that.  We therefore need protections in place for the individual.  Legal aid was mentioned.  It is about changing the culture in Ireland.  We do not have to go back too long to think of Ireland, Great Britain and the culture of informers and traitors.  Now, we are looking at how we in Ireland can accept that and support people who are acting in the public interest.</p><p>It involves getting our heads around that and ensuring that we have such supports in place.  I am happy to hand over to my colleagues if they wish to comment further.</p></speech>

Regarding the issue of supports, we made a submission to the Department in 2020.  In that document, we stated that when looking at such supports that it is necessary to determine if those supports will be the difference between someone making a protected disclosure or not.  If it is, then those supports must be provided.  We went on to refer to a report from the European Commission that looked at the cost-benefit analysis in this regard.  That showed that it was in everybody's favour to provide such supports.  Therefore, the cost of doing so was outweighed by the benefits.  I apologise to the members of the committee because I have not reviewed whether there is an updated report on that issue.  It is important information, however, because much of the time when people are discussing supports, and especially in the case of the Government, getting value for money is an important consideration.  In that context, though, there must be an examination of what supports will ensure that more protected disclosures are made and if those protected disclosures will ensure that there will be less wrongdoing.  That is an important and useful perspective.  Regarding the supports, as well, they may be financial but they could also be psychological.  We should not necessarily pigeonhole them into one box.  It would be very useful if the new office was given the power to provide those supports and was funded to do so.</p></speech>

I hope that between us we can improve the legislation.  We have all dealt with situations involving unfair treatment, bullying and-or sexual harassment, whatever the case maybe, within the workplace and outside it.  The speed with which an issue can be dealt with is important.  Are the witnesses satisfied that a review will deal with an issue in such a way as to ensure that it will be possible to have a rapid appraisal of a situation to allow for the content of disclosures or complaints to brought to the appropriate authorities with a view to resolution?  Would the witnesses like to hear all my questions at once?  I think taking one at a time might be easier.</p> <p>  I will add to that last question that we have all dealt with issues involving almost every profession, including the legal and education professions and academia.  Every facet of life has brought to our attention various forms of discrimination within the workplace and between workplaces as well over the years.  My point in this regard is that a parliamentary question posed by a Deputy will sometimes draw out the information.  However, we have come to rely more on the freedom of information legislation and access through that route.  In recent years, there has been a tendency in that regard for there to be a reluctance to give the information by way of reply to a parliamentary question and to rely on other avenues instead, such as that provided for by the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  That undermines the authority of Parliament, however.  Undermining the authority of Parliament, in whatever way, is not a good thing.  I am trying to broaden the nature of my question by coming at it from that perspective.  Any of our guests can answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#E00600"><p>I will address that question first.  Deputy Durkan raises a good point concerning the speed that an issue can be dealt with.  We welcome in that regard head 21 of the proposed Bill, that allows for interim relief to be sought in the courts in more circumstances than have traditionally applied, which were essentially cases where people were potentially going to be or had been dismissed.  In such instances, one can now go before the courts for interim relief if one is to be penalised in any way and not just by dismissal.  An opportunity, therefore, is being provided to get into the Circuit Court and to get interim relief to prevent penalisation taking place.  That can be done relatively rapidly.  The Circuit Court will have to be resourced properly, because if this type of litigation becomes popular, then the strain on the Circuit Court will continue to manifest.  One case involving a protective disclosure being dealt with will mean that another case is not being dealt with.  The provision of interim relief in a more expansive way, therefore, will assist people to get before the courts who need to do so rapidly.</p> <p>  In addition, new procedures will now apply.  People must have the receipt of protected disclosures acknowledged within seven days.  There is also a requirement for such disclosures to be followed up diligently.  Feedback must also be provided to the reporting person of the actions taken or envisaged within three months.  This depends on the size of the organisation, though, and that is what is mandated as a potential to bring out from the directives.  For example, the obligation is placed on organisations with 50 or more employees to establish formal channels and provide for employees to make protected disclosures, with a derogation until 17 December 2023.  It is for the Members of the legislature to consider whether they want to set that number at 50 employees or to reduce it to include smaller organisations.  There has been a history of wrongdoing in, for example, charities, where the number of employees in such an organisation would be much smaller.  That is a qualitative decision to be made by the legislature.</p> <p>  We agree wholeheartedly, though, with Deputy Durkan's comments regarding speed being of the essence.  There are shoots in that regard in these heads of the proposed Bill in the form of the potential interim relief measure and the speed at which follow-up must take place once someone makes a protected disclosure.  It is potentially important, though, to consider whether there might be a need to reduce the number of employees in respect of those organisations covered by the provisions of this proposed Bill to allow for the maximum speed of response to people making protected disclosures.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Clarke.  I will expand that aspect further.  Speed is important.  From the perspective of employees making protected disclosures, are we happy that sufficient protections are available to people initially to ensure that they are not isolated or pushed into a situation where they might be seen as <i>agents provocateurs</i>or constant complainants?  Are we satisfied that the means and structures exist to enable a proper, authoritative and full appraisal of cases and their merits to be made at the earliest possible stage and potential attempts at possible resolutions?  Do those elements exist now?  If not, why is that the case?</p></speech>

This aspect emphasises the importance of the possibility of anonymous disclosures for people within an organisation.  The Deputy made the point that people could be viewed as <i>agents provocateurs</i>or as having a particular set of grievances, etc.  That really emphasises the point concerning why anonymous disclosures should be provided for in this potential legislation.  The emphasis should always be on the content of protected disclosures rather on the people making them.  I say that because this drifts into the area that was previously discussed involving issues of personal grievances and things like that.  I think the point the Deputy is making that anonymity should be facilitated insofar as possible in order to ensure that people can be protected to the maximum degree and to prevent  concerns from being dismissed as arising from particular grievances about X, Y or Z.  It is important point to make.</p></speech>

The other part of that question concerns the thoroughness, or otherwise, of an investigation in response to protected disclosures from complainants.  How will it be possible to know that sufficient time, effort and impartiality will be applied to the investigation of complaints?</p><p>I am willing to take answers from all witnesses.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#F00300"><p>A number of the points raised by Deputy Durkan are linked.  We are of the view that it would be useful to have a code of practice in place.  This is where we envisage the new protected disclosures office having a role.  We welcome the additions to the internal reporting channels but they could be enhanced.  For example, while seven days are afforded to acknowledge a protected disclosure, the code should be clear on what should be done, how long a report should take, and it should contain more defined timelines.  When feedback is provided, what is the format of that feedback?</p> <p>  I agree with my colleague, Mr. Kennedy, in the context of his comment about it being about the content and not the person.  There should be a clear code of practice setting out issues of confidentiality.  In the commission, for example, we have an email address to which protected disclosures are sent.  When a person makes a protected disclosure, it goes onto a system and only one person can view that documentation on the system.  That person does not discuss it with other people in the organisation.  There should be clear guidelines for the protected disclosure recipients about how they deal with these matters and if a case of improper conduct arose, perhaps the new office could address that.  Supports are needed on both sides.  The protected disclosure recipients should have clear codes of practice on how to deal with disclosures within a specific period of time.  If they do not have the expertise, they would have to send the matter externally.  I expect that many smaller organisations will not have the expertise to deal with this matter and they should be obliged to put their hand up to say they do not have the expertise.  Likewise, the protected disclosure recipients may be on the same team as or knows the person making the protected disclosure or may have had an issue with him or her.  If they are in a small office, there may be issues of bias.  They need to know when to refer the matter externally.  The code of practice would be useful and if the new office provides that, it will go a long way in assisting us with those queries.</p></speech>

If a person makes a genuine complaint, he or she has a right to be able to depend on the issue raised being dealt with impartially.  The guidelines and regulations may change this.  Guidelines are not much good because they are only guidelines.  In the case of statutory guidelines or orders, it is somewhat different.  We have all dealt with cases on reporting a matter by way of a parliamentary question where complainants know, and can point out quickly, why a certain answer was given. They have said it was because of A, B and C, which in turn suggests they did not consider the case was dealt with impartially.  How do the witnesses feel about the impartiality of the current or required structures?  Do they consider they are reliable?</p></speech>

The worker could avail of this option.  The external reporting channels sets out a list of prescribed suitable bodies - these would be regulators - and if there is not an appropriate regulator for that given area of concern, the worker can make the protected disclosure to the newly formed protected disclosures office.  That will act as a safeguard and default suitable authority in the event of there not being an appropriate regulator for that area of governance.  It is for would-be whistle-blowers to determine whether they believe they will get a fair hearing in their workplace.  If they fear they will not, the external reporting channels are available to them and, if not, the protected disclosures office is the default authority.</p></speech>

I apologise for that.  There are some situations where women, particularly in cases of nuisance or unwanted sexual advances, are reluctant to go outside, when taking the immediate step of reporting, the appropriate authority within the structures of the profession or the business.  How do we respond to those kinds of situations?  I do not wish to encourage frivolous reporting either, however, at the same time we have to protect the people who encounter an illegal experience, and do so effectively.  Some people are reluctant to go to what they perceive as unnecessary lengths to prove their case and may shy away from reporting it.  Have we prepared for that situation sufficiently or do we anticipate it?</p></speech>

To build on what Mr. O'Leary said, if disclosers believes the internal reporting channels are insufficient or have not been responsive to their complaints, the option is open to them to go to a regulatory body or similar body.  Failing that, the protected disclosures office would be an option for them.  I sound a note of caution on that.  The experience in the Netherlands suggests that a centralised disclosures office, such as the Dutch House for Whistleblowers, can become completely overwhelmed with cases and significant backlogs can develop.  This occurred in a state where, traditionally, funding for such regulatory bodies has been consistent and generous.  The experience in Ireland suggests, unless the protected disclosures office is adequately funded and is able to deal with the volume of complaints it could potentially receive, it could become a serious choke point.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's previous point, delays could occur there and if a person is not comfortable reporting to internal channels or regulatory bodies associated with his or her industry, this could become a potential bottleneck.  It speaks to the idea that there is a role for civil society also.  Organisations such as Transparency International Ireland operate services whereby people can make reports to.  There should be a multitude of channels to which people can make their disclosures, not just regulatory bodies or the new office, but also in civil society.</p></speech>

I have one last question, if the Chairman will allow.  We all have dealt with cases where situations developed which required the disclosure to be made in the normal way.  We also know cases in which people make allegations that are not well grounded.  This brings me back to the initial examination of the complaint and who examines it, and the degree to which a clear conclusion can be reached as to the merits, or demerits, of the complaint, in addition to being fair to both sides, which is important.</p><p>In the event of a situation emerging whereby action is required, that should be referred to the appropriate authorities as a matter of urgency.  Who wishes to respond on the merits of the case in the first instance?  We may have some data to refer to here as to the number of cases previously dealt with, the number of cases that were deemed not to have any merit and the number that were deemed to have merit.  Have we any data to enlighten us in that regard?</p></speech>

It is important, particularly if we want a responsive situation in terms of the questions raised by the complainant.  In the event that the complaint is not valid, that needs to be dealt with at an early stage in order to protect the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made.  Do we have procedures in place in that regard at present?  If not, why not?</p></speech>

I am not sure about the rest of the public service but I know that in local authorities, for example, the level of such reporting has not been great in the past few years.  In 2018, only 54% of local authorities actually put forward their reports and in 2019 the figure was 45%.  It would be a good start if those reports from public bodies included data on false disclosures or disclosures that were not actioned through lack of evidence.  As the Deputy said, that could be a good start.  I am not sure about private sector bodies.  The protected disclosures office could have a role in receiving those reports and then issuing a report to the Minister annually so we can see how the legislation is actually operating.  In terms of the reports coming in, data on whether there are any disclosures that are not actioned due to lack of evidence and the speed with which disclosures are dealt would be useful so that we can see how we are progressing, year on year.</p></speech>

Obviously, our purpose is to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on this important legislation.  We want to improve it as best we can before it is enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would point out that we must engage in a balancing act in terms of ensuring that the procedure is fair for the person making the complaint, to make sure the method of making a complaint more appropriate and relaxed while also ensuring the rights of the person against whom a complaint is made.  In fairness to the witnesses, Deputy Durkan asked why we do not have the data we need but that is really the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  It is our job to ensure that if complaints are being made and if we are setting up a new protected disclosures office, that the office provides the relevant data to the public.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Herrick.  I am interested in one of the ICCL's recommendations in respect of ensuring that legal entities are obliged to investigate and follow up on anonymous disclosures.  In fairness to the ICCL, it is not saying that all or any anonymous disclosures should be followed up but that they should be, where sufficient evidence is provided.  Does Mr. Herrick think that is something that would need to be written into the legislation?  Should the Bill state that a certain threshold of evidence is required or could the ICCL's concern about anonymity be overcome if there was a requirement that the name and identity of the complainant would not be released by the protected disclosures office or whoever is investigating?</p></speech>

I made the point previously in response to another question that the emphasis with regard to protected disclosures should always be on the content of the disclosure being made and not the individual in question.  There could be very good reasons for a person choosing to make a disclosure anonymously.  Our colleagues in Transparency International found that either the first or second most important reason for people coming forward to make a protected disclosure is that their anonymity can be guaranteed.  While I take the Deputy's point that if a name, a position or similar had to be given to the protected disclosures office on the understanding that it would be kept confidential, requiring that in a situation where there is enough information provided in order to at least assess the validity of a disclosure could potentially prevent people from coming forward.  As the Deputy pointed out, the ICCL is not saying that all anonymous disclosures should be followed up but where there are reasonable grounds for investigation or a reasonable threshold of information required, then a follow-up should be required.</p></speech>

My next question is for Mr. Clarke and the Bar Council.  I was very interested in the point he made about section 13 of the Protected Disclosures Act and how it limits the options available to a person who has been discriminated against as a result of making a protected disclosure.  He also referred to the capacity that exists for a person who has made a protected disclosure to apply for interim relief.  If an employee applies for interim relief before the Circuit Court, does he or she have to, under statute or common law, give an undertaking as to damages, as is the case in most applications for an injunction?  If that is the case, is that a deterrent for employees to seek that interim relief because of the threat hanging over them of an undertaking as to damages?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#G00900"><p>Absolutely.  That is a very good point.  Persons seeking interim relief or injunctive relief traditionally have to give an undertaking as to damages should they not succeed in their litigation and that in itself could potentially be a deterrent to somebody going before the courts for interim relief.  It is something that would have to be considered by the Legislature because I do not think it is something that could be covered by Circuit Court rules, for example.  We are dealing with new territory, with situations where interim relief would be opened up in circumstances not traditionally seen before and the Circuit Court would have to deal with that.  Again, as I have often pointed out, the resources of the Circuit Court would have to be there too.  We are talking about people in the Circuit Court dealing with a complex area which will have to be newly thought through by judges, which could prevent other cases being heard on that day.  Therefore, it would have to be properly resourced but I agree with the Deputy that having to give an undertaking as to damages in an injunctive case could potentially be a deterrent to an applicant.</p></speech>

I wish to pose a rhetorical question but I do not expect the witnesses to answer now because it would require much more consideration.  One would have to also consider the extent to which the constitutional protections that an employer would have would be preserved if there was no requirement to provide an undertaking as to damages but that is not a matter for the witnesses or for me today.</p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. Farrelly of the MHC.  What would he like to see done to ensure that the public at large is made aware of the existence of the protected disclosures office, that their rights can be protected and that the statutory entitlements they have under the Protected Disclosures Act are available to them?  Is this something that should be publicised?  Should it be done through the public sector or the private sector separately?</p></speech>

Where an individual is raising a wrongdoing, careers may be at stake and systems may be called into question so there is a defensive instinct among people who have power and those at the top, as we have seen over the last ten or 20 years.  There is a defensive instinct so the idea of a Leviathan or an oversight or scrutiny body that people can go to, with guaranteed impartiality, would add value.  I will now pass over to my colleague.</p></speech>

For example, the new service the commission is setting up is the DSS.  One of its functions as set out in the legislation is to provide information and to add to the code of practice.  Additional functions could be added into the Bill to specify that it is a function of this office to provide information by whatever means and to specify the extent to which it provides information.  It could also clearly set out that one of the functions of this office is to produce codes of practice.  As we said in our submission, we welcome this new office but we also think it is a prime opportunity to expand the role.  As this office is just being set up, let us take the opportunity now to set out what functions it can be given.</p> <p>  I also spoke about providing supports.  I understand that has financial implications.  I also referred to the cost-benefit analysis report that was done in Europe.  This is an opportunity from the outset to set out all the functions this office could do to provide supports to both sides, as Deputy Durkan mentioned, to both the employee and the employer, the person making the protected disclosure and the person who is handling the protected disclosure.  All those functions could be added to that office.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have already been asked, but I will follow up on a few of them.  Ms Keane just spoke about the functions.  Mr. Kennedy spoke about a report on the kinds of disclosures that are being made.  Should there be a function to try to identify patterns in disclosures?  I know we rightly have clear caveats on the retention of individual information so that they would only be for the individual disclosure being investigated.  To identify patterns of financial abuse, workplace abuse and so forth, could it potentially be part of the function of the protected disclosure body to try to knit together the patterns?  Rather than individual instances, we could perhaps begin to identify the kind of cultural shift we need.  We have seen the recent example with the Army.  We should not need to have a whistleblower, followed by another whistleblower five years later and another one ten years later.</p> <p>  I take on board the points Mr. Clarke made about reporting in person.  He briefly mentioned members of a board and I ask him to expand on that.  People are often told or are under the impression that they are bound by confidentiality in particular contexts.  People need to be very clear that their right to make a protected disclosure is not limited by, for example, a confidentiality agreement they may have in respect of certain aspects of their particular role in work.</p> <p>  I would be very interested in any of the speakers' takes on some of the key problems we know we had in the past which seem to be addressed here.  One relates to the protected disclosure ending up going back to those about whom the disclosure is made.  I am concerned about that point where the person who has received the disclosure is assessing whether it has merit or needs additional information.  Is there sufficient protection at that point to ensure they are not making that assessment in a way that exposes the reporting person?</p> <p>  I think this point may be addressed here.  We had ambiguity in the past where people made protected disclosures to a Minister and then the Minister changed role.  It was not clear if it is the individual who received it that is the recipient, or if it is the role that is the recipient.  We had disclosures that were falling between stools.  Has that been adequately addressed?</p> <p>  I wish to deal with the question of compensation.  I am concerned about the stories we have heard from whistleblowers.  The compensatory package is capped at &euro;13,000.  We know the damage done to people's lives for whistleblowing in Ireland has often been quite extreme.  People have lost their homes, their livelihoods and ten or 15 years of their career in some cases.  I ask the witnesses to outline their thoughts on that compensation.  We have discussed at length the interim measures but I am asking about that ultimate piece.</p> <p>  This is not about being retrospective, but it is about cases which are almost still in play.  Two of the great frustrations we have heard from people is the lack of communication to them about what has happened on cases.  I see that improved in this Bill in that they get enough feedback within three to six months and they then would be entitled to know the ultimate end point.  However, some of the whistleblowers we have spoken to have gone four or five years without knowing what is happening, sometimes when they are still in the workplace about which they have made a complaint.  Is there a need for an interim communication point where they can seek an update on whether the matter is still in process to know what is happening rather than waiting for the end point?</p> <p>  Many of those who sought compensation under the previous system were not able to access it or have never had that claim properly processed.  Where the disclosure is in the past but there has never been a final communication as to what happened or there has never been a final resolution of the claim for compensation, should those persons still be able to apply under these new rules?  Even though the disclosure point was in the past, they are still effectively awaiting satisfaction from the system under those two particular remits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#H00400"><p>I might respond to two of the issues the Senator raised.  The first one related to the member of a board who would now be a person who could make a protected disclosure and seek the protections that are in the general scheme of the Bill.  That new category of person who is entitled to protections under the protected disclosures regime is effectively one of the new categories of persons in the directive.  The general scheme of the Bill simply puts into the Bill what is in the directive, specifying a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking, including non-executive members.</p> <p>  The Senator raised the issue of a duty of confidentiality a role might entail.  Nobody is forced to make a protected disclosure if he or she chooses not to, but if that person chooses to make a protected disclosure, he or she gets the protections that are afforded by the legislation.  I suppose the way to approach it is that any duty of confidentiality that person feels he or she has must give way to the greater public interest in receiving information about the relevant wrongdoing.  Therefore, I do not believe that person would be bound by their duty of confidentiality whatsoever.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.</p> <p>  The directive gives an opportunity for two categories of person to be protected whereby they do not have to make a protected disclosure, those being healthcare professionals and lawyers.  One can see why that is the case because a lawyer clearly has a duty of confidentiality which is an ethical obligation in respect of his or her dealings with clients, and it is likewise with healthcare professionals.  There may be an opportunity to allow an exclusion for lawyers, in particular, because of their duty of confidentiality.  That said, even if that were not there, lawyers still have their overall obligation and duty of confidentiality that would protect them in any event should they not make a disclosure.</p></speech>

I just want to ensure people would not have doubt.</p></speech>

They are the only ones to have their compensation capped.</p><p>I suppose that is a proportionate response to the fact their damages would not seem to be as weighty as another person who was in employment because maybe they are a job applicant, for example.  I suppose it is a proportionate response to try to match the balance that is there between employers and employees.  The judge could be the ultimate decider of a cap on the merits of a case before the court, but it is a legislative choice for the Oireachtas to decide what cap is relevant in the circumstances.</p></speech>

If somebody has had an interpersonal conflict and is engaged in a different procedure in that regard, it may curtail the person in being able to separately make a protected disclosure or vice versa.  I just wanted to address a position where people may wish to pursue a route through human resources relating to an interpersonal conflict but may also, separately, want to make a protected disclosure.  Are we confident the Bill does not create a position where people might feel they have to choose which course to take?</p></speech>

That is if the employer was adamant in shoehorning the new revelation into the grievance procedure.  Again, that is why we say this must be very tightly defined in order to ensure it is merely an interpersonal grievance issue only.  As I stated, there is no obligation on the Oireachtas to even include interpersonal grievance as an exclusion in this legislation.  It is a discretion within the member state to do so.  We share the concern pointed out by the Senator and we want to ensure an interpersonal grievance is exclusively that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#J00400"><p>I have a number of questions.  Some of the topics have already been dealt with so I will delve into some specific areas that have not yet been covered.  In particular, I am interested in whistleblower legislation and the impact it has on protection and the laws applying to the financial services sector.  I am sure our witnesses are familiar with what happened after the collapse of Enron, when the US Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002.  The latter provides for what could be called extensive administrative, criminal and civil provisions, with significant protection for whistleblowers so that employees could disclose information that was mainly about harming investors, especially in dealing with acts of fraud.  It prohibits companies from retaliating against the whistleblowers who provide true information - that is important to note - to authorities regarding potential offences, such as bank fraud.  It also provides that prevailing employees are entitled to reinstatement, back pay with interest and also special damages and legal fee costs.</p> <p>  I have raised this before at committee meetings in different forms.  Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United States, an award programme was created through the Securities and Exchange Commission.  That programme provides awards of between 10% and 30% of funds recovered for information provided by whistleblowers.  Are any of the witnesses familiar with these legislative reforms in the United States relating to whistleblowers that would incentivise employees in coming forward?  There are measures in the financial sector relating to first movers and not being prosecuted when people bring forward information relating to activities in the financial sector.  I am speaking about the incentivisation of employees in coming forward with the type of reward we see in the United States, which is between 10% and 30% of the funds recovered.  How would the witnesses compare these types of provisions to the Irish system?  Is there an opportunity to introduce some of these provisions within the Irish framework for whistleblower protection legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#J00500"><p>I can make a brief contribution on that.  Head 6 of the general scheme outlines specific rules on the reporting of instances of relevant wrongdoing are provided in the sector-specific union acts and those rules should apply.  The Deputy raises a very important context, which is whistleblowing in the financial services sector regarding financial impropriety and a lack of probity in financial matters.  That is probably a greater area that we have not dealt with in the same way as they have in the United States.  It is absolutely open to the Legislature to deal with this important matter in separate legislation and provide incentivised schemes to encourage people to come forward.</p> <p>  It has been pointed out by many Deputies, including Deputy Doherty, that coming forward with information of this nature can be perilous to one's career, financial stability and relations with family members' mental health.  The attraction of an incentivised scheme is that it would really incentivise somebody in going down what is a perilous and difficult road, particularly in areas of financial impropriety, where the gains to the State from recouping where there has been a large degree of impropriety, can also be shared with the person who took the bold move of making the relevant wrongdoing known.  It is a greater project to pass legislation in that area and it is of course a path open to the Legislature.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#J00600"><p>I appreciate that response.  I am not sure if anybody else wants to comment on the matter.  I have some experience with whistleblowers in the financial sector.  There is no incentive for whistleblowing, but it is my firm view that for some of the wrongdoing within the financial sector, somebody on the inside is required to tell the story, or otherwise we cannot get to the crux of the matter.  A financial incentive should be considered in the context of gains that would be recouped to the State from a successful prosecution and the stamping out of the activity in question.</p> <p>  I accompanied a number of whistleblowers to the Central Bank of Ireland a number of years ago.  They were whistleblowers within the moneylending sector.  They were directly employed and blew the whistle about practices in the sector.  That led to the highest ever award being made against a company where a whistleblower had acted, which stretched to hundreds of thousands of euro.  All the individuals who accompanied me to the Central Bank that day to provide that information, which led to the fine, lost their jobs.</p> <p>   What would the witnesses say to somebody in that position?  Does this strengthen their rights or the protections involved?  Is it the reality that no matter what is written on paper, these individuals in the financial sector are taking a risk in coming forward?  There is also another problem because the information may be given to the Central Bank but the bank never communicates afterwards because it the investigation would be life.  The bank will not say if it will prosecute or if it reached an agreement with the entity being investigated.  A whistleblower is left completely in the dark about the progress or outcome of the investigation.  He or she would read about it like any other citizen if a prosecution, administrative sanction or any other sanction is taken by the Central Bank against the entity.</p></speech>

As it stands, the cap is up to five years of financial remuneration under the unfair dismissals legislation.  It is greater than the normal case, which is two years of financial remuneration.</p><p>That is remuneration that is capable of being recouped.</p><p> In a difficult environment where somebody is a whistleblower, there may not be a prospect of him or her being reinstated in the job.  If the employer has created a situation whereby that person has been dismissed, that has not been a supportive environment for him or her to be working in.  I do not think the Workplace Relations Commission would be likely to impose reinstatement in circumstances where, effectively, the employer does not want the person back.  It is capped, therefore, at the five years' remuneration.  Moreover, the Workplace Relations Commission is probably not well equipped to deal with the other sequelae that follow from being a whistleblower, such as the mental hardship that occurs.  It is just not really equipped to deal with those other facilities.</p><p> Nevertheless, the Deputy raises a good point.  This legislation does not really deal with that issue; it just keeps it in place.  There is five years' remuneration, under the unfair dismissals legislation, and that has not been changed or altered by the general scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#K00200"><p>Without getting into the historical issue of that legislation or how other people are employed, the challenge here relates to the fact that moneylender would claim that it does not directly employ the individuals who sell the loans but that they are self-employed and, therefore, not entitled to that type of protection, which leaves a huge gap in respect of somebody coming forward with the information and the protections that could extend to him or her.</p> <p>  The Government's proposed Bill would exempt private sector firms with 50 employees or fewer but an accountancy firm, for example, with fewer than 50 employees could be dealing with significant volumes of funds.  If an employee identified wrongdoing, perhaps in the form of tax abuse or corporate malfeasance, he or she would not enjoy the same protections as public whistleblowers or workers in firms with more than 50 employees.  Will this not create unnecessary risks?</p></speech>

I fully agree that it will create an unnecessary risk.  Obviously, the financial sector is one where there are particular risks.  As for private sector firms in general, in our submission we have suggested that the exemption for private sector companies with fewer than 50 employees should be reversed, given the number of employees who would be actively excluded from protections if that were to be the case.  A large number of private sector employees are employed by companies of fewer than 50 employees. As was mentioned, technology companies constitute another area of particular concern to the ICCL.  We think of Facebook, the Google and organisations like that, but there are many smaller technology companies that have a small number of employees but a large or outsized impact.  Malfeasance and so on in those organisations as well should be called out and channels should be established in that regard.  We are very much in favour of extending the protections to companies with fewer than 50 employees.</p></speech>

The superior courts are always trying to get people to mediate their cases if possible.  That is to be encouraged given, as we have often said, the resources of the courts at present.  The President of the High Court was seeking additional judges because of the significant volume of work that is anticipated in light of the fact there was not much work over the past 18 months.  Mediation is always to be encouraged and, in certain cases in the commercial court, it has to be seen as the first alternative before listing the case for trial.  The Bar of Ireland strongly encourages all sorts of mediation in all sorts of cases.  A protected disclosure case may not always be the sort of case that will be ripe for mediation because of the particular issues that might be involved.  Nevertheless, it should absolutely be encouraged.</p></speech>

They relate to the State itself.  One of our guests mentioned power and authority.  That power and authority is seen to the greatest extent in cases involving the State.  It has the ability to stall the case, destroy an individual or hide the consequences of actions.  It appears to me, from the concerned citizens acting in the public interest who have come forward to date, that all of them have been brutally beaten up by the State.  Have our guests seen anything in the review of this Bill that will deal with such issues?</p> <p>  Without naming names, in cases where a protected disclosure has gone to a Minister, the person making the disclosure would find it very difficult to have it processed.  If a complaint has been made through local government, it is almost the same process.  It is a case of defending at all costs, rubbishing the person making the disclosure and preventing resolution.  That is according to the evidence given to us by Mr. John Wilson, Ms Julie Grace and Mr. Noel McGree.  In fact, in Mr. McGree's case, as the committee heard last week, the Workplace Relations Commission found in his favour but the Department in question still did not pay the person.  How can we ensure such cases will be dealt with firmly and adequately in this new Bill?  Do our guests have suggestions?  Is there another country in whose direction they might point us in order that we could examine its legislation?</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. Herrick, mentioned that whistleblowers are often the enforcers of last resort when it comes to public sector standards and exposing malfeasance, malpractice and so on.</p><p>I believe the point the Chairman is making, which Senator Higgins alluded to previously, is that there is a broader culture in Ireland, which, unfortunately, goes beyond the scope of the proposed Bill, of not being particularly good at accountability or oversight.  We are also not particularly good at equipping regulatory bodies with the resources they need to be able to investigate complaints.  In some ways, it makes sense that Ireland has very strong existing whistleblower protections.  We need them because we do not have a culture of openness and transparency in local or central government.  I know that is a very big point which goes beyond the scope of the proposed Bill but I notice that many of the contributors last week also mentioned it.  There is a cultural issue that the proposed Bill cannot address, but it is something to consider.  I am not sure if anyone else wants to add anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#L00200"><p>I will take Mr. Kennedy up on that point, and I encourage others to contribute.  This proposed Bill is being put forward in the Minister's name, but it was, by and large, written by civil servants.  These are the very same civil servants who set out to protect the State at all costs, using taxpayers' money, and to vilify the person making the protected disclosure.  In trying to get the best out of this proposed Bill and force open that culture of secrecy, which is a bad culture which is alive and well within the Civil Service and the public service, we have to reach out to people like the witnesses to give us a reasonable steer on how we might address the issues that have confronted us as legislators and those who have made a protected disclosure in the past to give them the best chance to have their case heard.  If we do not get the information from outside of these Houses, we are going to be landed with legislation that will be stacked against whistleblowers.  We have had whistleblowers before the committee.  I have given their names.  There are many examples.  The biggest example is, of course, Maurice McCabe.  Is there anywhere the witnesses can direct us to, or is there anything they can advise us to research, to strengthen this Bill beyond where it is currently to give a better chance to whistleblowers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#L00300"><p>I can speak to that as chief executive of the MHC.  I have been a regulator for many years, regulating State bodies in the health sector, the charities sectors and, now, the mental health sector.  I have also encountered many private businesses that worked in the charitable sector such as accountants, financial professionals and so on.  The protections in the general scheme for people who blow the whistle are key.  I am talking about protections for ordinary citizens to allow them to identify relevant wrongdoing.  Many of the acts of wrongdoing listed in the general scheme are criminal offences.  The idea is that if a good citizen spots a criminal offence or wrongdoing, they should be able to come forward.  The reason we are bringing in this proposed Bill is that most people do not seem able to just go to the Garda.  We are trying to protect them because they are within a big construct.</p> <p>  With regard to public service bodies, there is a misconception about what protecting the State means.  Many people seem to think that protecting the State means protecting politicians.  It is about ensuring that our Constitution and our laws are adhered to.  I will pass over to my colleagues soon but I genuinely believe that an independent office is required to support this culture of transparency and openness.  You can protect the recipients but we should add in the ability to publish the reports.  If bodies act glacially and are not prepared to meet the law, offences could be introduced.  We could be a little bit more robust in that way.  It is really just a recognition.  We have to understand that, in fairness, Ireland is changing but the bottom line is that people with power do not necessarily want people without power telling them they are doing things wrong.  It all comes back to relevant wrongdoing.  Offences are listed here so that we can protect our citizens, good decent working people, and allow these actions to come out into the open.  It is a strengthening of the proposed Bill with regard to oversight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#L00400"><p>I will be brief because I see a number of people wanting to get in.  Consideration may need to be given to the issue of anonymous complaints and there being an obligation to deal with them subject to certain criteria.  That appears to be a stumbling block, as we have seen from Transparency International Ireland.  That is one thing I would ask the committee to look at.</p> <p>  While the proposed Bill refers to supports, it is not entirely clear as to what these are.  Those supports should be set out clearly and should move to the new office.  I emphasise that these supports are important because supports should be given to people at an early stage so that they do not end up in difficulty with their employers.  These people should be appropriately advised so that they never end up in litigation or getting fired, as Deputy Doherty said.</p> <p>  The lack of data, which a number of members have mentioned, is another issue.  There is a requirement to report in the Bill.  Each public body has to report certain matters in its annual report.  I should say that, when I did this section of the commission's annual report a number of years ago, I was taken aback by how little information was requested.  At the time, we did not have a protected disclosure but additional elements could be included to increase the reporting requirements on public bodies.  That should be relatively easy to do.  The additional data that is desired should be set out in the legislation.  The private bodies with more than 50 employees should also be subject to this and should face reporting requirements.  Those requirements could be linked to annual reports or financial reports.  Perhaps consideration needs to be given to penalising public bodies where a recipient's name is disclosed and to how that is deal with.  That is quite a significant step to take and a major consideration but, if we want to balance the playing field for the parties involved, that may need to be considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#L00500"><p>I will put another question to the witnesses.  This is again based on a real example of someone who made a protected disclosure.  I am again asking how we can deal with this issue.  It was mentioned that a person making a protected disclosure was named.  That person was named at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I assume a law has been broken.  The president of a newly formed technological university refused to meet to try to resolve the issue raised by a particular whistleblower.  We have had nothing but stonewalling of the process of dealing with a protected disclosure by the same entity.  It is interesting that Ms Keane has put forward the opinion that there should be sanctions.  Should those sanctions be directed towards individuals because in Ireland we tend to blame and hide behind the entity?  We do not like to blame the person who has actually broken the law or who is preventing the law from being implemented.  This affects everything from the Garda to universities to Departments.  The process of dealing with most of the outstanding protected disclosures that I have seen is being hindered by senior civil servants.</p><p>In the context of addressing that in the proposed Bill, what suggestions do the witnesses have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#M00200"><p>If we are finding that this is operating at the senior public service level and senior political level, then we have got the process wrong.  The process should be happening at the level where the ordinary individual is finding out where the relevant wrongdoing is happening.  If one thinks of the Oireachtas, one thinks of the Ministers and the civil servants, policy directions and legislation.  Where someone is finding a relevant wrongdoing, where there may have been an offence, that is getting the structure right within the organisation, the checks and balances.  What the Chairman refers to is probably desperation on someone's part because the system is not working for them at the appropriate level.  I would question the idea that we are protecting one person, or as the Chairman put it, blaming individuals because if we go down the route of blaming, we will not get the just culture or the necessary change.  People who are significant wrongdoers over the years are often intelligent, tactical and capable of gaming the system.  What we want to see is an institutional approach that creates transparency and accountability.  The Chairman referred to different entities which may be legal constructs like companies or charities, for example, which will have individual trustees and directors.  There are laws in place to enable them, if there is wrongdoing or a potential criminal offence, to put systems in place to deal with that.  Most people are reasonable and decent.  We are trying to get structures in place so that the person who is doing wrong is not given a competitive edge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#M00300"><p>In terms of the experience to date, if one asks most whistleblowers if they would do it again, without hesitation they will say "No" because their families have been destroyed, they have been destroyed, their careers and their mental health have been destroyed while what they reported, particularly within Government agencies, is still ongoing.  That is a terribly bad example to set.  We have to find ways, within this proposed Bill, of dealing with these issues so that they do not continue to go on.  It is not easy for us, as I have said, because the paperwork and legislation is drawn up, in the main, by civil servants.  I ask the witnesses to reflect on what they have said to us today and on the conversation we have had, which has been very good and very constructive.  I urge them to reflect on the issues we have raised to see if they would like to make any further comments or written submissions.  I direct that comment to each of our witnesses because I found their contributions today very helpful.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins has asked that the witnesses respond in more detail to some of her questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#M00400"><p>I wish to respond to the Chairman's comments and then deal with what Senator Higgins had to say.  The Chairman has provided a very important context for the negative experience of whistleblowers in many areas in recent years.  In our view, there is a limit to what can be achieved by the legislation before us.  That said, our recommendations and the recommendations of all other contributors point out that there is an opportunity for this committee and for the Oireachtas to ensure that we broaden the range of persons who can make protected disclosures and to make provision for important strengthening measures <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the protections once people have made disclosures.  There are practical steps that can be taken but, ultimately, there is a question here of political will.  As has been noted in some of the submissions, we have had a troubling experience to date.  Even at the level of reporting on the procedures and policies that public bodies are obliged to have in place, the record of providing that procedural, meta-information has been very poor.  Perhaps that is something that this committee and the Oireachtas could take up in terms of holding those bodies to account on their failure to report.<br/><br/>Finally, we must also anticipate the role of the protected disclosures office and this goes to a question raised by Senator Higgins.  We have to be realistic about how much can be achieved by this office in the early period.  It will take time to be established and properly resourced but potentially, it should be playing the role that Senator Higgins talked about in terms of identifying patterns so that we can proactively and positively identify where in the system there are particular problems and target those areas for proactive action.  That is what we would like to get to but without the political will and resources, it will take time to get to that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021092900002#M00500"><p>Senator Higgins raised a number of queries.  My colleague, Mr. Clarke, dealt with some of them very eloquently, but there are two points to which I would like to respond.  The first relates to data.  It is a concern to everybody here that we do not have any data, given that the Act dates from 2014.  In response to one of the other questions, very simply, head 26 could be amended to increase the information that needs to be reported back.  If there was also some sort of reporting obligation on all private bodies, of plus and fewer than 50 employees, then very quickly the new office could create data.  It could also be data that is available to the public when they click onto an entity's website.  The first thing to do is put the onus on individual organisation to disclose more of the information and one of those things could be, if it has not progressed a protected disclosure, the reasons it did not do so.</p> <p>  The second issue the Senator raised was a lack of communication.  In a previous life, I advised review teams in the context of investigations in the HSE and other organisations.  One of the things I always said to them at the outset was that they should keep open a line of communication with the family, patient or individual who raised the issue being investigated.  While as lawyers, there may be issues at times that they cannot disclose, that does not mean that they cannot continue to communicate.  I told them that they should set out timeframes for when they will communicate with the person, when they think certain things will be done and addressed and if they do not meet those deadlines, they should send a short letter to explain why.  That is the minimum level of respect required and it is a matter of respect for the people making protected disclosures.  It is crucial that this would appear in any code of practice that is issued.  I would expect that as a minimum any public organisation that is dealing with a person who has made a protected disclosure would communicate with them regularly.  It may not be obliged or even be in a position to tell the person anything but it could provide progress reports.  People like to be told, even if what they are being told is that the report is not complete.  They like to be told that it is not complete because there is a need to speak to another witness or because more documentation has been received, for example.  People like to be kept in the loop and it is a matter of respect to do so.  It is incumbent on all in the public sector to uphold the right to respect.</p></speech>

To put cannabis in context, it is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  It is, therefore, subject to strict levels of control and access is allowed under licence for limited purposes only.</p> <p>  As the name would indicate, the purpose of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP, is to enable access to a controlled substance which otherwise would not be legally available to patients.  In this case the controlled substance is tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, a psychoactive derivative of cannabis.  Cannabidiol, known as CBD, another extract of cannabis, is not of itself a controlled substance and the MCAP is not intended as a means of accessing CBD-based products.  The ministerial licence programme, in operation since 2017, is similar in that it enables, with the support of a consultant, a GP to prescribe cannabis-based products where the patient is regularly monitored by a consultant.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in recent years, in both Ireland and abroad, the subject of using cannabis products for medical reasons has become an issue of social and political debate, with calls for cannabis products to be made available to Irish patients.  Owing to this increasing interest, in December 2016, the Minister for Health requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, to provide scientific advice on the use of cannabis for medical purposes.  Our colleagues in the HPRA will be able to elucidate further their findings in this review.  Following publication of this HPRA report, the Minister for Health established an expert reference group to provide clinical guidelines for the development of a medical cannabis access programme.</p> <p>  Acknowledging that some time has passed since the last review of the clinical evidence supporting the use of cannabis for medical reasons was done, the Department is currently working to commence a new clinical review that will continue the work of the previous clinical expert group.  This review will seek to build on evidence found in the earlier study and will assess if there is new information to support the addition of any other clinical indications to the MCAP.</p> <p>  Following the recommendations of the HPRA review in 2017, and importantly the subsequent clinical guidance, the Department commenced work on developing a legislative basis for an access programme.  This was done in consultation with the HPRA, and representatives from the expert reference group, and in June 2019 the legislation was enacted.</p> <p>  The SI 262 of 2109, the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019, sets out the legal provisions for the operation of the medical cannabis access programme and the legal obligations for healthcare professionals and commercial operators.  It also sets out how the access programme will work, who can avail of it, how it will be operated by the HSE and how cannabis-based products, made from whole dried flowers of the plant, are accepted for use under the programme and placed on Schedule 1 of the regulation's statutory instrument.  It is a pilot programme for five years and may be extended for a further period.</p> <p>  My colleagues from the HPRA can assist the committee with questions on the process leading to inclusion of a product on the schedule for use under the MCAP.  It is the Minister for Health who ultimately decides if a product goes on the Schedule.  However, it is the sole responsibility of the supplier to apply to be considered for inclusion on the MCAP.  There are currently four cannabis products on the Schedule and two more are to be added to Schedule 1 of the regulations in the coming weeks.  I understand that one of the products on the schedule, namely, Cannepil, is expected to be available in October.</p> <p>  Subsequent to the introduction of the necessary legislation the Department has been working with the HSE, which will, pursuant to the requirements of the statutory instrument, operate the register of consultants and patients who will access the programme.  This engagement culminated in the MCAP being made part of the HSE delivery plan for 2021.  In July, it was announced that the HSE was ready to accept registrations of clinicians and their patients as required under the regulations.  Our colleagues from the HSE will be able to advise on how the MCAP will operate in practice.</p> <p>  On the ministerial licence programme, to meet the clinical demand for medical cannabis prior to establishment of the MCAP, the Minister for Health initiated in 2017 a programme whereby licences, granted under section 14 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, can be issued to practitioners on behalf of patients where the clinician could prescribe, import, possess, supply and administer the controlled substance listed in the licence.  A detailed application is required from the clinician describing the indication the patient has, the fact that all other medications, meds, have been exhausted or are no longer adding value to the quality of life of the patient, and advising that the clinician is prepared to prescribe cannabis oils and monitor his or her patient while using such products.</p> <p>  Such applications must also comply with recommendations made by the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, who advised that the granting of an individual licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act for the use of cannabis for medical purposes by the Minister for Health sets aside the usual regulatory processes which are in place to protect the public and which ensure that only those medications which have been found to be both effective and safe are made available to the public.</p> <p>  Therefore, it is crucial that the granting of any such licence takes due care and consideration of the potential unintended consequences associated with the prescription of cannabis, a Schedule 1 controlled drug, for medical purposes, and that its use is endorsed by a consultant who is familiar with and responsible for the care of the individual for whom the licence application is being made.  The CMO also noted that the independence of the doctor-patient relationship is a fundamental principle upon which medical practice is based and that it would be neither appropriate nor ethical for the Minister for Health to seek to influence this relationship.</p> <p>  Currently 192 licences have been issued in respect of 67 patients.  The products prescribed are all sourced from a pharmacy in The Hague, called Transvaal Apotheek.  The products are compounded by the pharmacy itself.  Transvaal is a well-established good manufacturing practices, GMP, facility and is a reliable supply chain for clinicians and their patients.  The Netherlands authorities, however, do not allow the export of cannabis oils from the Netherlands to wholesalers or pharmacies, but they allow individual prescriptions to be dispensed.  Owing to the Dutch authorities' restrictions in this regard, it is not open to the manufacturers of those cannabis-based products to apply to the HPRA to have their products included in Schedule 1 of the regulations.</p> <p>  With that in mind, representations were made by the Minister for Health to the Dutch authorities to request that the products could be commercially imported for inclusion on the MCAP.</p><p>The Dutch authorities, however, stated, "magistral preparations may only be provided directly to patients or their representative on the basis of a prescription".  Notwithstanding this, patients who are currently being treated with these products can continue to access them under the ministerial licence issued to their clinicians.</p><p> Due to Covid-related travel restrictions, in May 2020 the Department of Health put in place a courier system to facilitate the collection of products from the Netherlands for delivery directly to patients' homes.  A decision has been made to retain this method of supply for patients accessing cannabis-based products in this way.  Additionally, in July of this year, a direct funding scheme for eligible patients was commenced between the HSE and the dispensing pharmacy in the Netherlands.  The pharmacy now directly invoices the HSE and this removes the need for eligible patients or their families to pay for products upfront and subsequently seek reimbursement.</p><p> I hope I have given you an overview of the MCAP and the ministerial licence arrangements.  My colleagues from the HSE will speak on the operation of the MCAP and address any reimbursement questions members may have, while my colleagues from HPRA will discuss how products are accepted for entry onto the MCAP.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021092900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to meet the committee to discuss the medical cannabis access programme.  I am joined by Professor Bryan Lynch, a consultant paediatric neurologist based in Temple Street Children's University Hospital, who will have a clinical perspective on the issues to be discussed.  Members will be aware the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, is responsible for ensuring that eligibility is in place for qualifying persons for most of the primary care schemes and other arrangements within the health service, while PCRS is also generally responsible for making payments of the order of &euro;3.269 billion to primary care healthcare practitioners and HSE acute hospitals.<br/><br/>As Mr. O'Connor stated, under the HSE national service plan in 2021, PCRS was given responsibility, on behalf of the HSE, to manage the medicinal cannabis access programme, subject to the availability of suitable products, and, as part of that, to establish arrangements to approve their use in relevant cases and record relevant information on the register, as provided for in the legislation.  PCRS also has the responsibility to consider, pursuant to the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, applications for pricing and requests for reimbursement of MCAP products for individual patients.  Currently, three specific therapeutic indications are set out in a Schedule to the misuse of drugs regulations 2019.  I will not go through them because the committee will be aware of them.<br/><br/>On the operation of the register, a practitioner, who has to be a medical consultant, can issue a prescription for an MCAP product only where an individual's name has been entered into the register and what is called a cannabis for medical use register, CMUR, number will have been provided by the HSE in respect of that individual.  Medical consultants are required, therefore, to provide the HSE with the following information before they issue a first prescription: the name, address, date of birth and specified therapeutic indication for the person being treated, that is, which of the three currently approved uses under the MCAP the person will be treated for; the name, registration number and medical specialty of the notifying consultant; and such additional information as the HSE may require.<br/><br/>A person supplying a specified control drug, such as pharmacist or a pharmacy, is required to provide his or her name and address to the HSE; the name and address of the person who supplied him or her; and the following details from the prescription: the date on which supply was made; the name, quantity and, where appropriate, the dosage form and strength of the product; the dose supplied; the name and registration number of the consultant prescriber; the CMUR number, name and address of the person who received the prescription; and the date of the prescription.  Finally, within the legislation, there is a requirement to provide any further information required by the HSE.  The HSE is then required to record all this information on the MCAP register and assign CMUR numbers as required.  The HSE is required to preserve all the information on the register for at least five years from receipt.<br/><br/>Turning to supply, Schedule 1 to the misuse of drugs (prescription and control of supply for medical use regulations) 2019, as amended, sets out the products that can, subject to availability, be supplied under the MCAP.  As Mr. O'Connor stated, four products are currently listed in Schedule 1.  The HSE does not decide which products are included in Schedule 1; it is a ministerial function.  At this point, the suppliers of two products, namely, Cannepil and Tilray oral solution, have submitted final pricing positions to the HSE and the HSE confirmed acceptance of those prices in writing to the suppliers in June 2021.  The HSE expects that one product, Cannepil, will become available during October 2021.  The suppliers of the second product, Tilray oral solution, have indicated their intention to supply the Irish market but, to date, have not confirmed when the product will be available.  The HSE understands that the supplier of the other two products does not currently have plans to supply the Irish market.<br/><br/>In making general decisions on reimbursement, the HSE is required, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to consider nine criteria set out in the legislation.  It is required to consider the health needs of the public; cost effectiveness; the availability and supply of items for supply and reimbursement; the proposed costs, benefits and risks of an item, relative to therapeutically similar items, and the level of certainty in respect of those costs, benefits and risks; the budget impact; the clinical need for the item; the appropriate level of clinical supervision required to ensure patient safety; the efficacy, which means the product's performance in clinical trials, and effectiveness, which means performance in real circumstances and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment; and the resources available to the HSE.<br/><br/>The Department has previously advised the HSE that it considers that section 23 of the health Act 2013 appeared to be the most suitable legislative option for reimbursement on a managed access basis of community supply of the MCAP products.  That section allows the HSE discretion, subject to such conditions it considers appropriate, to make arrangements to supply an item to a patient notwithstanding that the item is not normally reimbursed, provided that the HSE is satisfied the patient requires the item for clinical reasons and that no reimbursed item is a suitable alternative for the patient.  The intent of the HSE, therefore, is to utilise section 23 to enable the reimbursement of MCAP products where appropriate.<br/><br/>In practical terms, the HSE has designed an application form for prescribers to register a person to be treated.  This form will include all the information required to register an individual on the MCAP.  The HSE will then assign a CMUR number and provide the applicant prescriber with a specific, <i>pro forma</i>prescription form for the MCAP that will contain all the information legally required, including the relevant CMUR number for the operation of the MCAP.<br/><br/>We welcome any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

In setting the context for our discussion, it is important to be clear on the status of the products that may be considered under this access programme, what they are and, importantly, what they are not.</p> <p>  In doing so, it may be helpful to return to some key aspects of the HPRA's 2017 review.  The review considered the scientific data available at the time in respect of medical use of cannabis, which was very limited and fell well short of the standard required for a medicine to receive market access.  The review concluded that, from a policy perspective, should the Minister consider it in society's interest to establish a cannabis access programme, it should be in a limited set of circumstances for three specified medical conditions where it can be considered.  The committee will be familiar with these.</p> <p>  A key recommendation for the programme was that would need to take into account that access should be provided only where patients with the specified conditions have a clear unmet clinical need, meaning they have failed to respond to treatment with all available authorised medicines.  These limited recommendations were also based on the fact the safety and efficacy data available did not support a wider form of access.</p> <p>  The report also advised that cannabis-based products that may be available through such a programme should not be confused with authorised medicines and are not equivalent to them.  Authorised medicines undergo comprehensive clinical and quality evaluation, including clinical trials, to assess their safety and efficacy.  The data generated from these studies are reviewed by scientists and companies to determine whether there is a positive benefit-risk ratio, and if so, these data are submitted as part of an application for marketing authorisation.</p><p>The application is then reviewed by medicines regulators, such as the HPRA, to establish if they agree with the conclusion of the benefit-risk assessment.  Where this is the case, the medicine is authorised.</p><p> Not meaning to detract from the focus on cannabis, something perhaps the pandemic has shown in a very real way is how this process for authorisation of medicines works in practice.  It has also increased the public understanding, appreciation and value of this process.</p><p> As the committee members are aware, there are two cannabis-based products that are authorised as medicines.  These are Sativex oromucosal spray for the treatment of spasticity in MS and Epidyolex oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome or tuberous sclerosis complex.  Both products have met the standards and level of data required to receive a marketing authorisation.  As such, these are quite distinct and do not fall under the scope of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP.</p><p> Provision for the MCAP was made under regulations developed by the Department of Health in 2019.  These set out how the programme operates in terms of prescribing, supply to patients and subsequent patient monitoring.  They also define the criteria a cannabis-based product must meet in order to be considered for inclusion.  The regulations, importantly, are supported by clinical guidance that was generated by an expert reference group convened by the Department of Health in 2017.  This publicly available guidance underpins the introduction of the access programme.  It also highlights a very important point around the decision to enrol a patient in the MCAP, which is that the relationship between the patient and the doctor is paramount in terms of clinical oversight.  That clinical oversight allows for consideration of critical issues, such as disease progression, whether all conventional treatment options with authorised medicines have been exhausted and the doctor&rsquo;s decision as to whether these products may then be a suitable option for their patient.</p><p> The role of the HPRA in the MCAP is quite distinct and different from the role that we have with respect to the authorisation of medicines.  While we receive and review applications from companies seeking to supply cannabis-based products in Ireland via the programme, the extent and nature of this is very different in terms of review.  It involves initially reviewing the product applications against the criteria set out in the regulations.  The key requirement for accepting a product onto the programme is that it must be approved for supply in another EU member state and is being supplied in that state.  This is a way of providing access for Irish patients to cannabis-based products that are available to other EU patients and that could previously only be obtained by travelling out of the State.  It acknowledges the reviews performed by other member states and does not seek to create additional barriers where these reviews have already been conducted.  Other requirements are that the tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, limits are not exceeded and that the packaging and labelling is sufficient in terms of detail to support safe and effective dosing and product use.  It is also our role to ensure that the products are aligned with the published clinical guidance.</p><p> When our review is complete, we make a recommendation to the Minister where an application meets all of the above criteria.  The final decision as to whether or not the product is included on the MCAP rests with the Minister.  It is important to note, as per the criteria in the regulations and the overarching principle of the clinical guidance, that applications can only be made under the MCAP where an equivalent authorised cannabis-based medicine is not available.</p><p> Since the regulations came into force in June 2019, we have received 34 product applications.  Of these, four cannabis-based oils have been placed in Schedule 1 of the regulations and two dried herb products have concluded the HPRA final review and are with the Minister for his final decision.  Five are currently under active review.  In addition, 11 have been withdrawn or paused by the applicant company itself.  In the case of the remaining 12 applications, the company has not met either the legislative criteria or the clinical guidelines, and these have been placed on hold by the HPRA as a result.  We are continuing to work with a cohort of these companies on these issues.</p><p> The HPRA provides significant support to prospective applicants through guidance on both the legal framework and the product criteria to be met in advance of submission of an application.  In all cases, we have direct meetings with these companies to advise and support their applications.  The provision of this support also continues throughout the application review process.  The first cannabis-based products are expected to be available to Irish patients through the MCAP from mid-October 2021, as outlined by other colleagues.  Once these are accessed by Irish patients, the HPRA will receive any reports of suspected adverse events and review them for any signals of concern regarding the safety of the products.  The HPRA will also have a role in investigating any quality issues that may arise and co-ordinating any action that might be subsequently required.  I am very happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I thank our witnesses for coming before the committee and for the detail given in their submissions.  It is hugely important in respect of an issue of this nature that adequate information is made available and that the integrity of the treatment is protected.</p> <p>  The benefit-risk assessment carried out has been fairly thorough.  Are the witnesses satisfied that it is sufficiently firewalled and that the products are sufficiently firewalled within the system to ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands or that access is not given to those who should not have them - in other words, that they are strictly for medicinal purposes by the authorised people?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The next question is in regard to reimbursement.  Are we satisfied that the reimbursement system is sufficiently responsive and active in its dealings with the patients?</p> <p>  My third question is in regard to the patients deemed to be in need.  I know there were 34 applications and I got the information in regard to the volumes so far.  Are the witnesses satisfied that the patients who are deemed to be in need, and who will benefit from access to the treatment, are getting access in sufficient time?  In other words, is there sufficient access without there being a danger of damaging the integrity of the whole process?  Those are my three questions.</p></speech>

The other two questions seem to be the different sides of benefit-risk, namely, whether we are allowing sufficient access where it is beneficial and whether we are managing the risk of it leaking beyond the programme as intended.  I will bring in my own colleague on that and perhaps the HPRA will want to say something about it.  I ask Mr. Flanagan to start on the reimbursement aspects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021092900002#C00600"><p>On reimbursement, the MCAP has not started yet because there has not been a product.  The MCAP is due to start in the next few weeks.  We expect reimbursement will be reasonably seamless under the MCAP because we have an approved product and an application system will be in place.  Therefore, on the MCAP, that is probably going to be okay.  I have no idea of the volume, scale or the numbers, but we have sufficient staff to be able to deal with large volumes or small volumes, whichever it is, and we will flex our staffing as needed from other teams.</p> <p>  Obviously, the licences are somewhat different in that they come in one by one, and they come from the Department.  While that is not quite as seamless a process because it is an individual single approval for those products, we are doing our best to be as responsive as we can on those and the various arrangements have been put in place, including direct payment mechanisms.</p> <p>  Excuse me, is there an IT problem?</p></speech>

The other thing that has changed over the period of the introduction of the MCAP is that for one of the areas in particular, the epilepsy area, at the time that the MCAP was proposed, there was no medicine approved or authorised in the market.  As Dr. Nolan said, there is now a medicine that is market authorised.  The HSE obviously has a process around new medicines and how those are assessed, and that process is ongoing.</p><p>We are now at the stage when the health assessment is completed.  Commercial negotiations are ongoing with the company.  That is not part of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP, as it is a licensed medicine.  It is a separate medicine but some of the patients will in due course be covered, assuming it might be reimbursed.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.421" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021092900002#D00200"><p>I can come in on the Deputy's question about the risk of illegal access.  Those risks are very carefully managed and controlled within the programme.  Mr. Flanagan and Dr. Nolan spoke about the specificity about who receives the cannabis-based products and the clear clinical need identified by a medial professional that is required.  The doctor-patient relationship is at the heart of the management of the treatment.</p> <p>  Benefit-risk analyses feed into the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, assessment of drugs.  Such an analysis did inform the restriction of availability and a number of conditions at an earlier point.  I will ask Dr. Nolan to speak a little more to be benefit-risk analysis and how that works.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.422" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021092900002#D00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question, which is obviously a pertinent one in the context of the role we have.  He is absolutely right that these MCAP products are not medicines in the conventional sense in which he and I would understand that word.  The extent of the data behind these products is limited and I have been clear in that regard.  We are, however, satisfied.  What is here is in line with the recommendations we made in 2017.  This is a very limited form of access for those three specified conditions.  The cascade and progression to treatment under MCAP are important.  These patients must have exhausted all of the available options so that when they are granted access to MCAP, there is a clear unmet need for those patients.  In that context, there are different considerations regarding benefit and risk.  We are satisfied with the programme.</p> <p>  There is a little bit of overlap between the benefit and risk at the individual patient level and the control of the system.  In line with the clinical guidance to which I have referred, every time a patient is put onto the MCAP programme, it must be initiated by a consultant.  The enrolment process has been outlined.  A treatment programme must then be put into the medical record of each patient.  That sets out the background to the decision to introduce the patient onto the programme and includes the product and dosage that are going to be used.  It is important that there is an agreement on what the expected outcome should be in terms of improvement.  Actual measurements are put in place.  There is a monitoring plan for the patient.  Patients are monitored at regular intervals to ensure that those improvements are being realised.</p> <p>  The overriding principle is that anybody who starts on one of these products starts low and goes slow.  The dosage starts at the lowest level and is worked upwards.  If the measurements I have spoken about are not met, there is also a work-down.  The treatment can be stopped.  It is an individualised programme that is supervised at an appropriate medical level, which is part of the control system.  I do not want to overlap with what Mr. O'Connor already said.  These substances are controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation and there is an additional tracking system.  For example, if a wholesaler is bringing in stocks that must be held for onward supply to patients, a separate licensing system tracks them.  A reconciliation process is done on the amounts that come in, are used and are in stock.  The HPRA has a role in monitoring that as well.  There are many levels of control across the system to prevent leakage.  From the benefit-risk point of view, it comes down to an individual patient decision, closely supervised by a doctor.</p></speech>

The CannEpil product will be available from mid-October.  I see Mr. Flanagan wants to come in.  I understand the other product is Tilray.</p></speech>

Of those products that have been placed on Schedule 1, and I know there was reference to this issue in his opening statement, does he anticipate that only one will be available this year?</p></speech>

There are four products listed on Schedule 1 as we speak.  We have engaged with all four of those companies.  Two of the companies were interested enough to put forward pricing positions.  One of the companies, which has two products, was not interested in putting forward a pricing position.  Of the two companies for which we have approved pricing, one has confirmed it will launch this year and we are awaiting confirmation from the second.</p></speech>

The minute products are on the Schedule, we will engage with the suppliers.  There are four products on the Schedule and we have engaged with the supplier of each.  Of those four, all I can tell the committee is that for two products, the supplier has stated it is not interested in entering the Irish market even though it went through the process.  Two other suppliers have stated they are interested.  One of those has confirmed October as its launch date and we are awaiting a date from the other.  We will not know more until other products are added to Schedule 1 and we engage with those companies.</p></speech>

Mr. Flanagan may be unable to say definitively what might happen next year.  We are holding a hearing here today to try to get as much information as possible for the public.  Is it fair to say that the best I can tell people if I am asked is that there is potential for six products to be placed on Schedule 1?  In the best case scenario, one of them will be available to patients under the scheme this year.  There is a possibility of another being added next year but we do not know.  Based on what Mr. Flanagan is saying, I would imagine that the best case scenario would be that two products are available under the scheme next year, if that many.  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

It is important to flag that since the legislation was published, there has been a significant change in the market, in that there is now a licensed medicine, Epidiolex, for epilepsy indication.  It is going through the standard HSE medicines pricing and assessment process.</p><p>In other words, a licensed medicine very similar to the CannEpil product is going through the pricing and reimbursement process.  I cannot give any guarantee because I cannot make a decision until the process is complete.  If it gets to the reimbursement list, it will obviously have an impact on the number of patients who might use the MCAP in the epilepsy indication in particular.</p></speech>

Epidiolex is important for epilepsy patients.  I know it has been licensed and is going through the reimbursement process.  I hope it will be successful and make a difference.  I am trying to get a sense of how successful this programme will be.  If there is only going to be one product this year we do not know how many products will be available next year.  Mr. Flanagan said some modelling has been done but we do not really know how many of these products will be prescribed to patients.  At this point it is hard to get a handle on how successful the MCAP programme will be.  I would have imagined it was anticipated that more products would have been online by now and more products would have been not just on the Schedule but available for prescription.  Is it fair to say it is a bit disappointing that for whatever reason, and obviously it is down to the companies themselves that have to engage, only one product will be available as a start for a programme as important as this is?  We do not know how many products will be available next year and we do not know how many patients will be prescribed the drug this year or next year.  This is not painting a good picture.  There is not much information, it would seem, that I can give to the public or that will be given to the public arising from this session.</p></speech>

Those patients would probably have been on the MCAP.  This information is from the health technology assessments on Epidiolex which I have seen.  I am a member of the HSE drugs group and I am required to review all of the information.  Roughly from memory, and I do not have it in front of me, but it is of an estimate of 300 patients per annum who might benefit from Epidiolex if it were reimbursed.  In the absence of Epidiolex all of those patients would be expected to come through the MCAP.  I hear the criticism of the MCAP but against it the world has somewhat changed.  We are all agreed, and I am not an expert on safety, quality and efficacy as that is more Dr. Nolan's role, that if there is a licensed medicine the preference would be that it would be the mechanism used, provided the HSE can agree pricing and reimbursement terms with the company.  This changes the picture from where we were when the MCAP was contemplated.  I should also-----</p></speech>

This would suggest a decision on reimbursement would be made late this year or early next year.  I cannot indicate whether the decision will be "Yes" or "No" because I cannot get ahead of the decision-making process of the HSE, particularly given that I am a member of the drugs group.</p></speech>

I say again this is something that has to be done.  I know there is a process but we need to look at the process.  The drug approval process needs to be overhauled.  It will go to the drugs group which will have to do its work.  As Mr. Flanagan said, it will be sometime next year, and we do not know when, before a decision will be made on it.  We are still some time away from a decision being made on it.  This is brings us back to MCAP, which is one drug and one product this year.  We do not know about next year and we do not know how many patients will be able to benefit from the process.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Nolan on an issue that keeps arising.  This is with regard to CBD products that have a trace of THC.  It goes back to a European court ruling on this matter regarding traces of less than 0.2%.  This comes from companies that sell these products which I am sure lobby all members on a regular basis.  Their shops are raided.  They say the products they sell have minimal traces of THC in line with the European court judgment.  Will Dr. Nolan talk us through what the state of play is?  According to one of the opening statements, it is currently unclear whether CBD-only products that contain only trace elements of THC can be processed for inclusion in the MCAP as per existing legislation.  There seems to be confusion about this and we need clarity.  When are we likely to see some clarity?  Is it something the courts will have to decide or is it something the political system can decide?</p></speech>

I will refer to the last question first.  The experience of Ireland on a medicinal cannabis access programme is not that different from any European country.  We followed closely the progression of the system in Denmark where to date only four products are included in its MCAP.  We are certainly not out of kilter.  At the end of the day, it is up to the companies to make the applications to us.  It is up to the companies to meet the requirement that the legislation has set out.  The regulations removed all regulatory burdens.  The system has a low regulatory burden and I do not use the term fruitlessly.  I want the Deputy to understand that at the end of the day the companies control whether or not something is placed on the market.  I totally stand over everything Mr. Flanagan said.  The availability of a licensed medicine is the best treatment option that can be given to any patient.  The fact we now have Epidiolex which is a CBD-only product has really changed the landscape.</p> <p>  The question on the thresholds is a very good one.  I need to be clear it is a policy area, so I am aware I am probably speaking on the Deputy's area but I am happy to do so and he can stop me if he wants to intervene at any point.  Under the misuse of drugs legislation, by definition any product that contains THC, whether or not at trace level, is a controlled substance.  This is the bottom line.  The legislation is this clear-cut.  The misuse of drugs legislation was put in place in the 1970s prior to the evolution of a hemp industry, if we want to call it that.  The situation has moved on.  We would also have to look at whether THC is having a pharmacological action if it is in there at those levels.  It probably it is not because it is such a trace level.  The policy in this area is complicated and it is not an easy thing to fix.  It has knock-ons in the criminal justice system.  When the garda&iacute; are making street detentions, how can they can tell the difference between cannabis with no THC and cannabis that has THC?  It is not a simple matter of changing the policy because it has an awful lot of consequences.  This is something the Department is considering.  Strictly speaking, they are products that contain THC and there are no thresholds in our legislation.  This means they would be eligible for inclusion in the MCAP.</p></speech>

It is one of the most comprehensive presentations I have had the pleasure of listening to.  Almost all of the questions one could ask have been answered.  We have had the background to this, the international comparisons, the number of products, how the product is regulated, dealing with the companies, the review that took place, the consciousness that the review took place some time ago and there is now a further parallel review, and international best practice.</p> <p>  The reason I say all of this is that the previous speaker sounded a little bit disappointed that there are not more products on the shelves whereas the witnesses have made it very clear that the approach to this is very scientifically grounded.  I always fear that people like to polarise this debate and that if people are not in favour of this they are somehow conservative and backwoods people who do not appreciate or realise the impact they are having on the quality of life of people.  This is notwithstanding the very passionate pleas made through the years and the efficacy of some of the products.  People on the other side of the argument are then portrayed as somehow progressive and enlightened and as wanting to enable people to break free from the shackles of terribly tedious illnesses.  I am in the middle.  The witnesses have answered many of the questions I had.</p> <p>  I have a couple of short questions.</p><p>Denmark has four products.  We are not so much taking our leave from it as casting an eye to the Danish model.  It has just four products.  Is it consultants who prescribe in Denmark, and how long have they been in a position to do so?  I want short answers to these first few questions, please.</p></speech>

I cannot clarify for the Deputy whether it is initiated by a consultant in Denmark.  There are other HPRA colleagues on the call and one of them, perhaps Ms Farrell, may know.

I will move to my next question.  I apologise because we always come across as rude.  If the witnesses were here in person they would see we are smiling away but it is just about the time.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify something from Mr. Flanagan's contribution.  Is the information consultants are required to provide in relation to use of any cannabinoids or related medicines standard?  Would a consultant have to fill out these kinds of forms and report to the HSE on general prescriptions they are providing to people?  We might say unusual or maybe very rare drugs, as opposed to cannabinoids.</p></speech>

The legislation lays down the things we must collect.  Some of the information we collect, such as the name and address of the patient, would be normal information that would be on every and any prescription which anybody would have.  There is information such as the use, which would not normally be on a prescription, for example.  We would not normally see that even in our other reimbursement schemes.  We would connect things.  We would know the consultant.  We would know their medical record number.  All those types of things would be legal requirements as part of the prescription legislation for all medicines but therapeutic use in particular.  The requirement to pre-approve is unusual but not unique.</p></speech>

The suppliers of two products, namely, Cannepil and the Tilray oral solution, have submitted final pricing positions to the HSE.  They were accepted by the HSE in June and one product is, as was said, expected in October.  This question is again for Mr. Flanagan.  The HSE has designed an application form for prescribers to register a person to be treated.  Would that be standard practice for drugs?</p></speech>

Before a prescription can be written we need to provide the cannabis medical use registration number.  That is required by the legislation.</p></speech>

I found it very reassuring to hear in the Department contribution that a review was undertaken, commenced around the then Minister's decision in 2016.  The Department is now commencing a new clinical review that will continue the work.  This is, therefore, constantly under review.  When might we have that results of that review?  I would like a simple, short answer to that from the Department officials.</p></speech>

It is hard to put a timeframe on it.  There will be an evidence synthesis, a review of international practice and a review of relevant clinical trials from the intervening years to see if further indications can be added.  I expect the review will take six to eight months to complete, so by the middle of next year we will have that review refreshed.</p></speech>

Moving to the HPRA contribution, I notice it said: "The review concluded that from a policy perspective should the Minister consider it in societal interest ...".  Is that the normal use of language the authority would associate with this?  I mean as opposed to referring to the medical interest of society.  It may not be significant, but it just stood out to me.  It could equally say should the Minister consider it in the health interests of society but the authority said "societal interest".</p></speech>

With general clinical trial activity there is some activity within Europe.  It is pretty much at the same level it was in 2017 when we completed our initial review.  The areas of interest for those trials are chronic pain, psychiatric disorders and neurological conditions, including epilepsy.  Many of those trials relate to products such as Sativex and also Epidiolex, in part.  That is in the general context but in terms of the MCAP products themselves, the review of clinical data is not part of the assessment.</p></speech>

I was on the HPRA committee that initially looked at these products and I was on the advisory committee that ultimately produced the recommendation for MCAP.  In the HSE document, we clearly stated the indications.  I am an expert on epilepsy only and can only speak to that.  On that document, we clearly stated that it involved severe epilepsy where there has been a failure to respond to five or more standard anti-epileptic drugs.  Separately, there are two specific and very severe epilepsy syndromes of childhood - Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome - in that document.  Those are two different criteria.  If we look at what was available to treat epilepsy, it is perfectly reasonable to try better evidenced-based options first in general for severe medically refractory epilepsy.  I would not apply those criteria to those two childhood syndromes, of which can be life-threatening.  That is what is in the document and that is what we agreed as committee relevant to epilepsy.</p></speech>

Sorry, it sounds like a report with regard to the treatment programme where you have to outline the background.  Is this different from what would normally happen with a prescribed medicine?  I presume it is not.  Usually, you would give a background.  There is also a statement that measurements would be required along the way.  If we do not have the agreed medical research - it is not actually a medicine or recognised as a medicine - is it the consultative group that decides what the measurements and the response should be with a given patient?</p></speech>

This is still true in my area of epilepsy.  There is some medical evidence but we need an awful lot more.  There was a recognition that if we were going to set up this programme, we should collect information.  The Deputy is right.  That would not be the norm and that requires administrative back up, etc., and more paperwork, which is an additional burden on the people providing prescriptions and their staff.  It would not be the norm but there was a specific reason it was put in there and that is still a valid reason.  It points to the need for resources to be put in place for people to collect, compile and process that information.</p></speech>

I would like to understand more about how we are agreeing levels of measurement.  I know I am over time but I have one quick question and am not sure who can answer it for me.

The past five years have been very protracted to say the least for those seeking access to medicinal cannabis for themselves or their children.  It has been extremely frustrating and many people will be scratching their heads and asking why it has taken so long for this process to begin.  The good news is that the process is beginning in a couple of weeks.  My first question concerns MCAP itself.  It is good that people will get prescriptions in the next couple of weeks but how many clinicians have registered for MCAP thus far and have they registered patients under their care?</p></speech>

Professor Lynch might be better placed to answer this but, from my perspective, my understanding is that Epidiolex is reimbursed and that clinicians are most likely to move towards that, given it would be a licensed medicine and clinical trials would have taken place around that.

For us, as clinicians, looking after patients with epilepsy, the evidence base is for pure CBD products and there is no evidence base for products which contain a component of THC.  CannEpil, which is a product that has been mentioned a couple of times here, has a significant component of THC and there is no scientific evidence base for use of such a product for epilepsy.  Epidiolex, which is the pharmaceutical product which has been mentioned, is a pure CBD product.  From the very beginning going back to 2016, from when my colleagues and I engaged on this with the HSE and the Department of Health, what we have been looking for is a reliable, properly formulated, pure CBD, or as close to pure CBD as we can get, product that we can prescribe for our patients.  That is not available through what is currently coming through the MCAP.  As stated by my Department of Health and HSE colleagues, if Epidiolex is approved for reimbursement, that will solve that problem.  We sincerely hope that will happen.  However, I can speak for my colleagues when I say that we would not be prescribing CannEpil because that has a significant THC component and there is no evidence base for such a product to be effective for children and adults with epilepsy.</p></speech>

If Professor Lynch, as a specialist, is saying he would not prescribe it to his patients, then who is going to prescribe it?</p></speech>

I have no control over what products have been applied for and approved through the MCAP.  What I want very clearly is a pure CBD product.  The HSE guidelines document which came out of our committee review very clearly stated that is what we wanted for epilepsy.  While I am not an expert on legislation and on the niceties of what can and cannot be submitted, the MCAP, as set up, seems to be designed for products which contain a component of THC, and that is a problem that we have at present.  None of it is of my desire or making.  I want to be able to prescribe a pure CBD product for my patients and I want it as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Does the HPRA envisage that other conditions will be included in the programme?  The programme itself is very restrictive and we could have a situation where only a handful can get access.  We could have a situation where more people could have access via the ministerial programme than via the programme itself.  Is there a basis to include other conditions?  The omission of chronic pain in 2017 was very controversial.  My understanding is that the Danish cannabis access programme includes neurological pain as there is an unmet need for that condition.  Will the review look to include other conditions over the next six months?</p></speech>

The previous review looked at all conditions, including chronic pain and cancer and palliative care situations, and it looked very carefully at the evidence in all of those areas.  I will leave it to the people from the HPRA to answer on the new review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.528" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021092900002#H01700"><p>I am happy to start and I may bring in my colleague, Ms Power, on some of the questions.  To answer Deputy Kenny's question, he is right that the Danish system includes chronic pain as one of the indications for which cannabis can be accessed.  When we looked at this back in 2016 to 2017, we really felt that although at one level it appeared there were clinical trials that had looked at the area of chronic pain, the evidence base just was not there to stand over its inclusion as one of the indications, and there were many reasons for that.  First, the quality of the clinical trials was quite poor.  Many of them were not what we call randomised controlled clinical trials, which would really be considered best design, with the removing of bias.  Therefore, one could not draw conclusions from them.  Pain had been studied across multiple different areas, using different cohorts of patients, using different formulations, and the evidence just was not there.</p> <p>  Honestly, from what we know about this, I would say the situation possibly has not moved on a huge amount since that period.  A comprehensive review has been carried out by the International Association for the Study of Pain, IASP.  I will ask Ms Power to come in on this point because she has all the expertise on it.  I would honestly say to the Deputy that, from our viewpoint, I do not think the situation would be different.  As Mr. O'Connor indicated at the beginning, in the re-establishment of the clinical expert referencing group, from the Department's perspective, one of the first tasks will be to consider a piece of evidence on how that might be carried out because a comprehensive review is warranted, as I definitely acknowledge.  Ms Power might like to come in with regard to the IASP review findings.</p></speech>

The IASP review was the culmination of the work of multidisciplinary associations representing healthcare professionals and scientists from many countries.  In March 2021, it published a meta-analysis and systematic review on the evidence around the use of cannabinoids under the topic of pain.  I would respectfully suggest to members, if they have an hour, to Google it.  It is very nicely constructed and broken down into the safety, the efficacy, the preclinical and clinical data, the animal studies and whether they can or cannot be translated into human or clinical impact, and also the societal and policy implications related to the use of these compounds for pain management.  It is an extensive piece of work by global leaders and one of the work streams was, in fact, led by Professor David Finn of NUI Galway, who may be known to some of the committee members.</p> <p>  In summary, the major findings are on preclinical and clinical safety.  As Dr. Nolan said, it identifies a range of important research gaps and the lack of high-quality clinical evidence for safety or efficacy means that this particular association does not endorse general use.  This association recognises the pressing need for studies to fill the research gap.</p> <p>  As I said at the recent private session, none of us is questioning those for whom cannabinoids have provided relief from the lived experience of pain.</p><p>It is about the quality of evidence rather than the legitimacy of people's claims.  There is lots in there.  There was a recent publication in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>countering some of those claims but there are definite differences in methodologies and the methodologies used by IASP were robust.  The HPRA is a single entity and we have done a quick review of the evidence in a general way, so I would not want to pre-judge the outcome of a whole-of-health system expert review that might happen, as Mr. O'Connor outlined earlier.</p></speech>

I refer to those 67 individuals who have a ministerial licence.  They would currently fall outside the MCAP.  For logistical reasons and because of the product they get from the Netherlands, that cannot be included on the schedule.  That could be overcome.  Denmark has a third party licence company that provides that product to the Danish medicinal cannabis access programme.  In this situation with 67 individuals, they are not monitored collectively, so in that situation could they be included in the programme as part of the monitoring process?  The vast majority of them would in the programme because of refractory epilepsy.  Could they be part of the programme, not be prescribed medicinal cannabis products under the schedule, but be monitored nonetheless?</p></speech>

That is not information that the Department then collates; it is a doctor and patient relationship.  Any adverse reactions to the products will be reported to the HPRA, which gathers all that data.  On the clinical benefits seen from taking this product, that information is not gathered by us but that could be looked at in the MCAP scheme as a way of gathering information on the effectiveness of these products.  It is not currently being considered to bring those patients in.  As has been said multiple times, we would envisage that if Epidiolex becomes available for reimbursement, many of the patients will also leave the ministerial licence scheme.  Overall there are the three indications.  The vast majority of patients suffer from refractory epilepsy and if Epidiolex is available, they will be gone.  Our understanding is that since the MCAP was first set up the clinical needs of patients with MS and severe nausea are largely met by other licensed and non-cannabis based medicines.  We do not see a huge demand from patients with those clinical needs coming through either the MCAP or the ministerial licence programme.</p></speech>

The first licence was issued at the end of 2016 so the rest of those licences have been issued since then.  The first licence is for a period of three months and the second and subsequent licences are for six months.  A licence is not infinite and after the first three months clinicians will need to apply every six months to renew the licence.  As for the 67 individuals, there are currently approximately 40 patients actively being treated under the licence programme.</p> <p>  We have patients from all around the country in the scheme.  It is on a national level and includes the north, south, east and west.  I would have to come back to the Deputy in writing on the clinicians within the HSE.

When this started back in 2017, I was on the then Joint Committee on Health and this issue came up.  My understanding was that the HSE agreed that whatever cover was needed would be provided to the clinicians who were prescribing but I am not sure if that indemnity cover is available to people who are not employees of the HSE.  It might be worth looking at that.</p> <p>  When I talk about geographic cover I am talking about medical personnel who are prescribing.  It is that geographic spread that I am more concerned about.

I thank the Deputy for his advice regarding it.  It warrants some investigation when we are framing the terms of a refreshed evidence base.  I expect it will be difficult to gather solid evidence on it but maybe we could work through the GPs and so forth to determine the information available.</p></speech>

It seems a very tortuous route to try to get access to a product.  Mr. O'Connor said that in recent years, the use of cannabis products for medical reasons has been an issue of social and political debate in Ireland and abroad and there have been calls for cannabis products to be made available to Irish patients.  My understanding is that trying to get this product involves a fairly tortuous route.  Those patients believe that these drugs work for them and are transformative.  In many cases, they have tried everything else and this is their last hope.  I understand people travelling abroad to try to get access, particularly if a child is involved and the parent cannot get access to these products in Ireland.  People at home will be asking whether the process needs to be this complicated.</p> <p>  The drug task forces have not appeared before this committee but we know the availability of cannabis, cannabis oil and various different elements of cannabis is widespread.  We know that the THC level is 20 times higher than it was only a couple of years ago.  Again, this is the information coming from experts.  When we are talking about this tiny amount of THC, it reminds me of years ago when I was a kid and when there was a product called ginger beer that supposedly contained alcohol.  Some kids thought they would have to drink all these ginger beers but to get a high out of it, you would be drinking ginger beer forever.  I understand that it involves the Misuse of Drugs Act but it seems to involve a tiny amount.  For people listening at home, THC is supposed to be the element in cannabis that gets you this high.  We are talking about a tiny percentage so do we have an idea how much of this cannabis oil would you have to take to supposedly get a high under the current law if we are worried that people will use it willy-nilly as a backdoor to use cannabis in Ireland?  Do we, as legislators, need to look at the THC in it?  The committee would appreciate it the witnesses could come back to us with an answer today.  Do we need to look at this area?  I do not have a clue but I know the number of families that have approached us about this.  It was their last hope.  Is there anything we, as legislators, should be doing for families in that situation regarding the availability of these products?  Is there anything we, as legislators, can do about the slow pace of trying to get these products through the system?  I accept what the witnesses are saying, namely, that if pharmaceutical companies are not putting them into the system, there will be a difficulty.  If there is a significant number of products there, is there anything we or the Minister can do in terms of resources or legislation?  </p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the Minister being in contact with his counterpart in Denmark regarding this issue.  Is there a need for the Minister for Justice to talk to her counterparts because of the tortuous route and the difficulty people face trying to get products into Ireland?  Would it be useful for this committee to talk to its counterparts in the Netherlands to smooth out some of the difficulties facing those families who are clearly in need of these products but find it extremely difficult to get them?  </p></speech>

The Chairman described the process as tortuous and I acknowledge it is.  The schemes involve a lot of processes but we really need to take a risk-based approach.  The benefits of taking THC in particular need to be higher than the risks.  It is really only a clinician who can make that call.  I will bring in Professor Lynch.</p></speech>

I hear those concerns regularly and share many of them.  First, many people access unlicensed versions of CBD in the community.  The problem we have with those products is that we do not know what it is in them.</p><p>We know what is stated on the tin, but we do not know what is really in the tin.  That is why we are looking for properly manufactured, verified and sourced products.</p><p> The point about the low content of THC is very good as well.  The product I am accessing via ministerial licence for a couple of my patients - in total, I have had about eight applications for a ministerial licence - has a very low content of THC and that is why I am happy using it.  It is a minuscule amount of THC, so that is an excellent point.  Unfortunately, that still comes under the heading of a substance that is under the substance abuse guidelines.  The Epidiolex product, which is a pharmaceutical product, is essentially a pure CBD product and does not.  That is a very valid point.  Unfortunately, CannEpil, which is the only product that we see coming through the MCAP now, is a high THC product.  It is certainly not an insignificant content of THC, so it just not something that has any evidence base for prescribing for epilepsy.</p><p> You made a number of extremely valid points.  I have met many families and I have many children under my care where families have accessed non-proprietary CBD-based products from various sources themselves.  I share your frustration, Chairman, and I echo the frustration of my neurology colleagues, adult and paediatric, that we began this process in 2016 and it is a very slow process.</p></speech>

I take your point about the very small content of THC that is here.  As head of the medicines regulatory agency, I am not necessarily looking at this from the point of view of the psychoactive substance content.  We all acknowledge that what patients deserve most is evidence-supported treatments.  For me, fundamentally, this is not necessarily about this being a THC-containing product or not.  There are many controlled drugs under the misuse of drugs legislation that are regular conventional medicines.  I refer to one of the opiate products, fentanyl.  They have all reached the evidential standard that is required to achieve a medicines authorisation.  Fundamentally, we have to preserve those standards.  If cannabis wants to be a medicine, it has to reach the same evidential standards of all medicines.  It has to prove it works and that it is safe.  It comes back to that for us.  It is about the lack of an evidence base.  Unfortunately, being a controlled substance is one element of it, but the evidence base is not strong enough for this to be the more routine process in terms of access that we all know for other medicines.  Until that advances further, they are the circumstances.  This will never be a freely accessible programme.</p> <p>  I accept the point that we have started something with MCAP that needs to get under way.  We have to reform that experience, and we can look at how we can route that along, support it and much of what Mr. O'Connor said.  However, we must be careful in this debate that we preserve the standards we all expect for the medicines that we take and that we can rely on them to be safe and to work.</p></speech>

The Dutch would not change their stance.  They will not allow the commercial export of those products.  They will allow the filling of individual prescriptions, which is what the patients in the licence programme are doing.  Since April of last year, the Department has been operating a system where we are bringing the products in for the patients and delivering them to their homes.  That programme will continue.  The Minister announced last December that it would be a permanent fixture.  That has made the measure a lot easier for our patients.</p></speech>

In the first instance, I thank our guests for their comprehensive presentations.  I have a few brief questions.  First, the opening statements referred to scientific information, relying on scientific advice and so forth.  The witnesses might give us a little more information on the sources on which that scientific advice is based.  I am interested to hear that.</p> <p>  Second, it was stated that six suppliers were identified and that two of those decided, although they engaged in the process as the witness said to Deputy Cullinane, that they did not want to supply in Ireland.  Is there any reason for that?  They engaged in the process, but then opted not to bring it to its finality and supply to Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021092900002#L01700"><p>I may be answering this in the wrong context, so Senator Conway should stop me if I am going off the point to answer his question.  What we were saying in the opening statement is that it was the lack of evidence to support a demonstration of whether these products had an efficacy, meaning they would work, or they were safe.  For us, that evidence is generated through a very long development programme for any medicine, and it can take a number of years for that to happen.  That has been very well illustrated by the pandemic and much of the information that was in the public domain as to what contributes to the authorisation of vaccines.  We all heard about the coverage of the pivotal clinical trials.  One can see through that process that there is a comprehensive building of evidence which demonstrates the safety and efficacy.  That is done through clinical trials but also in terms of characterisation of the manufacturing processes, so they can stand over the quality of these products.  In the context of what is in the MCAP, the evidential base for those is not there.  The contrast to that would be the other two authorised cannabis medicines which are Epidiolex and Sativex.  They come onto the marketplace with that evidence wealth behind them and a confidence in the fact that the benefit-risk evaluation has been carried out, but by the company that has been independently reviewed by regulatory experts, and they have received a marketing authorisation.  That, in total, is the type of scientific basis or scientific evidence we were addressing.</p> <p>  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

As I understand it, that supplier made a commercial decision that it was no longer interested in the Irish market.</p></speech>

Did the witness say that 63 individuals throughout the country is the number of those benefitting from this programme?  Is it that the volume was not sufficient to make it commercially viable or was there some other reason that it made that commercial decision?</p></speech>

That is where the number of 67 comes from.  The medical cannabis access programme, MCAP, will be a different programme.  They will be the products on the Schedule.  I presume, from the perspective of the companies, that when they did the economics it just was not commercially viable in a small market for them, or they decided it was not a priority.  As I understand it, on occasion companies say that one of the reasons there can be delays in supply is that they have manufacturing pipelines and they must get sufficient quantities available to supply different markets, but I am open to correction on this.  It could be something as simple as that.  Perhaps they were just not in a position to have sufficient stock.  The Department would not be party to this as we would not be in the boardrooms of those companies.</p></speech>

I thank all of our guests.  There are quite a number of witnesses today and it is good to see them participate in this meeting.</p> <p>  I will first turn to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and specifically to Dr. Nolan.  Over the past 18 months or so, I have noticed there is a large array of CBD oils on sale in shops.  I believe the HPRA has oversight of these.  Will Dr. Nolan talk us through this?  Over the summer I bought some of these for an elderly relative who wanted to try them in order to alleviate pain being experienced on an ongoing basis.  The advice I received in the shop was a little bit substandard to what I would have wanted.  What kind of regulatory oversight does the HPRA still have on these products as they enter the Irish system?</p></speech>

CBD itself is what we could consider a "borderline product".  It is contained in cosmetics, foods, food supplements and in medicines.  The products in the shops, to which Deputy Crowe referred, are classified as foods and they should not be making any medicinal claims.  Certainly, because they are not qualified healthcare professionals, anyone working in those shops should not be giving any advice in relation to whether  these products can control pain.  They are not meant to do that at all.</p> <p>  CBD is listed by the European Commission as what is called a "novel food".  Those products have a different concentration of the CBD in them.  Epidiolex, for example, is a 10% weight by volume product.  Those products can have up to more or less a maximum of 3% and below that of CBD in them.  It is part of our market surveillance programme and it is an area in which we are very active.  I will pass over to Ms Farrell because it is her team within the authority that would look over that programme.  We have taken action on those products when we found them in shops and found them to have made claims.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, there are a lot of products out there, and from the HPRA's point of view, we are specifically looking to make sure that they do not make any medicinal claims.  When we find that they do, either on the packaging, the labelling or the company website, we will take market action when required.  For the most part, we engage with the suppliers and retailers with a view to removing those medicinal claims and bringing it back in line with the position of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on the requirements it would need to meet as food supplements alone.</p></speech>

I hold this view.  This is the reason I went in to buy it.  That is the positive of it.  When I was in the store, however, I felt the retail assistant was giving advice over and above what should have been given.</p> <p>  Another aspect is that we have all been in a situation when on Friday night we have had to run up to a local Tesco store to buy a bottle of Calpol or two, and then be told by the retailer that this is the most you can buy.  It seems to me, however, that you can buy the whole shelf of CBD oils.  From what I could see, there does not seem to be any cut-off in that regard.  Maybe there is a cut-off with the CBD products, and perhaps the HPRA could enlighten me on that.</p> <p>  Head shops were very much in vogue a decade ago, on which there was a national debate.  There has been an analysis of a number of products being sold in them.  Dr. Pierce Kavanagh of the department of pharmacology in Trinity College Dublin recently highlighted the presence of naphyrone, which is being sold in head shops.  Perhaps such shops are calling themselves something different these days, but that drug can be purchased in shops in Dublin city and throughout Ireland.  Will Dr. Nolan clarify if the HPRA has regulatory oversight or concern on that?</p></speech>

Paracetamol is a drug that is very commonly used in suicide, so the retail sale restriction the Deputy experienced in relation to the purchase of paracetamol is designed as a measure to prevent or mitigate that.</p> <p>  I come back to the point that CBD products are foods and this is what they are being sold for.  I can understand the limitations of the shop assistant's advice in relation to that.  I can understand a request for an alternative but this is why we would always advise anybody suffering from pain that the best source of guidance on controlling pain is from a qualified healthcare professional.</p> <p>  On the head shops, it depends on the nature of the substance being sold.  I will speak on this with a little bit more generality.  If the substance being sold in the head shop is included under the Misuse of Drugs Act, or is a derivative in relation to that, the enforcement action comes from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that context.</p> <p>  This comes down to the question of whether the substance in question can be considered medicinal or whether it is something that can be used in medicine and is considered to be pharmacologically active, and if it is an unauthorised medicine that is being sold.  It then comes down to the question of whether some medicines can be sold in general retail outlets, in the case of common analgesics being sold in retailers, for example, and the Deputy mentioned Calpol.  Head shops can sell medicines that would fall into this characterisation, but anything that would warrant prescription control purely should not be sold in them and this is the focus of our enforcement work.</p></speech>

It is a position I have held for a number of years.  We need to have a national debate on cannabis overall.  It is a fact that in many homes and many social outlets in Ireland people consume cannabis.  As a society we have chosen to ignore this for a long time.  I lived in Belgium and in Holland for some time where the drug is regulated by the state through the departments of agriculture, health and policing.  I am not suggesting for a moment that we should move immediately to a model like that, but there needs to be a national debate where perhaps we can look at the level of criminality around the dealing of these drugs and ask if there is a way the State can intervene to remove this layer of criminality, to look at a problem that is out there and to look at regulating it by perhaps taxing it and using quality control as they do in some other countries <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their departments of agriculture and so on.  At the very minimum, a debate needs to happen on it.  I do not have firm views either way but the debate should happen, and we should not be shying away from it.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for the information they have provided thus far.  I have three questions to ask.  What are the numbers of patients or individuals nationally who are availing of the MCAP treatment?  I am aware that there are three qualifying conditions at the moment.  Is the opportunity there to widen the conditions that qualify a patient for inclusion in the MCAP?</p><p> I am aware of a constituent in Clare who has a rare condition and is in the care of a consultant but has not been afforded the opportunity to be included in the MCAP.  Instead, this patient has now spent several years going through various types of medical treatment that had adverse side-effects but did not resolve the matter.  It did not have any kind of positive impact on the condition.  Strangely enough, the consultant has not offered the opportunity to be included in the MCAP but wants to start the whole medical treatment again, with the individual prescribed every medication that has already been tried for the past number of years.  Are the witnesses aware of such cases occurring and what are their thoughts on why they arise?  I am conscious that this patient is based in Clare, so I wonder about an urban-rural divide with this kind of treatment.</p></speech>

That would be a clinical decision and there is a clinical relationship between a doctor and patient.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Health or people in the Department to comment on that relationship.  There is trust in the relationship when it comes to what is prescribed.  The licensed programme is available to any patient once the clinical decision has been made.</p> <p>  We are not seeing a rural-urban divide that would have only Dublin-based consultants using this scheme.  Location is not an issue with access to the programme.  We are delivering cannabis-based products to patients all around the country.  We are not seeing it from our side that anybody in a rural area is disadvantaged.</p></speech>

The question was asked earlier about the position in Denmark and whether a consultant was required to initiate treatment under its cannabis access programme.  Any doctor may prescribe but for particular conditions, such as a neurological condition, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, a consultant must be involved with the prescribing.</p></speech>

N&iacute;or cheart go mbeadh coimhlint idir na gn&iacute;omhartha tromch&uacute;iseacha n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta a bh&iacute;, agus at&aacute;, idir l&aacute;mha agus dualgais i dtaca le cearta teanga.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go n-aithneofa&iacute; gaisce cheannaireacht agus foireann na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sl&aacute;inte in aimsir gh&eacute;arch&eacute;ime agus is maith a thuigtear go raibh m&oacute;r&eacute;ileamh gan choinne ar an uile acmhainn a bh&iacute; faoi sti&uacute;ir Fheidhmeannacht na Seirbh&iacute;se Sl&aacute;inte, FSS.  San am c&eacute;anna, nuair is m&oacute; an riachtanas eolas agus faisn&eacute;is iontaofa a scaipeadh ar an bpobal tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile is ceart nach nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; loiceadh ar bhuncheart teanga an tsaor&aacute;naigh agus an fhaisn&eacute;is ch&eacute;anna a chur ar f&aacute;il ag an am c&eacute;anna i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; l&eacute;ir go bhfuil dualgas reacht&uacute;il ar FSS i dtaca le roinnt mhaith de na h&aacute;bhair ghear&aacute;in a cuireadh faoi bhr&aacute;id m&rsquo;oifige mar nach bhfuil sc&eacute;im teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta aontaithe ag an eagra&iacute;ocht f&oacute;s.  &Aacute;ir&iacute;tear an aip rianaithe teagmh&aacute;laithe a chuir FSS ar f&aacute;il sa r&eacute;imse gear&aacute;n seo.  Socra&iacute;odh an aip a chur ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge den chuid is m&oacute;, c&eacute; nach raibh dualgas reacht&uacute;il i gceist.  B&rsquo;amhlaidh a tharla i gc&aacute;s na bhfoirmeacha agus na gc&oacute;ras idirghn&iacute;omhach ar l&iacute;ne.</p><p> Ocht gcine&aacute;l gear&aacute;in a th&aacute;inig chun cinn &oacute;n bpobal agus a cuireadh faoi bhr&aacute;id FSS.  Baineann na gear&aacute;in ar fad le heaspa seirbh&iacute;se i nGaeilge ar bheala&iacute; difri&uacute;la.  Cuims&iacute;tear idir dhualgais reacht&uacute;la agus neamhreacht&uacute;la sna gear&aacute;in seo agus t&aacute; teagmh&aacute;il lean&uacute;nach i scr&iacute;bhinn ag m&rsquo;oifig le FSS &oacute; l&aacute;r mh&iacute; Feabhra i mbliana agus fuarthas an comhfhreagras is deireana&iacute; uathu m&iacute; L&uacute;nasa.  Aithn&iacute;tear an t-ualach a bh&iacute; ar FSS le linn na paind&eacute;ime agus an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n a bhain le lean&uacute;nach seirbh&iacute;se a shol&aacute;thar i ndiaidh an chibirionsaithe go speisialta.  Mar sin f&eacute;in, n&iacute; thagann dualgas seirbh&iacute;se teanga salach ar aon dualgas seirbh&iacute;se eile.  Ina theannta sin, ba l&eacute;ir go raibh baint ag an gc&oacute;ras Eircode le br&uacute; an Bh&eacute;arla i gcuid de na gear&aacute;in a cuireadh faoi bhr&aacute;id na hoifige.</p><p> &Aacute;bhar m&oacute;r d&iacute;om&aacute; don phobal teanga an samhradh seo at&aacute; imithe tharainn ab ea an chaoi inar eis&iacute;odh teastas digiteach Covid an Aontais Eorpaigh.  N&iacute; raibh comhst&aacute;das ag an nGaeilge leis an mB&eacute;arla ar na teastais a cuireadh amach agus n&iacute; dhearnadh pr&oacute;ise&aacute;il cheart ar an s&iacute;neadh fada.  Cuireadh ainmneacha Gaeilge as a riocht mar thoradh d&iacute;reach air sin, agus n&iacute;or cheart go mbeadh an sc&eacute;al amhlaidh.</p><p> Tugadh faoi dh&aacute; thuarasc&aacute;il th&eacute;armacha &oacute; th&uacute;s na bliana seo.  Seoladh tuarasc&aacute;il faoi bhr&aacute;id gach T&iacute; den Oireachtas maidir le l&iacute;on na ngarda&iacute; at&aacute; ar dualgas i limist&eacute;ar Gaeltachta Dh&uacute;n na nGall, agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och de Choimisin&eacute;ir an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Drew Harris, agus den choiste seo as ini&uacute;chadh mion a dh&eacute;anamh ar &aacute;bhar na tuarasc&aacute;la sin i m&iacute; na Bealtaine agus den tuarasc&aacute;il a d&rsquo;eisigh an comhchoiste i m&iacute; I&uacute;il.  Creidim go gcuideoidh na c&uacute;ig mholadh at&aacute; sa tuarasc&aacute;il sin leis An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feidhm a thabhairt do mo chuid molta&iacute; f&eacute;in.</p><p> Tabharfaidh m&eacute; forl&eacute;argas ar an tuarasc&aacute;il Oireachtais maidir leis an gc&oacute;ras Eircode agus logainmneacha Gaeltachta a leagtar faoi bhr&aacute;id an choiste inniu.  Is ceart a mheabhr&uacute; go dtiteann an dualgas reacht&uacute;il ar an Roinn Comhshaoil, Aer&aacute;ide agus Cumars&aacute;ide sa ch&aacute;s seo agus n&iacute; ar Eircode f&eacute;in, n&aacute; ar An Post, a dh&aacute;il na h&eacute;irch&oacute;id.

Is l&eacute;iri&uacute; eile an neamhr&eacute;ir seo ar easpa cosanta ar bhuncheart teanga in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.</p><p> I m&iacute; I&uacute;il na bliana seo, thug an Rialtas le fios go gcuirfear breis is 30 leas&uacute; suntasach ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la faoi bhr&aacute;id an Oireachtais.  Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte eatramhach a chur roimh mhianaidhm na leasuithe uile at&aacute; molta ag an Rialtas ar an mBille.  Go deimhin, agus m&rsquo;or&aacute;id &aacute; chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an choiste agam seachtain roimh an chruinni&uacute; seo, n&iacute;or foils&iacute;odh t&eacute;acs na leasuithe go f&oacute;ill ach d&aacute; th&uacute;isce a rithfear an Bille is amhlaidh is t&eacute;agartha a bheidh an reachta&iacute;ocht teanga a bheidh ar f&aacute;il chun cearta teanga a chosaint.  D&aacute; ghaire f&iacute;s agus feidhm na gceart teanga d&aacute; ch&eacute;ile is amhlaidh is fearr &eacute;.</p><p> Mar fhocal scoir, fillfidh m&eacute; ar an d&aacute; mh&oacute;rcheist - t&aacute;bhacht na f&iacute;se agus feidhm na f&iacute;se.  Is maith a aithn&iacute;tear an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le st&aacute;das, siombalachas agus comhionannas measa.  Is c&oacute;ir gach leas a bhaint as an dea-mh&eacute;in agus an chomhthoil chun go gcuirf&iacute; len&aacute;r dtuiscint choitianta ar chearta teanga in &Eacute;irinn.  San am c&eacute;anna, m&aacute; dhaingn&iacute;tear ceart teanga go reacht&uacute;il is ann don tn&uacute;th&aacute;n r&eacute;as&uacute;nach go mbainf&iacute; l&aacute;n&uacute;s&aacute;id as an gceart c&eacute;anna agus go nd&eacute;anfadh an St&aacute;t agus comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; freastal d&aacute; r&eacute;ir ar an bpobal teanga.

Nach l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin an bhearna a bh&iacute; ann i leith c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge i rith na paind&eacute;ime?  D&uacute;irt an coimisin&eacute;ir go raibh 86 gear&aacute;n faighte aige.  Ceapaim go mbeidh i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ag gear&aacute;n faoi seo.  Nach l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin gur item faoi "any other business" &iacute; an Ghaeilge i meabhair a l&aacute;n daoine a n-oibr&iacute;onn le haghaidh an St&aacute;it agus sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s?  N&iacute; thuigeann siad c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; cearta Gaeilge don t&iacute;r agus do na daoine a bhaineann &uacute;s&aacute;id as an teanga.

Agus muid i m&iacute; Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair, t&aacute; 76 gear&aacute;n faighte againn cheana f&eacute;in i mbliana maidir le Covid agus n&iacute;l an bhliain caite f&oacute;s.  Is f&eacute;idir liom dul tr&iacute;d sin leis an Teachta m&aacute;s mian leis.  Bhain 40 acu sin le FSS agus 17 leis an tairseach cl&aacute;raithe.  Bhain tr&iacute; cinn le heaspa eolais ar shu&iacute;omh an ch&oacute;rais mhalartaigh ar an bhf&oacute;n.  Bhain c&uacute;ig cinn le f&oacute;gra&iacute; r&eacute;amhthaifeadta b&eacute;il agus bhain naoi gcinn le bileoga eolais i mB&eacute;arla.  Leanann s&eacute; ar aghaidh agus ar aghaidh.  Ansin bh&iacute; 36 gear&aacute;n a bhain leis an Roinn Sl&aacute;inte.  Bhain siad sin go sonrach leis an teastas Covid, litreacha i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in, easpa s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada, m&iacute;-aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n, seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; f&oacute;in i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in agus &eacute; sin ar fad.  N&iacute;or chuir aon phioc d&oacute;ibh sin aon iontas orm faraor.  Is i dtreo na ceiste a chuir an Teachta orm maidir leis mo seacht mbliana in oifig &eacute; sin mar tharraing muid aird air seo siar in 2017 nuair a d'eisigh muid tuarasc&aacute;il ar ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  Phl&eacute;igh muid an fhadhb a bh&iacute; ann le c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna agus s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada a bheith in easnamh.  Faighimid go leor gear&aacute;n faoi easpa s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada agus mar sin de.  Chuir an Teachta an cheist orm, an dtarl&oacute;dh an rud c&eacute;anna ar&iacute;s?  Le bheith ionraic, d&aacute; mbeadh paind&eacute;im nua ann ag deireadh na bliana seo, shamhl&oacute;inn go dtarl&oacute;dh an rud c&eacute;anna ar&iacute;s i go leor c&aacute;sanna mar, go minic, n&iacute;l ar chumas an St&aacute;it t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt don Ghaeilge n&aacute; caitheamh l&eacute;i go f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte, mar ba ch&oacute;ir.  Is ar cheann de na pr&iacute;omhch&uacute;iseanna leis sin, at&aacute; leagtha amach agam le blianta fada, n&aacute; nach bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann s&aacute;ch l&aacute;idir le bundualgais a leagan ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;.  T&aacute; fadhb an-bhun&uacute;sach faoina bhun sin.  Baineann s&eacute; sin le l&iacute;on leordh&oacute;thanach daoine le Gaeilge a bheith ag obair sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; agus sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras at&aacute; ar a gcumas feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.<br/><br/>Le cead an Chathaoirligh, l&eacute;ifidh m&eacute; p&iacute;osa beag as tuarasc&aacute;il a d'eisigh oifig an choimisin&eacute;ara teanga i gCeanada.  Bh&iacute; go leor de na fadhbanna c&eacute;anna ag daoine i gCeanada &oacute; thaobh seirbh&iacute;s a fh&aacute;il sa d&aacute; theanga sa t&iacute;r sin.  Is alt beag &eacute; seo a chuaigh i bhfeidhm go m&oacute;r orm sa ph&iacute;osa a scr&iacute;obh an coimisin&eacute;ir.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute;:</p> <blockquote> 	Once an emergency is declared, it is too late to learn English or French, and auxiliary resources&mdash;financial or material resources, translation and interpretation services&mdash;become less available than during normal times.  It is therefore vital that the federal government have a sufficiently bilingual workforce at all times that is able to perform essential tasks such as supervising staff in designated bilingual regions and communicating with the public in both official languages in areas where there is significant demand. </blockquote> <p>T&eacute;ann s&eacute; ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; c&eacute;ard a tharla go minic agus t&aacute; s&eacute; an-chos&uacute;il le c&eacute;ard a tharla sa t&iacute;r seo:</p> <blockquote> 	Federal institutions tend to justify releasing information in only one official language [c&eacute; chomh minic is a tharla s&eacute; sin anseo?] during crises by noting that in an emergency, waiting for communications to be translated simply takes too long.  In other words, these institutions are conducting an ad hoc cost-benefit analysis, wherein the cost of violating the Act is outweighed by the benefit of providing information quickly to at least those Canadians who can speak the official language most used by the institution.  The logic of the cost-benefit analysis is, of course, of little solace to speakers of the other official language, who not only have to wait to receive important information, but also see their trust in their government begin to waver as the institutions mandated to protect them disregard their language rights and communication needs. </blockquote> <p>Tagann s&eacute; sin 100% leis na gear&aacute;in a sheol daoine chuig m'oifig le beagnach dh&aacute; bhliain anuas anois.  Motha&iacute;onn siad ligthe s&iacute;os ag an St&aacute;t, nach bhfuil an St&aacute;t ag caitheamh leo go f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte agus nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag cur na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge mar ba ch&oacute;ir.  N&iacute; fheicim aon r&eacute;iteach gearrth&eacute;arma air sin ach is &eacute; an r&eacute;iteach is bun&uacute;sa&iacute;, agus is r&eacute;iteach fadt&eacute;armach &eacute;, n&aacute; go mbeadh a nd&oacute;thain daoine le Gaeilge ag feidhmi&uacute; sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; seo.  Ghabhfadh s&eacute; sin cuid mhaith den bhealach chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a chur ina gceart amach anseo.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an coincheap taobh thiar den ch&oacute;ras sin go maith agus is l&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag feidhmi&uacute;.

D&aacute; mbeadh caighde&aacute;in leagtha s&iacute;os d'fhoirmeacha agus do sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; f&oacute;in, n&iacute; bheadh muid ag brath ar sc&eacute;im teanga agus n&iacute; bheadh aon cheist an bhfuil sc&eacute;im ann n&oacute; an bhfuil s&eacute; gafa in &eacute;ag.  <br/><br/>Is &eacute; sin r&eacute;iteach na faidhbe sa deireadh thiar ach t&oacute;gfaidh s&eacute; am.  T&aacute;im ag teacht &oacute; &aacute;it at&aacute; chomh dona sin gur l&eacute;ir go dt&oacute;gfaidh s&eacute; sin am.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th gur luaigh m&eacute; i m'&oacute;r&aacute;id an phr&aacute;inn a bhaineann leis an Acht nua agus an t&aacute;bhacht go n-acht&oacute;far an tAcht nua chomh luath in &Eacute;irinn agus is f&eacute;idir chun go mbeidh muid in ann tos&uacute; dul i ngleic leis seo.  N&iacute; bheidh ann ach t&uacute;s.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go mbeidh s&eacute; mh&iacute; ann sula mbun&oacute;far an coiste comhairleach agus go mbeidh dh&aacute; bhliain ann go dt&iacute; go mbeidh an plean ann.  I ndiaidh sin, beidh anail&iacute;s le d&eacute;anamh maidir leis na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Is &eacute; sin mo phr&iacute;omhtheachtaireacht.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; go mbeadh toradh maidir le go leor de na fadhbanna san Acht nua ach t&aacute; s&eacute; in am d&uacute;inn anois tabhairt faoi agus &eacute; a acht&uacute; agus seirbh&iacute;s n&iacute;os fearr a chur ar f&aacute;il n&aacute; mar at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair.</p></speech>

Tos&oacute;idh m&eacute; le Eircode agus an tuarasc&aacute;il at&aacute; muid ag leagan faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais inniu.  Is &aacute;bhar tromch&uacute;iseach &eacute; don oifig go mbeadh tuarasc&aacute;il &aacute; leagan faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais.  Faoin reachta&iacute;ocht, nuair a dh&eacute;antar imscr&uacute;d&uacute; agus d&eacute;antar molta&iacute;, m&aacute; bhraithim n&aacute;r cuireadh na molta&iacute; i bhfeidhm, an rogha at&aacute; tugtha san Acht n&aacute; tuarasc&aacute;il ar an &aacute;bhar sin a leagan faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais agus sin at&aacute; tarlaithe sa ch&aacute;s seo.

Faoin Acht, leanann dualgas at&aacute; geallta i sc&eacute;im teanga ar aghaidh go tr&iacute;&uacute; p&aacute;irt&iacute; de chuid na Roinne.  Sin a tharlaigh sa ch&aacute;s seo.  Fuair siad tr&iacute;&uacute; p&aacute;irt&iacute;, Capita, leis an gc&oacute;ras Eircode a dh&aacute;ileadh agus a sti&uacute;radh ach s&aacute;ra&iacute;odh an tAcht mar gheall go raibh s&eacute; &aacute; chur amach do dhaoine gan na logainmneacha Gaeltachta &aacute; n-&uacute;s&aacute;id.  N&iacute; raibh aon s&aacute;r&uacute; ann faoi logainm i mB&eacute;arla do dhuine i nD&uacute;n Laoghaire, mar shampla, a bh&iacute; ag iarraidh go n-&uacute;s&aacute;idf&iacute; an logainm i nGaeilge.

Rinne muid moladh go dt&eacute;if&iacute; i ngleic leis sin agus go gcuirf&iacute; an s&aacute;r&uacute; reachta&iacute;ochta ina cheart.</p> <p>  Rinne an Roinn roinnt mhaith iarrachta&iacute; &eacute; a chur ina cheart sa mh&eacute;id agus go bhfuil an leagan Gaeilge de na logainmneacha ar an leagan Gaeilge den leathanach Eircode don chuid is m&oacute; ach m&aacute; th&eacute;ann t&uacute; isteach go dt&iacute; an leathanach B&eacute;arla t&aacute; an seoladh f&oacute;s i mB&eacute;arla.  An l&eacute;amh at&aacute; againne ar an reachta&iacute;ocht, agus pl&eacute;adh &eacute; seo aimsir an imscr&uacute;daithe, n&aacute; gurb iad na logainmneacha Gaeltachta a &uacute;s&aacute;idfear, n&iacute; na logainmneacha i mB&eacute;arla.

Cuireann s&eacute; isteach a sheoladh i nGaeilge, agus cuireann s&eacute; isteach an c&oacute;d poist leis, agus tagann an beartas chuige sa phost leis an seoladh i mB&eacute;arla, mar t&aacute; an rogha ag an duine at&aacute; ag d&aacute;ileadh an phostas p&eacute; ceann a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  Rinne an Roinn roinnt mhaith oibre air sin agus rinne siad iarracht &eacute; a chur ina cheart.  D&uacute;irt siad gur labhair siad leis An Post faoi agus bh&iacute; cruinnithe acu faoi.  Go bun&uacute;sach, an arg&oacute;int at&aacute; An Post ag d&eacute;anamh n&aacute; nach f&eacute;idir leo &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh leis na leaganacha Gaeilge amh&aacute;in mar go gcuirfeadh s&eacute; sin as do na hiarrachta&iacute; at&aacute; ar bun acu an post a dh&aacute;ileadh go cruinn agus in am.

N&iacute;or tharlaigh s&eacute; sin sa ch&aacute;s seo agus sin an f&aacute;th go ndeachaigh muid ag imscr&uacute;d&uacute;. </p> <p>  &Oacute; thaobh an Roinn Sl&aacute;inte agus FSS, t&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta faoin sc&eacute;im teanga.

Lorga&iacute;odh sc&eacute;im teanga &oacute; FSS in 2007.  D&rsquo;iarr an tAire orthu sc&eacute;im teanga a aont&uacute; agus a dhaingni&uacute;, ina leagfa&iacute; s&iacute;os na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute;, agus n&iacute;or tharla s&eacute; sin riamh.  In 2005, dh&aacute; bhliain roimhe sin, d&rsquo;aontaigh limist&eacute;ar an iarthair de chuid FSS sc&eacute;im teanga don limist&eacute;ar sin amh&aacute;in.  De r&eacute;ir Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, an plean a bh&iacute; ann, agus rinne s&eacute; go leor c&eacute;ille, n&aacute; go dt&oacute;gfa&iacute; ar an sc&eacute;im chuile thr&iacute; bliana, go mbeadh an dara sc&eacute;im agus an tr&iacute;&uacute; sc&eacute;im ann agus go leanfa&iacute; leis na dualgais.  Mura dtarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin, an rud a deirtear san Acht n&aacute; go bhfuil an sc&eacute;im imithe in &eacute;ag, ach leanann na dualgais at&aacute; sa ch&eacute;ad sc&eacute;im.  N&iacute;or daingn&iacute;odh an dara sc&eacute;im riamh i gc&aacute;s limist&eacute;ar an iarthair.  D&rsquo;aithin mo r&eacute;amhtheachta&iacute; Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in i 2011 go raibh fadhb mh&oacute;r anseo agus chuir s&eacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il sin faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais in 2011 nuair a rinne s&eacute; imscr&uacute;d&uacute; ar easpa chur i bhfeidhm na sc&eacute;ime maidir le limist&eacute;ar an iarthair de chuid FSS.  Is faoin gcoiste, agus, is d&oacute;igh, faoi Thithe an Oireachtais, at&aacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il sin f&oacute;s.</p> <p>  &Oacute; thaobh mo r&oacute;l mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, go bun&uacute;sach an ch&eacute;im dheireanach gur f&eacute;idir le Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga a th&oacute;g&aacute;il n&aacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il a leagan faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais agus a r&aacute; gur fh&eacute;ach muid ar an dualgas, chinn muid go raibh s&aacute;r&uacute; ann, rinne muid molta&iacute;, n&iacute;or cuireadh i bhfeidhm iad, agus anois t&aacute;imid &aacute; chur sin faoi bhur mbr&aacute;id.</p><p> Maidir leis an bhForas Taighde ar Oideachas, seo c&aacute;s a bh&iacute; thar a bheith d&uacute;shl&aacute;nach don oifig.  Bh&iacute; go leor tochailt ann &oacute; thaobh an imscr&uacute;d&uacute; seo.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; iarracht cur s&iacute;os a dh&eacute;anamh air go beacht gan dul i bhfad sc&eacute;il leis.  Go bun&uacute;sach, rinneadh trialacha nua do bhunscoileanna do l&eacute;itheoireacht i mB&eacute;arla agus i matamaitic.  Le teacht ar chaighde&aacute;n a bh&iacute; mar mhe&aacute;n-sc&oacute;r, mar shampla, do l&eacute;itheoireacht, rinne an Foras Taighde ar Oideachas t&aacute;st&aacute;il ar scoileanna roimh r&eacute; le go bhfaighid&iacute;s an caighde&aacute;n, tr&iacute; shampla&iacute; trialacha.  Nuair a bh&iacute; siad &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sin, bhris siad s&iacute;os na scoileanna i r&eacute;ims&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la - de r&eacute;ir mar a chuimhn&iacute;m air, scoileanna cathracha agus cinn tuaithe, scoileanna cail&iacute;n&iacute; n&oacute; buachaill&iacute;, scoileanna DEIS, agus scoileanna a bh&iacute; ag teagasc tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta, leis an gcaighde&aacute;n&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh bhain siad amach na scoileanna a bh&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus rinne siad an caighde&aacute;n&uacute; ar na cinn eile mar n&iacute; raibh siad ullamh &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i nGaeilge.  Go bun&uacute;sach, sin an t-imscr&uacute;d&uacute; a bh&iacute; ann agus sh&aacute;raigh an fhoras an tAcht Oideachais d&aacute; bharr.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo go lean&uacute;nach &oacute; shin chun cinnti&uacute; nach dtarl&oacute;idh s&eacute; ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; molta&iacute; curtha faoin&aacute;r mbr&aacute;id agus t&aacute;imid ag oibri&uacute; leo le teacht go staid go mba cheart nach dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; ar&iacute;s.</p><p> Maidir leis na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la, seo fadhb mh&oacute;r a th&aacute;inig chun cinn le linn na hoibre ar an dtuarasc&aacute;il faireach&aacute;in.  Luaigh an Teachta an c&uacute;ig &uacute;dar&aacute;s &aacute;iti&uacute;il nach raibh ag tac&uacute; linn.  Ceisteanna s&aacute;ch bun&uacute;sach a bh&iacute; ann faoin obair a bh&iacute; ar si&uacute;l ag na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la, ach an rud a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; sa tuarasc&aacute;il bhliant&uacute;il n&aacute; go bhfuil for&aacute;il san Acht a cheada&iacute;onn dom mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga an dl&iacute; a chur ar chomhlacht poibl&iacute; de bharr easpa comhoibrithe agus iad a thabhairt chuig na c&uacute;irteanna mura bhfuil siad ag comhoibri&uacute; liom.  An rabhadh a thug m&eacute; n&aacute; go bhfuil m&eacute; ag obair ina threo sin anois mar n&iacute;l s&eacute; f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte ar na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la eile at&aacute; ag tac&uacute; linn agus at&aacute; ag freagairt na ceisteanna agus ag cur eolais ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute; imn&iacute; n&oacute; aif&eacute;ala orm faoi seo.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur rud &eacute; gur cheart a tharl&uacute; - go mbeidh orm seans feidhme a thabhairt don fhor&aacute;il sin san Acht de bharr easpa comhoibrithe.</p><p> &Oacute; thaobh an Gharda agus easpa tuisceana, n&iacute;l aon bhealach gur cheart go mbeadh aon easpa tuisceana ar an nGarda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faoin dualgas reacht&uacute;il at&aacute; orthu &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de agus &oacute; thaobh l&iacute;on na ngarda&iacute; le Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Bh&iacute; muid ag scr&iacute;obh acu ar feadh deich mbliana faoi seo agus t&aacute; siad go maith ar an eolas faoin dualgas at&aacute; orthu.  Molaim an bealach go ndeachaigh an coiste i ngleic leis an tuarasc&aacute;il tr&iacute; Choimisin&eacute;ir an Gharda a thabhairt isteach agus tuarasc&aacute;il bhliant&uacute;il a lorg faoin dul chun cinn at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh s&eacute; sin ina chabhair.</p><p> N&iacute; dhearna m&eacute; an oiread sin machnamh go dt&iacute; seo faoin earca&iacute;ocht agus arduithe c&eacute;ime.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; sin ann.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag cuimhneamh os ard anseo.  Is l&eacute;ir go mba cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; mar bhunt&aacute;iste do dhuine at&aacute; ag iarraidh ard&uacute; c&eacute;ime go bhfuil Gaeilge acu, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r m&aacute; t&aacute; poist ann ina bhfuil g&aacute; leis an nGaeilge.  Ba cheart breathn&uacute; ar an nGaeilge mar bhunt&aacute;iste breise at&aacute; ag duine agus ba cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; sin san &aacute;ireamh chomh maith.  An rud at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il &oacute; thaobh earca&iacute;ochta de, go ginear&aacute;lta, n&aacute; go mbeadh daoine le Gaeilge ag chuile leibh&eacute;al den st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus den tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.  S&iacute;lim go gcuideodh s&eacute; sin go m&oacute;r.</p><p> Bhain an cheist dheireanach leis na leasuithe agus na ceannteidil.  D&uacute;irt m&eacute; go raibh m&eacute; ag cur f&aacute;ilte "eatramhach" rompu mar nach bhfuil siad feicthe agam.  In 2017, sa tr&aacute;chtaireacht ar ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, luaigh m&eacute; na ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il, dar liom, agus luaigh an comhchoiste na molta&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il ina thuarasc&aacute;il chomh maith.  &Oacute;n m&eacute;id at&aacute; feicthe againn, t&aacute; an Rialtas ag dul i ngleic le go leor de na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta leis na leasuithe, de r&eacute;ir mar at&aacute; feicthe againn sa r&aacute;iteas, ach n&iacute;l na leasuithe feicthe againn f&oacute;s agus sin an f&aacute;th go nd&uacute;irt m&eacute; go gcuireann m&eacute; f&aacute;ilte "eatramhach" rompu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh spriocanna ama cinnte sna leasuithe agus nach mbeadh siad l&aacute;n le d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute;.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; r&oacute;-&eacute;asca d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine a fh&aacute;il &oacute; na leasuithe m&aacute; t&aacute; dualgas ar chomhlacht poibl&iacute; a l&oacute;g&oacute; a bheith i nGaeilge, f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge n&oacute;, go s&aacute;bh&aacute;la Dia sinn, go gcaithfid&iacute;s s&iacute;neadh fada a chur san &aacute;it go gcaithfidh s&iacute;neadh fada a bheith.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin go sciobtha agus nach mbeadh siad ag f&aacute;il d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; ar feadh blianta a chuirfeadh moill ar a leith&eacute;id.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil na prionsabail leagtha s&iacute;os ach - agus deirim &eacute; seo le m&oacute;r-mheas - caithfidh an coiste Oireachtais agus Baill an Oireachtais a bheith ag faire amach d&oacute;ibh nuair at&aacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht seo &aacute; phl&eacute; san am amach romhainn.</p><p> Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil bearna mh&oacute;r mhillteach idir an fh&iacute;s agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;.  Deirtear go leor faoin Ghaeilge i r&aacute;itis de chuid an St&aacute;it agus an Rialtais ag dul siar go 2006, sa Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 agus in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  An &aacute;it inar f&eacute;idir feidhm a thabhairt don fh&iacute;s sin, ag deireadh an lae, n&aacute; tr&iacute; dhaoine le Gaeilge a chur san &aacute;it go bhfuil siad ag teast&aacute;il, sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;, le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine a theasta&iacute;onn siad uathu, chun nach mbeadh orthu a bheith ag streachailt n&oacute; anr&oacute; a bheith ann ag f&aacute;il seirbh&iacute;s&iacute;.  Sin an &aacute;it d&oacute; sin agus is r&eacute;iteach fadt&eacute;armach at&aacute; ann gur f&eacute;idir dul i ngleic leis sin amach anseo.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; siad uaillmhianach amach is amach agus i bhfad n&iacute;os uaillmhiana&iacute; n&aacute; mar at&aacute;, fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in, an Bille teanga at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair i l&aacute;thair na huaire.</p> <p>  Nuair a bh&iacute; mise ag sti&uacute;radh an ch&eacute;ad reachta&iacute;ocht tr&iacute;d an D&aacute;il, bh&iacute; gear&aacute;n &oacute;n taobh istigh sa ch&oacute;ras faoin mh&eacute;id a bh&iacute; ann.  Bhreathnaigh m&eacute; ar an duine sinsearach a bh&iacute; do mo cheisti&uacute; agus d&uacute;irt m&eacute; go raibh i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os m&oacute; i dtreoirl&iacute;nte an iarAire.  D&uacute;irt an duine sin liom gurbh ea agus gur aontaigh siad iad sin gan str&oacute; ar bith mar n&iacute;or cheap siad riamh go gcuirfeadh siad i bhfeidhm iad.  Bh&iacute; an cine&aacute;l ruda sin ann go raibh s&eacute; go deas Acht agus chuile sh&oacute;rt a bheith ann agus n&iacute; raibh aon duine d&aacute;ir&iacute;re go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm &eacute;.  Thuig m&eacute; &eacute; sin agus is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga ann anois.  Thuigeamar ag an am sin go raibh g&aacute; le duine &eacute;igin le bata m&oacute;r - le cumhacht reacht&uacute;il - a bheith ann.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir n&aacute;r tugadh d&oacute;thain cumhachta don choimisin&eacute;ir ag an am, ach mura mbeadh a leith&eacute;id ann le r&aacute; nach bhfuil eagra&iacute;ocht St&aacute;it ag d&eacute;anamh an rud at&aacute; sa dl&iacute;, is l&eacute;ir go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; dl&iacute; iontach a scr&iacute;obh ach nach gcuirf&iacute; i bhfeidhm &eacute;.  Is &aacute;bhar &eacute; seo rud a bhfuilimid ar fad ag pl&eacute; leis le fada.  T&aacute; go leor le d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;s i dtaobh na ceiste seo mar caithfear dul i ndiaidh daoine an t-am ar fad, fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in maidir leis na dualgais at&aacute; soil&eacute;ir taobh istigh den Acht a chomhl&iacute;onadh, mar shampla, chun freagra a fh&aacute;il i nGaeilge ar litir a cuireadh isteach i nGaeilge agus mar sin de.</p> <p>  B&iacute;onn tathant le d&eacute;anamh ar chuile dhuine agus is sampla &eacute; seo den rud a tharla le Covid-19.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; chomh h&eacute;asca na leabhr&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh go d&aacute;theangach.  N&iacute;l le d&eacute;anamh ach glaoch ar cheann de na comhlachta&iacute; aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus bheadh m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh an duine le chuile shocr&uacute; agus a r&aacute; leis n&oacute; l&eacute;i go mbeadh c&uacute;pla l&aacute; i gceist leis &eacute; seo a aistri&uacute;.  Is minic a rinne m&eacute; f&eacute;in &eacute; leis na comhlachta&iacute; aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus d&eacute;anfaidh siad &eacute;.  Ach n&iacute;or fh&eacute;adfadh na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is a bheith bother&aacute;ilte.  T&aacute; n&oacute;s beag&aacute;in&iacute;n den "cuma-liomachas" ann faoi seo ar fad.  Is &eacute; sin san &aacute;it a bhfuil dualgas l&aacute;idir sa dl&iacute; &oacute; thaobh ruda&iacute; a scaipeadh i ngach uile theanga is at&aacute; in &Eacute;irinn, chomh fada agus is eol dom.</p><p>Is bun-dl&iacute; &eacute; sin at&aacute; againn.  Caithfear &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus cl&uacute;da&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin na comhlachta&iacute; St&aacute;it ar fad ansin.</p><p> T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna i gceist maidir leis an teastas Covid-19 a bh&iacute; thar a bheith lochtach.  N&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n chaoi a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go lochtach.  N&iacute; raibh siad in ann fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in ainm na t&iacute;re a fh&aacute;il i gceart.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mo ch&oacute;na&iacute; i dt&iacute;r nua ar fad nuair a chonacthas go raibh a leith&eacute;id d&rsquo;&aacute;it ann darb ainm &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  An ch&eacute;ad l&aacute; a th&aacute;inig ceann amach, chuir cara liom ceann chugam agus d&rsquo;fhiafraigh s&eacute; d&iacute;om ar cheap m&eacute; gur teastas br&eacute;agach n&oacute; f&iacute;ortheastas a bh&iacute; ann.  Bhreathnaigh m&eacute; air agus bh&iacute; cuma de chine&aacute;l cirte air agus ansin chonaic m&eacute; an "Republic of Ireland" agus chuir m&eacute; t&eacute;acs aige ar an bpointe agus d&uacute;irt m&eacute; leis an rud a sheachaint mar cheap m&eacute;, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, gur scam a bh&iacute; ann mar n&iacute; h&eacute; sin ainm an St&aacute;it agus n&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;idfeadh Roinn St&aacute;it "Republic of Ireland" go br&aacute;ch.  M&oacute; l&eacute;an g&eacute;ar nach orm a bh&iacute; an d&iacute;chiall.</p><p> T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-acht&oacute;far an Bille.  T&aacute; Acht ann agus n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil aon duine ag arg&oacute;int anois gur cheart deireadh a chur leis an Acht.  Caithfimid cuimhneamh go raibh s&eacute; i gceist in 2010 lag&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh air.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th gur thosaigh caint ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus na dualgais at&aacute; isteach san Acht i l&aacute;thair na huaire a bhaint as.  N&aacute; b&iacute;odh aon duine ag ceapadh gurbh &eacute; &aacute; l&aacute;idri&uacute; a bh&iacute; i gceist ag an am sin.</p><p> Chomh maith leis sin, m&aacute;s buan mo chuimhne - s&iacute;lim go raibh an coimisin&eacute;ir ag obair do RT&Eacute; ag an am &ndash; bh&iacute; moladh ann go gcuirf&iacute; Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga isteach leis an Ombudsman.  T&aacute;im ag ceapadh go bhfuil dh&aacute; rud bainte amach idir an d&aacute; linn.  T&aacute; an tAcht le l&aacute;idri&uacute; agus t&aacute; Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga le f&aacute;g&aacute;il ann.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil tuilleadh foirne &aacute; lorg ag an oifig agus bheinn thar a bheith tac&uacute;il le hiarratas mar sin.  B&iacute;onn gach tosach lag, ach t&aacute; an oifig ann le p&iacute;osa fada agus t&aacute; go leor oibre le d&eacute;anamh.</p><p> Ba cheart dul ar aghaidh agus an tAcht nua a acht&uacute; chomh sciobtha agus is f&eacute;idir, ach t&aacute;im cinnte de nach mbeidh chuile sh&oacute;rt ar mhaith linn n&oacute; a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a chur san Acht ann.  N&iacute;l aon chosc orainn teacht ar ais laistigh de dh&aacute; bhliain n&oacute; tr&iacute; bliana le breis for&aacute;lacha, mar is de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile a th&oacute;gtar na caisle&aacute;in.  Is &eacute; an rud ba mheasa a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i mbliana n&aacute; an iomarca ama a chailleadh anois ag an bpointe seo.  T&aacute; an tAcht ag teast&aacute;il go g&eacute;ar agus creidim f&eacute;in gur feabhas maith &eacute; ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ann.  L&aacute;idr&iacute;onn s&eacute; gn&eacute;ithe &aacute;irithe ach n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go mba &eacute; sin deireadh an sc&eacute;il.</p><p> T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna seo i gceist maidir leis an Acht at&aacute; ann i l&aacute;thair na huaire agus bainfidh s&eacute; leis an Acht nua sa mh&eacute;id is n&aacute;r baineadh &uacute;s&aacute;id as na hionstraim&iacute; ar fad a bh&iacute; ann.  Is &eacute; c&aacute;s an HSE an sampla is fearr de sin.  Ligeadh na pleananna teanga dul i l&eacute;ig agus n&iacute;or tugadh pleananna teanga nua isteach nuair a buna&iacute;odh eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; nua agus mar sin de.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go mba bunlocht &eacute; n&aacute;r baineadh leath an oiread &uacute;s&aacute;ide agus a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; as ionstraim&iacute; reacht&uacute;la agus as rialach&aacute;in, c&eacute; go bhfuil sol&aacute;thar s&aacute;ch fairsing d&iacute;obh ann.</p><p> T&aacute; fait&iacute;os orm leis an Acht nua maidir leis an rud c&eacute;anna agus leis na caighde&aacute;in.  Faoin am go mbun&oacute;far coiste agus go dtabharfar caighde&aacute;in isteach, is f&eacute;idir go dtabharfar roinnt d&iacute;obh isteach ach beidh orainn a bheith ag athr&uacute; na gcaighde&aacute;n &oacute; mh&iacute; go m&iacute;, de r&eacute;ir mar a bheidh an saol ag athr&uacute;, agus is ag athr&uacute; a bh&iacute;onn an saol.  De r&eacute;ir mar a bh&iacute;onn poill &aacute; n-aimsi&uacute; ag an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras at&aacute; ag iarraidh &eacute;al&uacute; as na ruda&iacute; seo agus as na rialach&aacute;in, mura bhfuil siad &aacute; sti&uacute;radh go gn&iacute;omhach ag an Roinn, n&iacute; bheimid ag tabhairt na deiseanna don choimisin&eacute;ir ruda&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm. </p><p> Luafaidh m&eacute; rud amh&aacute;in deiridh agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go dtaispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; fadhb eile maidir le dearcadh.  Cuirtear an mana "Transport for Ireland" ar bhusanna agus ar dheiseanna iompair sa t&iacute;r seo.  Chuir m&eacute; ceist ar an Aire Iompair faoi sin.  D'iarr m&eacute; air c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil "Iompar &Eacute;ireann" ann.  Chuir s&eacute; an National Transport Authority, NTA, ar aghaidh, &aacute; r&aacute; nach raibh aon fhreagracht aige chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis.  Is &eacute; an dearcadh a bh&iacute; ag an NTA nach raibh aon dualgas air, is &eacute; sin an dearcadh nach nd&eacute;anfadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s sin rud ar bith riamh mura mbeadh s&eacute; sa dl&iacute; go gcaithfidh siad &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Chonacthas dom, agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il de chuid an St&aacute;it agus mar phr&iacute;omhtheanga oifigi&uacute;il sa bhreis air sin, go mba aisteach an dearcadh &eacute; sin ag oifig n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta de chuid an St&aacute;it seo.  Taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; nach bhfuil &eacute;irithe linn n&oacute; leis an D&aacute;il, tar &eacute;is os cionn 100 bliain &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il, a chur ina lu&iacute; ar an gc&oacute;ras seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute; go bhfuil dualgas n&iacute;os leithne air i leith na Gaeilge n&aacute; mar at&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge, mar a d&uacute;irt an coimisin&eacute;ir f&eacute;in i r&aacute;iteas i ndiaidh r&aacute;iteas de chuid an St&aacute;it, f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach agus f&iacute;orbhun&uacute;sach don St&aacute;t seo.  </p><p> Is mian liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l don choimisin&eacute;ir as an obair a dh&eacute;anann s&eacute;.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; &eacute;asca agus le c&uacute;namh D&eacute; beidh tuilleadh arml&oacute;in aige go luath agus t&aacute;im cinnte go mbainfidh s&eacute; spraoi as a bheith ag caitheamh na n-urchar.</p></speech>

Aonta&iacute;m le gach a bhfuil r&aacute;ite aige sa ph&iacute;osa cainte sin agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as a dhea-mh&eacute;in i leith na hoifige.<br/><br/>Chuir an Teachta ceist theicni&uacute;il amh&aacute;in faoin alt &oacute; thaobh na leabhr&aacute;in eolais agus cumars&aacute;id leis an bpobal.  T&aacute; for&aacute;il dh&iacute;reach san Acht a leagann s&iacute;os, i gc&aacute;s ina nd&eacute;anann duine cumars&aacute;id i dteanga oifigi&uacute;il le comhlacht poibl&iacute;, go bhfreagr&oacute;idh an comhlacht sin sa teanga ch&eacute;anna.  Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; dualgas ann in alt 9(3) a deir:</p> <blockquote> 	I gc&aacute;s ina nd&eacute;anfaidh comhlacht poibl&iacute; cumars&aacute;id i scr&iacute;bhinn n&oacute; leis an bpost leictreonach leis an bpobal ...  n&oacute; le haicme den phobal ... chun faisn&eacute;is a thabhairt ... gur i nGaeilge, n&oacute; i mB&eacute;arla agus i nGaeilge, a bheidh an chumars&aacute;id. </blockquote> <p>T&aacute; s&eacute; tr&aacute;th&uacute;il gur luaigh an Teachta &eacute; sin i gcomhth&eacute;acs na leabhr&aacute;n faoi Covid-19.  Faoin Acht, t&aacute; cead ag comhlacht poibl&iacute; c&aacute;s Ard-Ch&uacute;irte a th&oacute;g&aacute;il in aghaidh molta&iacute; agus fionnachtana na n-imscr&uacute;duithe.  Faoin alt 9(3) d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, is &eacute; an t-aon uair a tharla s&eacute; sin nuair a th&oacute;g na Coimisin&eacute;ir&iacute; Ioncaim c&aacute;s Ard-Ch&uacute;irte i gcoinne fionnachtana a rinneadh in imscr&uacute;d&uacute; faoin alt sin maidir le c&aacute;in mhaoine.  D&rsquo;&eacute;irigh leis an oifig sa ch&aacute;s sin agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin docht daingean &oacute; thaobh an dualgais at&aacute; ann.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin nuair at&aacute; rud leagtha s&iacute;os go soil&eacute;ir agus go daingean i reachta&iacute;ocht, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair &eacute;al&uacute; uaidh sin.<br/><br/>&Oacute; thaobh na hoifige de agus an deich mbliana &oacute; tosa&iacute;odh caint faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, t&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta maidir leis na ch&eacute;ad-cheannteidil a th&aacute;inig amach.  Is cuimhin liom iad mar n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ach tosaithe mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ag an am.  Go bun&uacute;sach, bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; san Acht nach raibh ag oibri&uacute; &aacute; dhaingni&uacute; agus n&iacute; raibh s&eacute; sin ceart sa mh&eacute;id is go raibh tr&eacute;imhse ama n&iacute;os faide le cur le sc&eacute;imeanna teanga seachas c&oacute;ras na gcaighde&aacute;n a thabhairt isteach.  N&iacute; raibh aon rud ann faoi earca&iacute;ocht n&oacute; faoi fhor&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh don Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute;imid tagtha cuid mhaith uaidh sin.  Is &iacute; an imn&iacute; at&aacute; orm go bhfuil an t-am ag sleamhn&uacute; thart an t-am ar fad agus caithfear dul i ngleic leis sin.<br/><br/>Mar fhreagra eile ar deireadh ansin &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; foirne de, luaigh an Teachta an ch&oacute;nascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman &aacute; bh&iacute; molta.  D&rsquo;imigh s&eacute; sin agus is dea-rud &eacute; go bhfuil an oifig ag seasamh as a stuaim f&eacute;in.  <br/><br/>Fillfidh m&eacute; go han-sciobtha ar cheist a chuir an Teachta Connolly faoi bhreis cumhachta&iacute;.  Tagann an cheist sin isteach leis an gceist a chuir an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Faoin mh&eacute;id at&aacute; beartaithe faoi l&aacute;thair, beidh r&oacute;l monat&oacute;ireachta ag an oifig ar achtach&aacute;in eile chomh maith le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, rud nach bhfuil ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  <br/><br/>D&rsquo;iarr an Teachta Connolly orm an bhfuil rud breise &aacute; lorg agam.

Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta Aindrias Moynihan, t&aacute;imid ar fad ag tn&uacute;th leis an mBille.  Beidh s&eacute; os comhair na D&aacute;la an tseachtain seo chugainn go bhfios d&uacute;inn.  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh moill orainn.  Bh&iacute; pl&eacute; an-fhada againn, t&aacute; ceisteanna m&oacute;ra le freagairt agus muna n-&eacute;ir&iacute;onn linn d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo tiocfaimid ar ais chucu.  T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht le bheith againn agus glacaim leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Chambers, agus le gach duine eile go mbeidh muid in ann cr&iacute;och a chur leis cuibheasach gasta sa D&aacute;il agus sa Seanad.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil seans ann go mbeidh s&eacute; achtaithe roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Leagadh s&iacute;os am roimhe seo agus n&iacute;or shroicheadh aon spriocdh&aacute;ta go dt&iacute; seo.</p> <p>  &Oacute; thaobh an reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in de, bh&iacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir ag caint faoi na sc&eacute;imeanna agus faoin gcaighde&aacute;n.  An bhfuil aon seans ann go mbeidh moillead&oacute;ireacht i gceist, mar shampla le FSS?  N&iacute;l sc&eacute;im ag FSS faoi l&aacute;thair.  An nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; moill go dt&iacute; go mbeidh na caighde&aacute;in leagtha s&iacute;os?  Ceann de na fadhbanna at&aacute; againne n&aacute; nach bhfuil a fhios againn cad at&aacute; sa chaighde&aacute;n mar n&iacute;l dr&eacute;acht againn ach glacaim leis gur cos&uacute;il leis an mBreatain Bheag a bheidh ann.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin nach mbeidh aon sc&eacute;im n&oacute; riachtanas breise ag FSS go ceann dh&aacute; bhliain eile.  M&aacute; smaoin&iacute;tear air, m&aacute; t&aacute; an Bille achtaithe ag deireadh na bliana beidh an coiste comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus an tAire ag cur an caighde&aacute;n le ch&eacute;ile; mar sin, beidh bliain sa bhreis ann agus ansin p&eacute; lead-in time at&aacute; i gceist.</p> <p>  Bh&iacute; an coiste ag labhairt leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe mar gheall ar earca&iacute;ocht.  Ceann de na ceisteanna a chuir m&eacute; n&aacute; an raibh aon earca&iacute;ocht d&iacute;rithe ar Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; amh&aacute;in ar n&oacute;s col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeltachta n&oacute; col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge.  N&iacute;l agus n&iacute; raibh.  Ceann de na f&aacute;thanna n&aacute; nach raibh polasa&iacute; n&oacute; feachtas earca&iacute;ochta ann le tamall de bhlianta but just n&iacute; raibh siad tar &eacute;is smaoineamh air.  Conas gur f&eacute;idir daoine agus Gaeilgeoir&iacute; a mhealladh isteach sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s chun na poist sin a l&iacute;onadh muna bhfuil s&eacute; sin ann?  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtiocfaidh sin as an obair at&aacute; ar bun againn.</p> <p>  T&aacute; an ceart ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir nuair a deireann s&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; r&oacute;-dh&eacute;anach nuair at&aacute; foirm eisithe n&oacute; nuair at&aacute; rud &eacute;igin d&eacute;anta agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir dul siar air.  Tharla s&eacute; le mo hin&iacute;on agus &iacute; ag filleadh ar scoil i m&iacute; an Mh&aacute;rta i mbliana.  Bh&iacute; foirm de 60 focal &oacute; FSS do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; ag filleadh ar scoil.  Bh&iacute; mise in ann &eacute; a aistri&uacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir nach raibh s&eacute; go hioml&aacute;n cruinn, agus &eacute; a leagan amach i leathuair an chloig.  M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liomsa &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh, ba cheart go mbeadh FSS in ann amhlaidh a dh&eacute;anamh.

I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from the precincts of Leinster House.  As we have two separate sessions in this morning's meeting with eight witnesses, and are limited to a two-hour slot, I propose our normal housekeeping business of minutes, correspondence, etc., be deferred to next week's meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to continue our engagement on the subject of the provision of local employment services.  We have already convened one meeting on this matter prior to the summer recess with the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and today we will hear from union representatives from SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa.  In the second session, we will hear from senior officials from the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses to our first session, which will conclude at 10.30 a.m.  I welcome the following: Mr. John King, deputy general secretary of SIPTU; Mr. Adrian Kane, divisional organiser of SIPTU; Mr. Bernard Fennessy of the SIPTU national jobs club committee; Ms Ashley Connolly, head of division in F&oacute;rsa; Ms Lynn Coffey, assistant general secretary of F&oacute;rsa; and Mr. David Orford, F&oacute;rsa branch chairperson.  </p> <p>  This joint committee recommended in its recent pre-budget submission to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, that local employment services and jobs clubs be maintained in the current model.  As a committee, we appreciate the concerns that a tendering process for employment services could lead to redundancies and the disruption of the service.  From my discussions with staff running these services, there is a genuine fear that the person-centred approach of employment services and jobs clubs will be replaced by a purely placement-focused approach, excluding valuable key aspects of existing services like personal development.</p> <p>  This concern comes in the context of two key publications in the last week on labour market scarring, by the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council and the Oireachtas Parliamentary Budget Office.  Both have highlighted that the scarring effects caused by the pandemic could have prolonged implications for our economy and result in higher long-term employment and lower economic output.</p> <p>  Some sectors have been harder hit than others over the last 18 months but there is no doubt there will be a disproportionate effect on youth unemployment, as well as impacts on longer term unemployment in the form of a wage penalty, diminished skills, limited career prospects and social exclusion.  F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU represent over 350 workers employed in local employment services and jobs clubs throughout the country.  We will hear their concerns on the proposed changes by the Department. </p> <p>  In our second session, we will have the opportunity to question senior officials from the Department of Social Protection on these changes and get a description of the regional employment service tendering process, comparable results achieved by JobPath, Intreo-based services, jobs clubs and the local employment service, and the reason behind the new phased procurement process.  </p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

As the Chair said, SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa represent over 350 workers employed in local employment services, LES, and jobs clubs throughout the country.  Our members have provided a professional service to some of the most marginalised people in the State over the last quarter of a century.</p> <p>  The current model has served communities and jobseekers extremely well since it was established in 1995, building relationships with local employers and tailoring its operations to local circumstances.  It is our strong belief that the tendering process which has now been embarked upon by the Department of Social Protection is deeply flawed, will ultimately lead to an inferior service being provided and will result in job losses for our members employed through the current processes.  We note the committee&rsquo;s position as outlined in its pre-budget submission and that is very much to be welcomed.</p> <p>  I will summarise the advantages of the current model, outline our concerns regarding what is being proposed via Request for Tender 2, RFT 2, and what we have learned from phase 1, summarise our engagement with the Department to date and put a number of requests to the committee.</p><p>Ireland has a mixed economy when it comes to public employment services.  Some services, for example, Intreo, are delivered directly by the State.  Others, including jobs clubs, employability and local employment services, are delivered by community organisations on a cost-met basis, while JobPath and others are operated by private agencies under payment-by-results contracts.  The premise on which the current service provided by community, cost-met providers is based is the belief that unemployed people need help to get back into work and largely would like to work but that they have various barriers in their way to fulfilling their potential via work.  The service has assisted many people to enhance their life outcomes and progress to employment and enterprise through person-centred guidance.</p><p> There are significant differences between the public employment services procured from private agencies via the market and those delivered by community organisations.  JobPath staff are more likely to attribute being on welfare to jobseekers&rsquo; lack of effort, whereas LES and jobs clubs staff are more likely to say that it has to do with circumstances beyond people&rsquo;s control.  In other words, the JobPath view of the world is one where the emphasis on motivating the unemployed to move from welfare to work should be through threats of sanctions and other behavioural policy tools.  That is not me saying that; it is the finding of an attitudinal study done by Maynooth college earlier this year.</p><p> The commissioning of JobPath was one of the first times public employment services had been commissioned in Ireland through competitive tendering for payment-by-results contracts.  The Department of Social Protection's decision to procure regional employment services, RES, in a similar fashion is indicative of what is to come via RFT 2.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, both in D&aacute;il debates and in responses to many parliamentary questions, has stated her Department would take learnings from RFT 1.  This first phase was for four new proposed regional employment services.  What we have learned is that some of the existing community-based organisations did not believe it was tenable for them to bid for the contract, due primarily to the financial risk that would result to the organisations.  That came to pass particularly in the case of Laois-Offaly.  Our members employed in these organisations now face being made redundant at the end of the year.</p><p> The position of jobs clubs, especially independent ones, is very precarious.  That is an issue we can expand upon in our discussion.</p><p> The Minister and Department have stressed that there has been significant engagement with the sector to date.  It must be noted that the Department only formally met the trade unions, along with the ILDN, on 17 September.  We had been advised by Department officials that any engagement offered before this date with the trade unions would be by means of briefings.  Although we do not claim to speak for the employers in the sector, we have been informed that this has largely been their experience also.  While the Department will point to numerous meetings, the ability to alter and influence direction of policy formation and implementation up to the tripartite meeting held on 17 September has been negligible.  At that meeting, the Department officials advised us and the ILDN that the principal reason the Department had embarked on the public tendering process was the necessity to comply with EU law in respect of public procurement.  When we asked if this advice would be shared with us the officials informed us that the advice was not shareable.  We have not been informed as to what principles of law, EU directives, Acts, sections, paragraphs of said directives or Acts the tendering process is being designed to address.  We have merely been told that the Department has received "strong" advice from the Attorney General and Chief State Solicitor that the course of action it has undertaken was necessary in order to comply with EU law.</p><p> This has left the union side in an impossible position.  We have not had sight of the legal opinion.  We are not, therefore, in an informed position to rebut the legal argument.  We strongly argue that the legal issues need to be shared, discussed and interrogated.  A defence for such a radical marketised approach to public employment services based on meeting EU requirements is, we believe, a dangerous position to adopt.  The consequences of such an approach, in other words, laying the blame on the EU for policy formation and implementation, played out to deadly effect in the Brexit referendum.  It is not a politically sound approach to public policy formation and implementation in the long run.</p><p> I will set out our asks to the committee.  We are looking for a stakeholder forum.  The trade unions and the ILDN have stated on numerous occasions that they are not against change in the current structure of public employment services.  However, it is imperative there is buy-in from all the stakeholders concerned.  In recent years, our democracy has become more dynamic and participative.  We are a more inclusive republic because of these developments.  Citizens' assemblies, plebiscites on establishing elected mayors and various commissions on pensions and tax reform have all been important experiments in deepening participative democracy.  We also note the commitment in the programme for Government to develop "sectoral social dialogue".  Where better to commit to a process of sectoral social dialogue than in the community sector?</p><p> We need to build consensus around the future provision of public employment services.  Marketisation of this essential social service does not have popular support, either among the public or their elected representatives.  It is necessary to halt the tendering process and commence a wider debate about future provision.  We are proposing a stakeholders' forum, comprising community-based organisations, service users, elected representatives, workers&rsquo; representatives and academics.  The composition and structure of such a forum would ultimately rest with the Government but it needs to be inclusive and comprised of representatives of legitimate interests in the future evolution of public employment services.</p><p> On workers&rsquo; welfare, SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa are the two principal unions which organise in the community sector.  Together, we represent in excess of 10,000 workers across the entire sector.  Regrettably, although many of these workers are in employments which are, in the main, funded by public moneys, their conditions of employment are typically precarious and they are often poorly paid.  We have been engaged in some interminable disputes across the sector.  Restoration of pay in section 39 employments is ongoing, pension provision for community employment supervisors arising from the non-implementation of a Labour Court recommendation, which has been outstanding since 2008, is still ongoing, and we have the current dispute involving local employment services and jobs clubs employees.</p><p> Our members across the community sector have not received any pay increases over the past 12 years.  Many have experienced pay cuts.  Few have pensions.  Many are on temporary or fixed-term ones.  The only viable resolution for endemic precarious employment in the sector is the establishment of a collective bargaining forum with State participation to resolve industrial relations disputes which has the capacity to address terms and conditions of employment in the sector.  If the current tendering process proceeds, it will lead to further downward pressure on terms and conditions.  That applies even if community-based organisations were to win the contract, such is the precarious nature of the tender being offered.  We want to have this structural change and stakeholder forum.</p><p> On the reform of the current tendering process, we have outlined our principal objections, the necessity to halt the current tendering process and the need to put in place a stakeholders' forum.  However, it is necessary to outline the specific failings from RFT 1 which must be addressed in RFT 2.  These issues include the upfront payments to mitigate financial risk, referral numbers, including a mechanism to deal with self-referrals, a dialogue process and time-lines.  Members will have seen the lengthier submission we made so I will conclude at this point.</p></speech>

F&oacute;rsa welcomes the opportunity to address the committee.  Members will have seen F&oacute;rsa's submission on the public employment services.  More than 400 workers are employed in local employment services and jobs clubs throughout the country.  As with most community services, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU trade unions have dual representation rights across the sector.  The unions have agreed to write individual submissions in an effort to impress upon the committee the grave concerns of our members about the proposed changes in the way the future contracts for service providers take place, without any interventions from all relevant stakeholders.  The specific issue is the proposals that the services of public employment services are to be issued through the RFT 2 process.</p> <p>  At present, there are three models in the provision of public employment services in Ireland.</p><p>These include the Intreo services, provided by direct employees of the Department of Social Protection and JobPath, provided by two private for-profit companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.  In April 2019, the D&aacute;il voted by a margin of 81 to 42 to close this model.  It has been extended twice but is due to close at the end of 2021.  The third model is a social model comprising the local employment service and jobs clubs.  There are approximately 23 local employment services across 82 locations and 40 jobs club throughout Ireland.  These are all not-for-profit companies, the majority of which have charitable status.  </p><p> The existing not-for-profit organisations have provided these services to people within our communities who, for one reason or another, find that they need assistance to engage with employment, either for the first time or when they seek to return to the workforce following a prolonged absence.  They provide a wrap-around service designed to assist in every way they can.  Their objective is to help people to become job-ready so that there are no cultural, psychological, physical or emotional barriers preventing them from entering the workplace.  These organisations support people who are on the live register in addition to providing support to anyone in the community placed furthest away from the labour market.  Our members have been providing these services to the most vulnerable in our communities for over 25 years and they have been doing it well.  The social model that characterises these services does not require them to turn service users into a commodity to ensure profit margins.  The not-for-profit approach allows them to measure their success in terms of meaningful outcomes for service users.  That is the model we are seeking to protect because it is the one that works. </p><p> Reports cited in the F&oacute;rsa submission refer to for-profit models used in the UK and elsewhere which are characterised by lesser terms and conditions for the staff who provide the service.  This has the effect of downgrading the services provided by applying pressure on the inexperienced, low-skilled staff to get results, no matter what the outcome.  We have seen this happen in Ireland previously with JobPath.  At that time, the trade unions opposed its for-profit, payment-by-result model for the provision of public employment services.</p><p> F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU represent a wide range of sectors in communities.  Both unions have consistently highlighted the hazards of putting our community and social services into a for-profit model.  Turning the services and service users into a commodity has been proven, time and again, to be simply unworkable.  Our message to the committee today is that we must put the service users first, particularly at this time when the pandemic has inflicted so much damage on the labour market, as the Chairman alluded to in his opening statement.</p><p> As stated by my colleague, what we are seeking from this committee is that due consideration be given to our statements and the proposed tendering process paused.  Without a predetermined outcome, we are asking the Department to engage in a meaningful and inclusive way with representatives from the service providers, the service users, the employee representatives and academic experts and that this is done with an ethos consistent with the social platform. </p></speech>

The committee has looked at this issue over many months.  I have received a lot of communication and correspondence on it, particularly from the Ennis-based jobs club and people working in the local employment service in Limerick.  It is an emotional issue because the services provided are person-centred and have delivered results on the ground.  I empathise with the witnesses' position and support it.  I note their concerns in relation to the legal situation around this and what they have been advised.  We will certainly ask officials and the Minister about that.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Kane to expand further on the situation in Laois-Offaly and the predicament in which the service found itself in not being in a position, legally, to submit a tender.  I ask him to explain why the service felt it could not submit a tender in the context of financial risk.</p> <p>  On the issue of pausing the tendering process and conducting a dialogue with all of the stakeholders, what would the trade unions bring to the table to make the tender process more workable from a community perspective?  What would make it more workable?  The witnesses said the unions would like to see a uniform system across Ireland as some counties do not currently have these services.  What would make the tender process more workable for the witnesses?</p></speech>

The community-based organisations in Laois-Offaly did not believe they were in a position to tender because of the construction of tender one, the financial risks that would befall the organisations and the capital that was needed, in terms of money upfront, to provide the service.  They took the decision, having been in that space for in excess of 20 years, that they could not continue because they were not in a position to submit a tender.  Some other organisations took a different decision but the Laois-Offaly organisation believed it was not in a position to apply for the tender.  These are experienced and professional people who have been providing the service for over 20 years.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Mr. Fennessy, who works for an independent jobs club, to explain why that decision was made.</p> <p>  On the question of reform, it is important to note that our principal request is that this process be halted.  If it is not halted, we will be left in a very difficult position.  I am sure the Department will tell committee members that it is in a tendering process and cannot have formal consultation with us and community-based organisations because it may disadvantage private parties who are interested in the tender.  We are caught in a bind.  Whatever discussion we have, if the playing field is left unaltered, will be very limited.  That is what members will hear from Department officials when they appear before the committee.  I do not believe the timelines for a new tender for the new year can be met, so why not roll over for a long period?  That would allow us to have a deeper engagement than we have had to date.  I will ask Mr. King to respond on RFT 2.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.655" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021092900002#C00800"><p>Deputy Carey asked why some of the existing providers did not tender, what were the restrictive pieces around that and why we think that will play out even more significantly in tender two.  We have told the Department that we believe, on the basis of current trajectory, that we are heading for a crash here.  The result of that crash will not deliver for the service users or the staff and will result in significant job losses and redundancies.</p> <p>  I know, following extensive engagement with workers and individuals at chief executive level in some of these companies, that they do not have confidence that the proposed tendering process is going to work.  The Department will say that they can all tender.</p><p>That is true, but the difficulty is they cannot tender because of the restrictive pieces around the tender, particularly financial.  If you imagine somebody who has just recently been made unemployed and who goes into an Intreo office, if that person is highly skilled he or she is likely to be employed pretty quickly because they have got the skill set.  A payment model based on getting that person a job might deliver finance.  Following being in Intreo for a while, that person will then go to a private provider who will get a second opportunity.  If that provider finds a job for the person, it will get a financial capacity.  The LES and jobs clubs providers will get, for want of a better word, a third layer and they are the people most distanced from the market.  They will be the clients and service users most in need of support to become employable.  A financial model only based on giving State support when a person gets a job will not deliver the finances to make those companies sustainable.  That is why they will not tender.  We will have many areas that will not tender.  We may have some areas that will tender but they will have to cut their cloth so significantly that the effect of the tendering will mean they will have to shed many jobs in many areas.  Those are the significant pieces around why there are concerns about it.<br/><br/>Mr. Kane mentioned this situation will lead to a transfer of risk from a net cost basis to a payment model.  What do we think will happen?  Mr. Kane mentioned we are very close to the end of the year.  The new model is supposed to be in place on 1 January next year.  We think the Department should pause this process to allow significant time for the stakeholder engagement piece we mentioned so we can try to build confidence within the existing providers to be able to make sustainable tenders.  It would be an absolute nightmare scenario if companies tendered, realised five or six months later that they were no longer sustainable and are forced to wind up.  Apart from the fact people would be made redundant at that stage, large parts of the country would be abandoned and would have no employment services at all.  We would like to use the time within a pausing of the process to design a system that works for the service user and the State, and allows for elements of private sector involvement, but protects that piece, which is an essential base for the community provider<i><font color="#2A2A2A"></font></i><i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the local employment service and the jobs clubs.</p></speech>

With regard to the Deputy's question on uniform access throughout the country, that is what RFT 1 has brought.  It brought some agencies into parts of the country where they did not previously exist.  We were told at the time that they were brought in on a green site, but it turned out there were some jobs clubs that suffered because of that.  Those jobs clubs have now closed because they could not tender for that process.  We have lost more than 180 years' worth of experience brought by the people working within those jobs clubs.  There were eight people altogether, with not less than 20 years' experience each, working within this area in helping people who are the most vulnerable and most removed from the labour market, enabling them to get back into some form of work and assisting them in getting to that goal.</p> <p>  At the moment, as we come through the pandemic, we will have unemployment scarring, especially with our youth.  As my colleague, Mr. King said, if we continue this way, the LES clubs, which at some sort of stretch or another tendered for these contracts, will no doubt end up not being able to continue within a year to 18 months.  They will not be able to provide the service to the standard they currently are, they will not be able to hold existing staffing levels, they will not be able to retain staff at the professional level they exist at the moment because there will be better-paid jobs out there that these people will be able to go to.  </p> <p>  Studies have shown that, under the for-profit model, staffing mainly comes from low-skilled, retail workers who end up trying to deliver these services as best they can, through no fault of their own.  It is the wages they are paid, which are really a race to the bottom.  When it comes to our most vulnerable people, we cannot stand by and allow the risk of more of them falling between the cracks as we go forward in 2021 because the Department has adopted a mindset that it will not engage with the stakeholders.  That is imperative.  </p> <p>  As my colleague, Mr. Kane said, the date was meant to be 1 January 2022.  We will not see that date.  It would be crazy to push it out by another month or two.  Let us take this time, let us invest in this and let us invest in the people we need to look after.  That is the kind of country and society we are.  My colleague, Mr. Orford, would like to have a word on what I was saying.   </p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for attending.  During the meeting that took place with Department officials last week, which was the first time they met with the trade unions, was it acknowledged there would be job losses?  Was that acknowledged by officials at that meeting?  Were the trade union representatives left with any hope as regards any changes or learnings to be taken from the first and second tenders?</p> <p>  I presume a major barrier to existing local employment services and jobs clubs even clubbing together to go for this first tender was the annual turnover requirement included in that tender.  The witnesses also mentioned upfront costs.  Given that many of these companies have charitable status, was the turnover requirement raised as an issue?  While the Department has mentioned quality and reputation, companies are disqualified immediately if they do not meet that requirement and that is a gamble for many of them. </p></speech>

There did not seem to be much hope, or thought, at all for the people who had provided this service for the past 25 years and who had invested so much of their time into the communities.</p> <p>  On the existing LES and the annual turnover issue, the companies have charitable status and will not have the money upfront to go forward for tenders.  I said that previously.  In an effort to keep it quick, I will not rehash what I said. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.663" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021092900002#D00800"><p>To briefly respond to the Deputy's questions, the answer is "yes", as my colleague from F&oacute;rsa said.  The Department officials expect job losses and they admitted that.  They are prepared, and certainly would have signalled to us, for some movement on referrals, access, moneys upfront, etc.  The point I will stress to the committee is that we find ourselves in the position that unless this process is paused, halted and existing contracts are extended for a rollover period - a year would be reasonable - any further engagement we have with the Department will be on the basis of it stating that the tendering process is at play and it cannot engage with us in any significant way because it is in that tendering process and it could disadvantage private sector concerns.</p><p>That is the difficult bind.  I have no doubt the argument that will be repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>when the committee hears the Department's side of the story is that it is too late to engage and, in any case, did officials not speak frequently with the unions.  They did not.  There was no sense of parity of esteem in the development of this.  We were talked down to.  In meetings attended by the trade union side, we were told in no uncertain terms by the Department officials, up to the meeting of 17 September, that they ere briefing us and telling us what was happening but they were not giving us an opportunity to influence the process.</p></speech>

Why do we need to change something that has worked well for 25 years?  As the Department has said, there are procurement issues.  My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, mentioned that there is an issue with procurement in many areas.  The size of tenders is a major issue for smaller organisations which are not able to meet the criteria.</p> <p>  In Roscommon-Galway, where I come from, the local employment service is necessary because people always fall through the net.  There is no question that people will fall through the net and be left behind.  I cannot emphasis enough how important this service is in counties such as Roscommon and Galway.</p> <p>  Some people can go for interviews and fail time after time.  They may be intelligent and good workers but they just cannot get through the interview process.  The local employment service is very important in that context.  If we are to treat all the children and people of the nation equally, we need to ensure the service continues.</p> <p>  There is obviously an issue with redundancy costs.  My information is that these costs could run to between &euro;10 million and &euro;12 million.  In their conversations with the Department, have the trade unions raised this issue and, if so, what has been the response?  Redundancy is a significant cost that must be taken into account.</p> <p>  Another issue is that this service is provided by local groups in the charity sector.  The new process does not suit them and they cannot apply for the contract with the change that is proposed.  The main issue is redundancy because I understand it is a major cost factor.</p></speech>

I am also a jobs club facilitator and I operate on the ground.  I am also representing my local employment service colleagues.</p> <p>  The model that has been proposed for dealing with long-term employed will not work.  People are long-term unemployed for a reason.  While the contract states this will be a four-year contract with a review after three years, really you will get a year with a long-term unemployed person.  If unemployed persons have come through all the different sections already, there will be a lot of unwinding required for them before we can get them focused and back into what should be sustainable employment.  We have 25 years' experience in this area and we know the model provided will not allow us to achieve turnaround in that time.  From that point of view, this model will fail to deal with people who have been unemployed a long time for a reason.  It takes time but it has been proved again and again that if you put time into these wonderful people, you will get the turnaround.  The bottom line is that the barriers are so deep that it would be impossible for us to work with them in that way.</p> <p>  The people on the ground who deliver the service have never been asked by the Department how to run the service.  Would it not make sense to ask the people on the ground with 25 years' experience how to put a better service together?  It strikes me that the Department did not ask us for a reason, that being it would not get the answer it wanted.</p> <p>  I thank members for their backing but we need people to listen and we also need an all-inclusive engagement.</p></speech>

I work for a local development company in the north Dublin area.  We have been operating a local employment service and a jobs club since 1995.  We have approximately 28 staff working between the jobs club and the LES.  Many of them have been with the company since the beginning.  They are highly-skilled and highly-experienced staff.  I recently asked our financial controller to work out the cost of statutory redundancy if we did not procure a contract and if we had to make our staff redundant.  The cost was &euro;302,000.  We do not have money to pay that.  The Department has never allowed us to build up a reserve for redundancy or for any other emergency costs.  The attitude of the Department seems to be that it is not the employer, it is not its problem and it is for us to sort out.  The cost of redundancy is a very serious concern.  If we take account of all the local employment services in the country, it amounts to a substantial sum of money.  There has been no guidance from the Department on how this is to be addressed.</p></speech>

Members of the committee have raised this matter with the Minister a number of times, including through parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il.  She repeatedly comes back with the argument on EU procurement rules and states the Attorney General has copper-fastened this.  It will be very difficult to push this along.  I will support the call for a pause.  The Minister will be before he House to take questions next week.  I am sure members will table questions on the issue and apply as much pressure as much as we can.</p> <p>  The number of workers involved, at approximately 400, is not significant from the point of view of having an impact on the Minister.  What are the unions doing in the area of industrial relations to apply pressure to the Minister who seems to be gung-ho about implementing this proposal, even though we have raised the issue of EU procurement rules with her?</p></speech>

I agree the Minister appears to be gung-ho in going forward with this.  When it comes to EU procurement, there are other social models.  I referred in my submission to the social platform.  We have asked for a stakeholder group to be established and we are seeking to have that done with the ethos of the social platform, which allows for social services.  There are particular provisions in place for the delivery of contracts for social services.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins noted that the workforce of 400 is small.  It is important to note that this small workforce has delivered very effective outcomes.  The local employment service was set up under partnership in 1995-96.  The number of people it has helped and brought through cannot be measured because there is no profit margin to measure it.  We do not need a profit margin to measure it.  However, we can see the difference it has made in the areas and communities in which we live, particularly underprivileged areas.</p> <p>  The Minister has cited EU procurement rules and the advice she has received from the Attorney General.  As my colleague stated, this makes it very hard for us because the Minister is not willing to share that advice with us.  How are we meant to understand what the Minister is saying if she will not share the information?</p></speech>

They do not appear in the new tender.  They were just dropped.  To give the members an idea of value for money, the average person who is unemployed earns approximately &euro;10,000 a year in social welfare payments.  The dearest jobs club probably costs &euro;150,000.  The maths are simple.  The cost of the jobs club is covered by 15 people being placed into full employment.  Everything else represents a positive return to the State.  Across the country, jobs clubs, with their local employment service colleagues, have consistently delivered value for money.  Despite this, jobs clubs were dropped from the equation.  Independent jobs clubs were told to go to the local development company or partnership and ask whether they could be taken on board.  These bodies cannot even make the figures match up for their own LES colleagues, never mind adding on a jobs club.  Why would such a cost-effective model be dropped?  That is a question that has to be asked.  It makes no sense.</p></speech>

It is very important that we try to get that message out there.  The services are important for the workers, particularly those in Empower in my own area whom I met quite often, including at their recent protest.  I fully support the pause to provide an opportunity to hold a stakeholder forum.</p> <p>  Regardless of what the service is, all services can be improved.  I was listening to "Morning Ireland" this morning and Jenny from the north inner city, the area where I was reared, was speaking.  The message she delivered about how person-centred services can make great differences is very important.  It is about placement through the service but it is also about follow-up to ensure that people who are feeling a little bit nervous or rattled about what is coming down the line for them can pick up the phone and talk to a person who genuinely cares about them.  I do not believe a profit-led private service can deliver that type of service to people.  It is important that we do not criticise those who work in these services, as was mentioned.  They are put under pressure to deliver and to get people in and out quickly so that profits can be maximised.  That is absolutely outrageous.</p> <p>  It is also ironic that the Government and Minister are hiding behind the Attorney General's legal advice.  I have requested that the committee seek advice from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, our own service, and that has been agreed to.  That will be critically important.  Let us also remind ourselves that the Attorney General released advice regarding the Merrion Hotel issue, so there is precedent.  Advice can be released when it suits the Government.  Have the trade unions sought legal advice on this matter?  What is the legal advice with regard to public procurement?  The Government is claiming that it is necessary for these services to go out to a public tender.</p></speech>

I am acutely aware of the great work they do.  I deal with them on a daily and weekly basis.  I am very much aware of the cost model involved and of the problems regarding a payment-by-results model.  I deal with that issue as well, unfortunately.</p> <p>  I will concentrate on the meeting with the Department on 17 September.  My issue relates to the 25 years of service that others have mentioned and the relationship with local employers, which is critical to this service.  In the discussions with the Department, was there any discussion of the social benefit or social contract that may accrue from these services and which may be lost?  Have any other countries gone through this and found that the social benefit outweighed any EU directive?  That is a very important argument and one that we may have with the Department in the next hour.  Will the two unions reply to both of those questions?</p></speech>

I do not see too many Government members here.  I would be very happy to convey the importance of this meeting directly to the Minister today.  I take it the Chair will be preparing a report to inform the Minister of the matters that have arisen and the information that has been given.  If the Minister has legal advice, it is important and only fair that it be shared, regardless of where it comes from, because it seems the Government is relying upon it.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that we have.  We have balloted for both industrial action and strike action.  These motions were carried overwhelmingly.  We reserve the right to take such action if all else fails.  We have had a couple of protest campaigns and we intend to keep them going.  We have been seeking a meeting with the Minister for the past 18 months.  The first time we sent the Minister formal correspondence was in February or March 2020.  We have not been given a direct meeting with the Minister.  We have had an engagement with the Department, which has been referred to.  Had we had a meeting with the Minister, we would have been able to explore the policy element, that is, this issue around the legal advice and so on.  However, when we talk to Department officials, we are told the policy decision has already been made.  We are trying to influence that policy to try to make it look as good as possible.</p> <p>  As to whether we have sought our own legal advice, we have not yet done so.  That is one of the reasons we want to see the legal advice being relied upon.  That would give us an opportunity to focus any advice we might seek.</p> <p>  Senator Wall asked about the issue of social benefit.  We have put that loudly and clearly to the Department officials and in various correspondence with the Minister.  We believe that some of the European legislation on procurement allows for states to be flexible when considering social policy initiatives, developments and so on.  The timeframe has been paused as we look at this and we believe that there could be scope to arrive at an amicable solution that delivers for the State but also for the employees, the existing providers and, most importantly, those who will require local employment services and jobs clubs in the future.  We appreciate Deputy Flanagan indicating that he would bring the issues raised in this most important meeting to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

On the question regarding seeking our own legal advice, as I stated, it is very hard for us to see what the Minister is citing as legal advice when she will not share it with us.  I thank Deputy Donnelly for noting that there is precedent for the sharing of advice in the other case he mentioned.</p> <p>  We were asked whether this procurement issue had arisen in other countries.  In Belgium, ways to deliver social service contracts have been developed that are acceptable to EU legislators.  This relates to cleaning services and so on as well.  Social services in these areas have been allowed to continue delivering services.  There have been situations in other countries within the EU in which the EU procurement legislation has allowed people living in those countries to benefit.</p> <p>  I will go back to what Mr. King said about the social benefit.  Did we impress this point on the officials at the meeting on 17 September?  We most certainly did.  We informed the Department of the relationships that have been built within these communities over a 25-year period and which took a long time to establish.</p><p>They are established.  They are walk-in centres for people.  As Deputy Donnelly said, it is about being able to lift the phone and do follow-ups.  It is about being able to have a conversation and ask people how they are getting on, how they found an interview, how the service can help them to go further and if there is anything else they need, including further training.  The private model will not provide this because these are not the results the private model is looking for.  The only result the private model is looking for is profit.  In the social model we are looking after people.</p></speech>

We have with us Mr. Niall Egan, assistant secretary, and Mr. Chris Kane, principal officer.  They are both very welcome.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Chris Kane, principal officer in the Department's contracted public employment services unit.  We provided the information requested by the committee in advance of today's meeting and are happy to clarify or elaborate on any matters of interest or concern the committee may have.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of income supports and other services to people across the State.  This includes the provision of the public employment service, which supports individuals in transitioning into employment, upskilling or securing alternative employment opportunities.  The public employment service is delivered through the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service comprising its own staff working in Intreo centres, together with our external service partners, including the local employment service, jobs clubs, JobPath service providers and Employ Ability.</p> <p>  Support is delivered through Intreo case officers and our service partners engaging with individuals on a one-to-one basis to identify their requirements, their skills gaps and suitable education, training or employment opportunities.  All of these services also work with employers to promote recruitment of people from the live register, people with disabilities and members of other groups.  The goal in all this activity is to support people make a successful transition from welfare to employment, either directly or by progression through training, education and employment schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s.</p> <p>  The Department recognises the valuable work of all its service partners in assisting those who are unemployed to transition successfully into sustained full-time employment.  However, the employment services currently delivered by the local employment service and job clubs are not available nationwide.  In areas where these services do not exist individuals have fewer employment service options.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Government published its employment services strategy, Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  This is a comprehensive strategy consists of 83 commitments with the aim of reducing long-term unemployment, reducing youth unemployment, improving labour market transitions and ensuring better labour market outcomes for all.  Crucially, it contains commitments to expand the caseload capacity of the public employment service and maintain the resource capacity of contracted service provision, while increasing the resources to deliver a regional employment service nationwide.</p> <p>  In late 2019, the Department commenced a review of the public employment service delivered by Intreo and our service partners.  This review built on several earlier reviews conducted by Indecon consultants separately into both the local employment services and job clubs, and by the Department in conjunction with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  As part of the review of the public employment service, the Department engaged extensively with all service partners both collectively and separately and with their representative organisations.  Separately, the Department engaged external consultants, the Institute of Economic Studies and the Social Finance Foundation, which consulted the Department&rsquo;s existing service partners.</p> <p>  Following on from this review, the Indecon reviews and in line with the commitments in the Pathways to Work strategy, the Department is making some changes to how it contracts external services, including those currently provided by the local employment service, jobs clubs and JobPath.  The contracts for all of these services end for new referrals at the end of this year.  This provides an opportunity to implement changes arising from the review process.  It also enables the Department to place the services on a proper contractual footing.  The existing arrangements for the local employment service and jobs club services extend back over 20 years, with no formal procurement taking place in this period.  This is in contravention of good governance and public procurement practice, a fact that has been commented on by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Attorney General has also advised that these services must be procured in line with EU and national public procurement rules by means of open and competitive tendering processes.</p> <p>  The Department has, therefore, commenced a phased procurement process which, based on the review undertaken, will see the delivery of a new national employment service and a multi-lot regional employment service to consolidate existing local employment services and jobs clubs and extend the new service nationwide.  The aim is to ensure that, as set out in Pathways to Work, there is sufficient employment service capacity across the State to support those who require access to employment assistance and advice.  These new services will deliver a more integrated customer journey between the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and that provided by its service partners; deliver a consistent range of employment services to customers nationwide; target specialised resources at individuals who are furthest from the labour market and require access to a wider range of supports and services for longer; provide employment services for a range of cohorts; and comply with EU and national procurement law.</p> <p>  The Department recognises that these changes are of concern to all existing service providers.  For this reason, the Department is anxious to ensure they are implemented in a careful and phased manner that, while being compliant with procurement rules, enables us to build on the existing capabilities of the service providers.  The phased approach, using a limited first phase tender, is also intended to enable learnings to be taken and incorporated into a second phase of procurement.  The Department commenced this process with the procurement, via a request for tender, RFT, of the regional employment services in four geographical lots in the north west and midlands, across seven counties, none of which currently has a local employment service.  In designing this RFT the Department, based on feedback during the review, prioritised community and social linkages as a key criterion and set pricing parameters that, for example, guarantee service provider income in respect of a referral of a guaranteed number of clients each year.  This phase 1 procurement is still ongoing and nearing completion with the successful bidders to be announced shortly.</p> <p>  The Department is committed to considering the experience arising from the phase 1 procurement in preparing the request for tenders for the remaining lots for the regional employment service under phase 2 of the procurement process.  We are also in ongoing dialogue with the various service providers and representative groups, including staff representatives, and will consult further with them before finalising the phase 2 procurement.</p> <p>  One of the learnings we have already taken is that providers are exploring ways to work collaboratively to provide high quality service and coverage as part of the service consolidation.  Accordingly, to enable providers sufficient time to explore these options the Department is reviewing the timelines for the completion of the roll-out of the regional employment service procurement.  Towards this end and to ensure continuity of service to our clients, it is intended to extend current contracts in the phase 2 areas for a short period into next year.  The request for tenders will issue prior to the year end and we will write to all providers shortly outlining the revised phase 2 procurement timelines. </p> <p>  I have set out briefly the Department&rsquo;s approach to the provision of employment services and how the current approach seeks to deliver the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work commitments, while ensuring that high-quality employment services are procured in a manner consistent with procurement law.  My colleague and I will be happy to address any queries the committee may have.</p></speech>

A number of issues arise, including the legal advice received by the Minister on this issue.  Will Mr. Egan please go back over that and explain what legal advice the Department received requiring it to bring these services to tender?</p> <p>  Can the phase 2 tender be framed in such a way that local community service providers will get priority and secure the contract?  How is it pitched?  Is a local community's track record included as a high-scoring criterion in the tender?</p><p>The tender needs to be designed favourably in respect of the local organisations given their long track record.  Can Mr. Egan confirm whether this is the position?  Has there been dialogue around that?</p><p> Mr. Egan maintains there is significant dialogue between the Department and the various stakeholders, but the latter are telling us otherwise.  They want meaningful engagement and a stakeholder forum.  Is the Department open to engaging in a more meaningful arrangement?  That is what the stakeholders want.  They want to come to some sort of agreement with the Department in order that they can move on with something workable for both sides and the employees and clients.</p></speech>

The legal advice is based on the EU Directive No. 2014/24 on procurement.  It is clear that due to the employment service provision that exists in the market for the provision of employment services to the long-term unemployed, there is a mixed market in play.  On foot of that, there is a requirement that all services, when they come up for renewal, have to be contracted in an open and competitive tendering process.  We have looked at specific issues in the directive to see whether certain exemptions apply for services of general economic interest.  The advice we have is they do not apply in the context of the services provided by the local employment services.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised phase 2 of the RFT and whether local service providers can get these contracts.  When we go to a procurement, it has to be open and competitive.  Any interested bodies in a position to bid have to be able to bid and to do so fairly.  That is important from a procurement perspective.  There has been extensive engagement with the sector over several years, going back to 2018.  On that basis, we have visited every single provider and asked all the providers what unique services and offering they provide.  We are aware of the important services the local employment services and jobs clubs provide.  We are aware they provide great linkages into the existing communities and have a proven track record with those linkages.  Therefore, we developed the tender under phase 1.</p> <p>  From the Department's perspective, we could have produced a simple tender, based on costs.  We do not do that.  It is a most economically advantageous tender process.  Quality is very much weighted, with 75% of total marks going to quality.  Of that, 23% goes to social value, proven track record on networking and building relationships and the important role of building services that wrap around the customer.  Given the proven track record some of the providers have, they should be in a strong place to tender on those grounds.</p> <p>  In terms of meaningful dialogue, we have had extensive engagement with the sector.  We had a meeting on 17 September.  There have been four meetings between SIPTU and senior departmental officials, three of which predated the September meeting.  Since 2018, we have had constant engagement with the Irish Local Development Network, which has been briefing its members on foot of the engagements we have had.  In addition, we have also liaised and consulted with the non-affiliated ILDN members, such as the independent jobs clubs and the three local employment services not affiliated with the ILDN.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021092900002#H00500"><p>Does Mr. Egan acknowledge that the model outlined in the first tender ends the community-based, not-for-profit model that has existed for 25 years and also that the Department is closing the door to walk-ins?  Mr. Egan cited two pieces of legal advice on the obligation to tender in the first instance.  If he cannot share or is not willing to share either of them, will he share what the Department sought when requesting that legal advice?  What was the question asked?  If we take it that this unseen advice is exactly as Mr. Egan says, then why not maintain the current model?  It has been said repeatedly that the local employment services and jobs clubs do not exist everywhere, but there was no reason or obligation for the model having to change, through procurement or otherwise.  If we take as read Mr. Egan's position on the legal advice and the need to tender, why change the model?  Why move from the community-based, not-for-profit model to an entirely different model?</p> <p>  Mr. Egan place a major focus on consultation and engagement.  During that process, did staff suggest a change in the model at any point over the years?  Did they suggest we end the service for walk-ins, wrap-around services and the community basis of the service?</p> <p>  The tender appears to totally disregard jobs clubs.  I know from engagement with jobs clubs in Ballaghaderreen and Ballinasloe in my constituency, they feel totally disregarded.  A tender has been issued which does not mention them and almost leaves them to one side.  They have been left in a vulnerable position.  These workers, highly-skilled and educated people, have given years of service to people in my constituency, including vulnerable people in Ballaghaderreen and Ballinasloe, and they are being left to one side.  It is regrettable how they and staff throughout the local employment service and jobs clubs have been treated.  I wish a conversation had taken place with them earlier on what exactly would happen at the end of this year.</p> <p>  We know from the unions and staff on the ground that some local employment services and jobs clubs were not in a position to tender because in some areas they do not have an annual turnover of more than &euro;1 million.  Mr. Egan stated that quality is a major focus ad will account for 75% of the weighting.  However, an organisation that does not meet the annual turnover requirements in the first instance is eliminated before the issue of quality is addressed.  While the focus is being put on quality, the financial constraints on these organisations, most of which have charitable status, means the Department is purposefully locking them out by basing the tender, in the first instance, on cost.</p> <p>  Mr. Egan cited the external review of contracted employment services.  That work was done by a university in Bristol.  Has it been published?  If not, we are basing all of this on unseen legal advice and an unseen external review on contracted services and we are supposed to just take Mr. Egan at his word on both.</p> <p>  Mr. Egan also stated it is hoped the service will provide employment services for a range of cohorts.  We know those obliged to engage in employment services are jobseekers.  How will the Department widen that and is that its plan?</p> <p>  The document before us features a table showing the number of people who have taken up employment through JobPath.  Clearly, the only outcome that is taken into account when the Department looks at local employment services, jobs clubs and JobPath is a job.  Any job is the basis of the outcome.  Does the Department count referrals to labour market programmes, training and education or part-time employment across the board, or is it just a job?</p> <p>  Mr. Egan indicated that 70,740 people had found employment through JobPath.  Is that sustained for more than one year?  I imagine it is not.  The table on page 12 is quite misleading.  Will Mr. Egan explain the difference between JobPath and what is being proposed under this first tender?</p></speech>

It will be a national employment service model with a designated area to provide greater flexibility and scope as economic circumstances change, and it will be a regional employment service model specifically designed to focus on supporting those furthest from the labour market.  We acknowledge that cohort requires a different service, and in many cases, as a previous speaker said, 12 months is not sufficient.  In the model we have proposed, it is possible to extend the length of engagement up to 18 months.  There is additional time because we know the individuals we are dealing with are farthest from the labour market.  We are also building into that model recognition of the importance of the existing network for delivering access to other State services to build a wrap-around service for jobseekers and other cohorts.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p><p> On the question on walk-ins, the Department through Intreo already takes in walk-ins across the board.  In any area where there is an existing local employment service, that already happens.  In cases where local employment services exist, we deal with walk-ins as well.  We are adopting a model that is close to the Employ Ability model.  Any individual who seeks access and support to employability, whether he or she goes to the local employment service or jobs clubs, will be referred to Intreo which will do an assessment of the individual and, if appropriate, send him or her to the correct employment service provider.  We believe in the regional employment service, that if the individual is far from the labour market, he or she will be referred back to the regional employment service model.</p><p> We are changing the model because there are serious problems with the fixed-cost approach we have on an annual basis.  That was expressed to us in consultations we had with the sector.  The existing model requires us in the Department and the providers to verify every euro spent on overheads.  There is very little flexibility for providers to innovate in the model or to have security in terms of multi-annual budgeting.  We are changing the model in that regard.  We are enhancing key performance metrics in the model to make services comparable.  We cannot at the moment compare services across the board between different employment service providers.  By the end of this process, we will have that comparability and be able to identify far quicker than we can at the moment service providers who are struggling to support the individuals, whether through progression or placement into employment.</p><p> We consulted every provider extensively.  In many cases, staff members participated in those meetings with officials, but not in all cases.  Members of the board or management were involved in those meetings as well.  The Institute for Employment Studies, which we got in to help us build the future model, consulted nominees from the sector without the Department being present.  We wanted a true, proper engagement for them to speak their mind in relation to consultants.</p><p> On jobs clubs, the services they provide are included in the request for tenders under phase 1.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It is true, given the areas we are covering in multi-county lots, essentially two counties, that there is a significant difference in what the regional employment service is delivering.  It is an intensive employment service engagement for 12 to 18 months.  A jobs club that provides services between one and four weeks for a small cohort would have problems in terms of scaling up.  We have, therefore, since 2018 and when we published the Indecon reports, informed all jobs clubs and local employment services of the need for them to come together and work collaboratively on a future tendering process.  That is clear and it ties in to the Deputy's question on annual turnover.  She is correct to point out that the annual turnover, in the request for tenders under phase 1, is a minimum requirement, but we accept any similar contracts, whether they be community employment, T&uacute;s, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, or the existing contracts as proof and if they combine with other service providers.  A jobs club and a partnership working together should and would be able to meet those annual turnover requirements.</p><p> The Institute for Employment Studies, I think, is the external review the Deputy referred to.  That review has not been published yet.  It contains information we are using on pricing and lot sizes.  It recommends a considerable consolidation of the lots, particularly in the Dublin area.  In the Dublin area it proposes a consolidation of three lots.  At the moment we have 12 local employment service providers.  The Department is carefully considering that because we are aware of the difficulty that having three lots in the Dublin area, which would be Dublin north, Dublin south and Dublin central, would pose to existing providers.  We are actively looking at that.</p><p> The request for tenders under phase 1, it is important to say, had scope within it to provide and send non-long term unemployed jobseekers in relation to it.  It is described as other cohorts.  There is a pricing structure relating to that for providers.  They are informed of the level of resources the Department would provide for that.  From the Department's perspective and in accordance with the commitments contained in Pathways to Work, we want to build an employment service that gives the Department flexibility to support people with disabilities, lone parents, carers or other individuals.  That mechanism is placed within the existing request for tender and we see that continuing into the second phase.</p><p> I will ask my colleague, Mr. Kane, to talk about the JobPath referrals.  On the Deputy's question regarding the figure of 70,740, that is total employment from JobPath.  The figure for sustained employment for a 12-month period is approximately 24,000.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the difference between the model of the regional employment service and JobPath.  They are very different models.  In the JobPath model the only guaranteed income is a referral fee of an average of &euro;311 per individual referred.  They have to engage with that person for 12 months, that is 52 weeks, irrespective of whether that person progresses into employment.  Any subsequent payment is only made if the person secures sustained employment at 13-week intervals.  The model we have for the regional employment service pays 90% of average fees based on a starting and an engagement process.  That engagement process is about progressing and tailoring a service that is unique to the individual.  That may include access to education, training or, as I said in the opening statement, employment support programmes.  There is a 10% performance incentive if that person can be progressed into employment thereafter.  It is almost the inverse of the JobPath model.  I ask Mr. Kane to contribute.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the 70,000.  The table clearly states it was job starts.  The committee asked for comparable stats.  The difficulty is the comparison.  It is difficult to present.  The stats for each of the services are compiled differently because performance in each service is registered differently.  We do not compare them across.  With JobPath, what counts is somebody gets and sustains a job.  We track that person through from the date he or she commences the service.  Local employment services do not do that.  It is much rawer in calculations.</p> <p>  With those tables, we were trying to present job starts.  For the local employment service, jobs clubs and Employ Ability, the only thing we really record is job starts.  We do not track the person or how long he or she stays in the job.  That is what we do in JobPath and that is what we hope to do in the revised regional employment service.  I am happy to go through the stats for JobPath if the Deputy wants.</p></speech>

The first is the independent evaluation.  If the full report cannot be given to us, the committee would like a copy of the report with the commercially sensitive information redacted from it.  The impression has been given to members and groups throughout the country that they can tender for the process but, with the &euro;1 million turnover limit and the objective of amalgamation or reconfiguration, clearly that is not the case and that is new information to the committee.</p></speech>

I would like to take a wider look at this issue.  We can talk about the service providers, but we need to look at the requirements of the people we are trying to serve.  Will Mr. Egan tell me what was the lowest number of people who were registered as unemployed at any time, say, since the year 2000?  In other words, during all the boom times, when jobs were readily available, what was the lowest number of people registered as unemployed we ever got to?  I am not talking about the live register, which is a different issue.  I am talking about people who were registered as unemployed.</p></speech>

Based on this assumption that there are plenty of jobs available at all levels, including in construction, hospitality and so on, does Mr. Egan accept there is a fair number of people in they system who will never get commercial employment, that they might, if we focused on it, get either sheltered employment, or long term employment through schemes such as the T&uacute;s scheme, the community services programme, and so on, and that this dream that all of these people will get commercial employment is only that: a fantasy land?</p></speech>

The labour force has increased substantially since then.  I think the current figure is 2.4 million or 2.5 million people in the labour force.  There is always churn in the labour market.  Even when we were at our peak of full employment with an unemployment figure of 4%, we would still have had a significant component on the live register.  From memory, it was approximately 150,000 people, but maybe not exactly that number.  That number represents two key elements.  One is the churn, which is the normal labour market working in terms of people transitioning in and out of employment and moving between jobs.  Two is probably the cohort the Deputy was referring to, a cohort who would have been long-term or very long-term unemployed.</p> <p>  The Department and Government policy since has been for the Department of Social Protection to take on board the community welfare office and F&Aacute;S services essentially to provide employment services to all individuals who are unemployed, with a particular focus on long-term and very long-term unemployed.  That is the model Intreo has been built up on, and we have worked collaboratively with our external service partners to deliver that.  The Deputy is correct.  There are some individuals who are so distant from the labour market that a job is going to be a very long pathway for them to get to.  However, the Department's policy is to engage with that individual and send him or her to progression opportunities that are best suited to his or her needs.  I have spoken to many individuals within the sector.  That can be just the structure of essentially getting them into a routine again that some of our providers currently provide.  It can also be support employment schemes.  Community employment, T&uacute;s, and the rural social scheme, RSS, are important employment supports for the cohorts the Deputy refers to and can lead to other longer term employment thereafter.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Egan and Mr. Kane for their presentation.  I have a couple of questions.  Mr. Egan in his presentation said he would postpone the process for a short period into the new year.  Will he confirm what a short period is?  Is it a number of months?  Is it the full 12 months?  Will he also commit to the request by both unions which we met earlier that he would postpone this process for 12 months to allow for the best possible consultation between unions, stakeholders, and the Department to formulate policy on that?  Mr. Egan might come back to us on a policy in that regard.</p> <p>  Second, in Mr. Egan's description of what may be contained in RFT 2, he said it was the inverse of the JobPath model.  To me, what he described is what is happening in jobs clubs and local employment networks at the moment.  Why are we going down this road?  Why are we not ensuring and developing the local employment networks as they stand at the moment?</p> <p>  Has the Department has put a cost on losing 25 years of experience that most of those people working in this sector have, as well as the relationship with local employers which has been built up over those 25 years and which is critical to this process working?  What value has the Department put on that?  I would hope that value is far in excess of the &euro;311 per employee Mr. Egan mentioned we are currently giving to the private sector.</p></speech>

In relation to my reference in my opening statement to the postponement, the Department will be writing later today and early tomorrow to all existing local employment service and jobs club contractors that are going to be covered under phase 2 informing them of the need, because of some of the feedback we received from the meeting of 17 September with the ILDA, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU, to give more time for the sector to work together and collaborate, and for partnerships to be developed.  On foot of that, we will be writing to them informing them that we will be giving them a new contract for the first six months of next year.  However, as I said in the opening statement, we are planning to proceed and go ahead with the request for tender for phase 2, with that tender to be issued before year end.  It is important the time is used and is used well.  We are happy to engage constructively and positively with those stakeholders between now and before that tender is issued.  I know a previous speaker said there has been no or little engagement, but we have engaged extensively with the sector on it since 2018.  We have listened very much to what it has had to say about the design and structure we are implementing.</p> <p>  The Senator asked a question about the value put on the 25 years of experience within the sector and the relationships that have been built up with local employers.  We are very aware of that.  We know the excellent service our existing service partners provide in that regard.  We know that experience cannot be replicated by anyone else coming new to the market.  That is why we have, within the RFT, specifically designated so many marks, in terms of the award criteria as part of the evaluation process, to that social value, those existing relationships, and that local community network in relation to the sector.  That is an opportunity for those in the sector to put their best foot forward about their past experience and proven track record and their abilities to access other State supports available outside of the Department that can ultimately lead to a wrap-around service, whether that be health supports, supports via SICAP, or other supports via my Department or other Departments.  We have not come up with a single metric for what that value is, but we believe we have reflected that value in the structure of the RFT under phase 1.  I do not see a direct comparison with the figure of &euro;311 for the JobPath referral, but I may I have mistaken that point.  If I have, I am happy to clarify.</p></speech>

We cannot put a value on the excellent service, the 25 years of experience, and the relationship with local employers that is most critical to this service.

I said initially there is a big difference between the number of people on the live register and the number of people who are unemployed.  There are people coming on to and leaving the live register all the time.  That is well recognised in the Department.  Anybody who checks the figures will note the difference.  Some 40,000 people have not been in employment for a long time and if they were employed, it was for a very short time.  We need to reach out to those people in a comprehensive way.  It will take more time to reach out to them than it will take to reach out to people who would probably get employment even if there was no intervention.  The issue is that the local employment service and jobs clubs focus on the hardest to reach and those who are most remote from the labour market to encourage them to enter those services.  JobPath has had success after success.  Obviously, it focused on the people most likely to get jobs and, in many cases, those people would probably have jobs in any event.</p> <p>  I have two specific questions.  How much is the JobPath model dictated by our EU requirements and obligations.  Can Mr. Egan give us details of those EU obligations?  If they are absolute obligations under EU rules, there is damn all we can do about it.  Mr. Egan said the tendering process is constrained by EU law.  He might forward us a copy of the law - I am not asking for the legal opinion of the EU laws he quoted - to enable us to separate what is Irish law and what is EU law.   Each of us is a Member of the Oireachtas.  If some of the matters are related to issues that arise purely in Irish law rather than EU law, we could suggest to our colleagues that the Oireachtas introduce legislation to change the law in order that tendering could take into account and favour non-profit bodies rather than entities working purely on the basis of the profit motive.  That is one of the big issues that arises.  Multinational companies motivated purely by profit, which have substantial resources to cover tendering, are entering this market and competing with non-profit bodies that operate on the ground, are based locally and might be able to deliver better services.  One of the challenges we face is the obsession in the modern world with measuring everything.  Some of the best things in life are very hard to measure.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Egan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021092900002#L00500"><p>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we need to reach out in a comprehensive way to those who are very long-term unemployed and very distant from the labour market.  The employment service we are building, particularly the regional employment services, will have that mechanism and feature.  That model will be the best placed and have the highest skills set to help those individuals on their journey.  As I said, that journey does and will involve progression into employment, education or employment support programmes, not only employment.  That has been reflected in the regional employment service RFT.<br/><br/>Regarding the JobPath focus on those who are most likely to be placed, I accept the temptation is to see it that way but the contract we have with both JobPath providers, Turas Nua, which is a farm co-operative, and Seetec, which is an employee trust ownership structure, is very much that they must engage with every individual once every 20 days.  We inspect that very carefully.  One of the fears in contracting for public employment services is that people would cream and park, cream being to focus on those closest to the labour market in terms of getting them a job, and park being not engaging with those who are furthest from labour market.  The providers are required to engage with all individuals once every 20 days.  We carefully examine that as part of the management of the contracts.  <br/><br/>It is not the case that the JobPath model,<i>per se</i>, has been dictated by an EU obligation.  When the Department issued the tender for JobPath in 2014, we created an increase of burst capacity to deal with an extraordinary level of unemployment in the Irish labour market at the time.  We were then able to focus and redistribute short-term unemployed individuals who were being dealt with by the Intreo service and that continues to be the case.  Any individual who is long-term unemployed is sent to either JobPath, having been chosen randomly, or he or she can be referred to the local employment service or jobs clubs service.  We are sending long-term unemployed people to those three separate providers which are contracted to provide an employment service.  JobPath and the local employment service are essentially contracted to provide the same service, namely, 12 months of intensive employment service, support and advice.<br/><br/>When it comes to an EU obligation, from a legal perspective it is EU Directive 2014/14, which we will forward to the clerk to the committee, for the members' information.  Essentially, it relates to the provision of that employment service.  On the basis that we tendered for that in 2014, we are required to retender for all employment services on foot of the legal advice we have received to date.<br/><br/>Deputy Donnelly asked about the way we have listened to those involved and the way that can be manifested in the design of the RFT, which we published at the end of May.  There are a few features in that contract.  One of the key lessons we learned from our engagement with the sector was that when we went to market with JobPath we required successful tenders to have significant upfront capital.  There is no such requirement in the phase 1 tender.  The issue of cash flow was also raised as a major concern.  We acknowledge the providers operate on a cost-met structure.  They have a two-month float from the Department and operate on that basis.  We gave a commitment in that respect to all representatives prior to publication.  That is included in the RFT, but I acknowledge it has been overlooked and we need to strengthen it.  We operate all our contracts on a reasonable basis.  We are aware cash flow will be an issue for the new service provision.  We are committed to providing upfront cash flow prior to referral starting for the new services.  <br/><br/>We also considered the issue of lot sizes.  If we were to adopt a cold and calculated approach at a remove from the service, we would have lot sizes that are on a national structure, more akin to the JobPath model of four to five lots.  We are now considering lot sizes realistically nationwide for the regional employment service of around 20.  We have taken that issue on board.<br/><br/>We also considered the issue of multi-annual contracts in the context of the existing model of annual contracts that did not offer certainty and flexibility from year to year.  The multi-annual dimension has been included on foot of what we heard.  The 23% of marks awarded for social value is also important.<br/><br/>In terms of costs, normally, from the Department&rsquo;s perspective, when we procure, our procurement requirements are typically 40% or 45% of costs.  In this procurement, our requirements were 25% of costs.  That is exceptionally low by the Department's standards.  In addition, because we want a high-quality employment service that we know will involve a significant cost, we introduced a minimum cost requirement based on the cost of the delivery of service.  It narrows the cost implications very substantially between a minimum and a maximum.  It reduces the cost requirement.  That is to ensure we protect against low-cost bids and that the cost structure we receive from tenderers reflects the cost of the delivery.  We are confident it does that based on the information we have.</p></speech>

Will it be a case of short-term unemployed people going here and long-term unemployed people going there?  Does he acknowledge that the new model being proposed is moving away from a not-for-profit approach?</p><p> I asked a question on a job being the only outcome counted.  Does the Department count the number of referrals to training and education, community employment and T&uacute;s?  As Mr. Egan explained, the path to a job is longer for some than for others.</p><p> On annual turnover, it seems the figure is not absolutely mandatory.  Given that this is news to me and, I assume, most members of the committee, was that made clear to those going to bid in the first place?  The Chairman suggested that the external review, which I mentioned earlier, be provided to the committee.  The Department can redact pricing and whatever else it may wish to.  Is the Department willing to do that?</p><p> I referred to the table showing figures for JobPath - I understand what the committee looked for - because JobPath is different in that it regards 13 weeks as a job being sustained.  If the Department is saying 24,000 people sustained a job for 12 months or more, given the figure of 376,000 people, or even if we take the 312,000 people who signed a personal progression plan, that indicates a success rate of between 6% and 7%.  I assume the total cost of JobPath to the taxpayer is approaching &euro;300 million.  I know people remain on JobPath and they will be run off and everything else.  However, of the more than 300,000 people referred, at a cost of almost &euro;300 million, the success rate for getting a job that is sustained for more than 12 months, which is not an especially long time in any event, means the rest of the jobs are not being sustained for a year and we are looking at a success rate of 6% to 7%.</p></speech>

However, it is important to note that, again, JobPath rates are recorded on a basis of cohort and when somebody is referred.  There is performance that is not recorded, so we do not fully know the position.  Of the people who are engaged with JobPath, many of the 312,000 people who have agreed a personal progression plan are still in their first year or even 18 months of engagement and have not started a job.  Many of those who may have started a job have not been in the job long enough to sustain it beyond 13, 26, 39 or 52 weeks.  What the Deputy says is correct and that is the information we sent to her.  However, it is important to note that not all performance has either been achieved or even necessarily recorded in that.</p></speech>

That is the metric we need to use.  It is the same with our other service partners.  Looking at just the long-term, 12-month job sustainment level would be too narrow a focus in relation to the overall supported offers.  JobPath has provided over 70,000 people with access to employment and helped people progress closer to employment, akin to our other service providers.  It is certainly the provider for which we have better metrics and visibility.  The costs are closer to &euro;275 million at the moment, just to let the Deputy know.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on the post-tender public employment service, the Department's policy on this is that Intreo will continue to act as the central hub of the public employment service.  It will continue to provide walk-in services to individuals and also focus predominantly on the short-term unemployed.  Individuals who have been unemployed for 12 months and become long-term unemployed will then be referred to a new national employment service for a 12-month duration.  If they remain unemployed at that point, they will then be referred to the regional employment service, at 24 months or longer, for another engagement of between 12 and 18 months.  As part of that, they be prioritised and engaged, with a view to achieving progression that best suits their personal requirements.  That may include community employment or other similar schemes.</p> <p>  I do not accept that from the Department's perspective, we are getting rid of or closing the door to not-for-profit provision.  What we are contracting for is what we currently have contracted for, namely, employment services.  We are creating separate streams within the existing employment service structure for those who are long-term unemployed and those who have been unemployed for 24 months.  We acknowledge, recognise and require a dedicated support level, one which we have at the moment and want to expand across the entire country through the provision of services in areas that do not currently have a local employment service.  That is what the regional employment service is trying to achieve.  It is actually creating an integrated customer journey between the different service partners we currently have.</p> <p>  On the mandatory turnover not being mandatory, I apologise to the Deputy but I may have inadvertently misled her on that.  The mandatory requirements in phase 1 are mandatory.  I was alluding to the fact that partnerships, collaborations and tenders from each area can cumulatively add up to that mandatory requirement.  For argument's sake, if two partnerships come together with three reference contracts between them, cumulatively the value will be accounted towards that turnover requirement under phase 1.  That is something we will look at in relation to phase 2 but we will have some sort of turnover requirement in phase 2.</p> <p>  On the external review, as I said, there is sensitive material within that in terms of the lot sizes and costings.  That is a significant component of that report.  There is very little in that report without that at the moment.  We are happy to share that with the committee but a lot of the material will be redacted on foot of the procurement.  I am just acknowledging that at the outset.</p></speech>

I look at these services as somebody who employed people and came to the conclusion that, for a fair number of people, it does not matter what is thrown at them in the form of job losses or whatever because they will find new employment fairly fast.  Has any analysis been done on how many of the 20,000 people who secured long-term employment and the 70,000 people who secured short-term employment would have secured employment if JobPath not existed?  That is the true value of JobPath.  It is not the number who managed to get a job because from my experience of the world, it is fair to surmise that different people have different abilities for getting employment .  We do not seem to get a breakdown of the number who would have secured a job in any event.  I say this because the real test is whether jobs are being secured for people who would not have got employment.  That obviously means that the further away from the employment market a person is, the less skills and employability, to use a term that is very hard to define, that he or she has, the harder he or she will find it to get a job.  There are some people with very high qualifications who are not very employable.  We have all met some of them in our lives.  Since we so are obsessed with figures these days, does the Department have any analysis on this?</p></speech>

We provided a copy of the econometric review conducted by the Department and the OECD into JobPath.  That, I think, provides the answers he is looking for.  Very briefly, we undertook a review of the performance of JobPath.  JobPath only deals with the long-term unemployed, so the short-term cohort was not covered.  We examined individuals and broke them down by similar characteristics.  We looked at individuals who were supported by JobPath and those with the same type of characteristics who were supported by other services.</p><p>JobPath participants enjoy a 17% higher wage level than individuals who were not supported by JobPath.  There is a 26% improvement in employment outcomes for JobPath participants compared with individuals who were not supported by JobPath.  Combined, that amounts to a cumulative overall improvement for JobPath participants of 37%, between employment and earnings, in comparison with individuals who were not supported by JobPath.  That is the level of analysis that we have undertaken.  We are committed to continue looking at econometric reviews of a similar nature in relation to the future services as we contract them.</p></speech>

The Criminal Justice (Public Order) (Quadbikes and Scramblers) (Amendment) Bill 2021 was recently referred to the select committee.  It was agreed at the private meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications this morning that the joint committee would undertake the scrutiny of Private Members' Bills.  A decision by the select committee is also required on this issue.  Accordingly, I propose that the select committee agree that scrutiny of Private Members' Bills referred be undertaken as a joint committee as distinct from a select committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to undertake a mid-year review of Estimates for public services 2021 in respect of programme A of Vote 29 - Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Vote 31 - Department of Transport.  I remind members that the committee has no role in approving the Estimates.  It is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to examine departmental expenditure, to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  I welcome the Minister for Transport and Environment, Climate and Communications and his officials to the meeting.</p> <p>    Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  It is great to see the Minister here in person, along with his officials.  It is another indication that we are emerging from Covid.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect yourself and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practice of good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between you and others attending.  One should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p> <p>  I call the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am glad to be here.  It is quite an innovation that we have an opportunity, mid-year, to review the Estimates for these two key areas: communications and transport.  I intend to present the 2021 mid-year Estimates for the Department of Transport, and for programme A of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p>As members will be aware, the budget for 2021 was set under conditions of uncertainty due to the ongoing Covid crisis.  Nonetheless, my priority as Minister is to ensure that the funding needed to progress the Government&rsquo;s objectives under the programme for Government, the climate action plan and the national development plan, NDP, is in place, and to take the necessary steps to ensure that this funding is well spent, getting value for money for the citizen.</p><p> My Department will continue to accelerate out spending programmes towards the end of the year, in line with spending profiles.  My Department expects to spend &euro;3.31 billion this year, up 24.5% on last year, largely reflecting the Department&rsquo;s increase in capital spending, and I am particularly pleased that the structure of spending has changed in line, with double the amount expended on active travel, for example, compared with the previous year.  It is anticipated at this stage that due to a combination of the tapering of Covid emergency expenditure and factors outside of our control such as planning and Covid-related delay, the overall underspend for 2021 will be circa &euro;247 million, or 6.9% of the overall Vote.</p><p> One of the sectors most impacted by Covid is aviation.  In the Department&rsquo;s voted budget for 2021, programme A, relating to civil aviation, is forecast to show a net underspend of circa &euro;12 million in terms of current expenditure as contingency for customer compensation in the event of a commercial failure of a tour or travel operator business was largely not required.</p><p> Programme B, relating to land transport, is forecast to show a net underspend for 2021 of almost &euro;70 million. This reflects the initial increase in public health restrictions and the subsequent gradual removal of restrictions on public transport and the recovery in passenger numbers and fare revenue.  The need for emergency Covid funding is starting to taper as passenger numbers recover, and I expect this trend to continue into 2022.</p><p> Programme C, relating to maritime transport and safety, is forecast to remain within budget.</p><p> Turning to capital investment, I expect there will be an underspend in 2021 of circa &euro;165 million, or 6.5% of voted capital expenditure.  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to apply to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry this capital into 2022.  Programme A, relating to aviation, primarily funds small scale projects in regional airports through the regional airports programme.  The two most significant projects under the aviation programme are the completion of the hold baggage screening project at Shannon Airport at a cost of &euro;6.1 million, and the Cork runway overlay project, with a funding allocation of &euro;10 million.  Much of the programme for 2021 was funded via capital carryover from 2020 and an application for carryover of circa &euro;7 million into 2022 will now be made.</p><p> Programme B, relating to land transport, constitutes the bulk of capital investment.  I expect the roads construction programme to remain on track, with no significant underspends for 2021.  Construction work will continue on projects such as the Dunkettle interchange, and commence on the Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue road.  Significant capital is being invested in protection and renewal of the network.  Almost &euro;1 billion, or 40% of the Department&rsquo;s entire capital allocation for 2021, will be invested in public-private partnership payments and in protection and renewal of the existing road network.</p><p> Subhead B6, carbon reduction, will almost certainly require a supplementary Vote towards the end of the year.  This is due to the growth in electric vehicle sales in 2021, which has exceeded the capital allocation for grant support schemes.  Electric vehicles now represent almost 15% of new car registrations and sales for 2021 show a year-on-year increase of 226% on the previous year.  This may lead to sales and grant drawdown in 2021, which exceed allocated capital by almost &euro;38 million, but that is a positive development, given our target of almost 1 million electric vehicles by 2030 as a key step towards carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p> With the recent press comments on MetroLink in mind, I will comment on the overall shape of sustainable mobility investment.  I currently see investment here as occurring in two broad strands.  One strand comprises large numbers of small- to medium-scale projects that can be rolled out steadily and consist of moderate challenges that can be worked through either at a technical level or local government level.  Citizens should be able to see the increasing impact of these programmes in their daily lives, be it a new low-emission bus, a new greenway link, a new footpath shortcut or a safe new cycle track or network for commuting, leisure or getting to school.  These are all changes that are happening now and happening rapidly.</p><p> The second strand of sustainable mobility investment constitutes large-scale projects that take longer to design and deliver and the impact of which will be proportionately greater upon delivery.  There has been steady progress on major projects in 2021, with the preliminary business cases for the construction components of the three Dublin mega-projects - BusConnects, Dart+ and MetroLink - due to go to the Government before the end of the year.  This is the basis for cost estimates, risk management and future procurement strategies, so these are major milestones in project design and analysis.  There is no lack of commitment to delivering on these projects but it is essential that we take the time now to ensure they meet the needs of citizens in terms of effective design and that we learn from the lessons of large-scale capital investment projects in other sectors so that the public finances are not put at risk.</p><p> Of course, there is more to transport infrastructure investment than just these three projects, so, in tandem with them, there is active travel management investment under subheads B8.1, B8.5 and B8.6.  The investment agencies and local authorities are continuing to scale up to invest the available capital and ensure that the project design and delivery framework is in place to deliver.  The allocated capital increased from &euro;180.6 million in 2020 to &euro;335.13 million in 2021 under the same active travel subheads, which represents an almost doubling of capital.  Carryover into 2022 will be circa &euro;90 million.  Half of this capital carryover is due to delays in the progression of greenways due to the impact of Covid on construction, as well the utilisation of capital carried over from 2020, but these projects will continue to be advanced.</p><p> Under B8.2, the contract for maintenance of the rail network continues to deliver in accordance with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s maintenance schedules.  The new Dart fleet preferred bidder has been identified and contracts will be awarded on Government approval of the preliminary business case.  The Intercity railcar project will now see railcar delivery in quarter 3 of 2022.  I was pleased to see Pelletstown rail station opening last weekend, the first new station for eight years, and construction of the national train control centre continues.</p><p> Under B8.3, the new low emission buses are starting to appear on Dublin streets as the BusConnects project continues to be rolled out.  One spine of BusConnects has been launched, with another due before the end of the year.  I remind Deputies that BusConnects is a three-strand project comprising low emission vehicle fleets and new capacity, reconfiguration of the entire network to make it more efficient, better connected and easier to use, and the construction phase.  The Luas capacity enhancement project is complete and the preliminary business case for MetroLink is expected to go before the Government before the end of the year.  A new Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet is being rolled out and detailed analysis of the transport requirements of regional cities in advance of significant investment in the years to come is under way.  I expect combined carryover under B8.2 and B8.3 to be circa &euro;40 million, or 5% of the allocation to the subheads.</p><p> Finally for transport, touching on the maritime programme, delays to the construction of two new Coast Guard stations at Greystones and Westport mean that it is unlikely that the capital allocation under subhead C3 will be spent in 2021.  As a result, I anticipate a carryover application of approximately &euro;8 million.  While most of the underspends relate to planning and Covid, I remain committed to further developing the systems across the transport sector to minimise underspends in future years.  The proposals in the NDP review to be published next week, which will include a significant increase in funding for transport, will facilitate more active competition between agencies for use of the funding available for large-scale transport investment on a timely basis.</p><p> I will now turn to the communication programme of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This programme has a key role in delivering my Department&rsquo;s vision for a climate neutral, sustainable and digitally connected Ireland.  The goal of the programme is to support universal access to high-speed broadband for better-connected communities while ensuring that service providers are properly regulated and strengthened with cybersecurity.  Overall, more than &euro;233 million has been allocated to the communications programme in 2021, of which almost &euro;15 million is current and &euro;218 million is capital.  An additional &euro;15.2 million capital was carried over from 2020 for the delivery of the national broadband plan, NBP.</p><p>By mid-year, my Department incurred current expenditure of &euro;5.6 million and capital expenditure of &euro;62.4 million under the programme.  This represents 88% of planned current expenditure and 79% of planned capital expenditure for the period.  Current expenditure mainly relates to the Department's governance over key programme deliverables, including eircode and the NBP.</p><p> By far the biggest item of capital expenditure within this programme is the NBP at &euro;212 million, with an additional &euro;15.2 million carried over into the year.  The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of high capacity and reliable broadband to ensure that people, communities and businesses across Ireland can avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.  National Broadband Ireland, NBI, commenced connections to the new fibre network in January of this year and build work is progressing across the 19 deployment areas, with 251,000 premises now surveyed.  Expenditure to mid-year was &euro;60 million.  The Covid-19 pandemic has again impacted the delivery of the network and NBI has revised its target for premises passed by the network to 60,000 by the end of 2021, a 40% reduction in the target for the year.  The Department is working closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan and mitigation measures under the contract to address the impact of the pandemic on the project for 2021 and into the future, and to ensure that momentum in the build programme gets back on track.</p><p> Expenditure on the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre was on profile at mid-year.  Additional funding was allocated in the 2021 Estimates for the development of a temporary facility for the National Cyber Security Centre and the Office of Public Works, OPW, has identified a suitable location.  Work on design and procurement for the fit-out of this facility is under way and my Department anticipates that the full allocation will be spent by year end.</p><p> The communications programme is a cornerstone of the delivery of the Department's strategy through to 2023.  While the Covid-19 environment has created some challenges in the roll-out of the NBP, all options available are being considered with a view to bringing delivery back in line with planned levels.</p></speech>

I will refer to a few issues.  I congratulate Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh who has been appointed the new chairperson of the board of the Shannon Group.  That is a positive appointment for Shannon.  He is a man of substance and has a deep understanding of aviation and how it works.  Hailing from the west, he also has an understanding of the need for, and importance of, balanced regional development.  I very much look forward to working closely with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and the team in Shannon over the time ahead.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues with aviation.  There is a need for a dramatic change in aviation policy.  What is the current position of that policy?  What plans does the Minister have to review it?  Will he accept submissions to that policy?  If we learned anything from Covid-19, it is that we need to disperse large volumes of people.  We can do that with a good airport network around the country, including Shannon Airport.  There is a massive amount of unused potential there.  We could create it, and use it, as a hub.  In the short to medium term, there is a need to establish a new package of aviation supports in the wake of the pandemic.  We must re-establish strategic routes and underpin them with finances to make it more attractive for airlines to come to our airports.  These points are being made by groups such as the chambers of commerce in Shannon, Ennis, Limerick and Galway, which came together and presented a report on this.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  Are he and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, working on providing a new package for aviation to underpin and re-establish strategic routes?  Those routes in the case of Shannon Airport are the transatlantic routes to Boston and New York and getting a regular, workable connectivity to Heathrow and other European hubs, such as Frankfurt.  Perhaps he would outline his plans in that regard.</p> <p>  Another issue is the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB.  It is something we have discussed at length in this committee.  I understand that a report has been lodged with the Department by Captain Steve Clinch on foot of a number of hearings held by this committee.  I ask that Captain Clinch's report be published without delay and that action be taken on the recommendations contained in the report.  If legislation is necessary, and I believe it is, that legislation should be worked on without delay.  I also ask the Minister to publish the draft heads of legislation in respect of the MCIB that were produced back in 2010.  This work was completed by a barrister, Ms Roisin Lacey.  Basically, I understand that this legislation and the report completed by Captain Clinch come to the same conclusion - we need an independent investigative unit in the MCIB that is at arm's length from the board and has a properly funded, full-time investigative role.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to those questions.</p> <p>  Finally, there is an ongoing issue with frequent flooding of the Ennis-Limerick railway line at Ballycar.  I was formerly the chairperson of the then Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development and that committee held a number of hearings two years ago on this issue.  All stakeholders were called to appear before the committee, including Irish Rail, the OPW, the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  There was a large number of stakeholders.  They were mandated to come back with a solution and they did that.  I compliment the role played by Irish Rail, Clare County Council and all the groups.  They submitted a report to the Department in December 2020 and they outlined and recommended a solution to this ongoing problem.  They put a cost of &euro;16.5 million on it.  They outlined in the extensive report, which runs to 173 pages-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.739" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021092900002#C00600"><p>I agree with the Deputy's comments about Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and I wish him well in his new role as chair of Shannon Group.  Many members, especially those of a certain vintage, will recall his work as a Senator on the Oireachtas committee with regard to water charges.  His diplomatic approach to that will serve him well as he takes on this challenging and important role for regional development as well as for the immediate Shannon region.  I support the Deputy's comments regarding how well suited he is for that role.</p> <p>  We have to do various things with regard to aviation policy.  Just prior to the Covid pandemic the Department was looking at starting the scoping of a revised version of the full national aviation strategy.  One of the things to do as we emerge from Covid and the immediate crisis period will be to re-initiate that.  That will begin again towards the end of the year.  It has to take a variety of matters into account, such as the fundamental shift in travel patterns that may arise in the medium and long term as a result of Covid.  For example, it is uncertain whether business travel will return in the way that it existed previously.</p><p>There are other issues, including decarbonisation.  The Deputy will be aware the European Commission's Fit for 55 package has radical plans for both the aviation and maritime sectors.  We have to take that into account in national policy.  Ireland may have an advantage or we will need to be ambitious in how we switch to alternative fuels, how we decarbonise to the best of our abilities and, with respect to our airports, how we use our location on the furthest west coast on the Atlantic to offer low-carbon solutions for people who have to cross the Atlantic and take other routes.  More immediately, we are considering further aviation support packages as part of the immediate Covid response.  There are various elements to this.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that while nothing is finalised yet, my sense is the resistance to the use of antigen tests in aviation during the most of the past year and a half is starting to weaken.  While their use is not over the line, yet I am confident we will be able to bring in measures for the use of those sorts of testing systems, which this committee has been promoting for a long time.  Second and most critically, the ending of the quarantine system is welcome news for the aviation sector.  Third, the recent decision by the US Government that from November we will start to see the return of the ability of transatlantic passengers to access the US is critically important.  As well as those measures - and this is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Government more broadly rather than for only our Department - we will have to consider the potential extensions of e-risks and other measures because aviation and tourism will be different from other sectors.  They will be properly later in coming back.  On further measures, for example, we have given a commitment to reduce landing charges.  We are considering additional, more immediate measures that might be able to further support the industry in the short term through this difficult winter and into the new year.  I cannot share the details of that now.  The budget allocations for that may come from Covid contingency funds rather than from our departmental budget.  Therefore, it may not directly affect our Estimates process.  </p><p> With regard to the MICB, the Deputy is correct.  Captain Clinch conducted that report.  The Department tendered in March for a broad review of the structures of the board.  The report was presented in July and my Department is going through its  findings and preparing to engage in assessing and implementing the recommendations we see as being appropriate.</p></speech>

It is something we want to proceed with.  I am not aware of the draft legislation from 2010.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on that having consulted the Department on it.  As that legislation was published in 2010, I will have to review it to see how it fits in within the recommendations of the report, and I will commit to doing that.</p></speech>

As I said, I was not aware of it until the Deputy raised it here.  I will check to see where it is at within the Department and, if it can be published in conjunction with the report, certainly, I will seek to do that.</p></speech>

I was glad to open an exhibition for the Geological Survey of Ireland earlier this week.  It is a brilliant exhibition in Collins Barracks, which I would recommend anyone to visit.  One of the exhibits relates to that section of line around Ballycar.  I have seen the specific report but I will look for it now.  I presume, having looked at the site and knowing something about the problems there, an elevation of the line might be the preferred solution.</p></speech>

The raising of the line was done previously but that has failed.  This is a comprehensive report.  It points to option two, which is costed at &euro;16.5 million.  It is important work gets under way as soon as possible to appoint consultants and work through the various different processes.  The Geological Survey of Ireland was part of that working group.  I am delighted it has raised its work on this with the Minister.</p></speech>

I might put direct questions to the him and get his response to them and then I will made a broader point.  Under subhead B3.5, I note there was an overspend of &euro;39 million in the local and regional roads grants.  Will that overrun have to come off the 2022 allocation or how will it be budgeted for?  Will that overspend this year impact on next year's allocation?</p></speech>

Often certain expenditure items could be either under or over the allocation but by the end of the year there will be a Supplementary Estimate or a reallocation for other Departments.  Typically, in the case of the roads budget, much of the local roads maintenance is done regularly.  It tends to be weather-affected and there can be variations depending on flooding or whatever.</p></speech>

Does the Minister know how much, if at all, that has been affected so far this year?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  The Limerick road is a good example of where there are various conditions in the contract whereby, for example, if another bridge was built across the River Shannon, the contractor would have to be compensated  That is an example of a contract with compensation measures.  Regarding the toll system and revenues for those projects, the revenue accrues directly to TII.  While the Department would have an oversight of the overall budget, we do not have the underspend to date in our Estimates information.  I presume because of lower transport numbers due to Covid, there will be a loss of certain revenue but the traffic volumes are pretty much back to the pre-Covid level.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, they have to go through that gate process.  We have all seen - we can take the children's hospital as one example - that if we do not get the planning and the procurement process right in the early stages, there may be significant overspend at later stages.  The first draft business case has been presented by TII to my Department.  Under the new spending code, in respect of mega public transport projects-----</p></speech>

We have to bring in both international experts and the Department of Finance to examine that business case before it goes to the Government.  As I said earlier, I expect that then to go to a Government decision to get through this gate level, that is, the critical Government approval in principle.  That will then allow TII to present the railway order, which will go to planning early next year.  As for timelines, it is difficult to tell people which specific year it will be.

It is going to greater detail at earlier stages in order that we will avoid finding, in the middle of a construction process, that matters keep changing.  The new public spending code seeks to bring forward much of the assessment that might previously not have been done.  In some ways, that could be frustrating because it takes time, but the public is better served than by saying, "Ah sure, we will go ahead, there is no problem and it will all be done within this time", and then finding out, because the basics have not been done-----</p></speech>

We have also brought in international consultants, connected very much with the European funding and with expertise in the area, to similarly assess the business case and advise the Department.  This gate process we are going through in respect of decision-making was outlined in that introduction of a public spending code of 2019.

A timeline could have been given for the delivery of the national children's hospital, for example, but it keeps being delayed.  An exact start time could have been announced three or four years ago but we would then find three or four years later that it was not.  We are better off being honest and upfront and getting the planning process right in order that we can avoid that sort of elongation of timelines once we get into the building phase.  That will not be the case for this project because a much more detailed assessment will have been carried out in advance.</p></speech>

It sits within the context this year of a projected underspend at this stage of &euro;247 million in the Department.  Communities and transport sector workers throughout the country are to the pin of their collar, whether they are in DAA, Aer Lingus or Dublin Bus.  They look at their industry and are concerned for their own futures.  There are areas crying out for the types of infrastructure and services the Minister says he wants to deliver, but we are facing a massive underspend.  I appreciate there are significant additional funding needs and Covid is a challenge, but is there a commitment that that funding of &euro;247 million that will be underspent will be made available again next year?  Will it be repurposed or assigned to the same projects as this year?  What were the challenges?  Was it just Covid or were there other challenges, such as the workforce or the supply chain, that meant it was difficult to spend the money?  Will he be able to spend it next year?  Will there be an opportunity to direct it towards major capital projects such as MetroLink, the Navan rail line or the western rail corridor, that is, communities crying out for these services?</p></speech>

In the area of sustainable travel, we took a conservative approach.  Certain projects did not proceed through the first quarter of the year because the advice was not to have workers in the construction sector, other than in certain critical areas, out working.  It could be argued we should have taken a different political call on that but the decision was to take a cautious approach in regard to Covid.</p> <p>  A significant element of spending this year was a carryover from the previous budget.  The truth is, in both Departments, there has been a massive ramp-up in spending, with significant increases year on year, and there will be again next year.  It can take time for the agencies and authorities to manage that and help deliver it.  I expect to be able to carry over the funding and the spending in areas where there is an underspend will be spent in those areas, so it will not be lost.  There will be catch-up, particularly in respect of the NBP and the greenways, two areas of underspend.</p> <p>  There are other factors.  In the area of sustainable travel, as everyone will be aware, there are significant issues relating to judicial reviews and the planning system delaying many works we might want to see advance.</p></speech>

There is a huge appetite for spending in these areas by councils right across the country.  Local authorities will be key.  If I take anything as a sign of hope, the decision last Monday night in Galway to proceed with what was a controversial and difficult project by 17 votes to one gives me confidence that local authorities are keen to do this.  People will be clamour for money rather than us being faced with an underspend.</p></speech>

Next Monday when people see the NDP document, I expect that what they will do is compare it to the previous NDP document.  They will look for their project and their completion date.  It sounds like it will be a different animal.  What can people expect to see?  What should they look for?  There were concerns, which the Minister has heard, especially about road projects being deprioritised or not going to happen at all.  What can people expect from the NDP on Monday and how will it compare to previous plans?  How does the Minister think they should look at it?</p></speech>

That is important because we could get fixated on the major Dublin transport projects and we must invest in Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and in towns across the country as well.</p> <p>  The NDP is not finalised yet.  We are still dotting the i's and crossing the t's.  Rather than having a white list or a green list where anything in the box is definitely going to be built and anything outside it is gone, it is better to set out broad strategic objectives and broad budget outlines and to give the agencies and councils incentives to get good value for money, to speedily develop projects and to bring costs down.  Sometimes when something is put in a white box, that gives everyone the signal that because it is a commitment it does not matter what it costs.  There will be a commitment in the transport and communications sectors to maintain the exact sequencing.  To a certain extent, it depends on which ones come through the planning first and which ones local councils support to be able to deliver in a cost-competitive way.  It is appropriate that we have some tension or cost competition, in particular between cities on the transport side, so that we get good value for the money we spend.  That is part of the reason the new approach is a better one.</p></speech>

I have a number of points to raise, and I hope I can go through them with him and have an exchange of views.</p> <p>  I join others in congratulating P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on taking up his role as chairman of the Shannon Group.  It is a very positive appointment.  We finally have someone who understands aviation.  There are many fine businesspeople in the mid-west, but one does not necessarily need an agribusiness or economics degree to run an airport and all the catalyst activity it stimulates.  Aviation is needed, as is someone with a knowledge of the west, and we are ticking both boxes with that appointment.  I say well done to the Minister on appointing him and I wish P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh well.</p> <p>  The new chairman should be given a slightly adjusted role for the next few months given the current turbulent time in aviation.  Shannon is positioned to recover, but it is crucial that it is done in the right way.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh should be given some form of executive role in the coming months so that he is not just chairing board meetings, but is on-site in the airport and working in tandem with Mary Considine.  I urge the Minister to look at that because Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is answerable to him.  Following the meeting the Minister might communicate to the board that he would like him to be hands-on for the coming months as he begins his tenure.</p> <p>  On the same matter, when does the board of the Shannon Group expire?  The Minister might not know the answer.  There are many fine individuals but, as I stated, agribusiness, economics degrees and financial backgrounds are not what we are about; we want aviation people.  A shake-up of the make-up of the board is required rather than getting rid of everyone.  That would be positive.</p></speech>

However, I will be upfront in that I do not agree with the point about the role of the chairman.  It is a chairing role.  We have a good CEO.</p></speech>

The chair is a critical function, but we must be careful that we do not confuse things and get in the way of the existing management structures.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has a good vision and a real understanding of the industry and he will bring real benefit, but it is in a chairing, non-executive role rather than in an executive role.  I respectfully disagree with the Deputy on that.  Otherwise, there would be real confusion and that does not work well.  There is a good reason for the separation of the board and the executive.  The role of the board is to oversee the executive and to support it, but not to become the executive.</p> <p>  None of the board memberships expire at the same time.  We try to rotate members on an ongoing basis so that experience is retained.  Typically, one or two board members a year come up for reappointment.  I do not have the schedule of appointments here, but we will continue to appoint new people.</p></speech>

To be clear, I commend and compliment what Mary Considine is doing as chief executive, but sometimes a few new players can help to reinvigorate a board.  I am sure P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Mary Considine will complement each other.  My point is just about the make-up of the board.  There needs to be an incisive aviation outlook in the coming months.  We need Shannon to get back to the point of recovery.  It was in a state of decline long before Covid hit.</p> <p>  Shannon Heritage falls under the Minister's remit currently because it is an entity of the Shannon Group.  Bizarrely, there is again talk of closing iconic sites in the mid-west such as Bunratty Castle and folk park and King John's Castle.  What we have is a takeover process.  It was a very good decision by the Government.  The running of these sites will transfer from Shannon Heritage to local authorities.  The date of 31 December was set as a target for all due diligence to conclude and for the formal sign-over to take place, meaning from 1 January, the local authorities of Clare County Council and Limerick City and County Council would take over the sites.  These matters are complex, but it now looks like the takeover might not happen until March.  Shannon Heritage is looking at closing the sites again in the period from 1 January until March.  That has been communicated to workers.  It has also been intimated to workers that the company will no longer draw down the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and Government supports.  That is illogical.  It lacks strategic outlook and is short-sighted.  The company is also turning down corporate bookings.  I accept that the Minister cannot have oversight of everything, but could he please ensure that any backlogs that might come down the line in this all-important transfer are expedited?  I accept it is not his line Ministry but unless I am totally missing the point, there is something wrong here.  The EWSS is a flat-rate support that is calculated on how many part-time, full-time and seasonal staff a company has and it is a support the Government gave to entities to ensure that people were not laid off, made redundant and put on unemployment benefit.  In the case of Shannon Heritage, the EWSS has been availed of but workers are being left on part-time and reduced hours.  All I ask is that the Minister would do everything he can at ministerial level to expedite whatever loose ends remain with the Department.</p></speech>

I will talk to him.  My understanding is that the function had transferred.  I cannot imagine there is a reason for delay within the Department of Transport because our view is that it is an appropriate realignment of responsibilities.  I will check with him and see.</p></speech>

Regarding aviation overall, there is a need for a number of interventions.  It is going to be one of the last sectors to experience a post-Covid recovery.  A number of interventions have been made.  Fianna F&aacute;il was very respectful of the coalition of parties in government but there is also delineation between parties.  We put forward a submission paper with some policy suggestions for the Minister, with respect to his Ministry, which I hope can be considered.  They include multi-annual capital expenditure on airports.  It was very good to see the baggage hold facilities in Shannon upgraded.  Another suggestion was a subvention on a per-passenger basis in the coming years, to the point of recovery.</p><p>Other colleagues have, and will, mention the need for regional connectivity.  I met recently with the Saudi Arabian ambassador, where we discussed the potential of hub connectivity from Shannon into Riyadh.  What plans, if any, does the Minister have for the airport and aviation overall in terms of how they will be supported in the upcoming budget and over the recovery period, which will take some time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.811" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021092900002#G00200"><p>As I said earlier, there is an immediate issue in terms of supports for our aviation industry and, by dint of that, our tourism industry.  Much of that funding will come from emergency Covid-type supports.  We are looking at that.  In the more medium term, we want our aviation industry to thrive, but there are different spending and policy priorities in the Estimates.  Deputies, including Deputy Crowe, rightly, lobby me in regard to local bus services in County Clare or investment in broadband or other services.  When it comes to spending, we have limited budgets.</p> <p>  To be clear, prior to Covid our aviation industry was booming.  Passenger numbers had increased massively.  Shannon Airport had not grown as fast as Dublin Airport, which is a big regional issue, but the main reason for that is the two-hour journey time on the motorway between Limerick and Dublin which brings passengers and bus companies to Dublin Airport.  Overall, the industry was in significant health.  In particular, Aer Lingus had significantly expanded its business in the north Atlantic, where it operates to approximately ten different locations.  While much of that was going to Dublin Airport versus Shannon Airport, Shannon Airport was also growing, as was Cork Airport.  It was not an industry in crisis before this crash; far from it.  The benefit of it coming back is that it will show that other industries are coming back.  As a country, we need connectivity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.812" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021092900002#G00300"><p>I agree with the Minister that the growth needs to be regionally balanced.  He signed off on the Limerick northern distributor road project at the start of this year.  It is making huge headway, as the Chairman can attest to.  It straddles both of our constituencies.  It is a shining light in what has been a few dull months nationally and in the mid-west.  It is a major infrastructural project under way in a part of counties Clare and Limerick where thousands of people are seeing this progress daily.  It starts in Coonagh and ends in Knockalisheen, which is in my home parish of Meelick.  The cartoon "Road Runner", in which Road Runner is chased out of town by Wile E. Coyote on a road that is going nowhere and so the only choice is to drop off the edge, comes to mind in that as things stand we are at risk of the Limerick northern distributor becoming such a road because when it reaches Knockalisheen there will be a roundabout and that is it.  There is a phase 2.  As the Chairman will know, I have had issues with the routing of phase 2.  I am still not happy with it.  Many of the communities are also not happy with it.  Those living along the route are being almost held to ransom, knowing that a road is coming but wondering when will it happen.  People further out cannot wait for this to happen.  We need certainty in regard to phase 2.  It cannot be left in limbo forever.  Phase 1 is being built and will be completed.  For better or worse, phase 2 needs to happen, offering the full suite of connectivity from Coonagh to Knockalisheen, Parteen, Clonlara and out to the Dublin Road in Limerick.  Those attending Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and people from the suburbs of north Limerick city and Clare face daily traffic congestion.  There have many local squabbles regarding whether the road should be extended 100 m here or there.  We got entrenched in that but communities and the people of counties Clare and Limerick want certainty about phase 2.  We hope it will be included in the NDP to be announced next Monday.  I ask the Minister to comment on how he sees phase 2 developing.</p></speech>

This is influenced by the fact that if we were to proceed with phase 2 and complete along the alignment suggested, that would drawdown a &euro;200 million compensation requirement for us to pay the contractors of the existing tunnel under the River Shannon.  There is a contract arrangement to the effect that should a second northern distributor road be built compensation of the order of &euro;200 million would be paid.  I asked the Limerick city manager if the council had the money whether it would pay that.  He did not answer, but I do not believe it would, and I do not believe we should.  I would like to see that &euro;200 million spent on the development of a metropolitan rail link, starting with a station in Moyross, which would be within a short walking distance of Thomond Park and would give people access to LIT and open up hundreds of acres of land owned by the public service, which could be a solution to housing problems for thousands of young people in Limerick and across the country.  The first priority is a railway station in Moyross.</p></speech>

It would be fabulous.</p></speech>

There is significant buy-in for it.  I have made a submission in support of it.  It is great to hear the Minister's views on it.  My concern is the project includes a roundabout, 3 km of dual carriageway and another roundabout.  On reaching Meelick, traffic will leave the road in small lanes heading towards minor country roads.  We cannot have a situation where phase 1 is completed, but phase 2 is not happening and everyone along the route is left in limbo for another protracted five or six years or however long it takes for this to come back on the agenda.  In that context, it needs to remain in discourse.  As I said, this cannot be the Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote road whereby having passed Moyross the road runs out to the end of Meelick and then ends.  We need that onward connectivity.  I am sure the Chairman will say similar in a while.</p></speech>

Another point I made to the Limerick city manager, on which we agreed and I hope the Deputy will support, is that in building the Coonagh-Knockalisheen road it is critical that at the same time we start to build the BusConnects in Limerick and the cycling routes in Limerick, which would transform the city from the University of Limerick to LIT and out to Mary Immaculate College on the other side of the city as well as the key BusConnects corridors that would connect Moyross to the city and connect through the city.  That is vital.</p> <p>  The third key point is we have to take down the walls that surround Moyross, which close it off from neighbouring estates, so that we get improved pedestrian access and improved access to schools and workplaces and other facilities.  The first thing we need to do in Limerick is build the pedestrian, cycling and bus facilities that will see that area of the city thrive.  That is where my focus will be in terms of delivery. </p></speech>

There are a couple of points I want to deal with.  The completion of MetroLink is referenced in the NDP to be 2028, but in the media, and on the website 2034 and quarter 4, 2028 respectively, are referenced.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has responsibility for the Department of Transport.  Could MetroLink be built before 2028?  When completed, projects are available for public use.  In many cases, they are factors in the decisions of families and single people around where to purchase a home and where children might go to school.  The Minister referenced city living as being key that.  Knowing what he does, when does he expect MetroLink to commence?</p></speech>

I will give my experience here.  I have been involved in the Dublin metro project dating back to 1997.  I was a member of the advisory committee of the then Dublin Transportation Office, which started in 1997 and by 1999 had a clear plan and a brilliant model to show that it did make sense.  A Platform for Change was the then plan.</p><p>Then the engineers on the advisory council told us that whatever we do we should build the metro first before we widen the M50.  We widened the M50 first.  By 2008 or 2009 it was back on track.  I was in government at the time and I was particularly interested in the project given my history.  Even though we were in the middle of the worst recession that ever hit the country and the budget was difficult, we made a commitment towards it.  We included it in the four-year plan in 2010 in the middle of the crisis.  We secured &euro;500 million in European Investment Bank funding.  If only we had built it at that time it would be operating now.  It would be up and running.  The reason we did not was it was delayed in planning.  If I recall rightly, there was an archaeological issue.  To be perfectly honest I did not think it was significant.  That one issue held it up in planning and in a legal challenge for approximately two or three years.  I am going on memory.  In that time there was a change of government.  The new Government came in and took it out of the four-year plan and it did not proceed.  The planning delay killed it.  I have direct personal experience.  I hate to come back to always answering this question by saying it depends on how long it takes us to get through planning but this is from direct experience of a similar project, which was ready to go and which we would have built for a fraction of what it will cost us in the end but it was delayed in planning and a legal challenge.</p></speech>

To go back to Shannon, I am a Deputy for Limerick and the mid-west.  I welcome the appointment of P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  He will add something to the management and the board of Shannon Group.  There are three strategic routes for Shannon.  These are Heathrow and the two main transatlantic routes of Boston and New York.  Philadelphia and others are important but these three are key.  These three routes are flown by Aer Lingus and we very much welcome that the Heathrow route is back.  We would like to ensure it continues, running in tandem with Cork and Dublin.  We would like to alter the time so it is more appropriate and better for people.  What does the Minister see in terms of government supports for Aer Lingus to re-establish strategic routes?   It is not just about the airport for us in the mid-west.  The airport has enabled us as a region to have exponentially large amounts of foreign direct investment above what should be the norm based on our size.  There are large employers and connectivity out of Shannon is vital.  What does the Minister say about providing supports to airlines such as Aer Lingus or to the airport?  What does he see as the timeframe for this?</p></speech>

We left it to the airports to be able to allocate and decide upon them on a strategic basis.  We will look at coming back to these to enhance them and go further.  It is very welcome in particular that Aer Lingus is back at Shannon flying to Heathrow.  I agree fully with the Chair that one flight a day is not sufficient.  Previously there were three flights a day.</p></speech>

We looked at this in real depth throughout the crisis.  Last week, air travel was 50% of what it was prior to Covid.  It is still in crisis and there is no two ways about it.  During this crisis we looked at all options.  When we say we will support a specific route, we run into European state aid rules.  There are rules on what we can do and what is described as a PSO route.  We are in a competitive market.  There is also Ryanair, which has brought some of its fleet back into-----</p></speech>

My colleague made reference to Shannon Heritage.  Many of the sites are doing well.  King John's Castle has better figures at present than it did prior to Covid.  There is a positive and I ask that it remain open.  I also have a quick question on broadband.  NBI came before the committee.  Is the Minister happy that by the end of next year NBI will have caught up on its programme?  I know he have concessions on not meeting targets.  It is a "Yes" or "No" question.</p></speech>

Looking at other similar exercises whereby big broadband plans are rolled out, there is often a period when all the operational issues are teased out.  The first six months or the first year are delayed, but then, when it is done right - and both the Department and NBI are doing it right with local authorities - one can accelerate.  The metaphor I would use is the vaccine programme.  During the early stages people were saying we were behind the UK, slow and so on, but we were getting it right and then, when it mattered, we were able to accelerate and overtake the UK.  The same will happen with the NBP.</p></speech>

We had the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, before us last week.  We have put a suggestion and written to him to the effect that each Department be required under the Estimates to outline how much is being allocated to cybersecurity.  There is a general view that there is probably quite a lot more than what is going into the National Cyber Security Centre.  Does the Minister favour that Departments would do that?</p></speech>

What is happening at the moment, the opening up in Moyross, is hugely significant.  I have always worked on that.  I do not see various means of transport as mutually exclusive.  The Minister made reference to the Dublin-Limerick motorway.  I would like to see buses coming from Dublin to Shannon.  We are such a small country that we should be looking at that model.  If buses are going from the Hurlers pub in my neighbourhood, Castletroy, directly to Dublin Airport, there is no reason the reverse should not happen  Once again I make that point.  As for the issue of the northern distributor road itself, eventually the tunnel will come back into public ownership.  I am not certain of the date; the Minister's officials will probably know.  It has been there quite a number of years.  I am just saying that the dynamics shift.  As for the rail transport system in Limerick, the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, when it was published initially did not have that in it.  I am very supportive of it.  It is a great addition.  I do not see this as either-or; I think they are all complementary.</p> <p>  I will go back to something I have brought up previously.  The NDP is going through this.  The Minister knows I am great proponent of the M20.  Outside of climate change or anything else, it is vital for balanced regional development.  I had to drive to Donegal at the weekend.  I was able to get from Limerick to Sligo with the click of a finger but when I went beyond there it took me hours.  There is a motorway from Galway to Tuam and it is great.  Equally, I can go from my door in Castletroy to the Red Cow roundabout in Dublin, in under two hours, yet it could take me much longer to get to Cork.  The M20 is currently in the design and planning phase.  Does the M20 continue with that momentum under the revised NDP that will be published next week?</p></speech>

I will give two examples.  We have loads of roads projects in planning all over the country, and if we built all of them, we would not have money for anything else.  They would soak up the entire budget, and even then we would not have enough.  We have to prioritise and allocate limited resources.  As for bypasses, the Chairman will not disagree with me on this.

It is a beautiful village with beautiful facilities that we have to protect.  I will give an even more important immediate example.  The Chairman said earlier that Limerick is a large industrial development centre for the country, which is true.  Significant industrial output comes out of Limerick.  Most of it heads on the road out to Cahir and down to Waterford Port.</p></speech>

I believe that if we want to be grown up about balanced regional development, outside of anything to do with climate change or anything else, we must link the two largest cities outside of Dublin, namely Cork and Limerick, where there is a counter-pole from all down along the western seaboard to Dublin.  The point is that by doing so the bypasses, which are required, are also getting done but they are not mutually exclusive.  The original M20 project incorporated the bypass of Adare.  However, that particular project did not proceed.  The M20 is now back on track.  In the interim, the N69 bypass of Adare is going through, and that brings the added benefit of linking Foynes Port to Limerick city.  I see them as very much an integrated model.  I ask the Minister to go back to the M20.</p></speech>

It is best to put it on rail freight.  Second, I will say to the Chairman the same thing I would say to the people in Tipperary.  The plan for Tipperary is to expand from Cahir to Limerick Junction, and TII is looking at that.  One of the potential solutions is to do the bypass first.  I am not saying the upgrade of the full road from Cahir to Limerick Junction will not be done but rather that, in the same way we did the Cashel bypass, the design can be such that the bypass is put in first and, subsequently, subject to availability of funding, the road can be upgraded.  The same approach, I would argue-----</p></speech>

We need to look at the system and we need to look at resourcing it at every point.  Some of this does not necessarily relate to the Minister's Department, but any of us who have ever gone through development plans, or even been sideways involved with them, are all aware that there is a scenario, let us say, of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, the council and planners existing here and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, or whatever else, existing there.  There is not necessarily proper, joined-up thinking.  That is before even getting into the specifics of rural housing or whatever.  It is a particular issue.  We have all experienced hold-ups where the full conversations were not had.</p> <p>  I will follow on from where the Chair finished on NBI.  Some of the issues are not necessarily budgetary.  NBI's representatives said to us, and I will welcome the Minister's view on it, that they now have a seven-year plan in place, taking into account delays due to the Covid pandemic.  They are looking at having a better plan, within the next six to nine months, on how that part of it, first of all, could be caught up on; they are talking about 2023 or 2024 for that.  Within that same period there is the wider issue of acceleration, which is necessary, in that what is in years six and seven would be put into years four and five.  If that happens, and NBI puts a plan together whereby it is expecting everything will be done on a contractual basis with ESB, Eir and all the necessary players, its fear is whether resources at planning and engineering level will be dedicated to it within local authorities, accepting that the section 254 guidelines have been updated or whatever.  Is the Minister reasonably happy that this will be done and that the conversations will have taken place to deliver that resource and to make sure this can happen?  </p> <p>  The other question I will throw to him and, again, I know it is slightly off the subject matter we are dealing with, is that now we can see the people who will be in year four-five as opposed to year six-seven, we need a little due diligence in offering them interim alternatives that are available.  An element of due diligence will have to be done by the State, even if it is only engagement with companies and operators that are delivering these possible solutions.</p></speech>

What the Deputy is discussing is, in a sense, part of the budget discussions for next year and they have not concluded yet.  Our bilateral discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has yet to happen.  It will happen in the next few days.  We will look for the resources we will need to truncate the seven-year plan to a five years.  That is one element of it.  The Deputy has put his finger on the key areas we need to work within.  My sense of what has happened this year, especially with local authorities, is that instead of ironing out some of those teething problems, local authorities have really helped.  It varies but local authorities have helped with some of the technical stuff, even around getting the poles in place and the wires through.</p> <p>  Eir is also a critical part of that.  There are both challenges and opportunities.  The challenges include the fact that some of the ducting used is not as clear or easy to use as had been hoped but, on the other hand, my sense from talking to Eir and listening to the project team is that there has been real co-operation and a willingness to accelerate.</p> <p>  The point the Deputy made about counties in particular areas that are towards the latter end of the process is a very good one.  The Department is specifically looking at other mechanisms where we would not leave them, in a sense, to the last.  It is looking at other mechanisms whereby we can overcome the characteristic geography or topography of an area, which is why those counties, in particular, are coming in later.  My recollection is the Department is specifically looking at whether there are mechanisms whereby we can mix that up a bit.  That has not concluded but it is in train.</p></speech>

We all accept this involves companies that have not done due diligence, to use an overused term of mine, as regards Brexit preparations.  From 1 July, new information will have to be provided with packages and parcels.  An Post warehouses seem to be full.  Packages and parcels have to be sent back and it is taking considerable time.  Part of the problem is the British postal operation is not filtering these out.  We know of the difficulties regarding An Post and the necessity, from its point of view, of either getting more services or of looking at public service obligation or whatever.  What is the Government doing on that specific issue at this point in time to expedite matters, whether it is dealing with the Brits, the European Union or even customs here, for which some would say there may be more leeway?</p></speech>

All I want to know is that it is in hand in government and that communications are happening with the necessary stakeholders, including customs on anything it can do, in particular.  An Post are engaging but I like to think there is some sort of involvement from the Department.</p></speech>

The Deputy made a valid point.  An Post has seen a dramatic and massive expansion in its parcel and packaging business.  That is very much to be welcomed.  The company has shown real resilience and capability.  There is a continuing reduction in its traditional mail business but an expansion in new products.  From talking to its representatives recently, the company is looking at all sorts of initiatives, including pick up and go and a range of options in going further with that parcel business.</p> <p>  I am due to go to the UK in the near future.  I want to go there to talk to a variety of UK Ministers.  Brexit presents such problems.  The scale of the challenge it presents on the energy, communications and transport side cannot be underestimated.  There is no upside.  I will make it my business to-----</p></speech>

That is accepting the reality of the world we live in, or have done.  We all want to ensure that there will not be significant delays in major capital infrastructure projects.  I will ask about two specific cross-Border projects that will not shock the Minister, one of which is the Narrow Water Bridge.  On the other, are we still looking at 2026-27 for the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast to run on an hourly basis?  I understand that the electrification programme will also be built into that.</p></speech>

The Deputy will see that there was draft funding within that.  It is not within my Department's Estimate.  My view is that the real potential development here, on both the Cooley Peninsula and on the Mournes on the other side, is particularly the development of cycling and walking traffic.  They are two beautiful tourist areas and there is potential for development of such sustainable transport solutions.  I am also concerned about the village of Omeath.  If there is a large increase in traffic coming across from Warrenpoint, how would the village of Omeath manage?  How would we cope if there was significant increased traffic on the peninsula itself?  There is a risk around Carlingford and around the other side.  Some of the tourist value could be lost if it becomes a much busier road.  As I said, that more immediately is an issue the shared island initiative within the Department of the Taoiseach is managing.</p> <p>  With regard to the Enterprise, I was talking to Irish Rail recently.  One of the issues coming out of Covid is significant changes in transport patterns.  Remote working will change the extent of long-distance commuting.  That may well allow Irish Rail, on a range of different services, introduce new services.  The new InterCity railcar carriages we will get in, next year and the year after, will give additional capacity and that may give us the potential to introduce new services.</p></speech>

I missed various contributions.  Deputy O'Rourke raised MetroLink, which I will start off with.  I am sure it is no surprise to the Minister.  Under subhead B6, I understand, in response to Deputy O'Rourke earlier on in the meeting, the Minister stated he hopes that the project will be completed between 2028 and 2034, and hopefully not at the latter end of that period.  That is probably the most encouraging news we have heard since the now-infamous article in the<i>Mail on Sunday</i>a week and a half ago in trying to get it delivered as early as possible.  We are at the stage, the article says, where we are hoping to go for a railway order in quarter 1 of 2022.  I understand that is still the case.  If it goes through that procedure and a railway order is granted, which could take a couple of years, is the Minister expecting a delay between when it is granted and when it can  start?  Is he expecting a significant delay in that gap in the process or that, if it goes through the railway order process and permission is granted, the State would be in a position to begin MetroLink and get diggers on the ground as soon as is practical after that point?</p></speech>

There still are ongoing negotiations regarding the final arrangements in that.  However, the broad agreement I have had with the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, the party leaders and Cabinet and Government in general is that we seek to deliver all the major public transport projects that are in planning or in train.  It is critical, that is not only the Dublin projects.  It is critical we do Limerick rail, Cork metropolitan rail, Galway and Waterford, as well as rural bus services under Connecting Ireland.  I could set out an array of basic transport projects.</p> <p>  My approach to the NDP was look to make sure that we progress the widest scope.  It is critical to do that to help address our housing crisis and we want transport-led developments to give a signal that the housing is built where there will be public transport.  With that, there are various different elements to it.  In many of the rail projects, Irish Rail will be the key deliverer and it will have the ability.  Going back to what I was saying about competitive tension between cities, Irish Rail will be doing DART+ in Dublin but it will also be doing metropolitan rail in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and-or potential other projects, such as the Navan rail line.  One could pick a number of different projects which, hopefully, we will see in the greater Dublin area transport strategy, etc., that will then therefore be in train.  The metro is slightly different in the sense that it is a large single project.  It is much bigger than any of the others and it is one where once you start, you do not stop.  If you have a tunnelling machine going you work right the way through whereas you might see the DART+, for example, start very immediately in some of the routes because these new trains I was speaking about earlier will immediately be able to fit in to commuter routes.  We will have the new DART battery electric trains, which will bring significant changes, efficiencies and benefits, but it can be done on a phased basis.  Metro is more a "yes-no" project.  The way we are approaching the NDP is to see that we progress all those different projects.</p> <p>  I keep going back to it because it is the honest and correct answer.  The exact starting time of each depends to a certain extent on planning and-or legal challenge.  That, in truth, in the past, has been the key factor.  Once we are through that, I expect to be able to press the "Go" button, subject to Government approval, Government decision-making and the Cabinet agreeing, but there is not a plan to say that then we will delay.  The business case is set out-----</p></speech>

The planning process is outside his control.  Legal challenges are also outside his control, but for him to say if it gets through that he would hope to be in a position to press "Go" is encouraging.  The people understand that there is a significant element of this outside the Minister's control.  We cannot just put the JCBs on the ground next week.  We have to go through the railway order and other statutory processes.  What people want to know is that there is a commitment that when the gate is open we are able to move through it.</p> <p>  With all due respect to all those other projects which are important, and while I speak out of local concern, Deputy O'Rourke will back me up here when I say that I have sat through many committee meetings where we have had a great deal of discussion about Shannon Airport.  I have not spoken about Dublin Airport too often.  I have let the local Deputies have a great deal of discussion about Shannon Airport over the past year and a half.  Dublin Airport is testing its second runway at present.  That will come on stream soon.  There will be an explosion in the number of passengers coming into Dublin Airport.</p></speech>

In all seriousness, there is no other project that is similar in scale to MetroLink and there is the demand that will be there from the second runway.  New houses and apartments will be built in Swords through the Fosterstown development plan.  Those householders will all have to transit out of the tow to work, school, college or whatever.  That is why there has been, from me and from others, a fairly intense reaction to what we see as a step back in commitment to this project.  From what the Minister said there, I take some encouragement.  It would be easy for me to politically say I do not take any encouragement and this is terrible.  He is still committed to it, albeit that the railway order process, the planning, the legal challenges, etc., are issues he cannot account for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.938" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021092900002#L01600"><p>I will add to that, because it is best to be honest with people.  There is also then a tendering process and that takes time.  Within that, depending on the structure used, the overall budget allocation has to work.  Some projects will be over two decades and that helps in managing the budget.</p><p>Some projects, and the metro may be an example, can involve a PPP element whereby some of the cost is carried over a 30- or 40-year period, or even longer.  That allows the budget window to be managed more easily so that a Minister is not just constrained by whatever the ten-year capital allocation is within this particular Department.  Those final details are still to be agreed and worked out.  It is a moving part.  </p><p> I keep going back to the work I did two decades ago.  We did a detailed plan for the future needs of Dublin.  I trust that original planning, which showed an underlying need for a higher capacity line to the north side.  That is the case not only because of the airport but also because of those development lands, Swords and so on.  There are also institutions such as Dublin City University, the Mater Hospital and so on.  That underlying analysis is still accurate.  I have, therefore, always been an advocate of the metro.  How it is delivered, how it gets through planning and goes through a tendering process is not yet concluded.  We will only know exact timelines when we get to that phase.</p></speech>

In 2011, we were in the midst of economic hardship.  MetroLink was paused at that time.  In 2015, it was brought back onto the table and, in 2018, it was committed to.  My understanding is that for the first time in the history of metro north, as it was known, it was tested against other solutions, including a DART spur from Clongriffin, a hard rail solution, a high-frequency bus service or light rail.  MetroLink came out on top and was committed to as the best option.  What is the difference between that analysis and its result and the analysis the Minister referred to that will have to be done by the Government in the next couple of months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-29a.941" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021092900002#M00300"><p>It is similar analysis.  I have always felt that the option of a spur from the heavy rail line along the east coast was not the optimal option because it would restrict capacity on that line.  That would restrict commuter traffic from Drogheda, Balbriggan and so on.  There are alternative options.  The Finglas Luas could be extended to the airport.  Rather than building a tunnelled solution, one could look at a light-rail solution.</p></speech>

Are we opening that again?</p></speech>

The following is a rough, broad and outline analysis.  A light rail option might accommodate 10,000 passengers per hour at full capacity with trams running every 90 seconds and so on.  The difference with the metro option is that it is a continuous, segregated, driverless system, which could accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour.  Those sorts of numbers will not be there from the start.  It will take time for all that housing to be built and for numbers to build up.  The exact numbers from the airport are conditional on a range of other factors.  This is not just an airport metro.  It is more about the development of the north side and a high quality public transport for all the neighbourhoods through which it goes.</p></speech>

That has gone out to public consultation.  Are all projects being assessed under that process as distinct from the existing strategic review process?  Is that a factor in projects now?</p></speech>

We have been looking at this for 25 years, as I said.</p></speech>

They have gone through a couple of phases and are engaged with TII.  People are starting to believe this is going to happen.  There have been ground testing works and all the rest.  That is why the reaction has been so visceral this time.  In the past, people did not believe it was happening.  Now people believe the process is happening.  I have seen the logo on the barriers for the ground testing works.  They have engaged with TII multiple times on the design, right down to the position of fences, plants, trees and everything.  That is where they are at, in advance of the railway order.</p></speech>

It is the right project and I have always said that.  However, there will be questions asked in times of limited resources.  A metro will, in all likelihood, be very expensive.  The people of Limerick might ask how this will be balanced.  That will be one of the challenges.  However, my sense is that the political system has come around to the view that a metro is the right strategic decision, though there may be different views.  We will have to have a debate about that.  We will have to discuss it when it comes through this process.  The real challenge is going to be how we balance a whole range of different projects.</p> <p>  I come back to this competitive tension between cities, to a certain extent.  On other projects, which are less stop-go, such as BusConnects, we must start looking at how we can deliver the outcomes without spending top dollar all the time.  How can we get planning or local councils to make it easier for us to make some of the changes that are needed and in that way get more projects through on what is going to be a limited budget.  Even with a massive expansion of the transfer budget, which will almost double, we must remember that a lot of money goes on steady state maintenance.  There is a series of demands on our money.</p></speech>

The Department always seems to be rinsed when it comes to large projects that cost a lot of money.  The taxpayer also wants to see a top quality children's hospital.  Most people who have come through Dublin Airport want to see a high-speed MetroLink and understand the rationale behind it.</p> <p>  On a separate note, there is evidence of the budget for what the Minister is trying to do being spent locally.  I will say that, in fairness, as it relates to other projects.  I am not here to roar and scream about everything all the time.  We are seeing cycling infrastructure being delivered in Fingal and all the rest.  It sometimes seems to be delivered quickly and some kinks need to be ironed out of the designs but people recognise there is investment in local projects.  However, they also want to investment in the big transport infrastructure projects.</p></speech>

We have had projects coming through in terms of cycle lanes and various projects in the city.  It is important that cities compete.  It is also important that we get synergy between cities outside of Dublin.  Cork, Limerick and Galway need synergies.  We talk all the time about balanced regional development but all that has happened is that Dublin has got bigger.  If we are serious, it is important to have a network through which we can get synergies.  We need links in terms of motorways.  A motorway between Limerick and Cork is the missing piece of the jigsaw.  We can beg to differ on a number of issues, but such a motorway would provide bypasses and synergies in terms of traffic times, speed times and safety between cities.  Those things are not mutually exclusive.  I call Deputy Matthews.</p></speech>

The Minister earlier touched on some of the particular challenges.  A separate but related aspect is whether this issue is about reassessing for the NDP, the decision-making processes we have and how we prioritise now.</p><p>We do not have a system in place to adequately assess the challenge of road congestion.  We have congestion between Kilmoon Cross and the Rath roundabout every morning.  The solution presented is major road infrastructure.  It seems the sufficient tools or institutional knowledge to adequately assess alternatives such as working from home, public bus transport and active travel are not available.  We, therefore, end up with major roads infrastructure projects as a result.  It is as if the system is designed to deliver these types of projects.  Is the Government looking to change any of that in light of the new NDP?</p></speech>

NIFTI is concerned with recognising, minimising and reducing demanded travel, putting active travel first, and using existing resources first and it is central.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to rethink and move away from a car dominated system we built over 50 years.  It will be difficult to do but that is exactly what NIFTI is concerned with.</p></speech>

On a general point, Danny McCoy, the head of IBEC, made a speech a year and a half ago, which was seminal, but perhaps not noticed so much because it was given just before the election.  He said, while our State has grown dramatically and has been hugely successful in employment and economic development, one of our difficulties of that was that the size of our State has not risen commensurate to it.  There are areas with underspends or inability to deliver in a timely manner and it is often the case that we need the resources in our Departments and agencies and that the public service and its agencies need that capability.  I said in advance of last year's budget, and as I will probably say tomorrow in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that we need current investment in our State capabilities to help deliver the infrastructure.  We are probably the largest capital spending Department along with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We need the current resources to help deliver that.</p></speech>

NIFTI does not have a specific bearing on investment decisions on projects currently proceeding through the project life cycle.  That is the official answer.  I was inaccurate and wish to correct the record.</p> <p>  On the points raised by Deputy O'Rourke, I will stand by the belief that we need a fundamental shift in change in our entire transport system towards a measure that promotes active travel, safe routes to schools, and creates compact developments and 15-minute cities.  I would not be honest and accurate if I was not upfront in saying that perspective of a radical fundamental change in our transport must happen, particularly in decarbonisation.  We need to reduce the volume of traffic by approximately 25% if we are to meet out climate targets.  Every decision and action taken by the Government has to be informed by that urgent need for a change in the way we do things, and that is what I bring.</p></speech>

He will be glad to hear that I made the switch in recent months.  I cycle and use rail from Clare to here, which is a long distance, but it works.  We need a western railway track.  West=on=Track is a long-standing movement in the west.  It is a shame that a fabulous rail line comes out of Limerick, travels through Cratloe, Sixmilebridge, and Ennis, with little onward connectivity.  I appreciate the Minister has submissions before him for park-and-rail facilities, in addition to a light rail system in the Limerick-Clare border area.  Is there a possibility of reopening Cratloe railway station?  There is a need to upgrade Ennis railway station.  The condition of the station is chronic.  I hope the Minister can provide warm indications on some of the questions.</p></speech>

Rather than always providing for park and rail, bike and rail has massive potential.  In other countries, such as Holland, thousands of bikes are parked outside railway stations daily.  The benefit of that includes saving the land that would have been used as a car park to build housing beside the railway station; people are much healthier and fitter; and it is faster, cleaner and cheaper.  I do not think Irish Rail, or any other plans to date, have properly taken into account the potential for bike and rail.  If we see that as a potential development in every railway station, it would be transformative, as the Deputy is doing, and it would be the future.</p></speech>

As part of that, it would take time and money to open a rail line from either Cratloe or Sixmilebridge to Shannon.  It has potential but it also has complications and would be expensive.  There is sense in what local people suggested to me.  If a good shuttle bus ran between either Cratloe or Sixmilebridge and the airport, there could be a good transport service.  That could make the case, if we were to have a station in Moyross when building the Limerick metropolitan rail, for doing something similar in Cratloe or Sixmilebridge, whichever one is optimal, to service not only Shannon Airport but Shannon Industrial Estate.</p></speech>

They are definitely warriors.  I apologise about earlier.  I accept that the Narrow Water bridge falls under the shared island unit but there are plans to build by 2023.  Would the Minister have a general indication of what the end timeline might look like?  As for the Enterprise service, are we still looking at 2026 or 2027 for delivery of the hourly service?  On electrification, I would ask about the situation with the DART and Drogheda but unfortunately that is already out there in the open and has been delayed beyond what we would want.</p></speech>
