    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#A00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Kehoe.   Senator Mullen is substituting for Senator Boyhan.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones. </p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to engage on the joint committee's report Horse Racing in Ireland, HRI, and the independent review of the anti-doping programme of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB.  The committee will hear from representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the IHRB and HRI.</p> <p>  Since 28 February, the legal requirement of mask-wearing in all settings has been removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use face masks or coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses to give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  The committee will hear from the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer; Mr. Michael Sheahan, deputy chief veterinary officer; and Mr. Tim Drea, senior inspector.  We are joined by the following representatives from the IHRB: Ms Cliodhna Guy, interim CEO and head of legal affairs, licensing and compliance; Mr. Martin O'Donnell, chairman of the board of directors; Dr. Lynn Hillyer, chief veterinary officer and head of equine anti-doping.  From HRI, we will hear from Mr. John Osborne, equine welfare and bloodstock director.  I call on the witnesses to make their opening statements, starting with the those from the Department, who are to be followed by those from the IHRB and HRI.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Ball" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#A00300"><p>I am pleased to attend to provide further information following on from the committee's report Horse Racing in Ireland.  I am accompanied by my colleagues Mr. Michael Sheahan and Mr. Tim Drea.</p> <p>  Over the past two years, a number of reports emerged in the media alleging malpractice with regard to integrity issues in Irish horse racing.  These reports naturally raised concerns in an industry that is hugely valuable to the rural economy.  On foot of these reports, the committee invited officials from this Department and executives from HRI, the IHRB and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association to a series of meetings in July 2021 to discuss anti-doping processes and systems in horse racing.</p><p>Following these meetings, this committee issued a report in November 2021 entitled Horse Racing in Ireland, which included 11 recommendations.  The Department welcomes the report, as do HRI and the IHRB.  We thank members for the considerable work invested in it and note that the report is broadly positive in content. </p><p> Along with the other bodies, the Department was heartened to see the regime of testing and anti-doping measures receive a favourable analysis in the independent review of the IHRB equine anti-doping programme conducted by Dr. Craig Suann.  He was broadly satisfied that the IHRB processes "at least match international best practice in most respects" and that the body "has made significant advances in recent years".</p><p> The recommendations in the joint committee's report have been carefully considered by the relevant bodies in parallel with those made by Dr. Suann in his report.  The Department will continue to work with other relevant stakeholders to ensure the highest standards of integrity and welfare are maintained.  The people of Ireland will not support horse racing if it is seen to be tainted with integrity concerns.  Efforts to counteract the issue of drug taking in any sport, including horse racing, are part of ongoing integrity development processes.</p><p> With regard to the organisation of horse racing, HRI is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  It is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry.  It falls under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As of 1 January 2018, the IHRB has been the statutory regulatory body for all horse racing in Ireland.  Its role is provided for in the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 and subsequent statutory instruments.  However, the body itself remains a private entity.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides for a funding mechanism under which the costs of integrity services provided by the IHRB are guaranteed by HRI annually.  With regard to Exchequer funding for horse racing, section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides for Exchequer support to given to the horse and greyhound racing industries through the horse and greyhound racing fund.  Some &euro;88 million was allocated to the fund in budget 2022, of which &euro;70.4 million was allocated to HRI.</p><p> As to the Department&rsquo;s role in regulation, the Department is the principal regulator of the agrifood sector while the IHRB regulates horse racing, as I have outlined.  There are compliance issues that are of interest to both regulatory bodies.  These specifically relate to the use and supply of illegal substances in racing and the inappropriate use and supply of veterinary medicines for use in equines.  Animal welfare is another such issue.  Certain areas where the Department has regulatory responsibilities may involve prosecution through the courts.  In these cases, Department-authorised officers lead or advise on investigations, prepare prosecution files and liaise with the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to see cases through the court system. </p><p> In August 2020, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine formally signed a memorandum of understanding between his Department and the IHRB providing for officers of the IHRB to be given powers as authorised officers by the Minister under section 10 of the Animal Remedies Act 1993, as amended, thus enhancing the IHRB&rsquo;s investigative powers with regard to the use of animal remedies.  This memorandum aims to advance the already collaborative working arrangements between the Department and the IHRB to improve the oversight, investigative and enforcement powers of the horse racing industry to support animal welfare and to strengthen domestic and international confidence in its brand.  While it extends the powers of the IHRB officers, the memorandum of understanding does not alter the criteria or sanctioning process of the IHRB.  Related prosecutions will remain at the discretion of the Department.</p><p> On the response to the committee&rsquo;s report on horse racing, the committee will have received a letter from the Minister earlier this week setting out the observations of the Department, HRI and the IHRB to the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report and providing an update on actions or activities undertaken.  I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are available to provide any further clarifications and to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliodhna Guy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#B00200"><p>On behalf of the IHRB, I thank the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for their invitation to appear before it.  I am the interim chief executive of the IHRB and the head of licensing and legal and compliance.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Lynn Hillyer, the head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer for the IHRB, and Mr. Martin O&rsquo;Donnell, chairman of the IHRB board of directors.</p> <p>  The IHRB was delighted to accept the committee&rsquo;s invitation to attend today and to take up the opportunity to discuss the committee&rsquo;s report and highlight the steps we are taking to respond to its recommendations.  At the outset, I acknowledge the interest of the members of the committee in the work we do to regulate horse racing in Ireland.  I welcome the committee&rsquo;s willingness to include this issue in its work programme last year and the publication of its comprehensive report last November.  Following the publication of the committee&rsquo;s report, we reviewed the recommendations made by the committee.  We continue to endeavour to build these into our actions.</p> <p>  The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board CLG is a company set up by the Turf Club and Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee to carry out the functions assigned to the racing regulatory body under the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  The IHRB is responsible for regulating the integrity of Irish racing including equine doping control.  It carries out its functions through a team of highly trained professional racing officials and administrative staff in addition to dedicated and experienced voluntary race day stewards and committee members.  The IHRB operates under a service level agreement with Horse Racing Ireland with regard to the provision of integrity services.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides that HRI is responsible for guaranteeing funding to the IHRB to carry out its functions through an integrity services budget, which is agreed annually.</p> <p>  The IHRB recently announced the appointment of Darragh O&rsquo;Loughlin as incoming CEO.  His appointment will effect from 29 June next.  Mr. O'Loughlin has an exceptional combination of regulatory expertise and long experience in sectoral development and advocacy from his roles as secretary general of the Irish Pharmacy Union and as a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the pharmacy regulator.  I am sure that members of the committee will have the opportunity to meet with Mr. O'Loughlin following his appointment.</p> <p>  In response to the committee report&rsquo;s recommendation that an independent review be carried out by an international expert to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s procedures match best international practice, in January 2022, the IHRB requested that Dr. Craig Suann undertake a review of the organisation&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme.  In terms of achieving the necessary level of independence and the appropriate level of expertise and experience, Dr. Suann was, in our opinion, ideal.  He is an Australia-based, globally recognised expert.  He is the former chief veterinary officer for New South Wales and his collaborative work with the Australian Racing Forensic Laboratory has been instrumental in ensuring the first-time detection of several prohibited substances.  Dr. Suann undertook a comprehensive and detailed review of the IHRB&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme.  His report concluded that he was satisfied that it "at least match international best practice in most respects and has made significant advances in recent years."  Dr. Suann made a number of recommendations "with the intention of enhancing the robustness of the programme&rsquo;s processes and outcomes".  We refer the members of the committee to Dr. Suann&rsquo;s report.</p> <p>  The IHRB&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme, led by Dr. Hillyer, has developed into a sophisticated and extensive risk-based and intelligence-led strategy in which it is not just the numbers of samples which matter, but from what horse they are taken and where and when they are taken.  In recent years, the IHRB has undertaken a range of initiatives designed to make significant progress in modernising our systems.  The IHRB has increased testing capabilities and is the first racing authority to routinely take hair samples at race meetings as well as in out-of-competition testing.  Similarly, the appointment of IHRB staff as authorised officers has greatly enhanced the investigation capabilities of the organisation.  This is considered to be a world-leading and groundbreaking initiative.  It effectively means we now have access to any thoroughbred, anywhere, at any time.</p> <p>  Dr. Suann&rsquo;s report, undertaken as a direct response by the IHRB to the committee&rsquo;s recommendation, demonstrates that our equine anti-doping programme is fit for purpose and operates to the best international standards.  The IHRB is currently reviewing the recommendations made by Dr. Suann to see where our programme can be strengthened.</p> <p>  The installation of CCTV cameras at Irish racecourses is a priority for the IHRB and the prominence of this issue in the report is evidence of its importance to the committee.  The IHRB has sought to progress this project to the installation phase as quickly as possible and had hoped to have the installation completed prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The project has been delayed as a result of the complexity of the procurement process and legal correspondence received in relation to that process which extended the standstill period to 28 January 2022.  The extension of the standstill period postponed the conclusion of the procurement phase and, as a result, delayed the commencement of the installation phase.  We regret that the original timeline for the project has had to be adjusted but this has been unavoidable under the circumstances.  The project is now progressing to the installation phase with the framework agreement signed on 29 March.  Site surveys have also been completed by Clardex Systems and a project manager is now in place to conduct the oversight of the project directly.  A timeline for the installation work is being agreed with each individual racecourse, taking into consideration the race day schedules that exist.  The project is planned to be completed by autumn this year.  As the installation phase commences, we will compete the committee updated as to the progress being made.</p><p> The IHRB recognises the importance of having a board which reflects the industry and wider Irish society while considering the role of the IHRB as the regulator of the sport.  We understand the importance this was given by the committee in its reports and want to assure the committee that we are committed to achieving the objective of 40% gender balance at board level, in line with Government guidelines, and recognise the benefit independent members with relevant skillsets can bring to the organisation.  Since the committee&rsquo;s report, we have been working on the process to allow for the appointment of two independent directors to the board.  These positions have now been advertised and the recruitment process is under way.</p><p> The IHRB is the regulatory body for all horse racing on the island of Ireland.  As an organisation, we are very proud of our historic roots stretching back more than 200 years and of the level of voluntary support we get from people and communities across the island.  Historically, the senior stewards and directors of the IHRB are nominated from the cohort of volunteers who dedicate significant time to the sport and have experience as stewards at race day and point-to-points.  We want to continue to retain that support at local level and benefit from the vast experience that our volunteers provide but to do this in a way that complies with the highest standards of governance underpinned by legislation.</p><p> The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 sets out the IHRB&rsquo;s functions, provides for the funding mechanism under which the costs of integrity services are guaranteed by HRI and requires that the annual financial statements of the IHRB be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, submitted to the Minister and laid before the Oireachtas.  The IHRB also complies with the code of practice for governance of State bodies.</p><p> Following a process of public procurement in 2018, LGC Laboratories was selected to provide laboratory services and sample analysis for the IHRB.  Working with LGC, the organisation has been able to reduce the cost per unit of samples and increase the number of samples that can be taken.  From 1 January 2022 to the end of April 2022, a total of 2,009 samples have been taken, of which 66% were taken on the racecourse and at point-to-points and 34% were taken as part of the out-of-competition programme.  In the same period in 2021, 968 samples were taken, of which 930 were taken on the racecourse and 38 were out-of-competition testing.  Of the 2,009 samples taken so far in 2022, four have returned an adverse analytical finding, which is 0.2%.  There have been 40 disciplinary hearings held by the IHRB so far this year, nine of which related to adverse analytical findings.</p><p> In carrying out its anti-doping testing programme, the IHRB applies a risk analysis and intelligence-based strategy to its selection of premises and horses for testing.  The focus is to obtain the right sample from the right horse at the right time.  The appointment of IHRB officials as authorised officers under the Animal Remedies Act enables the IHRB to access thoroughbreds at any time at any venue, even when they are not on licensed premises.  Between January and June 2021, 18 premises were inspected by the IHRB&rsquo;s authorised officers.  This number rose to 141 by the end of the year, after the organisation was able to reactivate inspections following Covid-19 restrictions.  The IHRB has had a much stronger start to 2022, with 87 premises already inspected so far this year, seven of which were unlicensed.</p><p> The IHRB understands the need for confidentiality in such cases to guarantee success.  The inspections are unannounced, with a specific process in operation to ensure that only those who need to know where the team is going know.  This is restricted to the head of anti-doping in the first instance, with the lead investigating officer being informed the evening before and the rest of the team informed only at rendezvous on the morning of the inspection.</p><p> The IHRB has a top-class equine anti-doping team, headed up by Dr. Hillyer, which meets international best practice, having made significant advances in recent years, as highlighted by Dr. Suann&rsquo;s report.  This team works alongside and is supported by colleagues who are highly skilled and experienced in their field, and passionate about their roles in horse racing.  The organisation will continue to work to implement the recommendations of Dr. Suann&rsquo;s review of the equine anti-doping programme and this committee&rsquo;s report on horse racing in Ireland.</p><p> I again thank the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for giving us the opportunity to address them regarding the progress we have made in implementing the recommendations made by this committee.  The IHRB looks forward to working with this committee in the future and will endeavour to keep the committee and its members updated of the progress we make as we continue to strengthen our anti-doping programme.  We would be pleased to engage with any questions or issues that members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Osborne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#C00200"><p>I am representing Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and Suzanne Eade, who, as members know, appears before this committee in a few weeks' time.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to update it on the progress we have made since we met last July.</p> <p>  HRI is a commercial State body under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Our mission is to administer, promote and develop horse racing and breeding on the island of Ireland.  HRI manages many elements of horse racing day-to-day, such as registration of horses, race planning and programming, entries and declarations, prize money and owner accounts.  We assist in the provision of certain specialist services to racing, for example, the modernisation of starting stalls procedures and world-leading photo-finish equipment and personnel are niche areas of excellence in what we do.  We have also set about improving the racing infrastructure through a capital investment programme which has seen great improvements in racecourse facilities for spectators, workers and horses.</p> <p>  At our foundation in 2001, the role of an independent regulator was specifically called out and the IHRB fulfils that role.  We have a good working relationship with the IHRB and its officers, who set and enforce the rules of racing.  Both HRI and IHRB work to an annual budget determined, as with all budgetary matters, through an annual allocation from which all our responsibilities are accounted for.</p> <p>  We are here today principally to focus on the findings of this committee from its deliberations last year and to report to it on our progress with implementation of those recommendations.  We are satisfied that progress has been made on all fronts.   The recently published Suann report on anti-doping was reassuring, stating how our standards match or surpass the best practices worldwide, and we are always seeking to improve upon that strong position.  This conclusion broadly matched the positive endorsement that this committee&rsquo;s report conveyed in November 2021.</p> <p>  In regard to the specific findings of the committee, much of it will be covered by my colleagues in the IHRB.  One area which attracted much comment last year was the provision of CCTV cameras in stable yards and the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that it be expedited.  If I may focus on this for a moment, it is fair to point out that this objective will be delivered on as soon as is possible.  The delivery has been slower than originally anticipated.  We have control systems on all our expenditure.  The complexity of the specification was partly due to each stable yard across 25 different racecourses being very different.  The procurement process was competitive and robust.  These controls are important.  We have a contractor in place, work has commenced and it will be completed by the end of the year.  This project demonstrates how we work collaboratively with racecourses and the regulator to achieve our mutual objective of world-leading horse racing with the highest standards of integrity.</p> <p>  We do not stand still, particularly in the context of the high reputation our racing enjoys.  The integrity of the racing results, which impacts directly on the value of our racehorses, their care and well-being, and also the value of our betting product, is reliant on trust.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#C00300"><p>At the beginning, I said that Senator Mullen was substituting for Senator Boyhan.  That is not the case and Senator Boyhan is attending as a full member of the committee.  I want to clarify that for the record.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  This is a hugely important industry for our country and its integrity is paramount.  As a committee, we felt last year it was important, due to comments that were being made in the media, that we would devote time to it and, as was said, we issued a comprehensive report on the industry.  To respond to one of the points made today, I am disappointed that the CCTV footage has not progressed faster because I believe it is very important.</p> <p>  Ms Guy&rsquo;s statement noted that the IHRB inspected a number of premises and that some were unlicensed.  She might clarify how unlicensed premises exist and why these premises are unlicensed when there are thoroughbred horses on the premises.</p><p>Does the IHRB distinguish between going to a licensed premises as against an unlicensed premises?</p><p>Another bugbear of mine is the registration of thoroughbreds and horses.  When the IHRB goes to a premises to do testing, unless there is an accurate live register of the animals there how can it be sure its testing is comprehensive of all the thoroughbreds in that ownership?  An inspector comes to the farm in the case of bovine tests.  Whether it is ten, 50 or 100 animals, they all have to be there and accounted for on the day.  Where stands the thoroughbred industry and horse racing in general, not just thoroughbreds?  I have a bee in my bonnet about the number of horses that are not microchipped, although most of them are not thoroughbreds.  It is a discussion we have had with the Department in other forums and it comes up a lot when we talk about welfare of horses.  In many cases, when there are welfare issues, the horses are not microchipped.  They are not thoroughbreds, however, and I accept fully that the microchipping of thoroughbreds is 100% comprehensive.</p><p> I know other members want to come in.

Unlicensed premises do not hold a licence under the rules of racing.  I will pass over to my colleague, Dr. Hillyer, who will deal with the Chairman's questions comprehensively.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we would have been in the position where, for example, if there had been an issue, and we had gone in under the rules of racing, we would have had to walk out of the premises and go back in again, if we had wanted to take action as authorised officers.  It was a default to enter as authorised officers.</p> <p>  On the point about how we can ensure we adequately test or examine all the animals on the premises, the Chairman is right that without a full traceability database that is challenging.  What we do to mitigate the risks in the spheres of anti-doping and welfare is examine and inspect every animal we can on the premises.  If we expect there to be a horse that is not present, we go and find that animal, as far as we possibly can.  We know what to expect in respect of horses returned in training.  If an animal is not there that should be, we do everything we can to try to trace it.</p></speech>

The common theme in all three submissions was the welcoming and the complimenting of the independent review by Dr. Suann.</p> <p>  I have a couple of quickfire questions to get some background clarification.  I will delve into the review a little more.  What process or procedure did IHRB follow in coming up with the author, Dr. Suann?  Was there any advertising of expressions of interest?  Who picked him?  </p></speech>

That shortlist was compiled and reviewed.  Dr. Suann was proposed as the person to complete the report and that was approved by the board.</p></speech>

They are co-signatories to many different reports of that body.  Did the fact there was a previous working relationship between our head of anti-doping and Dr. Suann somewhat hinder the independence of the review?</p></speech>

Dr. Suann and the other individuals who were considered also have featured on many committees, as well as Dr. Hillyer, who is involved with the International Conference of Racing Analysts and Veterinarians, ICRAV, and a number of the international committees.  That level of expertise is necessary to review our programme in order to be able to compare it to international best practice.</p></speech>

I know there was Covid, which may be a reason for somebody not to go to the southern hemisphere, but we can discuss that later.  When Dr. Suann required information, it was the IHRB that gave him the information he required for his desktop review.  Who was the point of contact?  When he had a query or when he wanted access to historical figures, numbers of tests, the process of testing, etc., and all the things he reviewed, who was his point of contact?  Who provided him with that information?</p></speech>

He did not have access.  As I said, he never had the opportunity to visit a racecourse or a point to point to see the IHRB testing, to go out on a day with its authorised officers or even to review its historical data, unless it was the historical data it sent to him.

Ideally, we would have loved to have had Dr. Suann over here.  That option remains open in the future should there be a need or the direction to do so.  What we did was open the doors to him.  We opened access to all of our systems and databases, and all of our staff.  He had open access to everything he wanted.  It was not so much us giving him the information we felt he wanted.  He came with long lists of what he needed and he had everything that we could give.  That included interviews with staff, for which I was not present or involved in, and access to our databases and all our records because that was very important for us.  There were no "no access" areas - that is bad English.  All areas were open to him.</p></speech>

I would like our other witnesses to comment on that too because they are all party to this.  I am not knocking the report.  I am not commenting on its content.  I am asking if the witnesses can see how the people we are trying to convince we are squeaky clean and doing everything right could be very sceptical based on what I have stated.</p></speech>

I can count on one hand the number of people who have the necessary expertise and experience to carry out this review.  The Senator is right in that Dr. Suann's skills and qualifications are in the same direction as mine, although he has been around a lot longer than I have and has worked a lot longer in this sphere.  There are two people in the United States, one person in Hong Kong, Dr. Suann and possibly me who are working in this area.  It was very important for us that we went outside Europe and our direct zone to somebody who could critically review us as far as possible.</p></speech>

I beg to differ on what Dr. Hillyer said because I was involved in a company years ago when we were convinced to put in an application for International Organization for Standardization certification.  The way it was explained to me was if these systems were put in, and everybody worked to the system, the man from the moon could come down to see if it was working or not.  While some veterinary background may be needed, it was really the IHRB's systems and processes that were being examined.  If they are written, anybody can tell whether they have been followed or not.  We will not split hairs on Dr. Suann's expertise or professionalism.  Can Dr. Hillyer and our other guests see why people would be sceptical of this report, based on the reasons I have outlined?</p></speech>

This can be done again.  In the world we were in in 2021, it was not the perfect solution but it was a very robust one in the circumstances.</p></speech>

Somebody off-island could have been picked and could have been given IHRB access-all-area passes because there were races at the time.  I would have thought that that would have been taken into consideration.  Dr. Suann knew about Covid when the decision was being made.  Did that not influence the decision as to who to pick?</p></speech>

We went to the top of the list for this person.  We also went to a territory which would be widely accepted to be among the most sophisticated in respect of this field, namely, Australia.  There were far more pluses than question marks in the choice.  Again, the ultimate report was comprehensive.  It went through in fine detail all the processes and came with a very strong endorsement that what was being done was equal to or better than anything Dr. Suann had seen worldwide.  There are not many people with the breadth of perspective on such a specialist area that Dr. Suann has.  That counterbalances the shadow the Senator might feel is over this.  The Senator asks whether, if somebody else was found to do this at some future date, he or she would come to the same conclusion.  I am very confident they would.</p></speech>

In my experience, no matter who is picked to do a report, there is never a perfect candidate and there is always a balance between their expertise, where they are located and so on.  It is correct, and I think it is acknowledged in the report, that in ideal circumstances it would have been better if Dr. Suann was able to visit, but for Covid reasons he was not.  If somebody had been picked from the UK, that could have been open to criticism that the person was too close and people would ask why we did not pick somebody from Australia.  There is never a perfect candidate, but the Senator's point is a reasonable one to make.  It certainly would have been better if Dr. Suann was able to put his hand on the wound and visit.  This area is constantly evolving, so at some stage there will probably be a need for a further review in order that people do not rest on their laurels.  The next time around, it is to be hoped, we will not be in the middle of a pandemic and that point can be addressed.</p></speech>

They will not be as long-winded.  We discussed the authorised officers a lot the last time the witnesses were before us.  We also discussed training of the authorised officers and a training manual.  I think the Department was to give training.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong about the following.  Was there an incident recently in which authorised officers entered private property in Northern Ireland, outside the jurisdiction of the Twenty-six Counties?  While HRI and the IHRB have racing jurisdiction and racing authority there, they were actually breaking the law in that jurisdiction by entering the premises.</p></speech>

I am asking if they entered the premises.  This is not about Northern Ireland but about authorised officers from the IHRB.  I am led to believe they entered a premises.  Irrespective of the fact that they had been trained by the Department and one of the submissions refers to the legal aspect of the authorised officer, still I am led to believe, and I am just looking for confirmation, that that happened.  The authorised officers do not have the authority to enter private properties, licensed or unlicensed, yet they did so.  Is that correct or incorrect?</p></speech>

We are now reviewing the memorandum of understanding, MOU, again with the Department.  We have a meeting on 13 June at which that manual will be refined.  I think I made this point the last time but I probably need to make it again.  The manual was an internal training document.  It has material, including regulatory information, in it which is sensitive and which we have been given by officers and colleagues in the Department as to how to carry out investigations, take statements and so on.  I think where we got to last time was that we were very happy to share the manual in principle, but there are sections of it which it would not be appropriate to share.</p></speech>

We have a lot of engagement with the IHRB, particularly on procedures and practices and working out ways of working together.

I am not very familiar with IHRB's, but in the Department there are complaints procedures that allow people to express concerns about anything we might do.</p></speech>

It further states: "We are satisfied that progress has been made on all fronts."  Does Mr. Osborne stand over that statement?  There are 11 recommendations, observations and conclusions.

I can come back to Mr. Osborne, if he wants to go through the recommendations.  To be helpful, I might reference some of the recommendations that I am talking about.  Recommendation No. 4 states that the committee believes an independent review of the horse racing industry by an outside body is needed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s procedures match international best practices.  This review by the independent body should, it continues, include a full audit of all tests previously carried out, with particular reference to five particular points, which are then set out.  Does the Department intend to establish that review?</p></speech>

It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Committee suggests that the board structure of the new governance regulatory body in the United States could be used as an example in this regard.  With regards to the composition of the board, the Committee recommends that a majority of independent members be appointed to the board by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </blockquote> <p>Does that bear any relationship to what we have just heard from the representatives of the IHRB?</p></speech>

However, we did liaise with the American Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, HISA.  It drafts and enforces safety and integrity rules in thoroughbred racing in the USA.  The HISA was created to implement, for the first time, a national uniform set of rules applicable to every thoroughbred racing participant.  Recently, I took part in a virtual meeting with two executives involved in the racing industry in the USA and the Department's agricultural attach&eacute; in Washington.  The engagement was very useful.  However, the HISA is quite a new organisation, so we have undertaken to continue to maintain a watching brief as to how the systems and structures develop.</p></speech>

The British Horseracing Authority, France Galop and the Japan Racing Association were referenced.  No verdict was passed on the US body.  In fairness, the committee suggested that the board structure of the US body be taken as an example.  Specifically, the committee recommended that a majority of independent members be appointed to the board by the Minister.  That is not happening.</p></speech>

It is not happening.  It is fair to say that.</p><p>Under recommendation 2, the committee asked for consideration to be given to the question of whether legislation should be altered to reclassify the IHRB as a semi-State body under the aegis of the Department to ensure complete transparency in its governance.  Is that going to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Ball" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#G00200"><p>We took the committee's recommendation into account and gathered information relating to the governance structures of horse racing organisations in other jurisdictions.  We have given the examples of what happens in Britain, France and Japan.  We also liaised with individuals in the US.  We found that other major horse racing jurisdictions had a variety of approaches, with each approach appropriate to the jurisdiction in question.  The Department arrived at the belief that the existing model in Ireland, underpinned by Irish legislation, is the best fit for this country.  There is existing legislation and a service level agreement between the IHRB and HRI, which is the State body with responsibility for thoroughbred horse racing.  We believe that provides a sound framework on which to base the regulation of the industry.  However, it is acknowledged that governance practices in all organisations should be reviewed and developed.  To that end, the IHRB has committed to complying with the stringent requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Having considered all of that, the Department's conclusion was that the existing model, underpinned by Irish legislation, is the best fit for this country.</p></speech>

I do not expect Ms Ball to elaborate any further.</p> <p>  Recommendation 5 states that the Department needs to employ veterinarians and technicians to manage and oversee the sampling of racehorses for testing and doping, and ensure the most modern and comprehensive testing regime is in place.  Is that recommendation going to be implemented?</p></speech>

This is one recommendation we considered carefully, but we did not see any merit in the suggestion.  We do not intend to employ Department veterinarians to do the sampling at racecourses.  We considered the recommendation but could not see any particular logic to it.  Dr. Suann's report also concluded that the sampling process is done by two assistants and a full-time veterinarian.  From reading back through the transcripts of debates, I am not sure from where the recommendation emerged.  We could not see any particular logic to it.  The process seems to work very well.</p></speech>

Recommendation 11 covers an issue that come up often at the committee.  It stated that full traceability of horses via an electronic system, like the AIM system for cattle, of which this committee is well aware, needs to be introduced by the Department immediately.  Is that going to happen immediately?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Sheahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#G00600"><p>It is not going to happen immediately, but it would be fair to say that a lot of progress has been made in respect of traceability in horses albeit there is still a long way to go.  As we discussed at our most recent visit to the committee, we always talk about how good our cattle traceability system is and to a lesser extent, how good our sheep and pig systems are.  The horse system, while it has come a long way, is not at the same stage as the AIM system for cattle.  Having said that, we should acknowledge that we have come a long way from where we started our journey to trace horses.  The Department became involved in horse traceability in 2012.  In that year, we introduced a central database for the first time.  In 2013 or 2014, the change of ownership legislation was introduced.  In 2014, EU legislation, and Irish legislation thereafter, considerably strengthened the identification of horses because it included the need for them to be microchipped and so on.</p> <p>  We mentioned at the most recent meeting we had with the committee that we were planning an equine census.  That census happened in November 2021.  There will be a further equine census in November 2022 because there were some issues with the technology and so on in last year's census.  We are moving towards more real-time information about where horses are at any time.  There are particular difficulties with tracking horses compared to cattle because as part of the training and breeding processes, horses move considerably more often.  We are moving in that direction but it is unrealistic to say we could introduce that recommendation immediately.  The census was an important step on that journey and there will be a follow-on census in November this year which we hope will build on that progress.  There are plans to give people access to the equivalent on an AIM database that will allow horse owners to update their profile in real time, similar to the process in respect of cattle.  It will take a bit of time but significant progress is being made.</p></speech>

I will not go into the other recommendations.  This is the committee at which our guests will get the best hearing in respect of horse racing.  Uniquely and unanimously, the members of this committee have a keen interest in seeing horse racing in Ireland succeed.  Our starting point for all of these interactions is to consider what is in the best interests of Irish horse racing.  The committee has made a number of recommendations and observations, and arrived at conclusions, following consultation with all the players in the sector and the general public.  The reason we did so - and took so much time in doing so - is because there is a lot of public unease and distrust relating to whether the systems in place are robust, fair and, above all, independent.  The responses the committee has got back are not up to the standard required in order for us to say in confidence that the sector is above reproach.</p> <p>  Having gone through the recommendations and heard the responses we have received, I must ask Mr. Osborne if he still stands over his statement that in respect of the implementation of the recommendations of this committee, he is satisfied that progress has been made on all fronts?</p></speech>

They are guests of ours and I think that is an important point to make.  I thank them for coming to the meeting.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions that will come in a slightly disjointed way.  I do not mean for them to be disjointed but they are observations I have noted.  I found the IHRB's Integrity Racing Statistics 2019 an interesting document.  Does such a document exist for 2020 and 2021 and if so, may we have a copy of them?  They are IHRB documents.</p> <p>  The Equine Anti-Doping Report is a new departure for the IHRB.  I think I read somewhere the intention is that those reports will be published quarterly.  Would our guests like to comment on anything in that anti-doping report?  Were there any statistics or concerns in that report that jumped off the page?  I have read the document but I want to ask our guests if there is anything they would like to bring to the attention of the committee in that regard?</p></speech>

The integrity statistics are published annually and are available on our website.  The 2022 statistics will be published shortly.  The 2021 statistics are on the website.  We can arrange to send them to the committee.</p></speech>

I could not find those 2021 statistics but that may have been my fault.  As our guests know, the committee made certain substantial recommendations.  I am concerned at the slow progress.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  We are here because we believe in the industry and are supportive of it.  I can declare that I have a reasonably keen interest in horse racing.  I attend races at Leopardstown, the Curragh, Punchestown and a number of other places.  I have an interest in the industry, as do most others on the committee.  It is an important industry and, as Deputy Carthy said, everyone wants to see it succeed.</p><p>We are not here to point the finger at anyone but it would be remiss of us if we did not raise the concerns that we received from the public and the bigger industry in regard to it.  That is an important point to make.</p><p> In our recommendation No. 8, we state that as Ireland has a large horse racing industry, the committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine considers developing laboratory capacity in Ireland to build a national expertise in testing as well as employment opportunities in this field.  That was a recurring theme.  We see that the work of the IHRB was contracted out to an independent laboratory, LGC.  I understand from the report that it was not audited by Dr. Suann.  He did not audit the work of the IHRB's contracted independent laboratory, LGC.  Is that correct?  If so, why?</p></speech>

The first is a basic accreditation under ISO 17025 under UKAS, so there is a statutory requirement for it to be audited.  It then has to jump through a few more hoops in terms of its extra qualifications or standing in relation to horse racing testing.  In particular, it must pass continual testing by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities.  A group there assesses its competence to allow it to maintain its certified laboratory status.  The laboratory was not reaudited because Dr. Suann was able to rely on those very formal audit processes that were already in place.</p></speech>

I have received complaints about it.  Personally, I would not necessarily share those views.  I think the authorised officer is a process.

Is there any resistance?</p></speech>

To take a broad brush, we have only been in operation about a year.  The warrant cards were issued on 21 May 2021.  We are careful to behave respectfully and carefully at all times.  Some visits warrant a different approach but it depends on the inspection.  To put numbers on it, I would say 95% of the time we would enter very similarly as we would on a normal licensed premises.  In other words, going to a gate, ringing the doorbell or the gatebell, and proceeding.  Sometimes, and only specifically in relation to intelligence, information or a risk basis, we have to behave differently.  By definition usually if that is the case we will actually be with our colleagues from the investigations division.</p></speech>

Then we have the memorandum of understanding which is an agreement between the two parties around how the IHRB will exercise those powers.  An authorised officer under the 1993 veterinary medicines legislation can deal with cattle and farmers, and has the powers to do all that.  The memorandum of understanding sets out how IHRB officers will work, given their role and where they will operate.  They are focused on thoroughbred horses, people associated with them and places where they might be.  It gives them more scope in that sense and the powers set out in legislation to search, seize and sample.  It basically gives them the powers that the Department has.</p></speech>

I will go back a stage.  We have a range of different tasks we must complete on each inspection.  When we appointed the panel of 12 authorised officers last year, we deliberately went outside the veterinary officer core team to make sure we had broad coverage of other skill sets.  We have on the team somebody who used to be an authorised officer with the Department, people who have come from a security official background and a person who is an equine vet nurse.  The only thing the veterinary officers would do in terms of procedures that the others cannot do is to take a blood sample.  The Senator is correct on that.  In terms of everything else-----</p></speech>

For other inspections, and this was in train before the authorised officer element came in, we would have had non-vets going out because it is important we achieve the coverage we need.  As I said, our inspection process is intelligence-led and risk-based.  In order to cover the number of premises we have to cover, we need to make sure we have a big enough team to do that.  I do not have a team of 12 veterinary officers.  The skills the others bring to us are as important as the skill of taking a blood sample.  Of course, the veterinary officers on the team have a deeper understanding of veterinary matters.  That goes without saying.  We make sure we deploy the veterinary officers we have where they are really needed and we make sure the other skill sets are bought into play.  For example, I mentioned one of the team was an authorised officer with the Department previously.  His expertise and experience in taking statements and interviewing would far surpass ours.  That mixture of skills was what was important to us.  It is a very new role for us.  It is not what we used to always do.   We used to have a veterinary officer and an official go out on inspections five or ten years ago but that is not the case now.</p></speech>

For clarification purposes, I have two further questions.  Dr. Hillyer noted the board is new to the game with respect to the authorised officer element.  What is the role between the Department and the board when it comes to inspections?  What ignites the need for an inspection?  I will not mention any of the particulars of the case that was referenced.  The case in Monasterevin was well documented and I read about it.  I read somewhere that the Department was on site with the Garda and the site was sealed before the board was even informed.</p><p>Is that correct?  Why was that?  If the IHRB is responsible for this area, why did the Department not share the information it had until it had the crime scene, for want of a better term, sealed off and was <i>in situ</i>?</p></speech>

There are some inspections we would carry out based on intelligence and risk that we have assessed, which we would not necessarily bring the Department in on.  There are inspections the Department would carry out that it does not necessarily need or want us to be involved in until the appropriate time.</p></speech>

I cannot comment on a particular operation but in broad terms, there are operations that do not require our presence because they may not have anything to do with racing.  There are other operations where we will closely collaborate with the Department's authorised officers from the get-go.  We will plan the operation with them and plan exactly how things will be accessed and carried out.</p> <p>  Regarding the earlier question as to what triggers an inspection, I can only speak for us.  Perhaps Mr. Drea will speak for the Department's team.  For us, it is a question of going through our normal risk register of all our licensed premises.  Those that have not been inspected for a long time, such as those that had a previous positive or have come to light for whatever other reason, are visited more frequently or more regularly.  Others, where we are satisfied there are no breaches of rules or issues, would be inspected less regularly.  That is the baseline.  There are other factors on top of that.  If there is a welfare concern or we have intelligence about an animal or welfare compromise, that premises would go to the top of the list immediately.  That inspection is then carried out as immediately as is possible.  If we have intelligence about doping, medication or animal remedies, it will depend on what it is.  That information will be assessed and that assessment will often involve colleagues in Mr. Drea's division, who will take appropriate action.</p></speech>

In that case we suspected there were veterinary medicines that should not be there.  As a principle, we keep the initial team as tight as we can.  We always do that in the Department.  We assess the number of people we need and who we might need to go in initially.  Then we see what is there and we determine if we need additional people or other organisations.  In principle, we keep it as tight as we can in our division.  That is based on a long history of doing work with the Garda, GRI, IHRB and lots of other agencies.</p></speech>

I thought at the time it was a little funny that the Department was there before the IHRB was even informed.  When we first initiated these inquiries, we had the board before the committee with Ms Guy's predecessor, Mr. Egan.  At that time, we were all receiving a lot of correspondence from people calling themselves whistleblowers or informants.  They provided us with a lot of information, which they had provided to the IHRB and no action had been taken.  Has any action been taken on the back of those informants?  It goes back to the previous question as to what stimulates an inspection.  Are there any outstanding files in the IHRB's offices with complaints from people identifying potential misuse?  There were the previous time the board was before the committee.  We were getting a lot of correspondence collectively from people who said they had informed the IHRB about issues.  One line said, "I can bring you to the cabinet in the yard and show you what is in it", and no action was taken.  We were given a commitment at the time that those correspondence and all future similar correspondence would be acted on.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

It is important to stress that us acting on information may not always mean us literally getting in our cars and going to a yard.  Acting on information can mean working up that information, in close collaboration with Mr. Drea's team, and putting the pieces of the jigsaw together.  I could count on two hands the number of ongoing investigations where we are gradually working up the pieces of information we have.  That involves putting pieces of information together and producing intelligence, which is then assessed and acted upon.  As tempting as it is to go out and deal with something rapidly, that is not always the right answer.  In a recent example, it took several weeks to pull the pieces together to make sure the necessary ducks were in a row.  That includes working with a divisional office, Mr. Drea's team and our team to make sure we have boxed off the various issues that could arise.  That way, when we do act, it is as effectively and as properly as possible.</p></speech>

In its opening statement, the IHRB states that between January 2022 and the end of April 2022, a total of 2,009 samples were taken.  Of those samples, four returned some adverse analytical findings.  It further states, "There have been 40 disciplinary hearings held by the IHRB so far this year, nine of which related to adverse analytical findings."  What was the outcome of those disciplinary hearings?  What were the sanctions?  I know the witnesses cannot get into the granular detail but what were the outcomes of those hearings?</p></speech>

The witnesses are very good at setting our their stall and I commend them for that.  They should not miss this opportunity.  I ask Ms Guy to share that with the committee.

Some of the jockey cases we dealt with included interference, not riding the horse on merit and whip regulation beaches.  Regarding adverse analytical findings in cases we have had, Dr. Hillyer might be in a better position to outline the sanctions.</p></speech>

The minimum sanction is &euro;1,000, and the horse is inevitably disqualified from the race.  There may be other stand-down periods or sanctions applied.  The fine can then go up.  There has been a &euro;5,000 fine, and there has been a very significant fine recently.  However, some of the cases are still undergoing process, so I do not believe I can comment on them.</p></speech>

However, the more we can say about these sanctions, the greater the confidence instilled in people.  I do not doubt the delegates' ability, commitment and integrity - absolutely not - but we have a job to instil public confidence.  Therefore, the more we can share information on the sanctions, particularly for doping, the better.  The rumours and allegations are rife.  Anyone can hurl abuse at all sorts of people, but, as Dr. Hillyer rightly said, allegations must be substantiated.  Due process is important.  I acknowledge and accept all that but believe it is important that the public know more about the disciplinary procedures and sanctions.  A fine of &euro;1,000 does not strike me as very big in the world of equestrian sport.  I ask the delegates to take this away as something really important.</p> <p>  With regard to developing laboratory testing capacity, the Department indicated that it does not see itself as having a role.  I would have believed it would have been good for it to have a role because the Department has credibility, is held in high esteem and is somewhat removed from the industry.  I would have believed this would have helped to instil confidence.  It is all about confidence-building.  What are the plans?  I would like to believe all the testing can happen in the Republic of Ireland.  It should happen here.  I would not like to believe any of it is outsourced outside the State.  What are the plans for the development of the testing?</p></speech>

It is open to laboratories internationally.  Our focus is on the standard.  We need to ensure the standards our samples are being tested to are the international ones.  We have sought to ensure that any candidate for the tender process must meet those standards and at least be certified by the IFHA, which, as Dr. Hillyer has laid out, does the certification of laboratories.  There are six laboratories internationally.  We have asked that they at least meet certain standards, if not exceed them.  Our focus is on ensuring that our samples are tested to the highest standard possible according to international best practice.</p></speech>

I would like to put my next question to all of our guests.  With regard to the two reports, including the joint committee's report on the industry, with its 11 recommendations, not enough progress has been made.  The independent review carried out by the IHRB resulted in 18 recommendations.  I am aware that recommendations overlap.  When do the delegates seriously believe these will be acted upon?  If the delegates were to return here in three months at our suggestion, would they come here reporting a lot of progress?  That question is for all the witnesses.  It is really important.  There is a sense of frustration over the slow progress.  Let us be honest about it.  This is about instilling confidence in the industry, not about persecuting it at any level.  It is about having a very viable industry on which we can pride ourselves as Irish people.  The Minister is absolutely committed to this.  I do not doubt anybody's commitment.  Therefore, how do the delegates believe we can arrive at the implementation of our 11 recommendations and, of course, the 18 recommendations in the independent review?</p></speech>

It would be wrong to say that we could come back here in three months with all the recommendations implemented.  That is not a fair timetable for us to work to.  At present, we are dealing with the reports by both the joint committee and Dr. Suann.  We are working towards the 2023 budgetary cycle.  It will be in the autumn of this year when we will have an understanding of what budget is available to us and when we will make proposals as to what we want to do.</p> <p>  This is going to be an ongoing job for us as members of a regulatory body.  We can never stand still; we have to keep going.  There will always be things that we can change and improve on.  We will continue that work.  Mr. O'Loughlin will also focus on that area.  Between me and all my colleagues in the organisation, we are focused on the integrity of Irish horse racing and carrying out our work to the best of our ability, in addition to putting the structures in place to enable our staff and the volunteers to do their jobs.  That is a very important part.  We are welcoming the interest from the committee and are happy to come here to lay out what we do and ensure it is understood.</p></speech>

Irish racing has never had such a high reputation globally, but with that comes the expectation of ever-increasing standards.  I would be disappointed if we came in here at any time and said "Job done" and that we were finished, because this is ever-evolving.  We are dealing with a subject that involves dealing with people who are trying to cheat the system or whatever.  We must be ever-vigilant about that.  We will always be trying to get better and never be standing still.</p> <p>  On the specific recommendations, I stand over what I said earlier.  Progress has been made on all fronts although some of it is slower than we would have liked, for reasons that are perfectly explainable but, to a certain extent, outside our control.  However, we are doing things in the right way rather than at a specific pace because we want to get the right outcome regarding many of these recommendations.  We are doing very well on the integrity and reputation front, which is so valuable to the Irish industry.</p></speech>

We have made progress on all 11 recommendations but I accept that there are one or two on which we may have agreed to disagree.  In general, however, progress has been good.  On the traceability front, there is no point in pretending it will happen overnight.  We have come a long way since we started around 2012 and a lot of progress has been made, but we are still a little bit away from where we are on the cattle front.  Having said that, nothing stands still, even on the cattle front.  By coincidence, while wearing a different hat today I was dealing with the electronic identification of cattle, with which some of the members will be very familiar.  I was amused.  We have a report from 1990, believe it or not, making a very compelling case for the electronic identification of cattle.  Now, in 2022, we are finally at the point of having the electronic identification of cattle.  Sometimes, even though there is a great idea and the case for it is made very strongly, it can take time to realise it.  Since we live in a democracy, we have to bring stakeholders along with us.  That is the reality of the world we live in.  The position is somewhat the same on traceability and horses.  There is a little way to go but we have come a long way.  Many of the developments we talked about earlier, including the census and the electronic passports that were introduced for the first time last year, will lead to considerable progress in the next couple of years.</p></speech>

The committee, Department, HRI and the IHRB should all be trying to work as quickly as possible to resolve these issues and restore confidence in the industry.  We all know how important it is.  I apologise for having had to go to another meeting.  Some of the answers I have heard have been somewhat evasive.  It is in everybody's best interest that we get answers as quickly as possible.  No one is expecting the Department to do everything overnight or in a month, but there are issues on which it seems to be dragging its heels.</p> <p>  I will go through some of the recommendations.  I apologise if they have been covered.  Let me comment on recommendation 4.  It has been stated that all blood, hair and urine samples taken by the IHRB within the past five years from licensed and unlicensed premises have been individually analysed and that all adverse analytical findings are subject to disciplinary procedures.</p><p>The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, notes that it had concerns about the length of time taken to do the investigation and the disciplinary process.  Why did the IHRB have concerns?  What is the average length of time that a disciplinary procedure would take?</p></speech>

Investigations are generally completed quite quickly.  Sometimes a disciplinary process takes a bit longer to progress.  I would also like to clarify that there is no average time and there is no set time.  These investigations can take time.  One might have quite a considerable amount of analyses to be done on samples to try to best identify the origin or the source of the adverse analytical finding.  Perhaps Dr. Hillyer is better placed to answer this.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, it is really important for us as a regulator, for the individual who is affected, for the owner, and for all of those involved with the horse, that as much as possible is understood as to why a substance has become present in a finding.  It is not just a question of "Oh well, that is very nice and we will carry on".  As my colleague has said, that investigation is initiated immediately on hearing any warning bells coming from the laboratory.  What we have done, particularly in the last few years, is to focus all of our effort, attention and time on that phase of events.  It can involve extended out-of-competition testing, repeat visits, and collaboration with colleagues in the Department.  All sorts of stuff happens.  I am happy that this is as good and as sharp as it can be.  I would be first in the queue to say that I would love the rest of the process to be quicker.  It has not been, but we are working on it and we are prioritising it.  I want to be as good as we can be, and we want to be as good as we can be.  When we compare ourselves with other processes in other jurisdictions, although it feels very slow to me, I am reminded that it is not actually that slow.  It feels slow to me but it is not that slow.  I hope this answers the question.</p></speech>

Can we talk about the training of these authorised officers?  There is no mention made of the authorised officer manual.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lynn Hillyer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#N00700"><p>I believe that I covered a little bit on the training the last time.  Very briefly, the training started with an assessment and an introduction last year.  Each of the panel of 12 were assessed in order for their suitability to go onto the authorised officer panel in the first place.  There was training that was kicked off by the Department in the areas of legislation, animal remedies, processes such as statement taking and witness organisation, and those types of matters.  We then really got into the job itself last year.  The first inspections were carried out after 21 May when our warrant cards were issued.  We have done a combination of on-the-job training and supports and training as needs have become identified.  With regard to sessions and how we get together as a team, we have done the inevitable Zoom training, which had to happen because of remote methods being needed.  We have got together in the room  at our offices where we have pulled out vat loads of medicines to go through.  Again, we have collaborated with colleagues in the Department as to what gaps we need to fill.  Particular and specific medicines training is being delivered by an external provider.  The list goes on.  I would be very happy to provide a more detailed list if the committee is interested in what is being done.</p> <p>  The next key date on the horizon is actually happening in the middle of this month where we will get together with colleagues and authorised offices in the Department, and also colleagues working in the greyhound sector, to compare and contrast and look at how we are doing things.  We will receive joint training together.  That sort of synergy and collaboration is really important as part of our support to our team.</p> <p>  Each of the members of our team have come with different skill sets, as I have already gone through earlier. There has been specific bespoke training for certain individuals on, for example, how to use some digital equipment we have, on specific medicines, and on prescriptions for the non-vets.  It has not been a one-size-fits-all.  We have tried very hard to listen to the feedback from the team and support them on an individual basis, as well as doing the generic obligatory training.</p></speech>

What has the reaction been when they have gone into yards?  Are they allowed to go into yards?  If a garda comes up he or she would need a warrant to go into a house or into a farm.  Are these officers allowed to just go in without a warrant?</p></speech>

I will answer the third part first.  When we attend a premises, as I said earlier, we try to behave as respectfully as we possibly can.  Processes, training and all sorts of things could be going on in that yard at the time we go in.  We will literally ring on the doorbell, unless there is a very good reason not to, which I already went into earlier.  We will explain our presence.  Normally, we would telephone the trainer or the person responsible first off.  We will enter and introduce ourselves and present warrant cards, go through why we are there and explain very clearly what it is we need to do.  I can honestly say that I have not had any resistance on any of the inspections that I have been on.  I have had nothing but collaboration and co-operation from licensees and from non-licensees.  Given that this was totally new for non-licensees last year we did try to work with the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, ITBA to put out a question-and-answer session as to what to expect and we have tried to be very transparent about what we do.  Even so, it was new.  I have actually been very impressed and pleasantly surprised by how the vast majority of people are actually the opposite and say "We are very pleased to see you", or words to that effect.  I am sure there are some who would rather we were not there but they certainly never say that or obstruct us, or cause any issue that has caused us to have to escalate matters.</p> <p>  As I said earlier the manual itself was intended and written as a training aid.  It is an internal document.  There are sections in there that are sensitive in terms of regulatory information.  There are no secrets in there, however.  We have had discussions with others in the Department about how we can share this information without compromising the operations that we do.  I would like to find a way of doing that, even if we can just share the headlines of some of the sections in order that people can see what is in there, but perhaps some of the detail might need to come out.  At the end of the day, we are all trying to achieve the same thing, which is to underline competence in these systems, while being transparent.  I need to do that and I want to do that but we cannot undermine the systems themselves.  At the end of the day this is-----</p></speech>

We have spoken about this before with regard to micro-chipping of the dogs, which also has a number of databases that do not necessarily coalesce or communicate with each other.  The report states that the Department database is centralised.  Will the Department tell us is that a one-stop shop for checking microchips?  For example, can vets access the databases themselves or must they contact the Department first?</p></speech>

At the moment the central database works whereby the six passport issuing bodies are all linked.  They populate our central database.  All the information in the central database comes from them, including the microchip number, the name of the horse, the registered owner, and so on.  The public or the vets do not have access to the central database as such.  If somebody needs information they must come through us, if they are entitled to access information.  It is not open to the public to access it.  It is usually, for example, if a horse is being slaughtered or if someone has an inquiry about a horse being exported.  Then he or she can contact us and we can confirm the details of the horse or whatever, as needs be.</p></speech>

The authorised officer status for IHRB, in terms of animal medicines in these types of equestrian premises, is a plus for us because it gives us additional resources and additional authorised officers on the ground, if we need them.  So if we get information that we think is relevant to the IHRB then the IHRB-authorised officers can accompany us.  That is an improvement on what existed before.</p></speech>

However, it may be an operational flaw in that the IHRB depends on legislation.  I was struck by one of the points made by Dr. Hillyer in terms of who is identified with testing.  So if somebody has a better track record or if they have been tested before and seem to be doing okay then they are less likely to get more frequent testing.</p> <p>  I appreciate Dr. Hillyer is relatively new to her role and that the IHRB is an organisation that is very much in an evolutionary mode.  Does she see a phase where we will reach a certain point?  It is always good to have intelligence and it is important that we encourage whistleblowers.  Does she envisage we will have reached utopia when we have a structured situation whereby anybody at any time is at risk of an inspection?  I do not mean that people should live in fear but they should aspire to knowing that if they get an inspection, it will be head and shoulders above the rest.   </p></speech>

We have a similar sampling pressure, sampling density, when compared with our nearest neighbours across the water.  Compared with other jurisdictions, such as possibly France Galop and some of the Australian jurisdictions, we do not do as much and increasing our on-course testing was in Dr. Suann's report.  I welcome that.  We had some of these plans in mind.  We set out in 2019 in our strategic plan that we wanted to increase certain types of testing.  Pre-race testing is the one that has received a lot of coverage but also on-arrival testing and less predictable testing on-track.  Where we want to get to now is to work on that.  To be honest, I have been focused on the out-of-competition testing for the past two to three years.  We had to get our percentage of out-of-competition testing up from where it was and we have done that now.  We certainly are not going to rest on our laurels but we now need to increase our on-track testing.</p></speech>

I thank our guests from the IHRB for being so forthright.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Department.  Passports come up every time we bring officials from the Department before us in the context of animal welfare.  Deputy Martin Browne touched on the issue.  Lower down the food chain in the horse industry, when we move into sports horse territory where horses may not necessarily be as valuable, and especially in the area of leisure horses, there is significant concern about the policing and monitoring of passports.  I am not sure which of the officials were at a previous hearing at which I referred to one owner who contacted me having checked the register and found that 24 horses were registered to him.  Although he only had six horses at the time, the register indicated he owned 24 horses.  When he checked, several of the horses were dead and a number had been exported but no effort had been made to update the register.</p> <p>  I appreciate Mr. Sheahan's point on the length of time it is taking to get us to where we are with cattle.  At the same time, I can go into SuperValu in Longford and see what farm my striploin has come from.  It is not many years since we had the horsemeat scandal in the UK.  It is an issue for the integrity of the food chain.  In the context of the Department's commitment and priorities, how close are we to seeing a realistic effort to resolving the horse passport issue?  Will there be a statutory responsibility, not dissimilar to what we have for cattle, on horse owners to ensure they update the register?  They are certainly not doing that at the moment, especially in the leisure and sport horse sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Sheahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022060100002#P02300"><p>Regarding the Department's commitment, there is no question we are committed to it.  Maybe sometimes we beat ourselves up a bit too much about how bad things are, as the Deputy mentioned, going down the food chain.  I am certainly not trying to say things are perfect - far from it.  At the same time, it is fair to say things have improved a hell of a lot, certainly in the last ten years.  By way of example, members will all be familiar with Ballinasloe Horse Fair, which is the biggest of its kind.  It is for the sport horse and leisure horse sector.  We first got involved in the Ballinasloe fair 12 or 14 years ago.  There is a very good committee there and it is a very well-organised event that attracts considerable international attention.  We got involved with the committee and the Garda in relation to checkpoints for horses going to the fair.  I cannot remember off the top of my head what year we first got involved but it was probably 2006 or 2007.  In the first year, we accompanied garda&iacute; at checkpoints on all the entries into Ballinasloe.  At that stage, the number of horses with passports was probably 10% or something of that order.  In that first year, when we did the manned checkpoints, we took a very benign approach.  We asked people if they knew they were supposed to have a passport for their horse but allowed them to continue on.  However, we said we would be back again next year and told people they might be turned away.  We went back for a number of years subsequently and within the space of a short number of years, compliance levels at the Ballinasloe fair had gone from 10% to 99%.  Even at that fair and places like it, there was a realisation that things had changed and a passport was required.  Even from the point of view of selling a horse and whatever, anyone who does not have a passport when selling a horse will be more or less at nothing.  I am not trying to whitewash this or say every horse in the country is microchipped and passported.  Not all of them are and there are still problem areas.</p> <p>  I will give another measure of how much things have improved.  Everybody has noted that animal welfare is hugely important and it is one of the main issues we are here to talk about.  If we take the figures on the control of horses and the number of horses seized by local authorities over the years, they show that the numbers have decreased dramatically since the peak in 2013 and 2014.  Again, that is not to say the problem is solved - far from it - but-----</p></speech>

As I said, there is no way of providing proof.  I can only give examples of the likes of the Ballinasloe fair.  When we do checks there, we find the number of horses microchipped and passported is close to 100%.  Nobody is turning up in Ballinasloe at the time we have checkpoints without a passport or microchip.  As I said, the figures for horses seized by the local authorities, which are often an indication of the scale of the problem, were close to 5,000 as recently as 2013 and 2014.  These are stray and abandoned horses, etc.</p><p>By 2019 that was down to just over 1,000 and last year it was down to under 400.  That is not to say the problem is solved; far from it.  However, we are in a far better position in terms of the scale of the problem than we were ten years ago.</p></speech>

We had the first equine census in November last year and we will have a second one in November of this year.  The first time we did it, it would be fair to say it was not as successful as we would have liked because we ran into unexpected technology problems.  Normally our technology in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is superb and I mention our animal identification and movement, AIM, database and our animal health surveillance.  However, for one reason or another the technology let us down with people being unable to do the census online and a lot of people had to resort to paper in the end, which was a bit frustrating.  We have learned a lot from that and we will be repeating the census in November 2022.  The first census has been completed and the data are being worked on.  It is a big step forward but we still have a bit to go.</p></speech>

I remind members they are required to attend from either the committee room or remotely from within the Leinster House complex.  Should a division occur, any member participating remotely will be required to make his or her way to the committee room within the normal division time to vote before returning to his or her original location.  Under public health arrangements, the proceeding of Oireachtas committees are now conducted without the requirement for social distancing and with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room and its environs should endeavour to continue to sanitise and wash hands, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Those with any symptoms of Covid, no matter how mild, should obviously not attend.</p> <p>  Apologies have so far been received from Deputies Shanahan and Bruton.</p></speech>

It also gives effect to EU Directive 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services; EU Directive 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods; and to the main provisions of EU Directive 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules.  </p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Troy, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is accompanied by his officials.  </p> <p>  Groupings are applied to amendments as follows: amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 8 to 18, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 4 and 121; amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 23 to 30, inclusive; amendments Nos. 35 to 50, inclusive; amendments Nos. 52 to 54, inclusive; amendments Nos. 56 to 59, inclusive; amendments Nos.66 to 69, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 71 to 85, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 87 to 99, inclusive;  amendments Nos.105, 106, 109 to 120, inclusive; amendments Nos. 123 to 141, inclusive; amendments Nos. 150 to 155, inclusive, and amendment No. 163;  amendments Nos. 21 and 122;  amendments Nos. 31 to 34, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 60 to 65, inclusive and amendment No. 86; amendments Nos. 100 to 103, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 143 to 149, inclusive; and amendments Nos. 156 to 162, inclusive.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022060100002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for its assistance in bringing the Bill to where we are today.  The Consumer Rights Bill is a long and complex piece of legislation that transposes three EU directives and updates existing domestic consumer rights law.  The purpose of the Bill is to reform, modernise and consolidate consumer protection legislation by bringing existing provisions together in a single enactment while introducing enhanced consumer protection measures.  The Bill will give effect to the following three consumer rights directives: directive 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services; directive 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods; and the main provisions of directive 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules.</p> <p>  This Bill marks an important step forward in consumer protection as it has the safeguarding of consumer rights at its heart.  It will be good for traders in that it puts responsible behaviour on a legislative footing and evens the playing field for all, so that traders who do not treat customers fairly and honestly will be held accountable and will not gain an unfair competitive advantage.</p> <p>  Since publication, small errors have emerged, as well as places where more precision or clearer language should be used.  The vast majority of Government amendments put forward today are to address these technical issues.  It is important we deal with these grammatical, technical and clarifying amendments to ensure the legislation is as accurate and robust as it can be.  There are some slightly more substantive amendments being introduced and I will give further explanation of those as we reach them.</p> <p>  I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward certain amendments aimed at ensuring the powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, are sufficient for the additional functions they will have as a result of the Bill.  I also intend to bring a technical amendment on the definition of "basic rate" in relation to charges for communications by telephone to bring it into line with a ruling of the European Court of Justice.  As these amendments require further development, I put it on notice that I intend to bring them forward on Report Stage.</p> <p>  I also stated on Second Stage that I would bring forward an amendment to section 459 of the Companies Act 2014.  However, this amendment is still being finalised.  It is therefore my intention to bring forward this amendment on Report Stage.  The purpose of the amendment will be to clarify the role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when holding on trust the unclaimed properties of dissenting shareholders who have not sought to claim the properties in the seven years following an acquisition.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022060100002#B00700"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 15, line 5, after &ldquo;contract&rdquo; &rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than in Part 5)  </blockquote> <p>These amendments are straightforward.  They are technical amendments aimed at clarifying the meaning of &quot;sales contract&quot;.  The definition of that term in section 2(1) states it &quot;has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 11(1)</i>&quot;.  However, while the main definition of sales contract is in section 11(1), section 10(1) states that the term includes:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) a contract concluded between one part-owner and another, and<br /><br />(b) a contract for the sale of goods to be produced or manufactured by the trader, including goods made to the consumer&rsquo;s specifications. </blockquote> <p>As a result, the cross-reference to section 11(1) in the definition of &quot;sales contract&quot; in section 2(1) is too narrow.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 refer to minor technical changes.  Amendment No. 3 deletes the term &quot;or supply&quot; from section 2(4), which states: &quot;A reference in this Act to the sale or supply of goods includes a reference to the transfer of, or an undertaking to transfer, the ownership of those goods.&quot;  The reference to the supply of goods in the subsection is incorrect and should be deleted as the supply of goods is generally understood to encompass transactions, such as hire purchase agreements, under which ownership of the goods will not or may not be transferred.  Amendment No. 8 removes the provision in section 10 which states what a sales contract includes.  Amendment No. 9 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 10 follows amendment No. 8 in that it transfers the provision which describes what a sales contract includes into section 11. </p><p>Section 12 is subject to a number of clarifying and technical amendments which will ensure accurate transposition of the sale of goods directive Article 3(3) and Article 10(3).  These amendments are not policy-driven.  Amendment No. 11 adds text to section 12(2)(a) to ensure the subsection clarifies that, in line with the requirements of the sale of goods directive, the digital content or digital services element of such contracts comes within the scope of Part 2.  Amendment No. 12 makes a technical change.  Amendment No. 13 is a minor technical amendment, necessary to clarify that the contracts referred to in section 12(2)(b) do not include contracts for the sale of goods with digital elements.  Amendment No. 14 is a typographical correction.  The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to delete section 12(2)(c), which obscures the fact that the contracts referred to are sales contracts, and to replace it with a new subsection (3), to make it clear that contracts for goods with digital elements are to be regarded as sales contracts, irrespective of whether the digital content or service is supplied by the trader or someone else and where the digital content or service is incorporated or interconnected in such a way that its absence would prevent the goods from functioning.</p><p>Amendment No. 16 substitutes the word &quot;single&quot; for &quot;sales&quot; to give correct effect to Article 10(3) of the sales directive.  Amendment No. 17 is related to these matters and inserts the word &quot;sales&quot; before the word &quot;contract&quot;.  Amendment No. 18 makes a further minor clarifying change.</p></speech>

Is that just a technical thing?  That is fine.  I just wanted to double-check.</p></speech>

Some of them delete a word and others add a word, while some clarify small typographical mistakes, including cross-references.  They are not policy driven; they are to tidy up the Bill as drafted.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 19 deletes unnecessary language.  Amendment No. 20 gives the consumer the right to all remedies arising from a lack of conformity with the contract, as opposed to only the first-tier remedies of short-term termination of the contract, repair or replacement.  Amendment No. 23 deletes language that is superfluous.  Amendment No. 24 makes a technical change.  Amendments No. 25 to 29, inclusive, correct incorrect cross-references.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 makes a minor technical change to delete an irrelevant subsection.  Amendment No. 35 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as do amendments Nos. 36 to 39, inclusive.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 40 makes a minor grammatical change.  Amendment No. 41 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 42 is another straightforward amendment, the purpose of which is to broaden the scope of section 34 to include instances where goods are not in conformity with the sales contract and where the trader otherwise fails to comply with the requirement of Part 2 of the Bill.  Amendments 43 to 45, inclusive, change the wording of paragraphs (d), (e) and (i) of section 39(1) so that the cross-references match the section titles to which they refer.  Amendment No. 46 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as does amendment No. 47.  Amendment No. 48 clarifies a change to the wording referring to the meaning of "alternative dispute resolution procedure".  Amendment No. 49 makes a slight change to the wording of section 41(1) to ensure that the precise transposition of Article 17(2) of the sale of goods directive, which states that the commercial guarantee statement shall be provided to the consumer on a durable medium, at least at the time of the delivery of the goods.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 50 makes a minor technical and clarifying change.  Amendment No. 52 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as does amendment No. 53.  Amendment No. 54 adds a new subsection (9) to underline that nothing in Part 3 will affect the right to terminate a contract under section 29(2), a new subsection proposed under amendment 31, and section 93(2), both of which cover mixed contracts.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 56 inserts a cross-reference to section 55 to ensure that Article 10 of the digital directive, to which section 57 gives effect, is fully transposed.  Amendment No. 57 gives consumers the right to all remedies arising from a lack of conformity with the contract, as opposed to only the first-tier remedies of short-term termination of the contract, repair or replacement.  Amendment No. 58 inserts a cross-reference to section 55 to ensure that Article 10 of the digital directive, to which section 57 gives full effect, is fully transposed.  Amendment No. 59 deletes superfluous language, as does amendment No. 66.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 67 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 68 deletes superfluous language.  Amendment No. 69 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 71 inserts clarifying language to section 69(3) in respect of the obligations of traders.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 72, 74 and 75 change the wording of sections 71(1)(c), 71(1)(h) and 71(1)(i) so the cross-references match the section titles to which they refer.  Amendment No. 73 would insert a cross-reference inadvertently omitted during the drafting process.  Amendment No. 76 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of "alternative dispute resolution procedure".  Amendment No. 77 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as do amendments Nos. 78 and 79.  Amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 82 make minor technical changes.</p><p> Amendment No. 83 inserts clarifying language in section 88(6) to ensure consumers are liable for any loss or damage suffered by the trader as a result of the failure of the consumer to comply with the obligation under all of subsection (3) or fails to return the goods or material under a type of agreement referred to in subsection (5).  Amendment No. 84 is a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 85 corrects the inadvertent omission of a reference to a reduction in the price as a remedy for consumers.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89 change the wording of sections 94(1)(b), 94(1)(c) and 94(1)(d) so the cross-references match the section title to which they refer.  Amendment No. 90 inserts a cross-reference inadvertently omitted during the drafting process.  Amendment No. 91 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of "alternative dispute resolution procedure".  Amendment No. 92 makes a minor technical change, as does amendment No. 93.  Amendments Nos. 94 and 97 are minor technical changes to ensure the application of Part 5 accurately transposes the consumer rights directive with regard to digital content.</p><p> Amendment No. 95 is another amendment that seeks to ensure the precise transposition of a directive provision.  Article 2 of the consumer rights directive defines a sales contract as any contract under which the trader transfers or undertakes to transfer the ownership of goods to the consumer and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay the price thereof, including any contract having as its object goods and services.  Amendment No. 96 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.</p><p> Amendment No. 98 would insert a new subsection (9) into section 97.  It is proposed the text for this section would be transferred from section 102 as the provisions fit more appropriately into the section setting out the application of Part 5.  Amendment No. 99 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 105 is a clarifying measure.  Amendment No. 106 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 109 ensures the full title of the Central Bank of Ireland is used consistently across the Bill.  Amendments No. 110, 111 and 112 make minor grammatical corrections.  Amendment No. 113 makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute "a trader" with "the person" to make the language consistent.  Amendment No. 114 makes a minor grammatical correction.</p><p> Amendment No. 115 makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute "a trader" with "the person" to make language consistent.  Amendment No. 116 makes a minor grammatical correction similar to amendment No. 115.  Amendment No. 117 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 118 again makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute "a trader" with "the person" to make the language consistent.  Amendment No. 119 makes another minor grammatical change.</p><p> Amendment No. 120 is a minor technical change to amendment No. 117 to provide for the summary proceedings under Part 4 to be taken by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Amendment No. 123 renumbers a subsection because of the addition of a new subsection with amendment No. 122.  Amendments Nos. 124, 125, 126, 127 and 128 all make minor grammatical corrections or correct an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendments Nos. 127 and 128 are the amendments in that group that correct an incorrect cross-reference.</p><p> Amendment No. 129 is a minor technical amendment to insert a right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 130 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 131 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 132 is a small technical amendment to insert the right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 133 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 134 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 135 is a small technical amendment to insert the right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 136 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 137 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.</p><p> Amendment No. 138 is a minor technical amendment that deletes the reference to a list of provisions and inserts reference to any section 73A to 73H in its place.  Amendment No. 139 deletes the list of provisions as mentioned in amendment No. 138.  Amendment No. 140 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of "alternative dispute resolution procedure".  Amendment No. 141 makes a minor technical correction, as do amendments Nos. 150, 151, 152, 153 and 154.</p><p> Amendment No. 155 makes a minor technical correction to delete in paragraph 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 5 the words "12 (determination of characteristics of subject matter of contract),".", whose inclusion is inappropriate and could be regarded as contrary to the unfair commercial terms directive.  Amendment No. 163 removes the reference to "certain" in regard to hire-purchase and consumer hire agreements from the Long Title.  The term is unnecessary and potentially misleading in that it suggests the amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 may not apply to some types of agreements when that is not the case.</p></speech>

The updated text ensures that the relevant subsections apply to goods with digital elements where the contract does not provide for the continuous supply of the digital content or digital services over a period.  It also ensures that in line with requirements relating to the supply of updates to subsections (4) and (2), amendment No. 21 also adds a new subsection (6), which would only apply to sales contracts for goods with digital elements where the contract provides for the continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 122 is to ensure section 73G(4) as inserted into the Consumer Credit Act 1995 by section 150 gives correct effect to Article 10 of the sale of goods directive.  Like amendment No. 21, the updated text ensures that relevant subsections apply to goods with digital elements where the contract does not provide for the continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period.  It also ensures, in line with the requirements relating to the supply of updates that the paragraph is subject to subsections (2) and (3).  The new subsection (5) is section 75G will also apply to hire-purchase agreements for letting of goods with digital elements where the contract provides for the continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period.</p></speech>

<blockquote> 	(a) the actual cost to the manufacturer of preparing and distributing the parts, tools or documents, exclusive of any research and development costs incurred,<br /><br />(b) the ability of owners and independent repair providers to afford the parts, tools or documents, and<br /><br />(c) the means by which the parts, tools or documents are distributed. </blockquote>(3) In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment.<br /><br />(4) Both an owner and an independent repair provider may maintain an action against a manufacturer who contravenes <i>subsections (1)</i>, <i>(2) </i>or <i>(3)</i>, and the court may order the manufacturer to take such action as may be necessary to observe the requirements of the subsection concerned, or to pay damages.<br /><br />(5) (a) Nothing in this section requires a manufacturer to disclose a trade secret, save as and to the extent necessary to provide documents, parts and tools on fair and reasonable terms. <blockquote> 	(b) Subject to <i>paragraph (c)</i>, nothing in this section alters the terms of any agreement between a manufacturer and an authorised repair provider.<br /><br />(c) A provision of an agreement referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i>, or any other agreement, is void insofar as it purports to waive, avoid, restrict or limit a manufacturer&rsquo;s obligations under this section. </blockquote>(6) In this section&mdash;<br /><br />&ldquo;authorised repair provider&rdquo;, in relation to a manufacturer, means a person who is not a connected person and who has an agreement with the manufacturer&mdash;

We are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence.  One need only visit a local civic amenity site on a Saturday morning to see piles of electronic waste or look at the number of mobile phones that we all have lying in drawers at home and that are beyond use.  The amendment is grounded in the idea that we protect the right to repair and ensure that we are part of the movement that fights back against the idea that global companies can build planned obsolescence into products.  By passing this amendment, we will fight back against the idea that we should be sold products by some of the world's largest companies knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years.  Having built in that obsolescence, we as consumers should have the right to repair the same products.  I am speaking specifically about smartphones and tablets, but we are also seeing it now in Kindles, coffee machines, large household appliances and the whole panoply of products that are sold to consumers.</p><p>The Minister of State will tell us that we should not be moving ahead of prospective EU legislation but, by accepting the amendment, there is an opportunity for him to be radical and for Ireland to become a leader in ensuring that we as consumers build in the right to repair the products sold to us as we see fit, that consumers are not penalised and that the same conglomerates do not go after entities that repurpose or refurbish iPhones or, to keep this generic, smartphones.</p><p>My amendment will not be accepted, so I am anticipating that I will be revisiting this matter on Report Stage.  In anticipation of the Minister of State's response, I will not be pressing the amendment, but I wish to keep it on the agenda.  We need to ensure that we fight back.  I am sick of the fact that if I purchase an iPhone, the software architecture of which allows the hardware to work with the Houses of the Oireachtas, email, WhatsApp and all of the other software that we need to survive in the modern world, that piece of kit will last less than five years or, if I am lucky, five years.  Processes and the software start slowing down after two years and the battery cannot be replaced.  There is no means by which someone can continue using the product for which he or she has shelled out considerable amounts of money.</p><p>People are sick of the fact that they are sitting on a mountain of this electronic detritus.  They are sick of the fact that phones are locked or bricked, to use that term.  They want to buy products that are recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer, and that is essentially what this amendment, as long winded and all as it is, is about.</p><p>I see no reason to say anything else.  I wish to hear what the Minister of State has to say on my amendment.</p></speech>

No one in this room or participating remotely is hostile to the notion of a right to repair.  It is a good thing.  Built-in obsolescence is creating a mountain of waste.  People often repair their goods, for example, shoes.  If you get a hole in your jacket, you do not say that that is it and the jacket needs to go.  The right to repair, particularly where technology is concerned, is important.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider this matter before Report Stage and devise a suggestion of his own.  I would be minded to support Deputy Sherlock's amendment were it pressed, although it will not be.  Including a provision on the right to repair in this legislation would be progressive.  There is no harm in us leading on such issues.  We do not need to wait for the EU to direct us to do the right thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022060100002#E00700"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  They are preaching to the converted.  My wife believes that I am the most frugal man to walk on shoe leathers.  The Deputies are pushing an open door with me where the right to repair is concerned.  I appreciate where they are coming from and I considered this amendment with an open mind when it was submitted.  I would make the point that the right to repair is part of one of the remedies to be enshrined in this legislation.</p> <p>  As Deputy Sherlock has pre-empted, this amendment is problematic.  That is because the sale of goods directive and the digital content directive are maximum harmonisation directives and, as such, I have no discretion in their implementation.  The purpose of maximum harmonisation directives is to ensure consistency across the whole of the EU and no member state can introduce new rights in their transposition that would put us out of step with other member states.</p> <p>  I wish to inform my colleagues of something, though.  They may already be aware of it but, if not, the European Commission's working party on consumer protection and information is considering a number of proposals to empower consumers to make sustainable consumption decisions.  Once such proposal has a particular emphasis of promoting repair and reuse and will consider harmonising certain aspects of consumer law, promoting repair as the primary remedy for consumers.  Another proposal under deliberation seeks to improve participation by consumers in the circular economy by providing better information on the durability and repairability of certain products.  This involves introducing several requirements, including providing consumers with information on the existence and length of a producer's commercial guarantee of durability for all types of good or on the absence of guarantees in the case of energy-using goods; providing information on the availability of free software updates for all goods with digital elements; and providing information on the repairability of products for all types of good.  This initiative also seeks to protect consumers against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases, such as early obsolescence.</p> <p>  I would welcome further protection given to consumers around the repairability of electronic equipment and access to maintenance of said equipment.</p><p>My officials are actively participating in these working party discussions.  However, as I said, because of the fact that it is a maximum harmonisation, I am advised that there is no discretion in the implementation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022060100002#F00200"><p>I sometimes feel &ndash; I would have been accused of this in the past as a Minister of State &ndash; that we are perhaps hiding behind EU rules.  However, I think there is an opportunity within the amendment not to fall foul of EU rules, because we are merely giving an additional right to the consumer to have that which they have purchased in good faith to be repaired.  The amendment describes a particular element.  It reads: "In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment."</p> <p>I do not see how that is injurious to the rights of the manufacturer in terms of fair competition rules from an EU point of view or maximum harmonisation rules.  Again, I know the Minister of State is frankly not of a mind to accept the amendment.  If I understand the Minister of State correctly, he is sympathetic to what the amendment seeks to do.  However, at a time when we are talking about the circular economy - there is legislation before us on that very issue - I think people are just absolutely fed up with the idea of built-in obsolescence.  I think we have crossed the Rubicon of people&rsquo;s patience around it.  This amendment, in its own small way, seeks to push back against this rampant consumerism.  The Minister of State said he will repair and fix shoe leather and I am of a similar mind.  There is a strong movement around people not necessarily wanting the best, new or shiniest, but wanting to repair, reuse and recycle.  Longevity is a key thing now in terms of products that we purchase.</p> <p>  I will withdraw the amendment.  However, I seek to submit it again or have it revisited on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I genuinely do.  I will go back and discuss it with officials again.  The clear advice I am being given is that we have no discretion in relation to the harmonisation.  However, I will go back and discuss it again to see because I fully appreciate where the Deputy is coming from and it is in the interest of enhancing the Bill that he has submitted the amendment.  I appreciate that he is withdrawing it.  He fully acknowledged he has the right to resubmit it on Report Stage and signalled that he will do so.  We will get the officials to review it again to see if there is any scope whatsoever to enhance it and achieve what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  However, the advice I have been given is that there is not at this stage.</p></speech>

(1) This section applies where goods are sold to a consumer under a contract that provides also for the supply of digital content, a digital service or a service.  	(2) Where the conditions in <i>subsection (3)</i>are met, the consumer shall have the right&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) to terminate the contract, or<br /><br />(b) to obtain a proportionate reduction in the price payable under the contract. </blockquote>(3) The conditions referred to in <i>subsection (2</i>) are the following: <blockquote> 	(a) if the contract were a contract for the sale of goods only, the consumer would have the right under <i>section 26</i>to obtain a proportionate reduction in the price or to terminate the contract;<br /><br />(b) the value of the digital content, digital service or service to the consumer would be materially reduced in the absence of the goods.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>These are straightforward amendments which will ensure that consumers will have the right to obtain a proportionate reduction in the price as well as the right to terminate the contract.  It also sets out the obligations of the consumer and trader in the event of a contract termination.</p><p>Amendment No. 31 replaces the current section 29(1) to clarify that the consumer has the right to obtain a proportionate reduction in the price as well as the right to terminate the contract.</p><p>Amendment No. 32 inserts, in line with the wording of the corresponding provision at section 93(4), &ldquo;objectively&rdquo; before &ldquo;determining&rdquo;.  This is important to make sure that the matter is not to be subjectively determined by the trader.</p><p>Amendment No. 33 is a consequential amendment to a cross-referencing that follows amendment No. 34.  The insertion of the text by amendment No. 34 is necessary to facilitate the inclusion of a provision in this section on the obligations of the parties in the event of the termination of a mixed contract.</p><p>I am proposing a small number of amendments to section 65, most of which are minor and technical in nature to ensure consistency of wording with corresponding provisions in other parts of the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 60 is to adjust the wording of section 65(2) to reflect that the consumer shall have the right to terminate the contract or to obtain a proportionate reduction in the price payable under the contract.  The content of the previous paragraphs, subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b), have been transferred to a new subsection (3).</p><p>Amendment No. 61 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 62 is a clarifying measure.  Amendment No. 63 is the most substantial change because it adds a new subsection (4) to include a provision on the obligations of the parties involved in the event of the termination of a mixed contract.  This will align this section with corresponding sections 21 and 29 in Part 2 of the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 64 makes a minor technical change.  This will give a more accurate account of the meaning of such a bundle in directive Directive (EU) 2018/1972 on establishing the European electronic communications code.  Amendment No. 65 makes a minor technical change.  This will give a more accurate account of the meaning of such a bundle in Directive (EU) 2018/1972 on establishing the European electronic code.</p><p>Amendment No. 86 is a technical change and inserts a provision in section 93 on the obligations of the parties in the event of the termination of a mixed contract.</p></speech>

Their purpose is to give full and accurate effect to Article 16 of the consumer rights directive, as amended by Article 4(12) of the better enforcement and modernisation directive.  These are small technical changes to clarify the section and do not reflect a policy change.  As some digital service contracts will involve the payment of a price by the consumer while others will not, Article 16(a) provides for different rules for the two forms of contract.  Sections 111(1)(a) to 111(1)(d) of the Bill deal with the application of Chapter 5 to service contracts.  The proposed amendments revise these subsections.  </p><p>Amendment No. 100 deletes the current section 111(1)(a) as it is unnecessary given that the provisions contained therein are already provided for in section 97(2)(b).  It replaces this with the text of the current section 111(1)(d).  This is because section 111(1)(d) gives effect to the first of the application provisions in Article 16 of the consumer rights directive.  It is therefore appropriate to transfer the text of section 111(1)(d) to section 111(1)(a).</p><p>Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 amend section 111(1)(b) to ensure that Chapter 5 does not apply to digital service contracts after the digital service has been fully supplied if the contract does not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital service.  This takes account of the fact that, for digital service contracts that do not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of a digital service, only the first part of Article 16(a) of the consumer rights directive applies.</p><p>Amendment No. 103 replaces the current sections 111(1)(c), 111(1)(e) and 111(1)(f).  The current text of section 111(1)(c) is deleted and replaced to provide that Chapter 5 does not apply to the digital service contract after the digital service has been fully supplied if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the service and supply of the digital service has begun with the consumer's prior expressed consent and acknowledgement that he or she will lose the right to cancel the contract once it has been fully performed by the trader.  This gives effect to both parts of Article 16(a) of the consumer rights directive.  A new section 111(1)(d) is to be inserted to provide that Chapter 5 does not apply to a contract for the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where the supply of the digital content has begun and the contract does not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital content.  This change gives proper effect to Article 16(m) of the consumer rights directive.  </p><p>For digital content contracts that place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital content, Article 16(m) applies in full.  The new section 111(1)(e) provides accordingly that Chapter 5 does not apply to a contract for the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where the performance of the digital content has begun if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay, the consumer has provided prior express consent to the performance of the digital content beginning during the cancellation period and acknowledges that he or she thereby loses the right to cancel the contract and the trader has provided confirmation of the contract in accordance with section 105 or, as the case may be, section 109.</p></speech>

It goes back to the theme of the previous amendment, which basically buttresses the rights of consumers, which is what the legislation is about.  We have seen in the past, however, the practice whereby customers of long standing find themselves at a price disadvantage relative to new customers where one seeks to attract new customers to a service, whether a digital service, an online service or whatever else that service may be.  From a consumer rights point of view, it is a matter of ensuring, as I said, that loyal customers are not penalised more for renewing a subscription than the price offered to new customers.</p></speech>

If the Deputy withdraws the amendment, however, I will see if we can do something on Report Stage.  When we looked at the insurance Bill, we found that it needed a market study because we do not want unintended consequences.  The practice of discounts is widely used by service providers as a way of attracting new customers.  It is an important competitive dynamic, which, among other things, has facilitated new entrants into the market, and we certainly do not want to risk that.  It took some market analysis to get to where we are with the insurance Bill to which I referred a minute ago.  We are unlikely to be able to do that type of policy deliberation and analysis before Report Stage.  I will certainly look at the matter again because I accept where the Deputy is coming from.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to work with the Department of Finance on the preparatory work it has done to get to where it is with its legislation on the insurance market and to see if we could borrow some of that work to help feed into this legislation.</p></speech>

Because paragraph (b) gives rise to criminal sanction, it is preferable to clarify what is meant by the word &quot;use&quot;.  Under the current formulation, criminal liability could potentially attach to traders who have issued contracts that simply contain a term that is subsequently deemed to be unfair, even though they may have no intention of relying on that term following determination of its unfairness.  The new formulation provides that a trader should not enter into a new customer contract subsequent to the declaration which contains an unfair term or, in the case of an existing contract, attempt to rely on a term which is already contained in consumer contracts concluded prior to the declaration and which has subsequently been the subject of a declaration.</p></speech>

</blockquote>&lsquo;subscriber&rsquo; means a consumer who receives a service from a trader pursuant to a contract where, on payment of a periodic fee, the contract with the trader under which the service is supplied is successively renewed or rolled over, whether the fee is calculated solely by reference to a period of time or by reference to the amount of service received during that period, or by a combination of both; and &lsquo;subscription&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly. </blockquote>(2) This Part applies to traders who supply a service to subscribers.<br /><br /><b>Requirement to establish complaints handling scheme</b><br /><br /><b>66D. </b>(1) The Commission may&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) by regulation require traders to which this Part applies to establish a scheme for handling subscriber complaints (in this Part referred to as a &lsquo;scheme&rsquo;) in relation to the trader&rsquo;s service or the supply of the service, and <br /><br />(b) prepare and publish guidelines applicable to traders concerning the establishment, form and operation of a scheme. </blockquote>(2) Before making regulations or publishing guidelines under this Part, the Commission may prepare draft regulations and draft guidelines and may consult with any person, as the Commission considers appropriate. <br /><br />(3) Regulations under this Part may, as respects to schemes, specify different requirements by reference to the class of trader concerned (being a class defined by reference to the commercial sector, the turnover of traders, the number of subscribers to the service or such other matters as the Commission considers appropriate). <br /><br /><b>Provisions of complaints handling scheme </b><br /><br /><b>66E. </b>Regulations under this Part may&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) require traders to attempt to resolve subscriber complaints and, as appropriate, to provide subscribers with a satisfactory explanation, an apology or some other form of redress, <br /><br />(b) require the provision of information to subscribers in relation to the scheme and how it may be availed of, including details of how to contact the trader and specifying minimum requirements in relation to a trader&rsquo;s response to contacts initiated by post, telephone and electronic communications,<br /><br />(c) require procedures under a scheme to comprise specified steps, and require one or more of the steps to be taken or completed within specified periods,<br /><br />(d) require traders to notify subscribers of the timescales for each step, and of the trader&rsquo;s commitments and standards in relation to response times, <br /><br />(e) require traders to include a procedure for escalating complaints to a more senior specified person where a subscriber is dissatisfied having completed the first step in the complaints process,<br /><br />(f) require traders to provide subscribers with details of how the Commission can assist in resolving complaints which the trader has not resolved to the subscriber&rsquo;s satisfaction and how the Commission can be contacted, and <br /><br />(g) prescribe such other requirements as the Commission considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of enabling complaints to be dealt with or resolved. </blockquote><b>Remedies and penalties</b><br /><br /><b>66F. </b>(1) A trader who is required by regulations under this Part to establish a scheme and who fails to do so is guilty of an offence.<br /><br />(2) A trader who establishes a scheme in accordance with regulations under this Part and who persistently fails to comply with the provisions of that scheme is guilty of an offence.<br /><br />(3) For the purposes of Part 5, &lsquo;prohibited act or practice&rsquo; includes: <blockquote> 	(a) the failure by a trader to establish a scheme where he or she is required by regulations under this Part to do so; and <br /><br />(b) the persistent failure by a trader who establishes a scheme in accordance with regulations under this Part to comply with the provisions of that scheme.&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>I would like to hear the Minister of State's response before I speak to the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022060100002#K03400"><p>I know where the Deputy is coming from but this amendment is a duplication and I do not think there is a need for it.  The proposed amendment relates to the handling of consumer complaints and seeks to insert four new sections into the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The proposed section 66C refers to complaints in the context of subscribers who receive a service from traders where that contract is successively renewed or rolled over.  This definition is relatively broad and, as I said previously, there is a complex landscape here that involves multiple sectoral regulators, most of which already require traders to operate complaints handling processes and provide access to alternative dispute resolution services.  In many instances, this requirement is linked to their licensing agreements.  For example, ComReg provides a complaint handling service called ComReg Connects for broadband, home phone and mobile phone consumer complaints.  Service providers are required to have a code of practice for handling consumer complaints.  Their code should contain all the information customers need to make a complaint, including information on refunds where appropriate.  Service providers have ten working days to resolve complaints, after which time customers can request ComReg&rsquo;s assistance.  Customer complaints that remain unresolved for more than 40 working days can be escalated to ComReg&rsquo;s dispute resolution procedure and ComReg can then adjudicate.  While I see where the Deputy is coming from, I feel there is a duplication in this amendment.  Rather than enhancing the Bill, it would put an onus on another body, the CCPC, where the responsibility for this already rests with sectoral regulators such as ComReg or the CRU.  I do not intend to accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022060100002#K03500"><p>The justification for the amendment is the lived experience of consumers who take out contracts, with broadband providers in particular.  Often, the consumer purchases a broadband product, such as fibre to the home or a copper line, that is advertised as providing 1 GB but it provides less than that and there are dropouts and blackouts in the service provision.  The consumer might pay &euro;80 for that.  I raised this on Second Stage.  I know there is a withholding arrangement built into the legislation in relation to moneys.  I fully accept that I may not be on the right track here so I have an open mind on this matter.  I am trying to ensure that, where the consumer goes through all the steps with the provider and where it is found that the trader did not adhere fully to the legislation, there is a stick built in whereby the provider will become guilty of an offence.  We have enough anecdotal evidence based on our own experiences as public representatives of services having failed people where there is a contract to supply.  I am open to correction on this but there do not appear to be sufficient penalties built in to ensure manners are put on the providers.  This amendment seeks to provide some remedy for the consumer, as well as some penalty for the provider.  Most people's experiences are positive and that is fully acknowledged.  Establishing a scheme that is unambiguous in its nature will provide a clear charter, for want of a better expression, to the consumer and the provider where there is an absolute understanding of the expectations on the provider or the trader.  That is where I am coming from.  ComReg is overloaded and is not resourced.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We know that so let us acknowledge that.  There are not enough personnel in ComReg and policing these issues has been a perennial problem.  People will be reluctant to withdraw a part of their payment for lack of a service if they do not feel there are enough protections built in.</p></speech>

This amendment is a duplication as it is asking the CCPC to do exactly what ComReg can do.  It will have new and enhanced enforcement powers similar to the CCPC as part of this Bill.  As the Deputy rightly alluded to, this Bill will for the first time give consumers the right to withhold payment for poor service.  However, there is quite clearly a dispute mechanism in place at the moment for broadband, home phone and mobile phone services and that rests with ComReg.  Consumers can make a complaint to the service provider and it has ten days to resolve the complaint.  Where that does not happen, they can refer the matter to ComReg and then there is a process by which it can intervene and escalate the problem.  Heretofore, ComReg did not have the same enforcement powers as the CCPC but it will after the enactment of this Bill.  Why would we give the CCPC a role in this while we are enhancing the powers of ComReg in order to do exactly what it can do?  Does the Deputy understand what I am saying?</p></speech>

This is to reflect the fact that section 5A(4) of the Central Bank Act 1942, as inserted by section 94 of the 2004 Act, provides that the functions of the CCPC under specified statutory provisions, which will include Parts 4 and 6 of this Bill, are functions of the Central Bank insofar as they relate to financial services provided by regulated financial service providers.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 144, 145 and 146 adjust the paragraphs because of the addition of the new paragraph (c) by amendment No. 143.  Amendment No. 147 is a technical amendment that inserts a new subsection into section 17 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The purpose of the amendment is to clarify what would not constitute a prohibited act or practice under the section.  Amendment No. 148 is a technical amendment that inserts a new subsection into section 75 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The purpose of the amendment is to clarify what would not constitute a prohibited act or practice under the section.  Amendment No. 149 is a technical amendment to section 79 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the purpose of which is to replicate section 142(2) of the Consumer Rights Bill on offences and penalties, and the criteria courts should consider when determining what sentence to impose on a person convicted of an offence under Parts 5 or 6 of this Bill.  The purpose of the amendments is to introduce a level of consistency and coherence across both the Consumer Rights Bill 2022 and the Consumer Protection Act 2007.</p></speech>

They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Today, we will engage with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Sebastian Barnes, chairperson, Dr. Adele Bergin, Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani, Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, who are council members, and Dr. Eddie Casey, chief economist and head of the secretariat  I invite Mr. Barnes to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#A00300"><p>The council thanks the committee for inviting us.  It is very nice to be back in person after two years.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas very highly.  These are important opportunities and an important part of our work.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  Our focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.</p> <p>  Yesterday, the council published its 22nd fiscal assessment report.  It is based on the Government&rsquo;s forecasts published in April in the stability programme update, SPU, 2022.  The Irish economy has continued to grow, despite the challenges.  Higher energy and food prices have taken inflation to the highest rate in a generation.  While this will slow growth in 2022, the economy is expected to continue to grow in the years ahead, helped by the high-pay and high-tax sectors.  Nevertheless, developments remain uneven across sectors and higher inflation impacts lower-income households far more than the average or wealthier households.  Risks and uncertainties are also high.  Inflation could remain higher for longer than the SPU assumes and there are downside risks to activity.  We also note with concern that the SPU only projects three years ahead to 2025.  This undermines a medium-term approach and good planning for budgetary policy.  The council strongly recommends a return to five-year-ahead forecasts as was committed to by the Department of Finance and confirmed by the Minister in the past.</p> <p>  The budget balance is being boosted by revenues from a faster-than-expected recovery from Covid-19 and continued growth in high-pay, high-tax sectors.  Over the medium term, the budget balance is set to reach a surplus in 2023 and to improve to a surplus of 2.7% of GNI* by 2025.  This should help to put Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio on a steady downward path to reach 80% of GNI* by 2025, down from 106% of national income in 2021.  However, there are significant pressures on many spending areas.  Some of these are known, others have not been factored into the budgetary plans.  In terms of spending, we broadly know that, first, higher inflation creates significant spending pressures.  The council estimates that each one percentage point increase in inflation in the economy would create pressures on Government spending of approximately &euro;700 million just to stand still if pay, welfare, pensions and the costs of goods and services were fully adjusted to maintain their value in relative terms as prices increase.  We assess that the planned increases in current spending under the Government&rsquo;s 5% spending rule over 2023 to 2025 would not be sufficient if the Government opted to fully maintain existing supports and services in real terms, although for later years the shortfall is relatively small.</p><p>This implies that the Government will need to make choices between accommodating price pressures, other changes to spending plans and revenue-raising measures.  Second, there are likely to be temporary costs associated with the war in Ukraine.  Of the &euro;7 billion in contingencies for spending set out in budget 2022 back in October, &euro;2.5 billion remains unallocated.  This may be spent on humanitarian assistance for Ukrainian refugees but it could also be used for further temporary and targeted cost-of-living measures.  Third, the Government plans to ramp up public investment spending to almost 5% of national income by 2025 and keep it at this high level out to the end of the decade.  The increases should help to meet climate change and housing objectives but capacity constraints in the construction sector could see higher costs or lower output for a given price.  Poorer value for money and possible spending overruns could result and a high degree of diligence will be required.  Fourth, many countries are considering raising defence spending in the light of the war in Ukraine.  For Ireland, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces establishes a range of different scenarios. </p><p> However, there are many areas where we are in the dark on the Government&rsquo;s plans.  The Government committed to halving Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 but it has not factored in the full costs to the State of achieving this.  Estimates from Mr. John FitzGerald in 2021, in a very useful piece of analysis, put the cost at an additional 1.7% to 2.3% of GNI* on average over the years 2026 to 2030.  The Government has also not costed its planned major healthcare reforms under Sl&aacute;intecare beyond this year and there is no clarity on how much progress has been made to date in terms of the overall cost of the reforms.  The Government has also not responded to the Pensions Commission recommendations on how to address funding shortfalls in the pension system.  Annual spending on pensions is set to rise by about 1.5% to 2% of GNI* by 2030 amid a rapidly ageing population.  The upfront fiscal costs of auto enrolment also need to be built into future budgets, if implemented. </p><p> The Government faces a delicate balancing act between supporting the economy and vulnerable households in the face of higher inflation while not contributing to higher inflation through second-round effects.  Sticking to the 5% spending rule, as the Government commits to and as the council welcomes, should help with that objective and with facilitating the debt ratio falling at a steady pace from high levels.  Reducing the debt ratio in line with these plans would be appropriate to help build a buffer so that future shocks, particularly major downturns, could be cushioned by budgetary supports in a similar way to the response during the pandemic.  Following the rule would also help to ensure that spending increases do not lead to excessive stimulus to the economy at the current time and would help avoid the risk of second-round effects on wages and prices potentially destabilising the economy and the public finances.  However, sticking to the rule also highlights the difficult trade-offs that are involved.  The various spending pressures that we have discussed raise significant questions about how they will be accommodated within the Government's spending rule alongside existing policies.  Sticking to the rule could imply reductions in planned spending elsewhere or higher taxes. </p><p> In the background to all this, an ongoing concern of the council&rsquo;s is the growing over-reliance on corporation tax to fund everyday public services.  Corporation tax receipts represent nearly one in every four euro of tax revenue raised by the Exchequer and the top-ten paying companies account for more than half of those receipts, up from a quarter in 2008.  The Government does not currently have a strategy to reduce this over-reliance.  The council&rsquo;s assessment is that the Government should clearly show the impact of excess corporation tax receipts on the budget balance, as we do in this report and it should take measures to reduce its reliance on corporation tax.  The council has set out a way to achieve this by making contributions to the rainy day fund or running debt down.  The Exchequer has benefited significantly from corporation tax receipts in recent years which could be considered excess, that is, beyond what is explained by the performance of the domestic economy.  By using these excess receipts to fund ongoing expenditure, the Government has potentially opted not to set aside some &euro;22 billion in a rainy day fund or to reduce net debt by a substantial amount. </p><p> I thank members for their attention and look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

There is always a wealth of information contained in the council's high-quality reports.</p> <p>  In the context of the unequal impact of heightened inflation, the council outlines in its report that there is potentially space for additional, targeted one-off measures to support those who are most vulnerable to the current inflation shock.  We are looking at a rate of 8.2% but for low and middle income earners, the rate can be higher.  Does the council agree that there is scope for targeted additional measures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#B00400"><p>Yes, there is scope for additional targeted measures in two senses.  First, in terms of the budgetary numbers and temporary measures, there is still space because there are still contingencies that are likely to be available this year, even within the existing budget.  Second, looking ahead, or taking this year and next year together, within the Government's spending rule there would be space to do that.  However, as we have highlighted, there are choices between how far we take measures to deal with the cost-of-living crisis as compared to other policy initiatives the Government might want to take.  The reality is that we are having to pay more for imports of energy and food and if we need to provide more help to some households, that is going to cost extra money.  That needs to be weighed against other potential alternatives.</p> <p>  The other way in which there is space, potentially, is that there is some room to do that without over-stimulating the economy.  What is good about targeted measures is that rather than just pumping money in across the board, they give it to those who really need it the most.  Lower income households spend around one third of their income on food and energy so this is a huge shock for people who do not have many savings to fall back on.  For wealthier households, it is a much lower share of their spending and of course, they are in a better starting position as well.  </p></speech>

Just before coming in here today we heard an announcement from PrepayPower that electricity prices would increase by 10% and gas by 20% on top of what has already happened.  There is a breaking point here and some have already passed it.</p> <p>  The council has been critical of the Government's lack of a targeted approach in its interventions to date.  The report refers to about &euro;1 billion worth of interventions since the start of the year up to the publication of the Stability Programme Update, SPU, about 90% of which were untargeted.  According to the council, this means that substantial public resources are being transferred to individuals who already have high incomes and who are, therefore, just likely to increase their savings.  What is the impact of this level of untargeted measures on inflation itself?</p></speech>

The Government can improve that trade off by directing more money towards those who need it most rather than spreading it out more equally.  There is a case for stronger targeting but it is obviously difficult.  Targeting is not an easy thing to do.  We know that poorer houses need to be targeted, as do rural households and older households but even within those groups, not everyone is treated the same.  There is a difficult mix and that is why we do not come down particularly strongly in any particular way, partly because it is not our mandate to look at the exact design of specific measures but also because we recognise it is a difficult thing for the Government to do.  It must make a number of judgments and trade-offs which is its job, rightly, and not our role.</p> <p>  It may be helpful to consider using either the welfare system or the tax system in more creative ways than they have been used in the past to make sure the money is going to those who need it most because that will strike the best balance.  The impact of this shock is radically different across households.  </p></speech>

To date, since the start of the year we have not seen an increase in core social welfare working-age payments.  In order to be in line with the average inflation rate that we are likely to see over the course of the year, predicted to be 6.2%, those rates would need to increase by &euro;7.50.  Would that be the type of targeted measure that would not risk second-round effects on inflation?  Is that the type of approach that the council is suggesting?</p> <p>  On the quantum of interventions, if they were targeted, what level of space is available?</p><p>Mr. Barnes spoke about the unallocated resources of &euro;2.5 billion, and that a portion of it may be used for Ukrainian refugees.  The assessment by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, is that not all of this will be needed.  The council also recognises an improvement in balances.  This is probably an improvement even from where the stability programme update, SPU, suggests our deficit would be at the end of the year.  In Mr. Barnes's view, what quantum of fiscal space is available at this point in time?</p></speech>

I will, however, make a couple of points in response.</p> <p>  A difficult judgment is being faced between temporary and permanent measures.  We do not know how long these price shocks will last.  We are aware that energy prices and food prices can be very volatile.  They may well go up and make the next winter very difficult in Europe.  On the other hand, they could also go down if things work out better than expected.  The Government must think about the balance between temporary measures where we make these once-off payments or time-limited payments, which is mostly what the Government has done, versus these permanent increases in welfare payments that would, essentially, be required to keep their real value over time but would need to reflect the fact that prices may fall.  This is the temporary versus permanent split the Government must think about.</p> <p>  The second point is the exact amounts.  It is a very difficult question.  Again, it depends on which instruments the Government wants to use, what combination it wants to use, and to what extent it wants to target.  The important part about targeting is that even just raising welfare rates in line with general inflation probably would not fully compensate the lower income groups who are spending a much higher share of their income and facing a much faster rate of increase than the general population.  That is an important point to bear in mind.  Ultimately, I believe the Government needs to co-ordinate across policies.  IFAC has also suggested co-ordination with the social partners on how the whole package will look.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the amount of fiscal space.  We believe that the Government's spending rule is actually providing useful guidance.  It is forcing the point that there is a choice between how much is ultimately spent on the permanent increases in welfare payments and other things.  We are not taking any view on how that choice should be made.  That is a democratic choice but it is forcing the right kinds of questions to be asked.</p> <p>  One very helpful aspect is that the Government seems to be interpreting the rule in terms of the level of spending.  In 2021 there was a big underspend.  If the Government was to lock in that underspend it would create more space to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.  That is one of the very live questions the Government faces.  It probably would not make a lot of sense to try to catch up on that underspend very quickly and then realise there is not enough money to deal with the cost of living.  This is one of the things that gives the Government a bit of marginal manoeuvre. </p></speech>

Is that the type of approach we should be looking at here?</p></speech>

Perhaps this could be thought about more broadly.  On the amounts, these are very difficult political decisions to be taken.  The council does not have a view on that.</p></speech>

In its report, the council does guide us along the way with some of the boxes, including boxes E-1 and E-2 and the impact of inflation on Government revenue.  Will Mr. Barnes talk us through, in simple terms, what this means.  For example, are the figures in table E-2 the total amount of additional revenue the State is bringing in as a result of the increased inflation that is taking place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.845" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#C00600"><p>People often forget that there is a sort of upside to revenue that comes from higher inflation as well.  Obviously, there is a downside from lower activity but there is an upside from higher inflation.  This is one of the things that compensates it.  Some of those effects would wash out naturally, which means it would increase in line with the economy.  In a sense, therefore, there is not a huge gain there.  A big issue would be the indexation of the income tax system.  We have discussed this before.  The income tax system bands are set in cash terms.  If one keeps the bands fixed and there is inflation, or wage inflation, then more income is going to move into the higher bands and will be taxed more heavily.  Those effects are going to be bigger if wage inflation is higher.  There is a potential upside of something that would raise the average tax rate if those nominal bands were kept in the same place.  The programme for Government commits to indexation in some form.  The Government has factored into its plans a degree of partial indexation, but if one kept that currently planned degree of partial indexation it would not be enough to compensate for the wage inflation that is now expected.  As a consequence of that, one would now expect the average tax rate to increase if those amounts that are currently planned are kept there.  That would tend to improve the public finances as a whole and improve the budget balance, but the Government spending rule does not take revenue into account so it would not have any counterpart on the other side.  This is something we discussed in another box in the report.  I believe there is scope for widening the design of that rule, which would actually improve its performance in situations like this.</p></speech>

For example, table E-2 refers to this year's income tax of &euro;1.4 billion, social contributions of &euro;613 million and VAT of &euro;202 million.</p></speech>

This is really the amount the tax revenue has gone up since the budget.  On the outlook for tax revenue, the outturns have been very strong in the recovery.  This reflects a number of factors.  Higher inflation is one of the things that could contribute to that.  As we said in a separate paper that came out in the week previous to this fiscal report, we have been surprised - as many people have - by the strength of income tax revenue.  We believe quite a bit of this is related to the strength of the high pay-high tax sectors in the economy.  There are reasons to believe that this may continue if those sectors continue to do well, but this is also a relatively recent phenomenon so it needs to be treated with some caution as well.</p></speech>

There is a mixture of factors on these forecasts.  Some of it is to do with higher inflation but there is a combination of real and nominal factors.  There is an inflation effect in there but there is a bit of a real impact there as well.</p></speech>

In the report the council refers to the measures the Government has introduced since the start of the year which is the &euro;1.1 billion, and then we had the VAT extension, which is about &euro;200 million.  The council makes the point that this is less than the bump in tax revenues the State is generating as a result of increased inflation. Is this correct?</p></speech>

Wages have not responded that much to inflation yet so we are not getting that much of that effect coming through in what we have seen already.  There are a number of other factors pushing it up.  A combination of factors push revenue higher.  At the same time, the Government has used more of the contingency than would otherwise have been the case.</p></speech>

My final question relates to the commentary in the report and the analysis on the cost of accommodating Ukrainian refugees.  To be fair to the council, there are two things the council has pointed out.  The council questions the level of refugee numbers that will come into the State, which had been estimated at an upper level of 100,000 or 80,000 this year.  The council also questions the cost of that.  Am I right in saying that the cost this year is estimated to be &euro;37,000 per person and next year will be some &euro;30,000 per person, and that this is well out of kilter with European averages?</p><p>Has IFAC been able to figure out why the cost estimates from the Department are so high?  Of the &euro;2.5 billion outlined in the stability programme update, SPU, for accommodating Ukrainian refugees this year, what would in the council's view be a more realistic range, bearing in mind that none of us know how this is going to pan out?  What would help to steer us through this period?</p></speech>

Things have evolved in recent months and can evolve the other way as well.  It is difficult to predict.  The cost is also difficult to estimate because it depends on the needs of the people involved.  We know accommodation is very scarce.  It is difficult to know what the solution is.  Perhaps Mr. Casey or Ms Holland have additional comments.</p></speech>

We can see how much they are drawing in regular welfare supports, child benefit and other assistance payments.  We can then guess how much accommodation costs per household.  The &euro;3 billion looks to be high but also seems to be an appropriate upper bound on what the cost might be.  It would take into consideration that these people might be put into hotels for a long time to come.  The reality is there is a risk that could happen.  It could be very expensive.  If the accommodation costs change because those people are moved to longer term housing solutions, the cost should come down.  Accommodation cost is a considerable driver of expense.  We are beginning to understand why the costs were put at a high level by international standards.  It is reflective of the environment here where there is already pressure on housing, which may push costs higher.</p> <p>  As to what a more reasonable estimate might be, it is too soon to say because the numbers are still rising.  Interestingly, the CSO data showed the number of claimants rose to approximately 30,000 and then started to come down again in recent weeks.  There might be some initial signs that-----</p></speech>

That was an interesting finding.  It might be that some of those refugees are integrating into working practices and things like that and might not be claiming as much as we thought.  It is difficult to see where this will end up because the cost is high compared with other countries and the number of refugees Ireland is expected to receive also seems high, given many of those refugees are settling in communities much closer to Ukraine.  There is some reason to suggest the estimate could be a high-ball estimate.</p></speech>

The impact of the inflation crisis has been uneven.  Would our guests go even further and say there are winners and losers in this situation?  It is not just that the impact is uneven.  Would it be fair comment that some people are being hammered while others are doing very well?  I would be interested to hear our guests' views on that question.  I note that corporate profits and net household wealth are up.  Somebody is doing well out of all of this and it is certainly not the majority of low- and middle-income households, who are being hit disproportionately hard, as our guests have alluded to.  Even the headline inflation rate does not take into account the hit that low- and middle-income families are taking.</p> <p>  I know IFAC does not get into policy suggestions but one possible approach to dealing with this situation is to insulate people's incomes against the impact of inflation and to do that, if I understood what our guests have said, would cost &euro;700 million.  Was that the relevant figure?  The problem is that &euro;700 million would take us over the 5% rule.  I am generally in favour of insulating people's incomes, wages and so on from the impact of inflation.  One approach could be to take money back from those who have benefited from this situation to insulate the losers fully and ensure there are no winners.  The Government's mantra is it cannot fully insulate people against the impacts of inflation.  That is the Government's view.  I do not think that is a statement of fact but is rather a statement of policy.  The Government has decided it is not going to insulate people fully from the impact of inflation because the cost would be too high and perhaps it would take us over the 5% rule.  The Government could do it if it wanted to.  That is a consideration.</p> <p>  Another consideration that is never debated is we should ensure there are no winners.  I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position but is it something we might consider as an option?  In the current circumstances, no excess profits should be made because that is not fair when the income of other people is being hit.  That would be a legitimate policy consideration.  Perhaps we might even cap profits.  We always talk about capping wages and a need to limit wage increases, social welfare increases and pension increases because the skies might fall on us if we let them rip.  The possibility we might cap profits, wealth and very high salaries is never considered.  As I said, I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position because I know IFAC does not advocate particular policy measures but is that a legitimate thing to consider in the range of options that is open to the Government?  Is it possible for us to consider insulating all the people who are losing as a result of inflation through direct expenditure, income rises or whatever it might be and to ensure there are no winners and nobody is benefiting from this situation?</p></speech>

IFAC does not take a view on distribution or those kinds of questions.  From the point of view of public finances, what is happening to different groups in society is very important because the State, through its policy, is committed to helping some people in society, the less well-off, but does not provide welfare to everyone.  That is the basic system.  It means that when a shock hits the less well-off, it will cost the Government more and that will have an impact on the public finances.  That is where it becomes something about which IFAC would think.</p> <p>  The prices of energy and food, which are largely imported goods, are high.  An economics textbook would state that is a situation that does not create winners and losers.  We are all losers in some ways because we are having to pay more to foreigners.  They gain but we do not gain anything from that situation.  There are probably exceptions but the general rule with regard to oil and energy price increases is that everyone is worse off.  However, we are not all worse off to the same degree.  It matters a lot more to people who have low savings and are struggling than it does to those with higher incomes.  That is why support needs to be targeted at those on lower incomes.  That shock alone is one that only creates losers.  However, there is a question about how one manages-----</p></speech>

However, it can aim to support some groups.  For example, if we were to compensate for the impact of this year's unexpected inflation on public sector pay, welfare rates and pensions, it would cost approximately &euro;2 billion - the &euro;700 million was for one percentage point of inflation, but we have seen a great deal more unexpected inflation than that - to compensate that group fully and no one else would get anything.  We can compensate the more vulnerable groups at a cost that is sustainable to society, particularly if we do not provide untargeted help to those who do not need it.</p><p> There is another point that is important to understand, and it is somewhat specific to Ireland.  We are suffering from higher energy and food prices like everyone else, but we are also benefiting - or, rather, some people are - from a favourable shock to digital and pharmaceutical activities and financial services.  Something we explored in the analytical note that was published last week by our economist, Mr. Kevin Timoney, is that wages in those sectors have been growing at a fast clip for a number of years and employment therein has increased a great deal.  People within Ireland who happen to work in those sectors or benefit from their spillovers are doing relatively well.  That is good for tax revenue, but another group is being hit by the food and energy price shock.  This is where choices have to be made - they are inherently political choices - between how these different pieces are put together to achieve the outcome people want.</p></speech>

They have to be economically and fiscally sustainable.  They are not choices about which the council can advise the political system.  We can just lay out what we believe they are.  The system can choose to go about this in different ways, but it is for the democratic system to decide how the balances are struck.  They are difficult balances to achieve, especially given higher import prices mean there is a loss to the country as a whole.  We have to decide who is going to bear that loss.  It is a difficult choice.</p></speech>

I suspect the answer is it has probably made some difference, but not enough because we have not gone that far down the transition path.  In some markets, the price is set at the marginal production price, which is often gas, and not on the cost of production of other sorts.  That is how markets work.  In a situation like this, it is the price of the marginal gas production that is setting the price of electricity across the whole market, not the price of production of some of the elements that are produced inframarginally, that is, produced at a lower cost.  This is an issue in many energy markets.  It is a major issue in France, where most electricity production is nuclear, which is relatively cheap, but prices have still increased because the marginal electricity producer is a gas producer.</p></speech>

The mantra is we will solve the current problem.  Actually, the Taoiseach is saying we are entering an era of high energy prices and that the inflation we are seeing currently will be around for quite a while.  Simultaneously, people are saying that, if we wean ourselves off fossil fuels and dramatically expand domestic renewable energy production, we can deal with that problem in the medium term.</p></speech>

In the short run, we have the energy system we have and we are facing the consequences of that.  In the long run, the move towards electricity and renewables will be a major change, not just in the way we produce energy but in the way the whole economy works.  We will not be importing anywhere near as much energy as we were beforehand because it will be produced domestically.  This will make the economy more resilient because we will be more dependent on domestic supply.  Unfortunately, that is a long way off.</p></speech>

It is a long way off.  From reading the submission, the council is concerned we have not factored in the transition to a green economy.  By not doing that, are we moving further away from making our dream of becoming energy self-sufficient and secure a reality?  I am seeking Mr. Barnes's opinion.  If I were Minister for Finance, should I be directing money towards the transition to secure the future?  Perhaps he will comment on this first question, after which I will discuss a few other points.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues the Climate Change Advisory Council and others have raised concerning the extent to which the Government has policies that would support reaching those objectives.  A report published today suggested there were still some gaps in the policies required to meet the objectives.</p> <p>  Another challenge, and the one we would focus on the most as the fiscal council, is that there is no assessment of the economic and budgetary costs of that change.  Much of the investment in the national development plan would go a long way towards meeting the Government&rsquo;s objectives, so that is probably okay, but we have more concerns about ongoing current spending needs in climate change.  The Government is also facing a potentially large loss of revenue.  It raises a great deal of money from taxes on petrol and diesel.  As people move towards electric cars, it will lose that money because electricity is taxed much more lightly.</p></speech>

It is a significant concern.</p> <p>  The council is a member of a European network of fiscal institutions and we have undertaken a survey to determine what the state-of-the-art is in Europe.  One or two countries are strong in this area.  For example, the UK and the Netherlands have performed proper assessments.  Most other countries are in the same boat as us, with their governments falling behind in terms of starting to figure out the implications.  It should be a major priority for the Government to understand the full economic and budgetary impacts of this major re-engineering of our whole society.  We need to figure out what the impact will be on the public finances.</p><p>If it is going to cost a lot of money, we must start thinking about how it is going to be funded and how the public finances are going to be maintained in a situation where we will be facing significant costs relating to climate change.</p></speech>

I meant to say at the start that I was watching these proceedings in my room but that the Internet connection was a bit flaky.  It was going in and out.  I decided to come down and join the party here.  Not the political party.</p> <p>  When we talk about changes in this context, I was in an electric car last night.  The tax on it is &euro;90.  I guess the tax on that type of car will go up as the cars powered by diesel and petrol leave the roads.  Another area where there is a conflict of interest concerns the context of hyperinflation and the necessity of supporting people on fixed incomes.  We will have to support people who have disabilities.  Additionally, we will have to increase support for those people and not just keep it in line with inflation.  I say that because we can already see from the reports done that people with disabilities have additional costs to bear just to live.  I refer to how we can address this aspect and how we can keep those supports in line with inflation.  Equally, we also have people who are working and contributing to society.  I refer to the cost of travelling to work for the many people with no access to public transport.  Public transport is probably now being subsidised more and that is benefiting some people because of a reduction in rates, while other people who have no access to public transport must use their own vehicles to go to work and are facing greater costs as a result.</p> <p>  We can see a differential emerging before our eyes.  How do we balance this situation?  Let us take people who have mortgages as well and consider the rise expected in interest rates and the resultant increase in the costs of mortgages for working people.  How can we best address this type of situation?  Is it through additional tax reliefs to help people to pay their mortgages?  We are trying to do everything for everybody.  Where does Mr. Barnes perceive the challenges will be in this regard?  What impact will this situation have on the budget for this year and for those in the following four to five years?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about the cost of supporting vulnerable households.  He has given a good sense of the many challenges existing in society.  The cost of supporting the most vulnerable groups and households, including those with the lowest incomes and those with various challenges in their lives is going to increase and this is what the Government needs to manage.  So far, it has mostly focused on temporary measures that may be warranted because the increase in this regard that has brought about higher energy prices has been relatively recent.  Eventually, over time, it would be natural for welfare rates to increase and for supports to be adjusted in the way referred to.</p> <p>  An important point, is that the Government cannot help everyone in this situation.  That would not be a sustainable approach and it would not make sense.  The Government, as we have said, is facing this balancing act between protecting the economy and protecting those groups that are vulnerable and not putting a great deal more money into the economy when inflation is already high and demand is strong.  The best way of doing this is by targeting such protections at those who are the most vulnerable.  A big challenge politically is that a wide section of the population is under some pressure because of these energy and food prices.  It can be hard to target protections in this kind of environment, because some people will not benefit much or at all from Government measures if they are targeted.  It is a challenge for the Government to communicate information on this scenario and then to calibrate its response.</p></speech>

When we had increases in public sector pay back in the champagne days, those were blamed for causing significant inflation and for a recession.  There is an expectation that public sector pay will have to rise to take care of and try to compensate people for the hyperinflation we have now.  Does Mr. Barnes see public sector pay as a topic that might be fraught with danger regarding how we approach it?  Are we potentially going to add more money to the fire of inflation?  What is Mr. Barnes' opinion in this regard?</p></speech>

Public sector pay rates were set with a view that inflation was going to be much lower than it turned out to be.  It would be natural that there would be some reflection of this.  It is, however, also an area in respect of which the Government will have to strike a balance.  Some people in the public sector are highly paid, while others are on much lower incomes.  This is also an area where some discussion with the private sector would be helpful, as would thinking about how this matter intersects with welfare rates and other things.  If we are trying to decide how we are going to manage this as a country, then we will need to think about how all these pieces will fit together.</p></speech>

How can we address our reliance on corporate tax revenue in the context of running the country?  I ask this because the current situation is not sustainable.</p></speech>

They have increased greatly and rapidly in recent years and come mostly from a small number of multinational companies.  If we were to unwind our dependence on this source of revenue, at least partially, as we suggest in this report, that would mean finding the money elsewhere.  There are various margins of adjustment in respect of where we could do that, as the Deputy suggested.  Growth may be one of them, but that is a difficult thing for the Government to control.  Other areas would include raising other forms of taxes or exploring the composition of spending in other respects.  Finding alternative sources of revenue will be important.  One issue to consider is that we are benefiting as well from strong income tax receipts from workers who are highly paid and highly taxed.  Many of them are also working in the same corporate sectors in this context and that means our vulnerability is higher than would be suggested just by looking at the corporation tax levels.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Barnes and all the witnesses for being here because this is an important engagement.  I thought it was ironic this morning, at a time when inflation stood at 8.2% in May and there is all this energy insecurity and fuel uncertainty in respect of cost and availability, that the news headlines focused on how we are going to achieve our climate action targets for 2030.  I refer to us being beaten into submission in the context where, whatever else might happen, it is necessary to achieve those targets at whatever cost that may entail.  People were being interviewed and giving their viewpoints on this subject in respect of the full enormity of what this endeavour is going to cost not yet having been realised.  I was thinking of someone having porridge, perhaps choking on hearing those comments this morning, and wondering if these headlines were really coming at this time.</p> <p>  I preface all I am saying by stating that I have as much, and maybe more, of a concern about the environment as anybody else.  I am not a climate change denier, but I am a realist.  I live in the real world of representing people, many of whom live in rural locations and must travel to work at enormous cost.  Their children must also be transported to schools.  These people are living in rural locations as they are perfectly entitled to do.  As I have always said, whether people are living in Blackrock, Ballinskelligs, Templenoe or here in any part of the centre of Dublin city, they are entitled to live where they and their families wish to be.</p><p> How sensible is it to be in the D&aacute;il one day imposing taxes upon taxes in the name of trying to reduce our carbon emissions while at the same time telling people they have to suck it up?  The Government is also saying we must introduce measures to take the bite out of this harsh financial reality and so far all it has come up with is a reduction in the price of fuel, which actually went up on the two nights previous to the deduction.  It went up more on the Sunday and Monday than it came down on the Tuesday.  There was also the famous &euro;200 in respect of electricity.  I can tell the Government that is well forgotten now because the prices people are paying on their fuel and energy bills are astronomical.  There are also issues around energy insecurity because the Government did not have the gumption to go ahead with an liquefied natural gas facility in the Shannon Estuary.  Any of the decisions it has taken so far have resulted in us being overly reliant on importing our energy from England and France.  That is going to lead us to-----</p></speech>

Is this a dream or is the reality really a nightmare?  We will not be able to do it.  If we try to continue, we are going to break people completely and put them in a position where they quite simply will not be able to afford to pay their bills, run their households, educate their children or do the basic day-to-day living they need to do.  That is a real worry.  The Taoiseach said yesterday we were in unprecedented times.  Due to the cut-off from Russian oil, we are going to have 90% less oil coming into the European Union than we would have had before.  The reality of that has not been thought through at all yet.  Where is it going to leave us?  Where is it going to leave the people we represent?  They would have choked on their porridge this morning on hearing that even if we implement everything it looks like we are not going to hit our targets, so we are now going to have to squeeze the noose a bit more and increase carbon taxes more and more.  Surely this is a time when we should be saying that we have to live for now and trying to make it possible, plausible and feasible for people to live now, rather than being so obsessive about putting more carbon taxes on people.</p></speech>

The core of the issue is that the climate transition is, even without the war in Ukraine, a very complicated and challenging undertaking.  As we have emphasised, it requires a huge re-engineering of our society in many ways.  It is not just about changing the energy mix.  It is a very deep change to the way the economy functions and the way society functions.  On top of that, there is the war in Ukraine.  In some ways, the war has had some of the same effects that meeting emissions targets would have had, in terms of having to change and move away from fossil fuels and things, but it is happening far more quickly and in a far more unstructured way than we had planned.  It underlines the fact that we ultimately need to take a steady approach towards tackling climate change but in the short run there may be some more urgent imperatives, which means some slightly different actions will have to be taken than would otherwise have been the case.</p> <p>  What the Deputy said also highlights some of the issues we will face with climate transition.  One issue is higher energy prices, which are today caused by Ukraine but may ultimately be caused by the phasing out of fossil fuels.  How we manage the social aspects of that is important.  Relatively wealthy households are probably in a better position to manage that transition than lower-income households, partly because they spend less of their money on food and energy but also because they have more savings.  They are in a much better position to deal with most problems.  We did not mention this in our earlier answer but the Government needs to start thinking about what the social implications of the climate transition will be in the long term and how it is going to manage that.  That is one of the big fiscal costs.  For example, the evaluation that was done in the Netherlands of the economic impact of their climate change package put a lot of emphasis on the fact the Government was going to have to compensate some groups in society or provide more help for them to transition.  For someone who is relatively wealthy, it may be not so difficult to manage investing in a heat pump and insulation but for someone on a much lower income, undertaking that kind of investment, which will pay back over quite a long period, is going to be much more challenging financially.  The Government has to think about the social implications of that.  Good planning, both on the climate side and with regard to the economic and social implications, will help make the transition as smooth and fair as it can be.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  Although I have meetings with them online, as someone who was elected just before Covid, I think this is my first time seeing them in person.  It is nice to meet them in person.  I have a few questions prepared but I am also interested in some things that arose during the discussion.  I am sure the witnesses are more aware of this than I am but I have noticed a particular issue in the media.  There is one thing that is thrown out there but you almost cannot discuss it.  Deputy Canney referred to wage increases and the impact they will have.  I have noticed that in a lot of commentary, both within the D&aacute;il and in the media, as soon as any kind of increase in wages is mentioned, people say wage prices will spiral and increase inflation.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on the concept of the wage-price spiral.  Where do we need to be at in order for that to happen?  The factors causing inflation are energy prices and supply chain issues.  A few weeks or months back, there was a graph in the <i>Financial Times</i>which showed that since 2020, wages in the eurozone did not really increase so that has not been the cause of inflation.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  Sometimes we have a very closed conversation nationally on certain topics.  People are struggling.  I have my own views on the matter but I would be interested in what the witnesses have to say.</p></speech>

Many things have changed in between.  We do not really know what it will be like in the current environment or how people will respond.  A lot of it ultimately comes down to human behaviour and expectations and things that are very hard to get to the bottom of.  There are two channels through which wages would be increasing.  As we have seen, since the onset of the pandemic there are labour shortages in some sectors.  That would naturally bid up the wages.  That is more like a conventional overheating but it is relative to some sectors, including construction and areas like that.  A special feature in the Irish case is that there are some sectors linked to the digital and pharmaceutical industries, which have very high wage growth for reasons that are totally unrelated.  It is really to do with global factors.  That is a permanent increase but it means the average wage rate does not mean very much because it is a combination of all sorts of different wage rates at totally different levels and with totally different growth rates.  It is a very hard thing to think about.</p><p>We have already produced a note on the matter, but it is something we are thinking about much harder because it is becoming a big reality for the Government.</p><p> When people set their wages, they may anticipate a level of inflation and want to be compensated for that.  The question is what level they anticipate.  If they think everyone else is going to raise their wages, and by consequence companies also raise their prices, they will ask for more.  We do not want to be in the environment where everybody is bidding up relative to everyone else because there will just be higher inflation.  That will not really achieve very much and it means there will be higher inflation just to stand still, in a sense.</p><p> A big question for Ireland is also what happens relative to other countries.  If other countries in the eurozone have the common currency, we need, in a way, to keep an eye on what is happening in those countries.  If they did not raise their wages very much and we raised ours by a lot, our relative prices would increase by a lot and we would lose competitiveness.  We also need to look at that fairly carefully.</p><p> In terms of what this means, as we said earlier, this is an energy price shock and it is imported goods that have increased so we cannot fully compensate that through wages for everyone.  We would just lose our competitiveness if we did so.</p></speech>

Is that shutting down such increases fully or partially?</p></speech>

It is a risk but exactly where to set wages is a really difficult judgment and we are not in position to have a strong view on that.  Being fully compensated for inflation would lead to risks of even higher inflation, which would likely be self-defeating.  Exactly where on the spectrum it is put would be a difficult judgment.  It partly depends on what one might think would have happened otherwise as well in the sense that people would have otherwise got some wage increase anyway.  There are some sectors that have relatively high productivity growth or there is a shortage of labour, so it is pretty hard to know how all of that fits together.</p></speech>

We have seen the initiation of the inflation co-operation framework but these are huge amounts of money and we do not know how inflation is going to go over the next while, as we mentioned.  Does the council have any concerns about the delivery of the NDP or will the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>

We know there is a certain budget and there are so many projects but we do not know all the detail about every single project because it is massive.  The capital plan was not that detailed in terms of economics, including specific programmes, their impact on the economy and the like.  That speaks to one of the problems we have in general, which is that we do not know what climate initiatives will cost and where the fiscal costs will be.</p> <p>  When we start to see costs rising for each capital project, given the rise in construction and material costs and labour, it will have an impact on when projects can be delivered.  It will potentially squeeze out some of the projects that are there but, on the other hand, we have already seen some delays in projects getting off the ground.  It is still possible that projects could be delivered but at a later date.  Again, this is a complex backdrop to all of this.  We could see the projects delivered on a later timeline.</p></speech>

The report references the topic of the day, which is the rise in energy prices we are all talking about.  Is there a prediction now that the energy crisis will lead to permanently elevated costs compared with the pre-Covid price trajectory?  I only have two minutes left in my slot so what is the assessment of the witnesses of such a view?  Do they expect fossil fuel energy prices to remain high throughout the decade relative to pre-Covid expectations?  Has a floor on the price of carbon been cemented by these new dynamics?</p></speech>

That said, they have stayed higher for longer than expected.  With some of the most recent sanction announcements, etc., they are likely to remain high in the near term.  That is probably longer than we had expected before.  With this in mind and moving towards the climate policies, which as the Deputy has said will put a sort of floor on the carbon price, it is very difficult to forecast what will happen in energy markets.  As a result, betting on the outcome is the wrong approach, but having them stay higher than we anticipated three years ago is probably plausible.</p></speech>

Sometimes we can see what is causing it and sometimes we cannot.  Currently, there is a war ongoing and inflation is inevitable.  It is the reason for it now but it is not always the reason, unfortunately.  Are there reasons given for the inflation that may not be a contributor but which may suit to explain away such inflation?  I feel there are, although I may be answering my own question.</p></speech>

Inflation was incredibly low in the pre-pandemic period, averaging 0.5% per year.  It was already starting to creep up through the end of the pandemic, partly because of a shift from services to goods, which put up some goods prices.  This was exemplified in construction.  We also saw labour shortages and as businesses reopened, some prices were going up.</p> <p>  The real driver to these sorts of levels can be clearly seen as the contribution of energy and, to a degree, food prices.  In the months ahead we can probably expect to see it showing more in other prices.  Other items that are not explicitly energy and food contain inputs from the energy sectors and we can see that in the euro area inflation, services are starting to play a bit more of a role.  These are services from areas that are very energy-intensive, such as transport.</p> <p>  The big question after that is what will happen next.  The Stability Programme Update 2022 assumes that oil and energy prices will stay at the same level and one would expect those components to disappear and inflation to come back, at some point, towards a more normal level.  The programme update assumes it will go back to approximately 2%, which is the ECB target, although we have not been there for a long time now.  There is much uncertainty around that, including how long the immediate knock-on effects will last.  It partly depends on policy as to whether inflation will really take off or we will get second-round effects, etc.  There is massive uncertainty, but what we see now is very clearly related to energy and food, essentially, along with rents and so on.</p></speech>

I contend that the European Union has been largely negligent in dealing with the energy issue.  It had all the time in recent years to make provision, and it should have been able to make provision, knowing what the prevailing opinion was regarding the origins of energy from the point of view of the countries in central Europe.  Are we likely to see any improvement soon in respect of that sourcing of energy?</p></speech>

There are obviously many risks around that and a lot of things could go wrong.  That could potentially lead to quite a difficult winter in Europe.  Ireland is not directly exposed to that as strongly as some other countries.  In particular, our industrial production is not as strongly dependent on that as industrial production is in some other countries.  However, that is a big risk to the European economy for next winter and, as a consequence, it is also a risk for the Irish economy.  Further ahead, many of the measures that have been announced would contribute to moving towards achieving the climate change goals and going in the right direction, so ultimately it would be helpful if all of that happens.  It also would be helpful for the public finances.  In the short term, however, those risks are important.  It is one of the big downside risks facing the economy.</p></speech>

There is going to be downward pressure in this country in respect of emissions, and I accept we must deal with that.  Some of it can be dealt with indirectly and some of it can be dealt with directly by taking steps.  However, we also have to be careful we do not end up with a food shortage.  A food shortage can develop very quickly.  It can come upon us in a very short space of time.  For example, there was a serious food shortage in Syria some years ago, in many ways because of the war.  Are we capable of withstanding all the pressures that are likely to be in our face, as it were, and come through that from the point of view of the food supply chain?</p></speech>

Internationally, the risk of food shortages is a serious concern, especially for lower income countries and those that are very dependent on importing directly from Ukraine and Russia.  In the Irish context, the biggest risk is probably more food price inflation, both because of the shortage of food but also, for example, due to the fact that fertiliser prices have increased a great deal.  It is mostly an inflation risk in the Irish context, but it is a risk that would not be borne equally by all households.  There are things to consider there in terms of lower income and more vulnerable households.</p></speech>

That did not finish up well in times past.  What is the balance to be struck in that area?  Are we capable of being discreet in what we do and prepared to be so?  Alternatively, are we likely to go overboard?</p></speech>

Many things have changed in the economy over time, which is one of the things that makes it uncertain.  We are in some senses in uncharted waters.  A clear lesson is that trying to overdo the response and insulate ourselves from these shocks will lead to higher inflation and second-round effects.  How far those go depends on many things.</p> <p>  One thing that has changed significantly is the way monetary policy works.  We now have an independent central bank in the euro area, which one would expect to take this very seriously.  That is one of the reasons interest rates have increased: people expect the ECB to respond and it has indicated it will start to raise interest rates in the next couple of months.  That is different from the picture we had six months ago.  That is one of the forces one would expect to keep inflation down.  The higher it sees inflation going, the stronger it is likely to respond.  That is one reason it would be counterproductive to have excessive across-the-board wage increases.</p> <p>  There is a delicate balance for the Government to strike.  There is a legitimate case for protecting the economy in the short run and for helping lower income and more vulnerable households, but a balance has to be struck with not putting too much money into the economy or creating unsustainable wage and price expectations.  It is a difficult balance and there is no magic formula to do it.  In the early days of social partnership, Ireland was able to use different instruments together and co-ordinate different parts of the economy to achieve an outcome.  It is a different situation today but that process worked quite well.  Like many countries, we have not needed those processes to the same extent for a long time.  The question is, if we come back to them, how we will do it.  The Government has said it is having discussions with different bodies and that could be a good way of managing this.</p></speech>

That was when governments were always going to address issues of a long-term or short-term nature.  The worrying part was that when they got their hands in people's pockets, they had a habit of taking more out than they were putting in.</p> <p>  We have to recognise that there may be, as the Taoiseach warned, a short, sharp pain.  How we deal with that remains to be seen but I hope we hold our nerve.</p> <p>  We are deemed to be one of the five wealthiest countries in the world.  That is what I hear the Opposition telling us, anyway, all the time.  I have my doubts about that because most of our wealth comes from wages and salaries and property prices.  That still remains, I think.  I will not ask Mr. Barnes to comment on putting the hand in the pocket but would be grateful for his response on the rest of it.  </p></speech>

It speaks to an important issue, which is that we have to tackle both the short-run challenges around the cost of living and the longer run challenges we have talked about, such as an excessive reliance on corporation tax; climate change; pensions, which we have not mentioned much; and rising healthcare costs.  We need to tackle all these things while maintaining the economy and public finances on a sustainable path.  The Government's 5% rule provides useful guidance in this context, keeping Government spending in line with the underlying potential of the economy.  The flip side of that is that choices have to be made between different things because we cannot keep putting money in the pocket without saying where it will come from.</p> <p>  On costs, this high-cost environment highlights the contribution of domestic factors to high inflation or the high cost of living.  Housing is an issue we are aware of, and there are a number of other things.  There are other ways of bringing down the cost of living by tackling some of the structural reasons some things are expensive in this country.  Maybe those become more important as inflation goes up for other reasons.</p></speech>

We may be one of the richest countries but we have an awful lot of poor people in it.

What is the best way to address this in the absence of raising the retirement age?</p></speech>

We also produced our long-term sustainability report two years ago.  An important message from that report is that tackling these problems earlier makes it less expensive and gives a better range of choices than tackling them later.  That is a case for addressing these issues in a timely way and that is why we highlighted the fact there is as yet no response to the Pensions Commission's proposals.  It is ultimately a political choice.  There are a number of options: raise the pension age, raise contributions or lower benefits.  Those are political choices and I am not taking a view between them.  Probably, given the size of the challenge, you need to do a combination of those things.  The Pensions Commission recommended eventually linking the retirement age to life expectancy, which would help to reduce costs, and fairly significant increases in PRSI contributions.  The Government has to decide which of those channels it will take.</p> <p>  There are two driving factors which are important.  One is the population.  People are living longer.  Life expectancy aged 65 is increasing quite a bit.  The time people can expect to spend in retirement is going up and we are having a more generous pension system.  That would stop if we started to index it as the Pensions Commission suggests, but we are making the pension system more generous as we go.  The other factor, which is less well understood, is that the number of people reaching retirement age will increase by 50% between now and 2050.  These big baby boom-type generations are reaching retirement.  That is where most of the cost increase is coming from.  That is why we probably need a combination of the two.  In the Pensions Commission proposals, the life expectancy increase deals with that piece and the tax part deals with the rest.  There may be a case for increasing the taxes earlier because those people are working now so the tax base is bigger than it will be in the future.  Taking early action is warranted.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty may have asked something similar around this, but we are in a massive cost-of-living crisis.  Should the action be taken more seriously?  Will the council outline how best to approach mitigating the impact of inflation on households while avoiding additional inflationary pressures?</p></speech>

The Government has introduced a number of largely temporary but untargeted measures and packages.  Those measures are sizable so the increase the Government has made is about the same size as the welfare package in the budget last year.  It is not a negligible measure.  Members can discuss whether it is enough.</p> <p>  On timing, the council does not have a view as to when additional measures should be announced.  Some of the current measures expire in October, so that is a natural point for the Government to consider it.  The summer months are easier because people are not having to pay for heating to the same extent.  The council really has no view on that.  It is a judgment the Government has to make.  It is a democratic decision.</p> <p>  As to how to do it, which is a different question, it is about trying to target that help more than it has been targeted thus far.  We are trying to get the balance between helping the most vulnerable people and not putting too much money into the economy at a time when inflation is already high.</p><p>Obviously the best way of doing that is taking a given amount and targeting it at the people who need it most.  That could be done with measures more tied to the welfare system.  It could also be done with measures related to the tax system because some of the people who are having a significant impact would not be covered by the welfare system.  There are a number of things for the Government to do.  It might need to be a bit creative in the way in which it does them.  We also know there is a rural-urban difference.  Pensioners, especially in the winter, tend to spend much more on heating as a share of their incomes.  There is a lot here and there are not necessarily perfect ways of doing it.  It is for the Government to come up with a way of achieving that.</p></speech>

It is getting out of hand.  We have many people coming through the doors of our office with those problems.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council mentions the rainy day quite a bit in its report.  What does the council feel is the best approach to a rainy-day fund in terms of its structure?  How is it funded and what would it be used for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.928" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#M00300"><p>The question about the structure of the rainy-day fund is a very good one.  The Government set up a rainy-day fund.  It made some contributions but delayed them and essentially made very few before the pandemic.  It does not currently plan to contribute.  We think that is very useful.  The Irish economy is inherently quite volatile.  We are very reliant on corporation tax and all sorts of changes in the global economy.  It is good to have a precautionary fund available.  The other issue is that we have become very reliant on these excess corporation tax receipts.  A good idea would be to reduce the extent to which spending relies on excess corporation tax.</p> <p>  It raises the question of what to do with the money.  One option is to use it to pay down debt.  Another option is to use it to build up the rainy-day fund.  We have some concerns about the way the Government set up the rainy-day fund.  Under the current EU rules, in particular, it is quite hard to draw money down from the rainy-day fund.  The design the Government chose did not seem to address that very well.  It is an issue to which the Government should return.  It should look at the design because the fund could be improved in order for it to have a much better stabilisation role in the economy than is currently the case.  </p></speech>

I will finish up by asking the council's view on changing VAT rates both in general and with regard to the reduced rate for the hospitality sector.  What would be its effect on inflation versus the benefits?  Would there be any unforeseen consequences of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.932" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#M00700"><p>One thing about the VAT rate cut is that it is temporary.  That is very important for the public finances.  The Government was running a deficit of more than 9% of national income during the pandemic, mostly due to temporary measures.  Now that those have unwound, the public finances are in much better shape.  That shows one can have big temporary stimuli without driving the public finances massively off track though, of course, we accumulated that amount of debt, rather than permanent measures.  That is why this distinction is also a little bit important with the cost-of-living measures.  Maybe energy prices fall at some point and temporary measures to smooth over that increase may be the appropriate thing to do.  With regard to the VAT cut for the hospitality sector, the council does not look at these kinds of specific measures.  Economists are often quite sceptical about those measures - how much they actually deliver and how much they reduce prices by, as compared to boosting the cash flow of those firms.  In some cases, as during the pandemic, cash flow was the issue, but we are now in a different situation.  We know the economy has recovered quite strongly.  However that is not something we have looked at in any detail.</p></speech>

I ask members participating online to raise their hand.  We talked a little bit about debt.  Can we expand on that?  Obviously we are in an especially volatile global situation right now.  I notice that some of the language in the council's submission is similar to the language at which we have been looking for two years insofar as it is a good idea to reduce our debt.  We have relatively high debt compared to international comparisons.  Since I am looking at vaguely similar language, has the situation changed?  We are possibly looking at different interest rates and a changed global environment.  Should we be considering our national debt differently now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.934" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#M00900"><p>The forecast for debt has changed quite a bit.  It has changed essentially because the economy has recovered much faster.  High inflation tends to reduce that debt ratio.  The other big thing that has changed is the budget balance which now looks much healthier than we thought before.  That is what is putting it on this downward trajectory.  Another thing that has changed which goes in the other direction is that we have seen interest rates go up a lot.  At one point, Ireland was paying zero.  It is now more like 1.5%.  It is a big change at the margin.</p> <p>  In the short run, we are relatively well protected because Government debt has been issued at relatively long maturities and the Government is holding quite large cash balances.  That was done for precautionary reasons but it is actually quite a good idea because it has locked in low interest rates.  It has pre-funded that.  The strategy has arguably paid off.  Eventually, however, we will have to roll that debt over and we will go from the situation we will have in the next couple of years where interest costs will fall, because the debt we are issuing is still likely to be at lower interest rates than the debt it is replacing.  That dynamic will go into reverse in the medium term.  The debt outlook has changed quite a lot.  The change has been partly favourable and partly less favourable.</p> <p>  In terms of the trajectory, the concern is that debt is still at a relatively high level compared to many countries and compared to what it has been historically.  We have just discussed all the pressures on the cost of living and the risks.  If those risks were to materialise and there was to be a big global recession in which Ireland was be hit badly, we would be in a different situation.  However, in an SPU scenario where we come to growth and inflation comes back under control, the years ahead will actually be quite favourable.  Unemployment will be quite low, the economy will be growing quite fast in real terms and interest rates will still be very low.  I will borrow the phrase about fixing the roof while the sun is still shining.  Those will actually be quite good years.  They are not amazing years but they will be relatively good.  Reducing public debt is a very difficult exercise.  One wants to do it in relatively favourable circumstances such as that.  One does not want to be doing it in a position where the economy is growing much more slowly which, in the long run, may well be what happens in Ireland or where one has major economic problems.  It is very much about taking the opportunities.</p> <p>  The policy mistake of most advanced countries over past decades has been not to take the opportunities.  When a country comes out of a recession or a slowdown, there are always problems to deal with.  The country says it will do it, but not now.  The country understands it needs to do it, but it will not do it now.  One sees that the debt goes up during every crisis.  It stabilises after the crisis for a bit and then we have another crisis.  One is basically going up an escalator.  This is really happening because of the failure to take slightly courageous decisions in relatively good times in the economy to get debt down.  If we want to avoid being caught in this trap or being in a situation that is worse where one has to reduce debt against a difficult background, this is why we should make this plan.</p> <p>  Of course, if the economy were to go sour, we would need to look at it differently but that is basically the reason that remains a priority despite all of the other challenges.  That is why we think sticking to the 5% rule would be helpful in that context.  Of course, that imposes choices, but it imposes exactly the choices one should be making.  If we want better public services or if we want to fund climate change, how will we pay for it?  We should not think we will borrow.  There may be cases in which it may be reasonable to do so, but we should not just do that because we are reluctant to face up to the fact that we should just be paying more or finding some savings elsewhere.</p></speech>

I am aware that some countries are dealing with an issue around access to cash.  I notice that some of the council's work is based on looking at ATM transactions.  There seems to have been a transfer of access to cash facilities from banks to private companies.  In terms of access to data, how happy is the council with the idea that transactions such as that are a good basis for data?  Does the council see the beginnings of any sign around access-to-cash issues in Ireland?</p></speech>

We have recently been using the cards and ATM data to really understand in granular detail what is happening on a day-to-day basis in the economy and what is happening with consumer spending.  It has proven really useful.  It is a brilliant resource that the Central Bank has started to produce.  It gets those data from banks.  It gives a very clear read of how consumers responded to the pandemic and how they came out of it.  It is possible to see the falls as the lockdowns hit and the sharp recoveries thereafter.  It has been a good forward glance of what we will see from the CSO in a few months when it does its own numbers and looks at retail sales, surveys and things like that.</p></speech>

While I cannot speak for anybody else, many people do not carry cash in the way that they did previously.  Many people in my community live a mostly cash-based lives because they are in receipt of small sums of money.  Is there a problem with the data from that aspect?  Will they truly reflect what is happening in lower-income households?  They tend to take their money out at the beginning of the week and parcel it out very carefully.</p></speech>

There is a gap in that when it is taken out as cash, we do not know where it goes afterwards.  We have very good insights into where the card spending goes.  We know it is on groceries, fuel, restaurants, retail or whatever because this is where the point of sale was.  However, if it is an ATM withdrawal, it is anyone's guess where it ends up.  We then need to rely on the survey data afterwards to try to fill in those gaps.  As the Chairman said, there has been a long-term trend towards more card-based transactions which was accelerated during the Covid pandemic because people were less inclined to use cash.  That might not reverse as quickly and it might be here to stay.</p></speech>

Some studies in the US looked at different communities just to see in real time how inequality is responding in things like that.  There is a significant widening of the possibilities with these kinds of data.  We may not be quite there yet.  A good characteristic about the Irish data is that we have the ATM data.  Some countries do not have that and so it is hard to know - they do not know whether people are spending more with cards because they are doing less spending with cash or because they are actually spending more.</p></speech>

I question that.  I would have thought the lesson in the current situation is we need to invest rapidly in areas which are making us more vulnerable to this inflationary crisis - to insulate ourselves against it rather than thinking about saving up money against the rainy day further down the road.  We should throw enormous amounts of money at education, training and apprenticeships.  We should remove every barrier to educating and training, given that the greatest resource we have is the human beings who live here but who are wasted in their ability and talent to a very large degree because it is made so difficult for them.  Large numbers of people could be contributing but it is made difficult for them to realise their potential and make a contribution.</p> <p>  We are seeing it now with all these bottlenecks - I love these economic euphemisms - but we have a lack of apprentices, tradespeople and people trained in areas such as construction, health and education.  It would be far better to take these windfall revenues or what might turn out to be temporary revenues from a relatively small number of multinational companies and really funnel them into an area like that, because that would actually protect us.  Obviously, we need to invest in sustainable energy production in order that we become less vulnerable to international price shocks in that area.</p> <p>  We also need a focus on the diversification of Irish agriculture when we consider that food security is becoming an issue again.  We need to rapidly diversify Irish agriculture which would have a very positive environmental spin-off by reducing imports and therefore carbon footprint further down the road.  It would also insulate us to some degree against inflation that is dictated by international market pressures.  These are choices.  There will be a debate potentially about this rainy day fund.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Barnes's response.</p> <p>  Regarding the wage thing, the RT&Eacute; website has a headline to the effect that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, says there will be tough negotiations ahead over the public sector pay agreement.  The debate has already started with the suggestion that we cannot give these workers too much to compensate for inflation.  I ask Mr. Barnes to reiterate the figure that he gave, which might be helpful in our debate in the next while.  He mentioned &euro;2 billion for pensions wages and social welfare to keep pace with inflation.  I ask him to tell us what that is based on, because it is an interesting figure.</p> <p>  Is there not a danger that if we do not give workers, pensioners and social welfare recipients increases at least in line with inflation, we start to create the conditions for a possible recession as consumer demand begins to fall off?  We know a significant driver of Irish economic growth has been consumer demand.  If ordinary working people just cannot afford to spend and therefore fewer goods and services are purchased, is that not as big a danger?  I take Mr. Barnes's point about not giving money to people who really do not need it or who have benefited and deciding where those thresholds would be is a matter for a serious debate.  However, is there not a big danger that if we start imagining that there could be something really wrong with giving workers pay increases or giving people pension increases to deal with inflation, it could have an equally bad effect in terms of consumer demand?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022060100002#N00900"><p>The Deputy made two very important points.  Obviously, investments in areas such as education, training and agriculture would be very good for the country but they could also be good for the public finances in some sense if they have high returns, that is, by training people so they have higher incomes, which feed back into the tax system, and are less reliant on the welfare system.  Depending on how they are done, all these can, in principle, be helpful to the public finances.  They are also relevant to the public finances for other reasons.  The Government should naturally be thinking about that and the democratic process needs to take a view on it.</p> <p>  There may be a case that under certain conditions, some of this could be financed from some of these excess receipts.  However, there are a number of caveats to that.  The case would need to be made very carefully if the Government were planning to do that.  One of those caveats is that many of these things actually involve recurrent spending.  In education spending, for example, there is a new generation every time.</p><p>One is locking in recurrent spending and there may also be current expenditure that is related to the capital part.  Funding recurrent spending from a volatile source of revenue that we might lose is risky.  That risk must be carefully considered.</p><p> Another point is the overall amount of money put into the economy.  One of the reasons for not putting so much of the corporation tax money into the economy is that it is essentially coming from the outside and is being pumped into the economy.  In an environment where there are risks of inflation and overheating, that is a constraint on how much you can put in.  If it is funded through taxation there is an offset somewhere, in that someone has less money to spend.  If, however, you are just funnelling in external money, that is a recipe for overheating, which may not be sustainable if the tax revenues are not sustainable.  In short, definitely the investment is a source of future prosperity or at least it should be if it is done properly.  How that interacts with the rainy day fund must be very carefully considered with these kinds of receipts because there are risks involved.</p><p> On the second part, in terms of wage inflation I wish be clear about the figure that I gave.  It was a figure of approximately &euro;2 billion for operating for the unexpected inflation.  It is the difference between what was projected in the budget and in the stability programme update, SPU.  Inflation has actually been a bit stronger than that so the actual number would be a bit higher.  The number actually includes the State pension, public sector pay, welfare rates and payments on goods and services.  About half of that would be public sector pay.  Of the remaining, one quarter of the title would be pensions.  The welfare and the other parts are actually relatively small compared to that.  This is one of the cases for targeting the number of welfare recipients relative to the size of the economy.  Relative to the population, it is a relatively well-defined group.  That is purely the figures part.</p><p> On the economics, the Deputy is right.  This is one of the reasons why we say that when the Government strikes the balance, the reasons for the extra cost of living supports are partly for very vulnerable people or people on low income in general, but it is also to support the economy.  Most people's wages have not gone up in response to the inflation we have seen.  Mostly this is because we do not have a lot of choice as to whether we purchase fuel or food.  When people are having to make choices between that and other things, the other things are the ones that are domestically produced.  For example, people might go out less and they would spend less on all sorts of other domestic activities.  This is why it will slow consumption in the domestic economy.  There is some case to have some increase in wages because of that reason.  Increasing in line with the full value of those pressures for everyone is not a desirable policy because one would be helping everyone, and yet the economy as a whole is being negatively impacted by these higher import prices.  Not everyone can be fully compensated.  That is obviously a very extreme case.  The question is: within that, who is the Government going to compensate and by how much?  There is no simple answer to that.  This judgment must be reached by the political process and by society more widely.</p></speech>

It has been an incredibly useful overview.  I thank the witnesses for coming.</p></speech>

Can members please ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment of the Houses even on silent mode?  The draft minutes of the meeting on 21 May have been circulated.  Are the minutes of that meeting agreed to?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will meet with the Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley, in session one and with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, in session two.  On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome the Minster, Deputy Norma Foley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education with special responsibility for special education and inclusion, Deputy Josepha Madigan, and their officials here today.</p> <p>  The report on the review of out-of-school provision was published by the social inclusion unit at the Department of Education on 12 May.  Why was the joint committee not informed of the publication of the report?  What are the Minster's intentions regarding sustainable funding at the Cork Life Centre as there is no funding model contained in the report?  What is the rational behind the decision to only focus on 13 to 15-year-old students in the review?  What plans are in place for students who are 16 years old and older who are at senior cycle in an alternative education setting as the review makes no provision for this cohort?</p> <p>  The second issue in this session is education and supports provision for displaced Ukrainian students.  I propose that we take the first issue, the review of out-of-school provision report, at the start of the meeting, separately from the Ukrainian issue.  If members put their hands up, I will call them.  Members have a number of specific questions.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to make their brief openings statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.958" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#A00200"><p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the invitation to attend today to discuss the important issues of the review of out-of-school education provision, and education and supports for Ukrainian students.  We are joined today by a number of officials from our Department, including Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc and Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretaries general, and by Ms Anne Murray, Ms Mary Cregg and Mr. Neville Kenny, principal officers.</p> <p>  I will speak first about the review of out-of-school provision report.  Out-of-school services are typically a provision of education, outside of the mainstream school setting, for children and young people who have encountered difficulties staying in mainstream education.  This sector has expanded over time and most often as a response to a local need.  For these students, out-of-school education provision is generally the final option within the education system, when all other supports, options and pathways have been tried and have not proved successful in maintaining their engagement with mainstream education.</p> <p>  The Department committed, as part of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, plan, to review the current provision of out-of-school education to inform future supports in this area.   The aim was to research current provision, to identify how best the sector should be served, and to make recommendations for future policy development.  This review encompasses the out-of-school education sector in general, nationwide, and is not specific to any one particular setting.</p> <p>  The report, which was just published on 12 May, acknowledges the need for out-of-school provision for a small number of students, for whom the mainstream school system faces challenges in meeting their diverse and individualised needs.  It also acknowledges that education provision for students, both in school and out of school, is best delivered by ensuring the voice of the child or young person is at its heart.</p> <p>  The next steps will involve the establishment of a working group to consider and work through the recommendations.  It is important to state that this is very much a first step in providing a policy platform for the out-of-school sector.  The working group will be tasked with considering the recommendations of the review of out-of-school education provision, and, critically, engaging with relevant stakeholders as part of this process.  The recommendations allow for consideration of possible approaches and funding models to be developed.  The working group is tasked with developing criteria for structure, governance and level of education provision, including scoping out costs associated with the implementation of the recommendations.  I am keen to progress this work and can assure the committee that these students will be supported.</p> <p>  I will turn now to the second issue the committee referred to in its invitation, namely, education and supports for Ukrainian students.  First, I want to highlight the fantastic work that our schools have done in welcoming so many children and young people from Ukraine into their communities over the last three months.  As I visited schools around the country, I witnessed first hand this exceptional effort by all members of our school communities from principals, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, staff, students, families to their wider communities.</p> <p>  I want to assure the committee that meeting the educational needs of children and young people from Ukraine is a priority for me, as Minister, and for my officials.  We are determined to continue our support for those huge efforts we are seeing from our school communities on the ground.  Members will appreciate the scale of the response needed, given that well over 30,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine since the beginning of this war.  Figures show that just under 6,000 children from Ukraine have now enrolled in schools in every county across the State.  To date, approximately 4,000 children from Ukraine have enrolled in primary schools, while almost 1,900 have enrolled in our post-primary schools.</p><p>From the early days of the crisis, the Department has moved quickly to respond appropriately.  This is why, in the early phase, we moved to establish regional education and language teams, REALT, across the country to co-ordinate school enrolment for Ukrainian families.<br/><br/>The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places when they are ready to engage with the school system.  REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined areas.<br/><br/>The Department is aware, through the work of the REALT co-ordinators and inspectors on the ground, that some Ukrainian pupils are accessing Ukrainian curricular material - for example, through the all-Ukraine online school, which is supported by the ministry of education and science of Ukraine.  I would like to thank those schools which have facilitated a pragmatic approach for these pupils.<br/><br/>The issue of appropriate language supports is an important one.  All children in the education system are provided with the supports they require to fulfil their potential.  The allocation of specialist resources to schools takes account of the needs of pupils, including where appropriate, English as an additional language, EAL, needs.  Figures show that 724 primary and 194 post-primary schools have applied for, and are now receiving, EAL teaching resources.<br/><br/>The Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have collaborated, in conjunction with SOLAS and ETBI and in wider consultation with other management bodies and stakeholders to agree the recruitment of additional capacity for ESOL tutors, that is, English for speakers of other languages, in every ETB.  This capacity will be flexibly deployed into post-primary schools, adult education centres, or wherever intensive English language development classes need to be facilitated for Ukrainian adults and post-primary age students.  This resource will be available to Ukrainian children and young people over the summer period.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today and to provide an update on the review of out-of-school provision<i></i>report and on the actions being taken to support the educational needs of students arriving in Ireland from Ukraine.<br/><br/>I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to address the committee.</p></speech>

My Department is committed to providing every support possible to all those fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland including those with special needs.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has outlined the important work of the regional education and language teams, REALT.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is a critical member of each of these regional teams in supporting families to access the educational supports they need.  NCSE staff are spending time with these families as they adjust to new school placements across the country.  While the most appropriate place for children is in the most inclusive environment in a mainstream setting, where there are known complex needs, the NCSE will work with families to get the right setting for these children.  The NCSE special education needs organisers, SENOs, are linking with other relevant State agencies, including the education welfare services and the HSE.  In addition, officials in my Department are working closely with the HSE disability services so that there is a joined up response and flow of information.</p> <p>  One of the key supports we can offer to children arriving from other countries is English language supports.  These supports are available generally in schools which have a large number of children for whom English or Irish is not their first language.  It has been of particular importance recently to support the large number of children from Ukraine enrolled in our schools.  I am pleased to say an allocation of English language support hours is provided to schools which have recently enrolled Ukrainian pupils.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I were delighted to announce this year&rsquo;s summer programme.  It is anticipated that it will support up to 48,000 children with special educational needs and children at most risk of educational disadvantage, which is a huge priority for this Government.  For the 2022 programme, the inclusion programme at primary and post-primary levels offers an opportunity for schools to address the needs of migrant students, such as addressing English language skills and integration.  This includes students who have recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.  This is a key part of the offering and I can confirm that it includes English as an additional language support.</p> <p>  Finally, it is also important to mention that I recently visited the Muslim school in Clonskeagh at the invitation of the school principal, John McDonnell, and the CEO of the Islamic Cultural Centre for Ireland, Ahmed Hasain.  In a gesture that truly illustrates the meaning of community spirit, the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland is willing to offer up to four classrooms to the Muslim national school to facilitate newly arriving children and young people from Ukraine, irrespective of their religion.</p> <p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the great work done by our schools and communities to welcome children and young people from Ukraine, as well as their families.  Once again, Chair, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today to provide an update on the important work that is being done to support learners from Ukraine with special educational needs.</p></speech>

We have all been very impressed with the Cork Life Centre, in particular.  It has been in front of the committee and we have met the representatives on a number of occasions.  I do not think there was one member of the committee who was not incredibly impressed by the service it provides.  I met Mr. Don O' Leary yesterday and he was anxious that there would be some light at the end of tunnel in terms of what the centre is trying to do.  The Minister, Deputy Foley' presentation speaks again of a review.  Unfortunately, for people in the Cork Life Centre, that is not going to give them an awful lot of comfort.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by the phrase "out-of-school provision" and not "alternative education".  When dealing with the Department of Education, you always have to be very cognisant of the fact that it knows language very well.  The Department knows language very well, so the choice of the phrase "out-of-school provision" is a deliberate one.  It gives a connotation of something that is odd or unusual.  It has negative connotations in terms of what the provision does, that is, it is out-of-school rather than being part of the educational provision by the State.</p> <p>  Will the Minister speak specifically on the Cork Life Centre?  What support will be provided to ensure those young people can continue?  Can I ask specifically about this phrase "out-of-school provision" which the Department has chosen to use?  Does the Minister agree that it does not really fit well with those who are working in alternative education?  For those who attend services such as the Cork Life Centre, it is school and it is their educational experience.  They are being provided with an alternative to what many people might consider the mainstream, but it is not "out-of-school".  I have an issue with that phraseology.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.963" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#B00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  In the first instance, I take the Deputy's point in terms of language.  This report was a report about out-of-school provision which was put in place in late 2017.  That is the report we are here to discuss.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  It is important to note that in the report there is an acknowledgement of the need for the provision of education types, whatever name or title we want to give them, for a particular group of students whose needs are not met in the mainstream education setting.  It is very important that acknowledgement exists within this report.  That is the first stepping stone forward.</p> <p>  At the end of the day what we want to ensure is that the maximum number of our students feel their needs are being met in education, and I know Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in would share this view.  Where that is not possible in one particular type of education, then we will support their opportunities in the type of education that meets their needs.  The provision of a different type of education from mainstream education is acknowledged here.  High level recommendations are made here.  The recommendations include the need to secure that type of provision for the students and the need to find a starting point, so that we can be clear in terms of how provision of that nature will work, be funded and how there will be consistency across different centres or providers.</p> <p>  On the Cork Life Centre specifically - and I acknowledge the work of the Cork Life Centre and of all the other centres - this report is not specific to any one centre.  It looks in the round at all of the types of provision that are made.  The Department has provided funding and has worked closely with the Cork Life Centre.</p><p>There is a pathway forward or starting point now, where we will look at future potential in terms of funding mechanisms, co-ordination, delivery and types of education and so on.  This report is significant because it is a stepping stone in terms of the necessary work which will be undertaken by the working group.  </p></speech>

I do not know if that was deliberate or not.  Regarding the Cork Life Centre and the fears and concerns they have, is the Minister in a position to give them comfort as to their future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.966" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#C00300"><p>We have not been found wanting in terms of the Cork Life Centre.  We have worked closely with it and will continue to do that.  It is important to say the entire purpose of this review was to look across all settings and secure a mechanism via the working group to ensure there is funding available, coherence of delivery of education and of governance and a variety of necessary measures to ensure everything operates as it should.</p> <p>  I do not have any particular preference one way or another for the name.  My absolute preference is to ensure children and young people are being provided for and their needs are being met.  The name is not of concern to me.  There is a provision of education in non-recognised settings in the Education (Welfare) Act.  Perhaps that is where it comes from but the name is not the concern.  The concern is to ensure children and young people are being catered for.  I say that sincerely and know that is the Deputy's interest as well.</p></speech>

My first question is more of a procedural one.  There are a number of capable people listed as being on the review group but it is not entirely clear which of them wrote the report.  Will the Minister clarify who was responsible for drafting the report and if it was agreed at a meeting of the review group?  Did anyone make amendments?</p></speech>

A group was put together and the report was finalised and delivered to me.  On the overall responsibility or charge for the writing of the report, the report was born of consultation with a wide variety of parties and agreed by the entire group.  There is no one individual.  It is an agreed report by the group as a consequence of the public and on-line consultation and submissions that came from the wider public.  I believe around 46 personal submissions were received.</p></speech>

There are two major points I want to raise.  I raise again the situation in the Cork Life Centre.  I know this was an overall review but this saga has been going on for some time.  There has been back and forth but it seems to be difficult to finally get to an arrangement that allows Cork Life Centre to continue in a sustainable way and to retain the staff who are committed to the centre.  I urge the Minister to do whatever is necessary to get that over the line and get the deal that will ensure the centre continues.  This saga has been going on for three years, at least, in its latest iteration, and longer than that in different guises.</p> <p>  Another thing surprised me.  I was not an education spokesperson when this report was commissioned.  I did not realise until it was published that this did not include the national Youthreach programme, which to me is peculiar.  It is the largest, by a distance, provider of "out-of-school education", which is the phrase in the report, or of alternative education.  I know it is saying that the Minister, Deputy Harris's, Department will be represented on the implementation group but it is not clear how there is a single unified vision here for alternative education.  This report, which has some good and some bad aspects, does not take the Youthreach picture into account.  That is surprising.  The report is done but it is about how we ensure it is all tied together and there is a unified vision because Youthreach does invaluable work.  It could be described as further education but I am not sure it naturally belongs in that Department.  There is an argument it might better belong in this Department.  Be that as it may, will the Minister comment on why Youthreach was not included?  How do we ensure there is a coherence to it all in the end?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.972" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#C00900"><p>It is my understanding, although it predates both of us in that respect, that the review of Youthreach was ongoing at the time the ESRI report was published.  This report states that Youthreach will be taken into account.  I acknowledge the report focuses very much on 13 to 15-year-olds.</p> <p>  The Deputy and many here have personal knowledge and have engaged with Cork Life Centre.  I acknowledge the work and role of the centre and that there has been long-standing engagement between it and the Department.  The priority now is to look at all provision of all centres and ensure there is sustainability from a funding point of view.  That is one of the tasks, the Deputy will see from the report, that the working group will focus on, as well as that there is consistency in the curriculum that is provided for.  The working group will be charged with all of that function to ensure the issues that have heretofore challenged in this area are smoothed over or worked through in consultation and in collaboration.</p> <p>  The bottom line is, as the report acknowledges, that there is a place for this type of education.  We have consistently said and I acknowledge that everybody here has recognised that no one size necessarily suits every student.  That is clear here, so a different approach is being taken.  We need to find a consistency and a suitable funding model around that.  The working group will be tasked with doing that work.  </p></speech>

I do not know that that was entirely fair to the centre or to people like us who asked questions in good faith about it.  The Department knew the report only dealt with children up to 15, while the Cork Life Centre deals with children up to 18.  This review, no matter how well authored, was never going to have all the answers to their situation.  The fact it was used as the basis for telling them to hold tough a while does not seem totally fair, in hindsight.</p></speech>

There is sufficient scope provided for within this working group to address all aspects, whether students in the 13 to 15 age bracket or those who are moving on towards leaving certificate level.  It is important that scope be given to the working group and it is my ambition and intention that such scope will be provided for.</p></speech>

Following on from the two previous Deputies and, I note, from the Minister, I think language is extremely important and is what shapes the report.  It is the first protocol.  I agree it needs to be changed because we are making the students who avail of these supports lesser and suggesting they are not getting the same education as young people in a school setting, though in many cases they are getting the same education.</p><p> I would welcome the report if it guaranteed a safety net.  When we first met the young people of Cork Life Centre, they described the arrangement as a safety net, a safe space.  Education is not for all young people and, as the Minister said, one shoe does not fit all.  Our education system has to be able to work with young people where they are at.  As said, Cork Life Centre works with young people up to the age of 18.  This should be included in the review.</p><p> To move on a little from the report, I wish to refer to supports for Ukrainian refugees.  Who is responsible for early schooling, including preschool and early childhood services?  As everyone who is a parent at this table knows, there is a minimal number of spaces available for children at present.  How is what is provided being funded?  Is there fair access?  Are there spaces for toddlers or children from three years of age?</p><p> A representative of AsIAm attended a meeting of the disability committee a few weeks ago when we were talking about meeting Ukrainian people where they are at in respect of providing special needs education-----</p></speech>

I want to be absolutely fair to and honest with both members in that I do not have any issue with the points they make on the title.  The current title is the one that was given to the report when it was first commissioned in late 2017 and that is why I assume it remains in place; however, I have no issue with working with whatever is appropriate or whatever the students themselves deem to be the appropriate title.  The core objective is to ensure educational provision that meets the needs of students and young people who, for whatever reason, cannot have those needs met at present in mainstream education.  The objective is to ensure cohesion and financial sustainability regarding provision.  As the Senator and students have said &mdash; nobody puts it better than the students themselves &mdash; they want a safe space.  The working group now has an opportunity to work through the various points to ensure cohesion regarding governance and the curriculum, in addition to financial sustainability.  That is the chief objective.  The report is the catalyst for the next stage of engagement and delivery.</p></speech>

Like previous speakers, I believe we have debated this issue for a good while.  The report was instigated in 2017 and I suppose it must be welcomed that it is now being published.  At least we know where we are at.  Many of us were waiting eagerly for the report.  When I got a chance to read it a couple of weeks ago, my initial reaction was that it was a stepping stone, as the Minister said.  Considering that it was commissioned in 2017 and it is now 2022, when will we get to the destination?  For five long years, the organisations have waited, unsure of their funding from year to year.  I concede that we have provided funding for Cork Life Centre more than ever before in the past few years.  That must be acknowledged, as must the additional hours given, but at the same time the report refers to a sustainable model.  All the models and centres are different.  As Senator Flynn said, there is no one size that fits all, and that must be acknowledged.  The majority of people running the centres just want to know the resources they have and the contractual status of their teaching staff.  We are all speaking about Cork Life Centre.  A sizeable proportion of the staff there are qualified teachers and some of them have a masters degree.  They are not being paid at the same rate as their equivalents in mainstream education.  I would like some feedback on when we will reach the final stepping stone or destination where there are definitive answers for each of the centres.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his personal interest in and engagement on this.  I appreciate his point on progress between 2017 and now.  I cannot say what the initial delay was.  No doubt Covid had an impact but the important thing concerns where we are now and what we are going to do next.  I see this report as a catalyst to allow the working group to go through each of the points the Deputy has made, which points I have made previously.</p> <p>  I believe the centres themselves would acknowledge that, in many instances, it has been a struggle for them.  There have been challenges and difficulties for them.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the supports given when the matter is raised with us.  The centres themselves need a definitive standing regarding supports that can be offered, and that is why we will move as quickly as possible, through the working group, specifically to examine the recommendations so as to find a funding mechanism that will remove the challenges that have arisen heretofore for the centres.  It is a matter of achieving coherence of delivery and governance across the centres.  The purpose is to work with the centres collectively to find a model that best meets and suits the needs of the students.  In the next step, with the working group, there will be wide consultation.  I assure the members that there will be consultation with the students involved in the process, in particular.  I cannot speak for what happened up to this point; I can speak only to what my ambition is.  It is to make progress as quickly as possible via the working group to answer the very significant questions that the centres themselves want answered and that need to be provided to ensure sustainability.</p></speech>

It seems from reading the report that there is an emphasis on students aged up to 15.  A sizeable proportion of the students of the life centre with whom I am most familiar are above that age.  I realise the report is to emphasise the return to mainstream education.  That is the ideal scenario, but the Minister, having taught in a classroom for long enough, like me, will know that is not always the end result and that a certain percentage of students will never return to mainstream education.  What is the plan for students over 16 if that eventuality transpires?</p></speech>

People have said Youthreach itself is a very significant programme that meets a great need for many students.  However, I hear the point being made on centres offering a facility to students beyond the 13-15 age bracket.  There is scope for the working group to consider this and determine how it can be managed.  I will not in any way be limiting the scope of the working group.  There is an opportunity for it to consider the leaving certificate cohort.  Ultimately, the chief objective is to ensure as much retention and completion at leaving certificate level as possible.</p><p>If that is the sole objective, we will look at the widest possible opportunities to ensure that.</p></speech>

I would be supportive of any mechanism to meet the needs of children and young people to attain to the best of their capability.  That includes the centres the Chairman referenced.

How will we meet the needs of Ukrainian children?</p> <p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for special education will know that representatives of AsIAm appeared before the Joint Committee on Disability Matters a few weeks ago.  They spoke about meeting the needs of young people from Ukraine.  Is money being put into special education services?  How is it working?  What money is being allocated to it?  What are the supports for those with additional needs, especially when neither English nor Irish is their first language?  How will SNAs support the students given the language barrier?</p></speech>

Our understanding is that many children from Ukraine with very complex needs are being supported in countries very close to Ukraine probably because of the travel and that a country like Ireland is so far away.  Officials in the Department of Education are in close contact with the HSE.  It has confirmed that the number of adults and children with disabilities arriving here is quite small.  My understanding is that only about seven or eight children from Ukraine are in special classes or special schools.  That is not to say there will not be more.</p> <p>  The approach at the moment is that children should be facilitated in local settings and that they should not be assessed in the very first instance.  We want to get them settled first of all.  That is based on a psychological first-aid model.  It is better to do that given that they can be so traumatised coming from a war-torn country.  Obviously, the NCSE has the information and they would be put into a specialised setting if that is needed.  The special educational needs organiser, SENO, meets parents with the aid of an interpreter.  The NCSE has also translated about 56 different documents into Russian and Ukrainian to help with the language barrier.  The NCSE so is engaging on an ongoing basis where children with autism or any type of additional need are identified.</p> <p>  They are part of the regional education and language teams, REALT, that the Minister, Deputy Foley, mentioned.  They know where the children are and they support them through that.  They are obviously in touch with the education welfare service and the Tusla education support service, TESS.  The National Educational Psychological Service helps with psychological supports.</p> <p>  The other part of the response relates to summer provision.  We hope the Ukrainians will avail the dedicated inclusion programmes this summer.  Evidence would suggest that particularly for younger children an activity-based environment is better than learning the language.  It is the best way for them to integrate in that way.  Considerable good work is being done for Ukrainians.  They are fully supported and if they need more special education teaching, SET, support - obviously the language comes under that as well - they can be given that.  They can also be given more special needs assistance, SNA, support.</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned language.  More than 918 schools requested additional support relating to English as an additional language or additional teaching hours and that has been granted.</p><p>We are also considering the live issue of tutors to teach English to speakers of other languages, ESOL, for those who do not have English as a first language.  That tutor programme is being made available to post-primary students and to families because there is recognition that a whole community approach must be taken.  Throughout the summer, tutor supports will be available to adults within families and to post-primary students.</p></speech>

Those communities came out of the traumatic period of the pandemic and all the challenges that had to be overcome in that regard and are now embracing the new challenge of thousands of children without English as a first language falling into their care.  Those children are suffering from all sorts of trauma as a result of what they have witnessed and where they have come from as they settle into a new environment.  They have concerns about their family members at home.  The teaching profession and those who work in schools, including SNAs, secretaries, caretakers and boards of management, have stepped up to welcome those thousands of students to their schools.  We totally accept it was never going to be perfect.  There were always going to be teething problems.  However, there are a number of issues.  It has come to my notice, for example, that in certain circumstances a child may be in a school for a number of weeks and with very short notice, the student and his or her family may be relocated to another part of the country.  A number of families were going to schools in my constituency and with short notice were moved to Youghal.  I understand these things have to happen and that in an emergency scenario not everything is going to be done perfectly.  Will the Minister speak to how such situations are communicated and managed?  How is a school informed of those sorts of situations?</p> <p>  A particular young person in the neighbouring constituency of Fingal has special educational needs and is utilising the available resources in a school setting.  The change of location for that young person is going to be even more challenging as they move from one setting to another.  What communications are the different agencies having about the individual needs of children when they are being moved from one part of the country to another?  What kind of communication takes place with the school and the education partners?  Does special educational need come into that discussion?  We previously thought that the child and the family may be moved elsewhere.  Should we reconsider that?</p> <p>  I hope my next point does not come across as unfair but I feel strongly about this issue, as the Minister will be aware.  A Ukrainian child who is now trying to access a secondary school place will be disadvantaged by the fact that certain schools retain 25% of their intake for the children and grandchildren of past pupils.  A Ukrainian is very unlikely to have a parent or grandparent who attended a secondary school in a locality in Ireland.  Does that not again expose how unfair that provision is?</p></speech>

The Deputy clearly articulated the situation when he said they have come out of the challenges of the pandemic and moved into a new challenge.  It has been my good fortune to have had the opportunity to visit many schools and see all of the work going on seamlessly and generously on the ground.  I acknowledge that, as I did at the outset of the meeting.</p> <p>  I appreciate the point the Deputy has made about children settling in a school and families settling in an area only to be moved on.  Even with the best will in the world, there are significant challenges relating to the availability of accommodation from the point of view of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This is an emergency.  It is a remarkable achievement that 30,000 people who have arrived into the country in recent weeks are being accommodated with respect not only to accommodation but also in wider society, including our schools.  There is unprecedented demand but all of society is stepping up in response.  It means some accommodation is available on a more short-term basis than others.  We are liaising clearly with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We know where we have more or less capacity.  The priority of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is to provide accommodation first.  That is its primary consideration.  Up to this point, the Department of Education has been able to provide for education in areas in which the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has found accommodation.  It is a challenge and there is no doubt about that but we liaise closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked specifically about children with special educational needs and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has articulated a response on that point.  I will invite her to come in on that point but she has referenced the numbers involved and the fact that we are managing our way through that situation.  The important point is that we must find a place to accommodate all children who require it within the school setting.</p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about admission policies in schools.  As I said to him earlier, we know we have capacity within our schools to meet the needs of the students as they arrive and we are doing that.  We also know that our invocation of the capacity of schools in terms of their admission is in very limited circumstances.  The important thing here is that every child has access to a place.  That is what we are intending to achieve.  I have also outlined to the Deputy that it is my intention to gather data to measure how that admissions policy is working, the impact it is having and the available opportunities, going forward.  That notwithstanding, it is important to remember that we are talking about children and young people from Ukraine.  We are currently meeting their needs and the schools on the ground, full credit to them, are providing the accommodation and places for them.</p></speech>

If that child is moving to another school, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, should already be aware of the child.  As I said earlier, there are only seven or eight children in a special class or special school at the moment.  The regional education and language teams for Ukraine, REALT, include representatives of the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service.  They will be aware of children with special educational needs and should be able to assist wherever they are at the moment.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and commend the generosity of the Irish people, the Government and the school communities who have accommodated up to 6,000 children from Ukraine.  They have done so seamlessly and without complaint, and that needs to be acknowledged.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned in her introduction that 6,000 children from Ukraine have now enrolled in schools.  Approximately 4,000 children are in primary schools and 1,900 are in our post-primary schools.  Do she have any idea of the demand for places in primary schools in September?  If not, is that something about which she is concerned or does she think we will be able to accommodate that demand?</p></speech>

As I referenced earlier, we have a clear understanding of where we have capacity within our schools.  It was for that reason I said in reply to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that we are working closely with the Department of Children, Equality Disability, Integration and Youth.  It would be very helpful if we could match accommodation with our capacity.</p><p>It is very hard at this point to be clear on the enrolments that might be required throughout the summer.  We know that families are continuing to come.  Enrolments will continue over the summer and REALT will be operating.  We have roughly 20,000 places at primary school level and approximately 25,000 places at post-primary level.  We are currently finalising a survey of primary schools but our geographic information system and data tell us we have in and around 25,000 places.  We may well have in excess of that.  We are confident we can meet the challenges, notwithstanding these are challenges faced every day by schools on the ground.</p><p> I also acknowledge that schools on the ground have always been accommodating of students coming from other places and other countries.  The difficulty and greater challenge this time is that it is in such significant numbers and at such high volume.  I again acknowledge the schools are generously meeting that challenge on the ground. </p></speech>

I suspect the vast majority of them will not be proficient in English and may not even have learned English.  Can anything be done to provide language support hours for them?  Is that an issue we may need to revisit in future?</p></speech>

We also have the ESOL tutors.  These are tutors who make themselves available, and will do so throughout the summer, particularly to adults but also to our post-primary students.  We also have initiatives in our schools, for example, the Say Yes to Languages programme for third to sixth class pupils, to facilitate students who arrive and our own students in having an understanding of their language.  The Ukrainian language will also be included in that programme from September.  There are a variety of different streams, including English as an additional language, the ESOL tutors and the Say Yes to Languages programme.  A particular emphasis is being placed on language supports.</p></speech>

It may be the case people have come from Ukraine who have the academic qualifications to be teachers in Ireland.  It is obviously a different education system.  The courses are different but these Ukrainians may have qualifications in maths, physics or chemistry.  I am also aware the EU Commission agreed a recommendation on 5 April this year in respect of recognition of the qualifications of academic and professional people who have come from Ukraine.  Can anything be done to give recognition to people coming from Ukraine who have the academic qualifications to be teachers?</p></speech>

We have reached out to those who have teaching qualifications and teaching backgrounds.  We have invited them to register with the Teaching Council.  A number have already done so.  The numbers are small at this point, which is understandable, for a variety of reasons.  Some 48 or 49 people have currently registered with the Teaching Council.  That is being progressed by that body, which will be a great addition in future.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the excellent work being done by schools, by REALT and by school communities.  I also acknowledge the Department has been under very severe pressure on this.  I am sure not everything is perfect but significant work is going on.  I acknowledge the work of the Department in ensuring these children who are coming from a very grim situation are getting an education.  I commend it on that.</p> <p>  We have talked a little about additional educational needs.  The numbers in that regard are small but, generally speaking, when it comes to additional needs, we can be sure the vast majority of children coming to Ireland will have suffered a fairly severe trauma.  Some of the impacts of that may take time to play out and it may take time before these children feel they are in a position to articulate that trauma.  Are we looking at the budget for additional counsellors within schools, or additional therapeutic supports or anything like that?  It is not just about the child.  Schools themselves may not have the skills to help or be able to respond to a child's needs in a trauma-informed way.  That can be very challenging.</p> <p>  I can see where we are at with the numbers but at some stage in the midst of this, the Taoiseach talked about potentially 200,000 Ukrainians, or at least in excess of 100,000, coming here.  It is probably not possible to have a picture in the long term but what has the pattern been for the past month or two?  Is there any way of having a projection of the capacity that will be needed within the next 12 months?  Is that possible at all?</p> <p>  I will briefly pick up on a point Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made on the case of the children in the northside of Dublin who ended up being brought down to Youghal.  In addition to all the points made about settling in, a practical consideration is that some of those children had bought a uniform and so on.  It might be worth putting out the message that for a while, until there is a clearer picture about where these children will end up, there should be flexibility regarding things such as uniform.</p> <p>  I will make a specific point about secondary schools.  Ukrainian children who are coming towards the end of secondary school are in a very challenging place because the learning is of a much higher order.  Even the English language support would generally be of a different nature, because people who might require additional support would usually have some, whereas some of these Ukrainian children might have none at all.  Are some of them being integrated remotely with Ukrainian education?  What way can they be supported?  Is it worth those children sitting the leaving certificate or should they be sitting Ukrainian exams?  I have no answers to that myself; I am just asking the question.</p> <p>  The Minister engaged previously with the Ukrainian Minister of Education and Science, Serhiy Shkarlet.  I engaged with him myself during an online event.  One of the matters I brought up with him was that if there are Ukrainian teachers here, one of the challenges may be Garda vetting.  I ask for an update on how that is going.  Even with the best will in the world, I am sure the Ukrainian police are under very severe pressure, as is the rest of civil society. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1022" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#G00700"><p>On future projected numbers, I reiterate we are clear of our capacity in having a potential 25,000 places at primary school and 20,000 at post-primary.  REALT, which has been an invaluable resource to us, and I acknowledge the work of the 16 ETBs in leading that, is liaising very closely with the planning and building unit to manage our projected enrolments.  References were made to families still coming over the summer.  REALT will have access to the capacity limits and otherwise that are available to the planning and building unit.  That will be a useful resource for them as we source places for students as they arrive over the summer to be ready for September.</p> <p>  In respect of the children and young people who come with particular traumatic experiences, to be fair, and I have met many of the students, it is very difficult, especially with the younger ones, to know exactly what they have seen and what their little minds are processing.  I acknowledge the work of our National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists on the ground.  Significant work is being done by NEPS on programmes for schools and webinars, in particular its great emphasis on a psychosocial response in our schools.  Ensuring that the school environment for children and young people is safe and calm, and a place of connectedness for them, is a point consistently raised with me.</p><p>I want to acknowledge that work and any additional supports, and that is not just the supports from a NEPS point of view but across the board.  The Department has not been found wanting in making those supports available.  In terms of the leaving certificate, the Deputy raised a very good point that many of the students who come here are probably in the upper senior cycle.  I want to acknowledge that some of them - just over a 1,000 of them - continue to engage with the online Ukrainian system of education.  Again, I want to salute the schools that have made this possible for those who want to do it.  Many others are very happy to move into different year groups.  The inspectorate is working very closely with the schools in helping them to identify what year groups at the senior level, as raised by the Deputy, are appropriate to the students.</p></speech>

The Ukrainian equivalent of our leaving certificate, the matura, has been cancelled this year. It is not running.  It did not run last year or the previous year either because of Covid.  The students were given a type of school completion certificate, or a version of that.  They recently confirmed this is their intention this year as well.  I want to acknowledge again that we are very happy to work with students in terms of meeting their needs, whatever they are.</p></speech>

I wish to note my frustration that we are having a truncated meeting of 45 minutes.  I pushed for this session.  We are talking about an issue that affects 6,000 children and, by extension, our entire school community.  I do not think 45 minutes is enough to cover the huge number of questions I have.</p> <p>  I thank the Ministers for their presentations and for passing along the briefing notes.  They raise a large number of questions for me.  The Russians invaded Ukraine on 24 February, so we are approaching 100 days since that happened.  I said from the start that we would have to think about how we were going to approach this to try to ensure we got the best educational outcomes for the children we knew were going to arrive on our shores.  I cannot help but feel we have just defaulted to folding them into our regular school community.  If we had considered all factors and decided that was the best approach, that would be fine.  I am not sure I see the evidence of considering all of the factors.  I accept as in Maslow's hierarchy of needs that we needed to get these children accommodated.  We needed to make them feel safe and secure within our schools but I think we need to be thinking beyond that as well.</p> <p>  I note in the briefing note that even when we talk about curriculum, it states explicitly that in the immediate term that we are focusing on ensuring that school places can be secured for students from Ukraine and that in the medium to longer term, the Department is seeking advice from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment regarding the model of curriculum provision.  We are still not at the point where we are considering specific curricular needs.  That is going to be complex in terms of planning because the children are going to present as complex in the first place.  Obviously, they are coming from a very different cultural and social background but also they are arriving with very complex emotional needs which will have been caused by their trauma.  We also need to be thinking about how long these children are going to be staying with us and making educational decisions around that.</p> <p>  I will begin with some questions because I have a large number of questions.  There are organisations that have experience in planning for the educational needs of displaced people.  UNICEF would be one of the organisations that jumps out in the first instance.  Have we engaged with it?  Have we spoken to people who have expertise and experience in these contexts?  It will not be the exact same context because an Irish primary school is a million miles removed from a Syrian displaced persons camp, for example.  Surely there are lessons to be learned from that.</p> <p>  If we have engaged with the Ukrainian education minister, what is it we have learned in terms of what they are hoping for in education not just here in Ireland but across Europe?  My third question is on whether we have engaged with education ministers across Europe.  Many of these people will arrive first in Poland or Moldova and will then arrive in Ireland and will remain mobile, as has been mentioned, even within our school communities.  They may arrive into Dublin or Waterford.  Tramore is a good example.  Many people were accommodated there first.  The schools have done an outstanding job in terms of folding them into the school community but how long with they be in Tramore?  We do not know.  Have we given any consideration to trying to standardise a curriculum?</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to school uniforms.  What about school books?  As they move from one school to another, are they going to be accommodated?  How many of these children who finished school in Tramore, Youghal, Dublin or wherever in June, will be in that same school in September?  Are we modelling for that?  I have probably 1 million more questions but I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

We are also looking at what is happening in other jurisdictions.  We already have considerable experience ourselves of dealing with students coming from different educational backgrounds and systems, albeit not at the level we are dealing with at present.  We do have our own unique experience in that respect.</p> <p>  We are co-ordinating with the Ukrainian authorities to provide online access for students who wish to avail of schooling in Ukrainian.  Many of them wish to engage in the Irish education system as well.  We have, at this point, more than 1,000 students who have availed of the online facilities and I want to acknowledge that our schools have made that possible.  There is also the role of our inspectorate who work with the schools on the ground to ensure that the students are placed in the level that is appropriate to their needs.  Equally, we have put huge resources into supporting students whose level of access in terms of language might not be what is required.  More than 900 schools have been granted additional posts or additional hours, including English as an Additional Language, EAL, tutors, support teachers, and English to Speakers of Other Languages, ESOL, tutors.  We also have the Say Yes to Languages programme at primary level where students would make themselves available to learn Ukrainian as a measure to integrate the students.  </p></speech>

The Minister said some Ukrainian students are availing of a school completion certificate while they are here.  Where does that put them in terms of access to third level education?  On summer provision, it has been difficult to find people to work at summer provision.  Are we providing something specific around the needs of Ukrainian students?  Are we designing a curriculum for it and are we confident that we can staff it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1042" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#L00500"><p>As I said, we have engaged with the Ukrainian department of education.  The Ukrainian mature exam, which is the equivalent of our leaving certificate, was cancelled this year and in the previous two years because of Covid and students are getting a certificate of completion.  In terms of third level, there is an online university entrance exam and, as I understand it, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is engaging with the Ukrainian department of education on making provision for students in that regard.</p> <p>  I have forgotten the Deputy's second question-----</p></speech>

Are we designing an English as second language curriculum?  Obviously that could be activity based but are we designing it as a curriculum that people can follow and are we confident we can staff it?</p></speech>

There is an inclusion programme at primary level and at post-primary level for mainstream pupils with complex needs and those at greatest risk of disadvantage and that would include children from Ukraine.  As I said earlier, for children who are coming here, particularly younger children, an activity-based approach to learning the language is better than more intensive instruction, which would be done at a later age.  There is already support available for migrant children and that has been integrated into the summer programme.  By the time the summer provision is over we should have a fair idea as to how many Ukrainian children have participated in it.  At the moment, they are in the process of enrolling and registering to do it.</p> <p>  There will be qualified teachers graduating this summer who should be able to help in terms of trying to get the participation up and making sure that we have enough staff.  Undergraduate students who have registered with the Teaching Council should also be able to support summer provision.</p></speech>

Rather than responsibility for summer provision being undertaken by school principals, there will now be an overseer role as well, which means another individual can take responsibility for it.  There will be, for the first time, an online payment made available for staff working on the summer provision programme.  Our absolute aim, as the Minister of State has said, is that the maximum number of children and young people are facilitated to avail of the programme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1047" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#L01000"><p>I welcome the Minister, Minister of State and officials from the Department of Education and thank them for their time.</p> <p>  Obviously the students coming here from Ukraine have endured a lot of trauma, upset and stress.  I very much welcome what the Minister and Minister of State said about the importance of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, teams and the educational psychologists that are there to support these children.  As the Minister noted in her opening statement, more than 30,000 people have come here from Ukraine, including more than 6,000 children.  As I understand it, there are approximately 4,000 Ukrainian children in primary school and the remainder are in secondary school.  </p> <p>  The Regional Education and Language Teams, REALTs, are important in terms of securing school places.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to comment on whether there have been challenges in that regard.  An update provided on 13 May by way of a press release from the Department shows that in my area of Roscommon and Galway, there were 208 children at primary school and 94 at post primary in the Galway area, while Roscommon had lower numbers, with 64 at primary school and just nine at secondary level.  Have there been challenges around school capacity?  I am very aware of schools in my area where there would be challenges, particularly in some urban settings.  How is it working in the more rural schools?</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that the NCSE personnel are a crucial part of the teams that are being rolled out from the ETBs.  How is that working from the perspective of the Special Education Needs Organisers, SENOs, and the NCSE?  Have there been any challenges in accessing places?   I am very appreciative of the fact that St. Teresa's Special School in Ballinasloe got funding for additional accommodation.  How do we ensure we have adequate capacity? </p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned educational welfare services, working with the HSE disability services and English language supports, which are absolutely crucial.  We are focusing here on children who are under 18 but I have a query based on meeting a lot of Ukrainian families who have been living here for decades and whose grandparents are now coming here.  They are bringing their older family members here from Ukraine.  Is there any English language support or training through ESOL tutors being offered through the ETBs to them?  I accept that this is a little outside the remit of the Department and the primary and post-primary sectors.  </p> <p>  I have one other question for the Minister relating to senior cycle students and career guidance teachers.  A lot of support is being provided to schools through the REALTs to help students but what about the career guidance teachers and the options for Ukrainian senior level students?  Of particular interest is the Further Education and Training Course Hub, FETCH, whereby students can attend local ETBs and do not have to travel, which keeps costs low for students.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1048" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#M00100"><p>I thank Senator Dolan.  In reference to the two points she raised, the REALTs have been an invaluable source for working through and finding pathways forward for us in this current situation.  I acknowledge their effectiveness and the manner in which they are operating.  There are 16 REALTS operating out of the ETBs, with a variety of supports, whether it is NEPS or the linking in with community response or whatever else.  The idea is to make access to school places as seamless as possible for children and families.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the challenges.  Capacity is always a forefront challenge in terms of finding suitable places for the students but I acknowledge that the schools have met those challenges.  It has been a priority for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to find the accommodation.  We know we have specific capacity in certain areas but the REALT has the ability to look at all schools within an area.  While there may not be capacity in one or two schools, there could be capacity in a third or fourth school and the REALT will make the necessary provision in terms of transport or whatever access is required for pupils to get to school.  This has been an invaluable opportunity for us to make it as seamless as possible for the schools and especially the families concerned.</p> <p>  On English language supports for adults, as the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, said, we are placing particular emphasis on language supports in schools, whether EAL or ESOL, which is made available to the post-primary children.  ESOL will also be made available to families, particularly adults, and those opportunities will be available in the summer months.  There is capacity in ESOL but online recruitment is under way for additional tutors to take up positions.  It will be beneficial to families that they will be almost like a community response to English language access.</p></speech>

If we take the average that 1% of children require special classes and a further 1% need to go to special schools, we will have approximately 60 children in each category.  As I stated, we only have seven or eight Ukrainian children in special classes and special schools because we are not assessing them at this time.  The advice is not to assess children when they are coming from war-torn countries but to take the psychological first-aid approach first.  NEPS is there to support and as the enrolments proceed over the summer, we will get a better idea of how many children we have.  I expect that those with extremely complex issues tend to stay closer to Ukraine because of travel difficulties.  We do not have a large number with disabilities or complex needs in the country.</p></speech>

I thank all of those who have put in place so many positive systems to ensure that Ukrainian students at this time of major trauma have welcome places in schools.  I thank in particular school principals and teachers and, of course, the other children in the classes who have made our guests welcome.</p> <p>  I will ask about some particular areas, one of which is the summer programme as there has been comment and queries on it.  I welcome the extra funding and support for the programme and the decision to provide special capacity for those who have been displaced.  Having spoken to teachers and SNAs, I have a concern about the uptake of professionals to be able to roll out the programme.  While it is welcome that the principal does not have to be present, the fact that there has to be a named teacher from each school can be a problem.  I understand from SNAs that payment for last year's programme was not made until January of this year.  There seems to be a reluctance to take up those positions again.  We need to get that right.</p> <p>  The home-school liaison scheme is one of the best programmes in the education system.  It has provided substantial support to families and children.  Has consideration been given to providing extra home-school liaison teachers to schools with high numbers of Ukrainians?  I am thinking of the trauma the children and their parents - it is mainly the mums who are here - have gone through.  The connection with the school and community the home-school liaison programme provides is very important.</p> <p>  While most schools have co-operated and tried to ensure that children have places, we are aware of schools that do not have places.  I know of a small number of Ukrainian families who have not secured a school place in the community in which they have been placed.  I am speaking specifically of Newbridge.  The closest school available is in Halverstown.  That has been suggested but transport has not been put in place.  The young boy in question has been in Ireland for two months now and has not had an opportunity to access education, which concerns me.  We need to ensure school transport is in place, particularly in September when the new school year starts.</p> <p>  On plans to support intensive English language learning, we do not know how long the students will be here, although we all hope the war will end soon.  There will be a need to rebuild Ukraine.  What plans are in place to provide for examinations in Ukrainian and offer intensive English language teaching, particularly for older students who are taking their other subjects through English?</p> <p>  The Minister stated that 49 people had registered with the Teaching Council.  I appreciate that vetting and so on are a difficulty.  I am aware of three teachers from Ukraine who applied some time ago and have still not heard whether they will be accepted and can start teaching.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1054" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#M00900"><p>On the summer provision, Senator O'Loughlin mentioned an issue with payment.  There will be an online claims system for schools to submit payment details for those staff taking part in the school-based summer programme.  That should provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.</p> <p>  It is important to stress when we are talking about this year's summer provision that extensive consultation was done last year through the inspectorate with advocacy groups and education stakeholders.  We introduced a number of measures to encourage schools to participate.  All 4,000 schools can participate.  I hope the double pay for staff will be an incentive.  We appreciate, of course, that staff have been under considerable stress with Covid, and are now dealing with Ukrainian children coming into schools.  We have tried to listen to any concerns that staff had previously and reflect those in the new measures.  As the Minister indicated, there is an overseer, better preparation times and faster payments for staff.  We eased the administrative burden on schools and given greater guidance materials.  There is flexibility regarding when schools run the programme, giving them autonomy in that regard.  We have also provided for the recruitment of final-year students who are graduating this summer, undergraduates and newly-qualified teachers.  We hope that will help as well.</p><p>That centralised application process should make a difference.  Schools may engage substitute staff and special needs assistants from another school if they are not available in their own school.  I hope those measures will make a difference.  For Ukrainian children in particular, there is a real opportunity to integrate and have those sort of arts-based activities for well-being, as well as music and drama for language development.  It will go a long way in helping them to integrate properly in our schools system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1056" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#N00200"><p>As we have already said, considerable resources have been put in place in schools for intensive English as an additional language, EAL.  More than 918 of our schools have applied for additional resources there either in terms of EAL hours or additional teaching hours.  As I referenced, we have the English to speakers of other languages, ESOL, tutors coming on stream, specifically working with senior cycle and post-primary students and wider families.  We also have initiatives like the "Say Yes to Languages" programme in our schools, which again will support communication among children and young people.</p> <p>  On the specific point around registration, we have had 48 or 49 who have applied to be registered from a teaching perspective.  It is worth noting that some of those applications have been general rather than specific to an area where they might have a qualification.  That demands another investigation by the Teaching Council as to what area they might be best suited to.  There is a body of work to be done, as well as reference vetting and all of that.  It is absolutely the objective and the intention that this would be streamlined as quickly as possible.  This would be a rich addition to our schools and we are determined to do it.  We must ensure as well that the accreditation would be for the area and appropriate.</p> <p>  There was a specific question on transport and school accommodation being made available.  As the committee has already referenced, we have more than 6,000 students and by the time the next numbers come out, we will probably have in excess of those 6,000 students placed in our schools.  For a variety of reasons, students present at different times.  Some, on arrival, immediately want to go into a school setting and for other reasons, others may wish to take some time, as is absolutely appropriate.  Every child's needs must be individualised.  I am not sure of the circumstances referenced by the Senator but it is quite an achievement by the schools and regional education and language teams, REALTs, to ensure we have more than 6,000 students placed.  There is also an absolute determination from the Department that where accommodation is required in terms of school transport, it is provided, whether that is on a bus route or another route to get them to school.  That is the first time the matter has been raised with me and I am interested if the Senator wishes to share the detail.  There has been a general acceptance that there has been an excellent job on the ground by the schools and REALTs.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has dealt with the question of summer provision very well, including the aspects and consultation we have had to ensure it is more appealing for people to become involved in administration or working through it.  We will continue that engagement going forward and where there are opportunities to reimagine it or do it differently, both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are totally committed to doing it.  Our singular and sole objective is to ensure the maximum number of children get the opportunity to avail of summer provision.  We are very appreciative of the schools and staff currently in a position to do it but maybe there could be opportunities for others if we did things differently or in other ways.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I will continue to engage on that as well.</p></speech>

This is a broadly positive conversation about provision for Ukrainian children and I acknowledge the flexibility that the Department has shown on the back of a very difficult period with Covid-19 and facing into another difficult period in accommodating children from Ukraine.  The Minister and Minister of State should be commended on the work they have done, along with school communities, teachers and principals who have worked in every corner of the country.</p> <p>  My question has been answered, somewhat, in that it concerns the integration aims that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, touched on with the REALTs.  At this stage of the discussion, there could be more very specific questions, notwithstanding the reference by the Minister, Deputy Foley, to the period where some children may need to adjust to our life in Ireland before attending school.  Is the Department aware of any children not attending school after a certain period has elapsed?  Is there a mechanism to ensure students are either participating in Ukrainian online schooling or in an Irish classroom?</p> <p>  The measures announced by the Government very recently regarding Citywest poses a question.  If we put that many Ukrainian families into such a large facility, with over 700 rooms, will it put too much pressure on schools in that community?  Related to Senator O'Loughlin's question and the response of the Minister, Deputy Foley, is the question of whether we are confident in the transport systems in place for those children to be bussed to the school to which they have been allocated or which they have selected, depending on availability?  Ensuring the children have seamless access to education is critical.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the number of students in Ireland accessing online learning.  Do we have a breakdown of that for primary and secondary levels?  Is it concentrated in the students' equivalent of the leaving certificate.  I note the Minister mentioned that it was suspended.  Do we have any Ukrainian students in sixth year in the Irish education system and are they going to be sitting the leaving certificate?  What mechanisms have we in place for those students?  I apologise if I missed an answer to this in prior questioning.</p></speech>

These could include those aged 18 or so and moved to some other type of education experience or work.  Their education might be finished.</p> <p>  I referenced students presenting for exams earlier and the facility is being made available for students who wish to follow the Ukrainian education curriculum.  It is interesting to note that although many choose to do that, they also choose to avail of part of the Irish system as well.  There are three students who will present for the leaving certificate exam and two who will present for the junior cycle exam.  That is my current understanding.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Citywest.</p></speech>

We are working very closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this, as I mentioned.  There is a clarity from our perspective about where we have clear capacity.  It is totally understandable that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has a priority for the families to have accommodation.  It is our hope and expectation that as things settle, there will be a greater opportunity for the accommodation needs to match the capacity we have in education.  In the short term, our schools are operating magnificently on the ground and rising to the challenge where there may be a greater concentration of families at any given time.</p><p>Perhaps there is an opportunity for that to be more streamlined.</p><p> Some 1,000 students are availing of the Ukrainian online learning.</p></speech>

I do not have the full breakdown.  As I said, it is interesting to note that they are availing of both, including online.

I will go through my statement because there is information within it that I want to share with colleagues.  I will go through it quickly if that is okay with the Chairman.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for having me and my officials here today.  Like the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and their officials, we are working tirelessly to enact the view of the Irish people and that of the Government to the effect that we must, and we will, be unequivocal in welcoming people fleeing Ukraine.  It is our collective determination to deliver on our obligations to support access to education, social income and accommodation.  Of course this is challenging.  There are no two ways about it, but we are legally obliged to respond and, more importantly, we are morally required to do the right thing.</p> <p>  I am very proud to see that this approach is widely reflected throughout our society and in the education sector.  I am also pleased to say that we remain united with our fellow European Union member states in our condemnation of and revulsion at Putin&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.  On 18 March, alongside our European partners, I signed a statement on behalf of Ireland condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine.  The key aim of this statement was to signal support for higher education students and staff in Ukraine and to suspend Russia&rsquo;s rights of representation on all structures and activities of the European higher education area.</p> <p>  In March, I asked Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, who has responsibility for innovation, research, culture, education and youth to convene a special Education Council meeting in order that we might adopt a common approach and response across all member states on the continuance of access to education.  I am very glad this meeting took place.  We had a very useful discussion, and it allowed for a clear and united message to be sent to Russia that EU member states are united in their stance on Russia&rsquo;s illegal, immoral and unjustified war.  The Ukrainian Minister also took part in that meeting.  The picture of destruction of education infrastructure in Ukraine provides a further imperative for me and for us to respond as generously as possible to the plight of Ukrainian students now residing in Ireland.</p> <p>  Sadly, the numbers fleeing the destruction and violence visited on their homeland continue to grow, and facilitating the significant numbers of people arriving is challenging, not least for the education sector.  I would like to put on record with this committee my appreciation for all working in the sector and working with us to address these challenges throughout the period.  The Irish higher education sector has been open and generous in its response to the crisis.  The sector has worked constructively with my Department to facilitate the further studies of those arriving from Ukraine.</p> <p>  In line with the European Council decision of 4 March, the Government has committed to ensuring access to the labour market and to the education system to qualified persons on the same basis as citizens of Ireland.  My officials have written to the Irish University Association, IUA, and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, confirming that qualified persons, people from Ukraine residing here, should be treated as Irish students - not international students - in terms of fees.</p> <p>  Furthermore, my officials are examining how these students may be further supported, including financially, to facilitate their continuing education in Ireland.  I plan to bring a memorandum to Government to agree additional supports for Ukrainian students within the next few weeks.  I am happy to share some initial proposals with colleagues and this will confirm that Ukrainian students will not pay international fees.  We will also provide student supports, which will be equal to the SUSI grant scheme.  This memorandum to Government will also ensure that displaced Ukrainians living in Ireland can access our post-leaving certificate courses for free.  Crucially, additional funds will be made available for mental health services in order to ensure that  adequate services are available to Ukrainian students.  This memorandum will be considered by Government shortly and I will then be happy to share more details with the committee.</p> <p>  Colleagues may also know that we have tried to co-ordinate the response across the higher education sector.  We have established a national student and researcher helpdesk for Ukrainian students, researchers and higher education staff.  This has been operational since last month.  It is hosted in Maynooth University, and I thank the university for that.  It involves all universities and higher education institutions across the State.  They have seconded individuals from admissions offices, career guidance support and other areas.  It is now a single point of contact for all displaced students who are seeking access to higher education.  This will guide applicants through the documentation required to support their continued access to higher education, and the helpdesk will then be able to direct students to a local college equipped to meet their individual educational needs.</p> <p>  In agreeing to fund this helpdesk, I am aware that it is very well staffed by admissions and research advisers, who are the best-placed people to give advice to students and researchers.  I am happy to tell the committee that since its establishment, the helpdesk has dealt with more than 500 queries.  This number is expected to grow over the summer months.  I would encourage colleagues here - and anyone watching these proceedings - who receive calls or emails from students looking for assistance to direct them to the national helpdesk.  This is where they will be able to meet with the experts who will be able to look at the individual circumstances and guide them on what is best in the context of the continuation of their education.</p> <p>  I will be honest with the committee and state that one of the biggest challenges we are facing in my Department is the issue of English language supports.  English language supports are, obviously, essential to people arriving from Ukraine.  The 16 ETBs are offering ESOL courses right across the country in response to demand presenting locally.  I am happy to share with this committee details of each ETB contact person.  Again, there is a specific contact point within each ETB for the provision of English language courses.  Ukrainians wishing to learn English or to improve their English, can contact their local ETB for an assessment of their English language competency in reading, writing, speaking and listening.  The ETBs will identify appropriate language and additional learning supports.  Of course, this service is free of charge.  In some ETBs such as in Kerry, Limerick and Clare, ESOL provision is delivered on an outreach basis in the centres and in the accommodation facilities where Ukrainians are living.  This has the benefit of enabling their participation around childcare in a familiar setting but also has the function of providing information and orientation, not only in terms of their education and training options but also in accessing local services.</p> <p>  The ETBs are also exploring the possibility of continuing professional development courses over the summer months to upskill or retrain Ukrainian teachers to provide tutoring services.  I saw this work very well in Clare recently where a Ukrainian teacher is now upskilled to teach English to other Ukrainian people.  They are also reviewing the possible use of e-college for this provision.  Following a survey of ETB staff, Education and Training Boards Ireland ran a webinar on the topic of psychological first aid.  This is important.  We must remember that these staff are dealing with people who have fed from a war zone and with people who may be presenting with trauma.</p> <p>  We need to make sure that we continue to beef up the provision of English language support.  I am being honest with the committee - and it is important that we are honest here - that when I go around the country I hear a variation in the intensity of English language supports.  It is provided everywhere and is provided in every ETB.  We are in the business of now trying to recruit and train more people so that adults in particular can get that intense level of English language they may require.</p><p>I have met some Ukrainians who are very grateful for the English language training being provided but who tell me they could do with more classes more regularly.  We are working through that.  As colleagues will know, the level of English language competency required to participate in higher education is different from that provided by the ETBs.  With that in mind, a working group comprising representatives from the higher education sector has been established to support the acquisition of English language competency for academic purposes.  Proposals designed to support Ukrainian students for the coming academic year will be submitted to my Department imminently.<br/><br/>Many people ask me what is to happen in the case of Ukrainian students who have not yet accessed higher education.  I refer here to the equivalent of our leaving certificate students.  These students have not done a leaving certificate or the Ukrainian equivalent.  It has always been clear to me that Ukraine is very keen to maintain its connection with its student population.  The Ukrainian Minister has made that clear to me and to my European counterparts.  To help maintain this link, Ireland has committed to hosting sessions of this year&rsquo;s Ukrainian higher education entrance examinations.  I am pleased to inform the committee of this.  It is quite a significant development.  There will be three exams.  There will be one exam for entrance into higher education, the national multi-subject test, and two entrance exams for master's level: the master's test for educational competence for admission into master&rsquo;s degrees and the master&rsquo;s comprehensive test for admission into a speciality subject.  The examinations will be taken online in a dedicated testing centre and my officials are working with the IUA and THEA to source the necessary staff, testing centres and equipment.  As of 30 May, only a few days ago, my Department has been made aware of 229 students who wish to take the undergraduate test<b></b>in July.<br/><br/>There is an ongoing commitment to provide every support possible for Ukrainian citizens who are seeking the recognition of their qualifications.  As I am sure is also the case for colleagues, I meet many people from Ukraine who are living in Ireland and who are very keen to work.  They want to get back working.  Many of them are highly skilled and highly qualified.  My Department is responsible for the implementation of the EU directive on professional qualifications and, in that regard, we provide critical support to the work of the appropriate competent authorities by sharing best practice material supplied by the European Commission.  This includes working with and supporting these authorities as they implement the recently published Commission recommendation on the recognition of qualifications for people fleeing Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.  <br/><br/>Where professions are regulated, such as the professions of doctor, nurse and teacher, the decision to recognise qualifications rests with the relevant national independent regulator or competent authority.  For example, if a person wishes to practise as a doctor, he or she will need to engage with the Medical Council, while those wishing to practise as nurses will need to engage with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  Ireland has more than 45 such authorities covering a very wide range of professions from surgeons to security door personnel.  Many of these authorities have already reached out to engage with the Ukrainian community and have published dedicated material on their websites to support Ukrainians.  My Department is continuing to work with our national competent authorities, their parent Departments, the European Commission and other member states on this issue.  Through the National Academic Recognition Information Centre, NARIC, Ireland, a service hosted and operated by QQI, advice can be readily obtained on the academic recognition of foreign qualifications.  I direct colleagues to that service, which is free of charge, fully online and available in a wide range of languages spoken by Ukrainians.  I am very pleased to say that, in addition, SOLAS has scheduled the first of two Ukrainian language Safe Pass programmes with an approved Ukrainian interpreter used to help with delivery.  Fourteen people from Ukraine have been granted the Safe Pass to date.  As members will know, the pass is required for people who wish to work on a construction site.  We have made sure that training is provided in a wide range of languages used by people from Ukraine.<br/><br/>I will also update the committee on another matter, which I am sure we will get into during questions.  We are working to ensure that Irish students who were studying in Ukraine can continue their studies here.  Approximately 60 Irish medical and dental students were forced to abandon their studies.  In the interests of time, perhaps we can come back to that through members' questions rather than dealing with it now.<br/><br/>As the Chair will know, we are also working on making student accommodation available on a short-term basis during the summer period.  It is not a long-term solution nor can it be but it may provide a little bit of breathing space as our housing authorities and local authorities work to put longer-term arrangements in place.</p></speech>

He was very comprehensive in his account of the services and supports available to Ukrainian students.  I was somewhat heartened to hear about the mental health supports he has announced, although the details are yet to be agreed.  In particular, the psychological supports he very briefly referenced will be key to ensuring that students from Ukraine have the opportunity to complete their studies.</p> <p>  The Minister referenced online learning with regard to entrance examinations for third level for Ukrainian students in Ireland.  It is fantastic to know that the Ukrainian authorities are in a position to facilitate that.  Will there be academic supports available for those students in Ireland?  Online learning is obviously one component.  Will academic supports be made available to students who are continuing their studies online, perhaps through the ETB supports the Minister mentioned?</p> <p>  The Minister touched on transport needs.  Perhaps he might like to provide a little more information.  What supports are being provided for students who are accommodated in a facility in or around a major city while attending a university or third level institution and by what means?  The Minister has not actually provided the number of third level students.  He might do so.  Are there already students enrolled or is that something we can expect in September and thereafter?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the assistance with student accommodation.  If these students are being treated like Irish students and their families are being accommodated in hotels or reception facilities, they will clearly need transport or student accommodation.  Will the Minister drill into that a wee bit?</p> <p>  My final point is on the recognition of qualifications and what I would refer to as language support or additional support in the classroom at primary and secondary level, although that might not be the right term at third level.  The Minister referenced the importance of English language training and additional modules of education for those wishing to enter the Irish workforce.  Is it the intention of the Department or the universities and third level institutions to absorb academic teachers and third level lecturers into the third level system to support students?  There are 6,000 primary and secondary students.  I believe 1,500 are secondary students.  I did not quite catch the total number but I believe three are doing the leaving certificate.  It is absolutely amazing that they would do that after only a few weeks in Ireland.  What will happen to them and what supports will be made available if they enter third level education given the precarious or temporary nature of their accommodation?  Will the Minister respond to those questions?</p></speech>

We have to recognise that every student is going to be in a different scenario.  That is the beauty - if I can call it that - of this national line and contact point.  Students can come in have a conversation, say that they were a third-year engineering student, to take a random example, and ask where they fit in the education system, what their options are and what are the local colleges.  Crucially, they may want to continue their link with their Ukrainian university online but use a given university's library and attend some tutorials or lectures there.  We are very much in the business of facilitating that.  At the start, Ukrainian students and ourselves, when we got individual queries, would have to navigate the higher education system and go to the local university.  We are now trying to put in place a bespoke plan for each individual student as to what is best for him or her.  It is more straightforward with some programmes than with others.  Where people are with their medical studies in Ukraine may be very different from where medical students would be at the same stage in Ireland.  We are very eager to provide any support for Ukrainian students, including those who are learning online.  They may wish to become full-time students in an Irish university, and that is no problem.  They may wish to continue to study with their Ukrainian universities but to access some lectures, tutorials or facilities.  That is also facilitated.</p> <p>  With regard to transport and accommodation needs, what we might generally call financial needs and supports, without getting ahead of the Government decision, I will say that I have been working very intensely at a European level with my colleague, Mr. Ian McKenna here, to try to use the Erasmus scheme to support students because it provides at least the SUSI level of support.</p><p>I will not get ahead of the Government decision, but I have been working intensely at European level, with my colleague Mr. McKenna, to try to use the Erasmus scheme to support students because it provides at least the SUSI level of support.  If we can register all Ukrainian students at whatever level they are at, be it postgraduate or undergraduate, as Erasmus students, not only here in Ireland but throughout the European Union, we can actually provide them with a significant level of support through that initiative.  I commend Commissioner Gabriel on her work on that.</p><p> I will share with the committee some figures I received before coming to this meeting.  The national student and researcher helpline has received 535 unique inquiries so far.  I will provide a breakdown of where each student is at in his or her studies.  Some 266 of them are undergraduates, 40 are postgraduates and 25 are researchers.  I can also provide a geographical breakdown of where those queries are coming from.</p><p> I should have said that staff are included in the same way as students.  The beauty of the Erasmus programme is that it is for staff and students.  It is our intention to provide opportunities for any higher education member of staff from Ukraine who is in Ireland to work in our institutions.  Ukrainian teachers working at primary or secondary level, as was referenced, could really benefit.  I think we will see the same there.  They can also register under the Erasmus scheme for staff.  I will pick up the recognition of qualifications in the next round.</p></speech>

My first question may lie outside the Department's remit.  The Minister said there are 64 full-time Ukrainian students in Ireland and 229 applying for this undergraduate test.  However, the figures opening the Minister's briefing document suggest approximately 3,000 Ukrainian people.  I am accounting for 300 people participating in third level education, which would only be approximately 10% of the 3,000 figure.  Do we know what the remaining 90% are doing?  Are they in the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS?</p> <p>  It strikes me that the English language skills training course is an extremely valuable capacity to build within the ETB sector.  Is that available to non-Ukrainians, as well as Ukrainians?  I know there has been an uptake in IPAS applications, as people arrive in from Ukraine.  One will always have people who are English language learners.  I know from being a language learner and a language teacher that when trying to learn a second language, it is better to be in a mixed language background.  Two Ukrainians sitting beside each other in a language setting will tend to speak Ukrainian to one another rather than English, as they are supposed to do.</p> <p>  What the Minister said about the Erasmus scheme was very interesting.  It answered a question that I have about how we would fund people coming into third level.  There was also reference to the MSCA4Ukraine funding, which is a &euro;25 million direct-aid package as part of the EU response.  Will the Minister tell me how that will work?  It sounds very promising.</p></speech>

It will be done through the Irish Universities Association.  I will get Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh more detail on that.  My best answer on the difference in the figures, about which the Deputy is right, is that the larger figure is the number of people who we know fall within an age group that may well be in third level education or likely to access it.  That compares and contrasts with the number who have come forward so far.  This is a world of anecdote but I have been in many parts of the country recently and have been talking to people from Ukraine.  For many people who have fled a war zone, the priorities are shelter, food, family and safety.  Only as people begin to settle more in our country will they begin think about what is next.  That is why I indicated in my opening statement that I expect the number to grow and for that to converge more in the weeks and months ahead, especially over the summer period, as we begin the new academic year.  We are certainly seeing the number of calls to the central point tick up in a way that suggests that is probably the case.</p> <p>  With regard to the English language, anyone who arrives here through section 60 is covered.  There is a broader point, which is not for today because I will not have time to answer, about some of the very good things we are doing in welcoming to our country people who have fled war zones.  Perhaps we can learn from that more broadly.  I am thinking of people from Afghanistan as an example.  I met a very good organisation today called Open Door.  It works with people from marginalised groups, beyond just displaced people from Ukraine.  There are lessons we can learn more broadly.</p> <p>  Does Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh want to come back in?</p></speech>

I certainly welcome the fact the Erasmus system will be used.  Do we have an indication of the figure?  Did we get &euro;27 million for Erasmus last year?  That has been committed to.  That means there will not be any cost to the Exchequer for third level grants.  It would purely come from Erasmus.  Is that paid the same way as Erasmus, with 80% being paid upfront?</p><p>Could the Minister speak to that point, which I think is important?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1093" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022060100002#R00200"><p>Yes, it is an important point.  It will be paid for in the same way that an Erasmus+ student is paid.  They will be Erasmus+ students for all intents and purposes.  Support is paid for through the Erasmus+ office in any given higher education instruction.  We have to update the Government and subject to the Government decision, we will make this information available through the helpline.  I want students to know - and I want public representatives to know for their for own work - that any Ukrainian student at any level in higher education, undergraduate or postgraduate, will qualify to be registered as an Erasmus+ student.  That position is not unique to Ireland.  It is a good proposal and it has been agreed at a European level.  The funding will come through the Erasmus+ programme.  We have been asked through the European Commissioner that the money that was due to have been spent later in the programme, in 2027 or so, will be front-loaded to earlier.  I think that is sensible.  That is how it will be funded, so that it does not place an additional financial strain.</p> <p>  If this information is of use to the Deputy, it just so happens that the Erasmus+ payment is almost identical, if not slightly higher, than that of a SUSI payment.  It is therefore quite a good fit.  It also shows European solidarity, which is important.  </p></speech>

It sends out a clear message and it is the right thing.  I very much welcome that.</p> <p>  In terms of the anticipated demand, we spoke about how 229 students were to take the undergraduate test.  Have we any idea at this stage about the total demand for place, and on which courses the students will be demanding places?  What provision have we made for the extra courses that they will be demanding?  Can the Minister indicate the type of courses in which they have expressed an interest so far?</p></speech>

I can give the Deputy a note on this.  The first answer is, to be very honest, that we do not, nor could we, have a full sense of the total demand.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh got to the heart of that.  We know that more than 3,000 of these people are within the age group that might be considered the typical college-going age.  However, only a fraction of that number so far has even contacted the helpline.  Therefore, we do not know the full demand.  We do not know what will happen in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <p>  We do know, as the Deputy has said, that over 200 students have said that they want to sit what I am calling the matriculation exam.  We know from the queries that are coming through the helpline that approximately 50% are for places in areas such as business, engineering, psychology, music and art.  Approximately 50% of them are in areas like medicine and computer science.  That does not mean that because a person wants to study medicine at first, second or third year that they will automatically slot into a place in medicine at first, second or third year.  There is therefore a matching exercise under way by this office as to where the person would fit within the Irish higher education system.</p> <p>  On the issue of places, the number is a small fraction of the overall number of places that we will have available.  We are trying to keep the discussion going as to how we will manage that demand separate to the CAO process.  This is because nobody wants any sort of them and us mentality-----</p></speech>

Quite a number of universities in Ukraine provide online education.  Therefore, they will be relying on our colleges for support, wrap-around services and additional tutorials, rather than being a full-time student there.  We are working our way through this on a case-by-case basis at the moment.  I will keep the Deputy and the committee up to date on the issue.  I get a read out from the helpline and I am happy to share it with the committee on a monthly basis.  If it is useful to let the committee see what information is coming through, I would be very happy to do that.  </p></speech>

This has been passed to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is co-ordinating accommodation.  In the first instance, my Department wrote to all of the universities, higher education institutions to ask them to help and to ask them what they could do.  Approximately 1,000 beds came through that exercise.  A further exercise was done and the Department got the number up to approximately 2,000.  In addition to that, and separate to and distinct from our work, a number of conversations have been held between the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and private providers, in other words, people who are not within our direct ambit.  That is where that stands.  It is a mix of public and private.  The figure is approximately 2,000 in the higher education institutions, which are college owned.  The figure is approximately 2,000 or 2,500 in the private sector.  We are very clear that student accommodation is student accommodation.  This is welcome in the short term but it cannot be a medium-term solution, for obvious reasons.  However, it can be a release valve or breathing space while other solutions are put in place.  Any of the higher education institution combinations that are being contracted or offered are specifically for that summer period.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to this point in his statement.  When will we have a clear roadmap for those students, as well as for the dental students who have been studying and who are now coming back into the Irish system?  The Minister mentioned that he had been in communication with them.  That will be my last question.</p></speech>

There is a group of 60 Irish medical and dental students who were forced to abandon their studies in Ukraine for their safety.  My officials - and I thank Mr. Ian McKenna and his team - have been liaising with the deans of the medical schools in Ireland.  Those deans are currently undertaking an assessment of the medical schools in Ukraine.  They are trying to match where the students were with their medical education in Ukraine with the equivalent in the Irish education system.  As I have suggested, a key element of this process is understanding the alignment between the Ukrainian programme and the Irish systems of medical and dentistry education.  Where issues arise regarding the accreditation by the professional bodies, this will allow us to see how we can best facilitate those who fled in continuing their studies.  However, to be clear, we maintain our commitment to ensuring that they can continue their studies.  We have written to them or are about to write to them.  We have written to them directly as recently as last week.  My Department has been painstakingly making sure that we keep in regular contact with them and that we keep them informed.  We wrote to them, as my note says, as recently as last Friday.  I will send the Deputy and the committee some more detail on this.</p></speech>

As members have already said, I welcome everything the Department has done to support Ukrainian people coming into the country.  It is the right thing to do.  I give credit to the Department for that.</p> <p>  Without repeating questions or going into the numbers, I will focus on the point that this situation will evolve.  This time next year, we will have a different conversation about the numbers of, for example, mature students from Ukraine who are going into third level education.  I raise the issue of people with learning difficulties going into higher education.  I understand that at the moment there is not a high number of these people in third level education, and I accept that.  However, I am sure that people at any age can get diagnosed with dyslexia.  Are there supports for people from Ukraine who have learning difficulties?  On the issue of pathways, because I am sure there are different levels of economic inequality in Ukraine just like there are here in Ireland, are there pathways in place for these students to go to colleges, in terms of QQI levels, colleges etc.?  My question is probably for this time next year.  However, even if we only had ten people going to college, it would be important that we would meet their needs.  This is especially the case for people with learning difficulties.  I am sure that is tough when English is not your first language, as well having a learning difficulty.  </p> <p>  I would be interested to know about interpreters.  Sitting here, I do not even know what kind of interpreters there are for people who are deaf, for example.  How will we deal with this?  I know that I have raised many questions, many of which will need to be addressed next year, rather than here and now.  However, I would be interested to know where we are with people with learning disabilities and what supports have been put in place for third level.  Those are my questions.  </p></speech>

Her analysis is right and honest.  This is a situation that will evolve, as the Senator noted.  We are at the early stages, from the point of view of our sector.</p><p>The first thing you need when you arrive in a new country having fled war is not higher education, but accommodation, food, safety, checking in with your family, learning the English language in the community, and getting your kid into school.  These are the immediate needs.  The front-line response that my Department has been involved in is English language provision in the community.  That is going well but it is under a great deal of demand.  We need to beef it up and do more.  The Senator is right, in that this issue will undoubtedly grow, if that is the right phrase, over the next 12 months.</p><p> Regarding a student from Ukraine with a learning disability - the Senator referenced dyslexia - or additional educational needs, I will give two answers.  That student will have the same access as an Irish citizen to the range of supports that are in place.  Any support that is in place for an Irish student with a disability in college - we will be announcing more policy on this matter tomorrow - will be available to Ukrainian students.  They will be treated no differently and will not miss out on any of those supports.  We have a fund for students with disabilities that works well in our colleges.  In fact, people often tell me that the level of support in higher education compares well to other sectors of society.</p></speech>

Are we putting in place additional services or staff to support them?</p></speech>

In the memo that I am bringing to the Cabinet, probably within the next two weeks, there will be specific funding for additional psychological support services for students from Ukraine.  I will reflect on what the Senator has said about whether there is a need to do more.  As a country, we have shown that we will not allow money to be a barrier to providing the necessary supports.  I am satisfied that, between the fund for students with disabilities, the student assistance fund, the Erasmus+ scheme and the psychological supports, which will entail additional money, we will be able to meet the aim of ensuring that everyone can continue in education regardless of additional needs.</p> <p>  The Senator and I both referenced the English language.  There is a difference between providing the English language for someone who wants to continue in academic studies and general English language provision.  We have a working group, which will conclude shortly, on what we need to do for the student, who could be at an advanced stage of his or her studies, for example, a masters, and needs the English language in an academic setting.  The committee can expect proposals from my Department on this matter shortly.  We will share them with the committee.</p></speech>

It is a traumatic situation for the people coming to Ireland from Ukraine.  We discussed this matter with the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  It is excellent to see what is being put in place to support these people.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, spoke about trying to identify the numbers.  We know of 6,000 - 4,000 going into primary school and approximately 2,000 going into secondary school.  The number doing the leaving certificate has been mentioned.  I understand that approximately 250 students have stated that they would like to sit the Ukrainian entrance exams in Ireland.  It is phenomenal that we are able to host those exams, so I wish to pay tribute to the Department, THEA, the IUA and the universities that are supporting that.</p> <p>  Even though they are more for the other Department, the Minister might have some thoughts on questions that I asked in our previous session.  I raised some interesting questions about the secondary school career guidance teacher's role in respect of Ukrainian students.  I do not know how many of the 2,000 are at senior cycle level.  As the Minister mentioned, the role of ETBs is important.  There are colleges of education in many towns around Ireland.  The breakdown of where these secondary level students are shows that there are more than 250 in County Galway, for example.  How can we deliver courses where the costs are lower, the students do not have to travel and they can do pre-nursing courses or other early study courses to reach level 5 while also doing their English language courses so that, in the following year, they will be able to engage with third level fully instead of all of the pressure being applied immediately?</p> <p>  The national student and researcher, NSR, help desk is fantastic.  It has dealt with more than 535 queries, which is amazing.  It can just be contacted via phone and email at the moment, though.  Does it have a web page yet or is one going to be set up?  Something with FAQs would be useful, particularly when everyone is googling and doing quick searches.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that students from Ukraine would be treated the same way as Irish students, they would not pay fees and SUSI supports would be available.  He also stated that post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses would be free for them.  That would be fantastic.</p> <p>  Regarding grants under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Actions, MCSA, the Minister referred to &euro;25 million in direct aid at European level to fund fellowships.  This is crucial.  There is such a level of education in Ukraine that we can only benefit.  When I had a chance to visit the Donamon F&aacute;ilte Centre in Roscommon, I met many young people from Ukraine who were chomping at the bit to give something back to the community.  Be it fellowships, competency courses or something done through the National Academic Recognition Information Centre, NARIC, that will be crucial.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to queries from approximately 25 researchers and he spoke about the specific English language competency for academics and researchers at that level.  In some science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, English is the international language.  Are specific sectors being considered?  University research teams can be very international.</p></speech>

We have linked in and are utilising the ETB career guidance service.  I am grateful that the Senator mentioned ETBs because it provides me with an opportunity to thank them.  I have visited quite a number of ETB centres in several counties over the past month and have been blown away by the level of work they are doing and the skills on show across the range of programmes that they offer.  With SOLAS and using translators, they provide Safe Pass classes.  They also provide access to cookery classes.  I met many women displaced from Ukraine who were teaching our learners about their national foods and exchanging ideas.  Nice intercultural work is happening.  The ETBs are also ramping up provision of English language teaching.  The further education and training, FET, colleges are playing a major part and the work is already happening.  The Senator is right about the appeal &ndash; it is local and we have waived the fees, so there is no cost.</p><p>Regarding the NSR help desk, there is no web page at the moment because we are trying to use <i>gov.ie</i>, which has a Ukrainian section to co-ordinate everything.  We will keep the matter under review.  At the moment, though, it is an email address and a phone number.  The FAQs should be on <i>gov.ie</i>, but if there is a gap that people believe we need to fill, they should let me know.</p><p>I have stated several times that students coming from Ukraine will be able to access all of the same supports, including SUSI.  To be clear, they will not be accessing SUSI.  Instead, they will be getting the equivalent of SUSI through the Erasmus+ programme.</p></speech>

We are in receipt of a proposal from a university working with the Irish Research Council, IRC, and Scholars at Risk for funding to support displaced Ukrainian researchers, but we are awaiting further developments from the European Commission on the operation of the additional funding.  The IUA is the contact point for the scheme.  It will form part of the brief for the NSR help desk, which will then become the contact point.  In another good European initiative, there are specific bursaries for researchers from Ukraine.  I will send the committee a note on that.</p></speech>

Will those apply to entry into Irish third level institutions as well so that there will be a pathway for people taking the qualifying exam?</p> <p>  Senator Dolan referenced some FET work.  There has been a great deal of discussion about the promotion by this committee and the Minister of the apprenticeship pathway.  Will that be available to, and supported for, Ukrainians?</p> <p>  I wish to ask something about the 3,000 people in the age range in question, although the Minister might not have this information.  I imagine that there is a stark gender breakdown and that they are predominantly female.</p><p>I may be wrong in that.  If we are offering further education opportunities or apprenticeships, are we trying to promote those in the right way to get the right people into the right courses?</p></speech>

Yes, that entrance examination, the leaving certificate equivalent if you like, can and will be a route into third level education.  We have talked a lot about CAO reform and how there must be other pathways.  The university system takes in many students through the mature student application route every year so it is not without precedent that there would be another entry route.  This is one for Ukrainian students.  It is what people want and expect us to do and it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>  The apprenticeship scheme is open to Ukrainians.  I do not have data here and I am not sure we compile data but I will check.  I have met Ukrainian students in colleges of further education doing apprenticeship courses and pre-apprenticeship courses.  We very much need more apprentices.  Anybody here in Ireland is very welcome to get involved and will be supported to do so.  The ETBs will be instrumental in helping with that work.  I will reflect and feed back what the Deputy said.  The overwhelming number of people of adult age who have come here are female and I would be very surprised if the position was dramatically different in this age group.  I will discuss and consider how we reach out to this group.</p></speech>

As with the previous Department, I commend the work being done by his Department and people on the ground in further and higher education institutions to support people in the area of English language.  It is obviously very important.</p> <p>  While it is not the same with respect to scale, Ukrainians are not the only refugees.  I think of the people fleeing horrendous oppression in Afghanistan.  Ukrainian students will not pay international fees and students supports will be provided to match the SUSI scheme.  Will that also apply to Afghan refugees?</p></speech>

I alluded earlier to the fact that a policy question will have to be addressed in this regard because these matters relate specifically to people who are displaced in Ireland and under the protection directive issued at European level.  It may present a significant policy contradiction as regards how other refugees in this country are treated but these supports currently apply to people who have entered from Ukraine.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  A universities of sanctuary initiative is run through a number of universities.  We have made significant changes to the level of financial support available and made it easier for people in direct provision to qualify for support in higher education.  However, I also want to be honest with the Deputy.  We have the Dr. Catherine Day report on this issue and we are not where we need to be on this and it would be dishonest for me to suggest we are.  I will consider the issue of those who come here from Afghanistan and revert to the committee on it.  I also want to be honest about the legal framework that applies to people entering from Ukraine under the protection directive.  Let me revert to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

I visited a number of schools in Waterford and at one school I happened to ask the principal if the school had any Ukrainian students.

The Minister alluded to mental health supports.  I emphasise that point on which I do not need a response.</p> <p>  The issue of apprenticeships has been addressed, as far as I can gather.  When tradespeople who arrive here need their papers, does that fall under the remit of the Department?  For example, electricians must register with a certain body.  I think it is called Safe Electric.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be delighted to know that there are approximately 45 competent independent regulators and authorities within that.  To give an example, SOLAS, which deals with many of the trades and crafts, is operating a system where an individual who comes to Ireland with a foreign qualification, trade or apprenticeship can apply to it to have these qualifications assessed for their equivalency.  We are doing that at the moment.  SOLAS is individually assessing the equivalency of each applicable construction skill qualification received.  This is being done under a specific statutory instrument.  SOLAS is also seeking to provide, where required, opportunities to take any reskilling or upskilling course that may be required.  To be blunt, we want people who have trades here to be able to work here.  They want to work and we want them to work.</p></speech>

The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and the Medical Council are working through issues.  It might be useful if I provided some of the notes I have to the committee.  It is basically about each independent regulatory or competent authority, which is SOLAS in the case of the trades, working through what we have from Ukraine and how that measures up with what we have here.  It is also about trying to be practical in recognising that when people have fled a war zone they may not necessarily have the paperwork.  Work is ongoing on that assessment process.</p></speech>

What assessments have been done on the impact the influx of students will have on our education system?  It is my understanding that we are talking about more than 40,000 students in the education system.  We have never been faced with these numbers before.  I am concerned in responding to one crisis that we do not cause another.  What level of planning and assessment has been done?</p> <p>  On collaboration, I recognise and welcome that there is collaboration with SOLAS on the apprenticeship issue.  Is there collaboration with the boards of the individual universities?</p> <p>  I am also concerned about special needs.  Our resources are seriously stretched.  How will students get support at third level?  Will that have implications for the students who are already receiving the supports within our system?  Does it mean they will get less or do we have additional experts and trained people going into that area to cover the numbers that will be needed?  I am concerned about that, in particular, the overall assessment.</p></speech>

I can only speak for the numbers in further and higher education.  So far those numbers have been quite small and especially so in the context of the overall numbers.  There are probably around 500,000 people in third level education in Ireland and we are talking about 535 calls to the helpline.  I expect that number to grow and as Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh reminded us, slightly more than 3,000 people between the ages of 18 and 24 years have come from Ukraine.  From our point of view, it is very much about putting additional support in place.  For example, when I go to Government in the next two weeks I will seek additional funding for psychological services in recognition that a higher education student from Ukraine will obviously have fled a war zone and the pressures that will bring.  That is the space we are in.</p></speech>

I am an adjunct professor in finance in the school of business, Trinity College.  Previous to this, I was an associate professor in finance there.  My interest in this topic stems from research interests in the area of corporate tax, shadow banking and regulation of financial firms.</p> <p>  Revenue defines a section 110 firm as &ldquo;an Irish resident special purpose vehicle that holds and/or manages 'qualifying assets'".  Firms that have section 110 tax status are self-declared, that is to say a firm informs Revenue that it qualifies as a section 110 firm.</p> <p>  There are very valuable tax benefits to being a section 110 firm.  Interest paid abroad is tax-free while interest paid in Ireland is tax-deductible.  This is because interest payments may vary and become a distribution of profits and are treated as a dividend when paid abroad.  They are referred to as a form of hybrid finance.  Due to this tax treatment, section 110 firms were a very attractive form of finance for Russian-based firms.  Capital could be raised at interest rates that were relatively low given the risks of providing finance to Russian-based firms.  There was relatively little regulation, apart from a requirement to comply with the Companies Acts, and there were no restrictions on the use of funds raised.  Corporate profits, net of interest, are low or zero, hence corporate tax payments are also low or zero.  This is often described as "tax neutrality".</p> <p>  To keep within the time limit, I will skip to the section of my statement on the funds raised.  Total funds raised by Russian-connected section 110 firms amounted to &euro;118 billion for the period from 2005 to 2017.  A further &euro;17 billion was raised on the Dublin Euronext market in the period from 2018 to 2021.</p> <p>  I will move on to the assets of Russian firms in Ireland.  Table 2 in my written submission shows a very partial inventory of Russian-connected assets located in Ireland.  A full inventory would be very useful because the number of Russian firms and individuals subject to sanctions, including the freezing of assets, is likely to be extended.  In addition, assets may be not just frozen, but confiscated.  The European Commission has published a draft directive on criminalising the evasion of restrictive measures and has also published a draft directive on asset recovery and confiscation from criminal activities.  </p> <p>  Table 2 shows that Russian-connected section 110 firms comprise the largest component of Russian-owned assets in Ireland.  The next largest component is made up of Russian aircraft leasing firms.  The value of these assets in 2020 is likely to be far larger than the &euro;5.4 billion shown in table 2 as 15 of the 20 firms identified, although active, have not filed accounts.  All of these firms are subject to tax at 12.5%, unlike section 110 firms, and account for around 85% of aircraft leased assets in Ireland.  Even though they are similar to section 110 firms, the Central Bank collects no records or data on these firms.</p> <p>  I will now address the issue of holding companies.  The use of holding companies in Ireland by Russian-connected companies has changed over time.  A former US expert on organized crime in the former Soviet Union gave evidence to the US House Committee on Financial Services that identified Ireland as a major location for wealth leaving Russia in the post-Soviet period.  A search of Companies Registration Office records for directors of companies with a Russian address, for example, an address in Moscow, shows several hundred companies incorporated in Ireland in the period from 1992 to 1996.  Most of these firms were dissolved without filing accounts.  One estimate is that 50% of the total financial wealth of Russia is held offshore. This wealth is most likely held by incorporated entities and holding companies.  A report published by Chatham House states that incorporated entities and trusts are also used to layer ownership through chains of ownership in financial centres such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Malta and Cyprus. The purpose, of course, is to hide the source and ownership of assets.</p> <p>  I will skip to my comments on establishing ownership and sanctions.  In order to impose sanctions, Governments rely on professional firms such as corporate service providers, CSPs, to correctly identify the ultimate ownership of a company.  A CSP may, for example, believe that the ultimate owner is located in the Cayman Islands, whereas in fact the Cayman Islands firm is a subsidiary of the ultimate owner, resident in the State of Belize.  Even if the ultimate owner was correctly identified at the date of incorporation, ownership may subsequently change at any point along the chain.  Similar issues arise in respect of money laundering.  Reliance on a "know your client", KYC, process can lead to difficulties in identifying the owner of cash.</p> <p>  I will skip to my final remarks, which are on the future of section 110 firms.  Post the Ukraine war, the use of section 110 firms may decline due to increased regulation at an EU level and restrictions on the global movement of financial flows.  Section 110 firms may be regarded as tax neutral in Ireland but they can result in large tax losses in countries which receive interest payments.  For this reason, the use of hybrid finance has resulted in a number of EU anti-tax avoidance measures, for example, interest limitation rules.  The proposed EU directive on shell companies is also likely to impose restrictions on firms that have no fixed assets or employees.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Stewart for coming before the committee.  I know this is something he has been focused on for quite some time.  It really came into the spotlight in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  There was then a lot of talk of financial and economic sanctions and, as a result, the spotlight was turned on the role of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, as one of the main finance hubs for Russian State-owned and oligarch-controlled companies.  It is thanks to Dr. Stewart's work that we are fully aware of this situation so I really thank him for coming before the committee.  The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a lot of capital flight and offshore financial centres such as the IFSC were absolutely key to this.  Some estimates suggest that approximately 50% of Russian wealth is held offshore.</p><p>I have a number of questions.  In 2018, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>carried a story on its front page that cited Dr. Stewart's research.  It noted how Russian-connected companies funnelled billions through the IFSC.  Following this, the former deputy governor of the Central Bank, Stefan Gerlach, said Irish politicians were &quot;mindlessly in favour&quot; of the growth of the IFSC.  He went on to say that they did not recognise the risks involved in the facilitation of massive influxes of cash to companies such as Russian banks and oil giants.</p><p>He also said they were much too positive about the benefits of the IFSC, such as employment for lawyers and accountants.  Does Dr. Stewart share this view and, if so, is that mentality out of step with the efforts currently being undertaken at European level like the forthcoming EU shell company directive?</p></speech>

There is certainly a case that there is relatively light-touch regulation.  That is a problem not just for the IFSC but also other countries as well, unfortunately.  It is difficult to trade off various points that employment will be affected and certainly the IFSC employs people but there are also certain activities that are not very productive for Ireland or indeed for the EU generally.  You can certainly say there could be much greater regulation but there are issues with regulation because Ireland is a small country and the IFSC is very large.  It would cost a huge amount of money and you would need considerable legal resources to properly regulate all the activities in the IFSC.</p></speech>

His research was widely covered in the media four years ago and a former deputy governor spoke about the significant risks he had identified and went on to say the Central Bank needs to be appropriately staffed and have teeth to monitor such opaque activities.  One thing that has come out of all the decisions we have had so far is the opaque nature of this.  On the back of that, is Dr. Stewart aware of any regulatory action taken by the Central Bank in the wake of this to tighten up the regulation of these firms, when this issue was highlighted four years ago?  What is his view on whether the Central Bank is sufficiently staffed, has appropriate sanctioning powers and in some ways has the resolve to tackle this kind of activity?</p></speech>

One might say it should be made responsible but currently it is not.  There is a kind of gap here because who is actually responsible for regulating section 110 firms?  It seems to fall between a number of different stools.  Again, the problem really relates to the huge size and range of activities being performed in the IFSC.  It would take a huge amount of resources to properly regulate all these activities, so that is an issue.  Maybe the issue would be more appropriately tackled at an EU level if the ECB or some other agency became responsible for regulating financial firms.  The EU is moving in this sort of direction.</p></speech>

The IFSC appears to have a long-standing relationship with the Russian economy.  I am aware Dr. Stewart's research detailed the period of 2005-17 but in the 1990s the use of Irish-registered non-resident companies by those from Russia attracted much adverse comment in the international media and even in D&aacute;il debates.  Here the IFSC seems to focus as a conduit for purposes like capital flight, money laundering and other illicit flows.  That is money that was leaving Russia and entering the West.  The use of section 110 over the last two decades shows the relationship seems to have maintained but now the flow seems to move in the opposite direction, that is, from the West back into Russia.  What does Dr. Stewart think explains the pattern of this flow of funds and is there any possible relationship to the Russian Government's policy?</p></speech>

As they are so large, the use and control of these assets is spread over a number of different financial centres.  One aspect of the section 110 financing of Russian firms is there is a case to be made this is really recycled money.  Huge amounts of wealth have left Russia in recent years through Estonia, Latvia and other countries.  Some of the funds, though not all of it by any means, has flowed back to Russia to help with the financing of Russian firms.  That is kind of new and section 110 tax status has given particular advantages to Russian firms in the sense of lowering the cost of capital, lowering the risk of investing in Russia and hence making it easier for firms like the Russian railways company to raise large amounts of money using section 110 status.</p></speech>

It is quite interesting to note the IMF in a 2019 paper found 60% of all FDI into Russia is made by empty brass-plate holding companies, which are the type of companies Dr. Stewart's own study examined.  Do we have any idea what proportion of that 60% would be comprised of investment from the IFSC?  As a broader point, and one very relevant to us, do FDI statistics need to be interpreted with greater calculation than they are usually treated in the media, for instance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#B00800"><p>It can be difficult to interpret FDI flows because of this issue of firms flowing back to the country of origin of the funds in the first place.  It is very difficult to work out exactly what the flows of funds are.  They are very large indeed.  They are coming from different directions and may be channelled in different ways.  These are difficult questions to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#B00900"><p>Obviously they are difficult questions to answer and it is good in a sense the spotlight has been put on this whole issue now.  This is something that has gone into all sorts of media and there has been more of a focus on it.</p> <p>  I ask about the lack of transparency around the ownership of certain types of company structures operating in the IFSC.  This State introduced its register of beneficial ownership as part of the EU's fifth anti-money laundering directive.  However, as has been noted by Transparency International it permits the use of legal trustees to list themselves as beneficial owners when we know they are not the beneficiary but rather acting on behalf of them.  It also only requires those with a shareholding of over 25% to record their ownership.  In a company with four owners with an equal shareholding of 25%, none of them would be recorded as beneficial owners.  This being the case does Dr. Stewart believe this State's register of beneficial ownership is fit for purpose?  Do we need to lower the ownership thresholds?  Should we allow trustees to be recorded as beneficial owners?  We know some of these Russian-connected companies did not merely use trust ownership structures.  Some even used charitable trust ownership structures and from what we can see these companies are not exactly the Red Cross, so does he think that is appropriate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#B01000"><p>Hiding the beneficial owner applies not just to the IFSC but to lots of other regimes as well.  Treating a 25% shareholding as a beneficial owner can easily be circumvented by splitting this into 10%, 12% or whatever.  I noticed that for some section 110 accounts I have examined, while they state they are owned by a charitable trust, they also state they are controlled as part of a group structure of another firm and they appear in the consolidated accounts.  This seems to be a recognition of the fact these supposedly independent section 110 firms are in fact part of a group structure and they are fairly tightly controlled.  That is the reality and the idea they are owned by a charitable trust is a bit of a smokescreen.</p></speech>

I understand what Dr. Stewart means about this not just being an issue for the IFSC but as the finance committee of the Oireachtas that is where our focus needs to be.  It is about what we can do to make things as transparent as possible.</p> <p>  Dr. Stewart has highlighted the role of corporate service providers in providing the know-your-client function but presumably this can be quite difficult given the complex ownership chains of companies we see nowadays, which can span multiple jurisdictions.  Economists like Thomas Piketty propose establishing a Europe-wide asset registry because of the gaps and weaknesses in the registries of beneficial owners of EU member states.</p><p>What is Dr. Stewart's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#C00200"><p>The proposal by Thomas Piketty and others that there should be a European register is a good one.  The problem is that it may be very difficult to implement.  Different countries have different regulatory and disclosure requirements for companies.  There might be all sorts of difficulties in making those comparable.  There is still the issue of who is the beneficial owner.  If somebody is rich enough and has enough resources to disguise the beneficial owner, he or she can do so.  We saw that in recent media reports of the attempts to seize the yachts of various oligarchs.  Those are very visible assets and yet there have been difficulties with seizing them and establishing ownership.  The ownership of those yachts can change overnight.  It is a tricky issue and involves a considerable pooling of information at a European level.  That requires a lot of money.  It must be resourced and investigated properly.</p></speech>

There appear to be well-paid professional networks acting, in some senses, as enablers.  While fines can sometimes be imposed, we rarely see any kind of criminal sanction.  Do we need harsher penalties for those who are willing to act as enablers within this kind of system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#C00400"><p>It would be difficult to impose fines on enablers as long as they are acting within the law.  That is a major issue that requires changes in the law and regulation of those changes rather than an attempt to fine enablers.  The job of the professional firms that are performing services for oligarchs and others is to perform those services for their clients.  What the client does with those services or how it behaves in other jurisdictions cannot be a part of the legal remit or requirement of those professional firms.  They have a moral duty as opposed to a legal duty to ensure they are behaving in an ethical way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#C00500"><p>I noted in Dr. Stewart's opening statement a reference to the fact that section 110 firms may be regarded as tax neutral but can result in large tax losses in countries which receive interest payments.  I am aware that one of the issues the domestic tax base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process of the OECD was intended to tackle was the risk of double non-taxation.  Would it be fair to say that the use of section 110 gives rise to risks of double non-taxation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#C00600"><p>That is certainly the case, as it is with regard to all hybrid instruments.  That is why the European Union in response to the BEPS initiative has imposed restrictions on the use of hybrid instruments.  It has, for example, limited interest payments that may be made by hybrid instruments.  They can involve double non-taxation and for that reason, I think their use will tend to be phased out.  In addition, EU commitments and attempts to reduce the use of shell companies may also affect section 110 companies.  It defines a shell company as a company with no employees and no fixed assets.  Both those forces may reduce the number of hybrid instruments and their use in financing companies.</p></speech>

A number of the issues I was going to raise have been raised by Deputy Farrell but I will follow up on a few points.  I am interested in the issue of double non-taxation.  Perhaps Dr. Stewart could comment further on that point in the context of the conversation around the effective tax rate.  There is a push on the idea of an international effective tax rate.  It was out of step with proper processes in the past but perhaps Dr. Stewart could comment further in the current context where there is meant to be that push towards a global effective tax rate.</p> <p>  Are section 110 vehicles onshore entities?  They are marketed as such but seem to meet the criteria the IMF has set out for offshore financial centres.  The IMF describes those as countries or jurisdictions providing financial services to non-residents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and financing of the domestic economy.  That is important because, as was touched on, there is a danger of their distorting the measurement of our financial economy.  Should section 110 vehicles be recognised as offshore in that context?  If they are being treated as onshore but do not touch the real domestic economy in any meaningful way, that will throw off our foreign direct investment, FDI, figures.  Perhaps Dr. Stewart would comment on that onshore or offshore piece.</p> <p>  I am also interested in the beneficial ownership piece.  The following is related to but does not touch directly on section 110.  Investment limited partnership legislation went through approximately a year and a half ago.  What was particularly notable was that it seemed for that particular form of company the legislation increased the powers of non-beneficial ownership while diminishing liabilities.  One was not considered to be a beneficial owner unless one hit the 25% threshold, yet one was allowed to sit on the board, make decisions and engineer hiring, which one would not have been allowed to do in the past.  How is control measured?  We only have the blunt measures around the 25% ownership and the control of 25% of voting when there are other mechanisms for control such as, for example, seats on boards.  I would love for Dr. Stewart to elaborate further on the case he mentioned because this issue extends beyond the question of Russian assets.  There are also questions around parent companies and group companies, and the control a group may exercise on a charitable trust that comes under that group even though the trust is registered as a charity.  Are we monitoring control effectively and in the right ways?  Do the beneficial ownership rules, the 25% rules and even the 25% voting rights rules evade the proper monitoring of control?</p> <p>  How section 110 companies lend their money seems to be one of the main mechanisms over which there is little monitoring.  There seems to be little monitoring of what section 110 companies do with their money in respect of things such as loans.  This is not my normal area to expertise but we know that in the past a sanctioned company was able to receive loans through a section 110 structure.  Will Dr. Stewart comment in respect of loans from a section 110 company to another entity?</p> <p>  Dr. Stewart touched in his opening statement on the aircraft leasing sector.  That is an interesting sector which requires much more scrutiny.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Environment, Climate and Communications and, in an area that is slightly related, I am aware that one of the major beneficiaries of financial subsidy from the State is jet kerosene.  Some &euro;600 million goes to jet kerosene tax relief every year.  That is an enormous subsidy for fossil fuels and public moneys are forgone in tax in that sector.</p><p>Given that the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action is considering this matter, I am very interested in the scrutiny of aircraft leasing structures and those company structures.  Dr. Stewart touched on the issue briefly and I would appreciate hearing more.  He will be able to take the more useful questions from my questions.</p></speech>

She is right that the issue of beneficial ownership is very difficult, particularly the supposed ownership by a charitable trust or a trust.  This is a legal fiction because the firm is tightly controlled.  It might be tightly controlled by the trust deeds.  It can be described as an orphan structure as it has no parent or subsidiaries that try to restrict it in what it may do.  Nevertheless, I have noticed that lots of the section 110 aircraft leasing firms have a financial deficit.  For 2020, out of the 171 firms examined, 23% had a financial deficit of 10% or more.  How do they continue to operate if they are effectively insolvent?  It is understood that the control company will step in to provide funds to the firm.  The problem is that there is a legal fiction that such firms are independent.  They are actually part of a group and the group advises a way of efficiently financing the firms in an equitable and cheap way.</p> <p>  There is an issue about raising funds and then the purpose for which they are used.  That is a serious issue, particularly for the Russian-financed firms, where funds were raised and used for military expenditure by certain banks in the IFSC.  We do not know how much, but we know it was a certain amount.  Again, that is a problem with the use of funds by section 110 companies.  How can one police what happens to the funds?  Are the funds used in a way that is compatible with Irish laws and international laws?</p> <p>  There are huge issues with the financing of these firms and how they are structured.  The structure of firms' assets is constantly changing.  Finance constantly evolves in terms of tax incentives and market conditions.  One must be constantly vigilant as to how these firms raise funds and how they are being used.  It is a problem that there are too many tax incentives - in section 110 about aircraft leasing and in other areas.  It is difficult to justify these tax incentives given the costs of the tax reliefs not so much to Ireland - they might be tax neutral in Ireland - but to other countries, which they cost a lot in terms of tax reliefs and a lack of taxable income.</p></speech>

Are there examples of how we can strengthen them?  The liabilities seem to have disappeared into one company but the control is exercised elsewhere, so the liabilities and the control are quite separated.  Is it a matter of dismantling this form of section 110 company and having greater tracking of parent companies or group structures?  Dr. Stewart has mentioned companies that are technically insolvent where money just moves in and out of them.  What mechanism can we, as a committee, press for?  Besides calling for greater scrutiny in these areas, are there examples of countries or processes that are better in terms of tracking control between group structures other than through the blunt instruments of beneficial ownership and voting weight?</p></speech>

In my opinion it would be a good idea if the section 110 tax deal was removed.  Certainly, Russian section 110 firms are not going to raise finance anymore.</p></speech>

Many branch companies that are aircraft leasing firms, which I have come across in Ireland, are branches of a parent company that is located in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands.  Why do they locate there?  That is not obvious.  They are part of a group structure but what is the advantage?  I can only surmise that it is because of a lack of transparency and tax reasons.</p> <p>  I think that there could be moves made to ensure that the parent of the subsidiaries in Ireland are not owned by a particular tax jurisdiction but that is very difficult to do.  For example, the OECD has grappled with this issue and has failed to come up with a reasonable definition of a tax jurisdiction so Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and other jurisdictions are not regarded as tax havens.  It is difficult to tackle these issues.  One needs more of an EU-wide regulatory system to examine these issues, and let us remember that we must compete with Luxembourg and other financial centres.  It is often the case that a tax change in Ireland is justified by the argument that it happens in Luxembourg or it helps us to compete with other tax centres such as Malta and Cyprus.  We need more EU-wide initiatives to control this activity and examine the benefits that can be generated by these activities.</p></speech>

I ask Dr. Stewart to comment on this matter.</p> <p>  To follow up on the charitable trust piece, in another area of work we look a lot at the regulation of charities.  Actual charities are subject to quite onerous and rigorous regulation.  Do we need to rigorously re-examine what constitutes a charitable trust?  How does the term "charitable trust" relate to registered charities and their activities in Ireland or elsewhere?  What type of relationship should a parent group have with a charitable trust within its group in terms of how the assets of a charitable trust may be used by a group structure and how liabilities are dealt with?  Is that a specific area?  I am speaking about the definition of a "charitable trust" and the relationship between a parent company and a charitable trust in the context of the examples of tighter regulation in other countries.</p> <p>  With the charitable trust piece, I am not simply thinking in terms of the Russian assets and those structures because charitable trusts are used quite a lot in Ireland, and very often as part of large groups of companies, and this is done in a way that is questionable.  I ask Dr. Stewart to outline where there are better examples of tighter regulation.</p></speech>

From the point of view of marketing and selling various financial products, it might be easier to sell them if they are marketed as being onshore but, in fact, for tax and other reasons they are effectively offshore.</p><p>Most of the activities in the IFSC are offshore.  They have nothing to do with the Irish domestic economy and for that reason they are not subject to regulation or there is minimal regulation by the Central Bank.  The distinction between offshore and onshore with regard to IFSC activities is minimal.  I do not understand why one would wish to make a distinction.</p><p> With regard to charitable trusts, it is quite obvious that section 110 companies are not charities in the way the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or other charities are.  Corporate law has evolved to allow companies to be termed charitable trusts and to be taxed and regulated as charitable trusts when they are not, in fact, charitable trusts.  The Charities Regulator certainly does not look at section 110 firms, yet they have the legal status of being a charity.  I suspect the reason for that is to try to protect the assets.  If it is a charitable trust and if other parts of the firm go into liquidation, the trust keeps its assets intact.  They cannot be touched by other creditors.  The problem is that if the assets of the charitable trust fall below the debt that has been raised to fund those assets, then it becomes effectively insolvent.  For example, a number of the aircraft leasing firms may become insolvent or suffer large losses because of the Russian action in respect of aircraft leasing firms from Ireland to Russia.  It is a thing that puzzles me.  How is it that charitable trusts have become such a key component of corporate finance and how have they become integrated into company law and used alongside companies that are subject to the Companies Acts?</p></speech>

I recall that case.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Stewart.  Those are very interesting areas to follow up.</p></speech>

A number of questions that I am interested in have already been asked.  I have a question about the issue of tax residency.  We know the challenges in defining tax residency, where they arose in the Apple case and the so-called stateless income tax strategy that was in operation at that time.  Some argue that the tests of tax residency in Ireland, namely, the central management and the control test and the incorporation test, are quite complex.  What are Dr. Stewart's thoughts on the need to reform this area or is there a need for reform in this area?  Are there any jurisdictions we should look at as examples of best practice?</p></speech>

It has run with the idea that one is located for tax residency purposes where one is managed and controlled.  The problem with that is: what is the definition of being managed and controlled?  This is in contrast to the national statistical agency which defines one's location as the country of residence, where one is incorporated.  That is why there is such a large gap between US estimates of profits of US firms in Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners' estimates.  The US would say that if one's profits are made in Bermuda and the company is owned in Ireland, the profits are attributable to Ireland, whereas the Revenue Commissioners would say the profits are attributable to Bermuda.  That is a huge problem in how one defines tax residency.  The OECD decided to go with where it is managed and controlled.</p> <p>  The problem is that in an era in which meetings can take place by telephone, where are the directors meeting?  They may all be living in California, Ireland or in other countries and the meeting supposedly takes place in Bermuda via telephone, so this has become a type of legal fiction or a moveable feast.  We decide where we are located and we can bolster this by where meetings of directors take place.  I do not have the solution to this.  It is an area of corporate tax planning that is very widely used.  It featured in the Apple case, as we saw, and will feature in other cases as well.</p></speech>

What is Dr. Stewart's view of a regime such as section 110 which facilitates a type of tax neutrality?  Is that in step with the OECD's BEPS process for dealing with corporation tax, minimum effective rates and addressing base erosion?  Does he believe that the section 110 structure is out of step with the reforms we are seeing internationally?</p></speech>

Some of the reforms are very good and I thoroughly support them.  Some of them are not so good.  One of the problems is that the OECD reforms require consensus.  They cannot be implemented unless all countries agree.  This is why the OECD's most recent reforms relating to a minimum tax rate have run into difficulties.  However, there is a possibility that the European Commission, through its directive implementing the OECD proposals, could implement what the OECD has not done.  This would require unanimity at the Council.  The Deputy knows the names of the countries that would object if this directive was voted on at the Council.  It would involve various changes.</p> <p>  Regarding the OECD initiative, section 110 firms are certainly at variance with this.  The hybrid initiative, the directive the EU has introduced, is basically a transposition of what the OECD recommended.  The hybrid directive is attempting to ensure there is no double non-taxation, and this is effectively what section 110 allows.  I notice there are concessions given to aircraft leasing, but the hybrid directive, if implemented, will certainly reduce the advantages of using section 110 finance.</p></speech>

I refer to the financial crisis and the steps that were taken in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008.  The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was set up in the US in the wake of that crisis.  That inquiry commission identified shadow banking as a significant contributory factor to the crisis.  Returning to today, a fortnight ago the <i>Financial Times</i>carried a story about how shadow banks are threatening the global economy.  The article went on to discuss how many companies rely on expensive junk-rated debt just to survive and how the coming interest rate increases could put them in real jeopardy.  The IFSC holds a lot of junk-rated debt.  Are there concerns here?  Are there issues or red flags about which we should be worried?  Are there risks that we could see a repeat of something similar to the last crisis?  While no crisis would be identical, are there concerns here about that?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that shadow banking is a huge area of risk to the global economy.  It is not so much to the Irish economy because most of the shadow banking activities relate to other countries.  It may well be the case, as in the financial sector, that what happens in Ireland has more effect in other countries than within Ireland.  The growth of shadow banking and its unregulated nature lead to risks.  Shadow banking is a huge area and there is no doubt that some parts of shadow banking are very high risk, while others are of less risk.</p><p>The problem is if there is a chain of lending, failure in one area can lead to failures in other areas as happened in the case of Lehman Brothers and other cases.  An era of rising interest rates and credit shortages could pose risks to shadow banking and the sorts of funds that are being raised by shadow banking and provided to other sectors.</p></speech>

The banking assets held by section 110 companies are staggering.  Given the problem of that, there is very little research into how our shadow banking sector is operating.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight wanted to examine some of the tax expenditures and was told it was not possible to examine section 110 which is concerning in this day and age.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has been championing this section 110 issue since she was elected.  She has raised this a few times with the Taoiseach.  When she raised the issue of section 110 being used by Russian companies with the Taoiseach recently, he said he had no problem with a cost-benefit analysis of section 110 being undertaken.  Does Dr. Stewart believe it would be timely to undertake such an analysis of section 110 companies?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#F00300"><p>A cost-benefit analysis of section 110 or of any other areas is dependent on the assumptions made, including issues such as employment.  If firms locate in the IFSC because of an array of products that are used here including section 110 financing, for example, will it affect their decision to locate here?  Given that they employ very few people and that there are many other ways of financing a firm, maybe some activities would move to other financial sectors but I do not see any inherent problem if section 110 companies close down.  We need to remember that most of the employment provided through section 110 firms must be indirect.  It is law firms, corporate services agencies and accounting firms providing services to these companies.  I do not believe any single law firm or accounting firm is dependent solely on auditing section 110 accounts.  It must be a fraction of such firms' income.  Some corporate services firms may be more dependent but the vast majority are dealing with companies other than section 110 companies.</p> <p>  The number of companies in Ireland which have no assets or employees, shell companies, is vastly larger than section 110 firms.  The Central Bank defines shadow banking as being equivalent to section 110.  This is not true.  Special purpose vehicles exist for all sorts of different reasons, such as holding assets, patents etc.  They may be used for various financing purposes.  It is likely that there are many thousands of shell companies in Ireland given that definition of no fixed assets and no employees.  However, they may be doing useful commercial tasks, particularly holding assets or patents, or buying and selling property.  These sorts of activities tend to shade into the shadow banking sector.  To equate shadow banking with section 110 is rather misleading.  The shadow banking sector is much larger than that and is quite pervasive in many different areas of the economy.</p></speech>

There is no contribution to income tax, PRSI or USC, nor do they pay any corporation tax because their interest payments can be used to write down taxable profits.  They do not pay any dividend withholding tax, capital gains tax or stamp duty.  In an Irish context, the real beneficiaries are the professional service firms, whose fees are also tax deductible.  Is there an argument that section 110 firms really function as taxpayer subsidies to a select group of professional services firms operating in the IFSC?</p></speech>

They have lower costs.  For example, the Russian firms that have used section 110 have paid a lower rate of interest on their debt given their relative risk because they use section 110.  It was not just the advisers who made a lot of money on this.  The Russian firms themselves were able to raise finance that otherwise would probably not have been available.</p> <p>  It is quite likely that section 110 clients only represent a minority of the income of any law firm or accounting firm involved.  While they have benefited, I do not think they benefit exclusively.</p></speech>

Section 110, introduced I believe back in 1991, was originally to promote securitisation for the financial sector operating in the State.  It was designed as a tax-neutral regime for securitisation transactions.  Before looking at the Russian firms' use of section 110, I have a question about the orphan ownership structure that exists.  Are there valid commercial reasons for this State to have on its Statute Book as scheme such as this, which permits orphan ownership?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#F00700"><p>Orphan ownership is also used in other countries.  It is very common in the Netherlands, for example, to have these structures where there is no parent and no subsidiaries.  The commercial advantage to orphan ownership is that it places a tighter control over the use of assets.  There can be no subsidiaries.  The parent company can have no claim over the assets and the creditors of the parent company can have no claim over the assets.  It is less risky to a lender.  Lawyers, accountants and all their advisers set up these companies because they are lower risk for the lender.</p></speech>

If a firm had raised finance and was part of a group structure and if the group gets into difficulty, then the creditors could attack the assets of the firm raising the finance.  However, if it is separate, if it is bankruptcy remote, it cannot be attacked in that way.  They are not remote from bankruptcy in the sense that if their assets fall in value, the debt owners are subject to liability.  A write-down in assets is associated with a write-down of debt.  In that sense they are not bankruptcy remote, but in some sectors they are.  If an aircraft falls out of the sky, for example, who is liable?  Is it the insurance company that is asked to cough up?  Who actually pays for this?  In the case of leased assets seized by Russia, the leasing industry is trying to claim the insurance companies are responsible for this, whereas the insurance industry might suggest that the firm leasing the assets is responsible.  Ultimately it is writers of debt who will bear the loss.</p></speech>

It might say that this is a risk-free vehicle.  My point is that if the assets the structure owns fall in value, the providers of the debt are exposed.  You cannot protect them from all exposures.</p></speech>

I have not read of any case where Revenue has said to a section 110 firm "sorry you do not meet these criteria and you are no longer a section 110 firm".  Having said that, I notice that there some section 110 firms that have migrated to being 25% companies.  They no longer state that they are section 110 firms.  This might be because they no longer meet the requirements of Revenue.  I am not quite sure about it.  The number of such companies is very small.

The beneficial owner could be a holding company that is just at 12%.  There are a number of these holding companies that have far less than 25% shareholding.  Together they control the company but you would have to go through registries in many different jurisdictions, including tax havens, to find out who is the actual owner of the firm.  It can be very difficult and complicated.</p></speech>

Obviously confiscation is distinct from freezing.  I noticed he referred to a draft directive of the European Commission.

Confiscating assets is very different from freezing them.  Regarding an asset that is frozen, you might put pressure on to sell it as is the case with a football club such as Chelsea but it is a very different legal process.  The Commission has proposed that breaking sanctions becomes a criminal activity.  Assets that come from criminal activities can be confiscated.  A breach of the criminal law means that the assets can be confiscated.</p></speech>

To a certain extent, it shadows the system that operates here in respect of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Initially, the Criminal Assets Bureau will freeze proceeds of crime but simply because it freezes them does not mean that they are subsequently confiscated, although I think such an application can be made seven years later.  Would Dr. Stewart agree with that?</p></speech>

There is a focus on yachts owned by the oligarchs and works of art but I would say that the bulk of Russian wealth abroad is held in the form of holding companies and companies owning various assets.  Such assets could be property or other kinds of assets.  We do not know.  It is very difficult to know what countries are involved and it is quite likely that there is no single country involved.  Rather there is a chain of ownership.  For example, the real asset is in the US and is owned by a subsidiary in Canada, which is in turn owned by a subsidiary in Ireland or Bermuda, which in turn is owned by five different companies.  The chain seems to stop with the Ireland or Bermuda company but the reality is that it is not where it stops at all.  It is carefully disguised.  What you can certainly say is that Russian oligarchs are very well-funded and can afford the best brains to develop corporate structures that are very well hidden and very difficult to track down.</p></speech>

We do not have the resources.  The US Treasury has enormous resources and legal power and it appears to have difficulty in tracking down the assets of Putin and other Russian oligarchs.  Perhaps it knows and is not saying.  This is something that cannot be done by Ireland alone.</p> <p>  If one thinks of the chain of ownership, every country where part of the chain hits its location must combine and use their resources together with those of others in order to try to track down the ownership of these.</p> <p>  This needs an EU-wide initiative which includes other countries within the EU, which run into the difficulties as to why they would comply.  If the EU can get an agreement and a directive at the Council, then this will have the force of law in every country such as Malta, Cyprus, Ireland and Denmark.  They will all then have to comply with the EU directive.  That might be a way that this issue could be tackled.</p></speech>

One has to say that unless a person does this, they will be committing a criminal act, or whatever.  The IMF cannot do that because each country has its own sovereignty in respect of tax and all of those sorts of issues.  I do not believe it would fully solve the problem but if these assets could be identified, it would be good way to proceed.  Once they are identified, one can then ascertain if they are owned by a sanctioned individual, whether they could be seized or not only seized, whether they could then also be confiscated.</p></speech>

During the course of his opening statement I was looking at his comments on the treatment of the section 110 firms.  Can he add a comment to that section where capital could be raised at relatively low interest rates given the risks of providing finance to Russian firms where there was little regulation?  What does Professor Stewart mean by saying that capital could be raised?</p></speech>

One is then told then that the after-tax yield will only be 5% and one will not be paying any tax on that.  If the yield was 10%, one would pay tax on that of perhaps 50%, or whatever, possibly a third, hence the yield after tax would be 6% or 7%.  If one is told that there is this yield, that it is 6% and there is no tax, this will reduce the cost of capital for those investors.  It makes it a much more attractive investment for firms or individuals who may think of purchasing debt being issued by these companies.  For that reason, it facilitates the raising of debt at a lower rate of interest and lower cost of capital.</p></speech>

I have extended this period from the year 2018 to 2021, and have found that &euro;17 billion was raised by section 110 firms.  That amounts to &euro;135 billion in total.  Most of that, not all of it, was raised on the Dublin market through loans that are quoted but not necessarily, or very rarely in fact, traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.  There is, therefore, evidence of the amount of money raised using section 110 firms.</p></speech>

I can understand that but on one of the tables he has provided here, in the area of employees, for example, Table 2 which refers to assets of Russian firms in Ireland, there was a significant number of these section 110 firms in Ireland in 2020 which had zero employees.  The aircraft leasing firms, which involve a great deal of money, had, I believe, 32 employees.  The Vtb Commodities firm had zero and Aughinish Alumina had 459 employees.  There is not any great number of people actually employed in these firms with the exception of that one company.</p></speech>

Russian special purpose entity, SPE, firms or conduits employ nobody.  They have no fixed assets or employees.  That is a feature of all section 110 firms where they have no fixed assets or employees.</p> <p>  Most aircraft leasing firms also have no employees either.  They have assets, obviously consisting of aircraft, but no fixed assets by way of office buildings and whatever.  It is true that the section 110 firms have no employees and many firms set up to fund finance and are not section 110 firms will also have no employees.  These are referred to as brass plates companies which are firms with no employees or fixed assets.  There are many thousands of them incorporated in Ireland as there are, incidentally, in many other countries.  The Netherlands is probably the major country where one would have these types of structures, not Ireland or Luxembourg.</p></speech>

Revenue cannot publish the names of firms that are section 110.  There is no public register of the ownership of these firms.  The Central Bank does not collect any data on aircraft leasing firms that are subject to 12.5% tax.  It collects data on aircraft leasing firms that are part a section 110 tax regime.  We argue that the huge firms are almost identical in structure, as in size.  It seems that tax data are ascertaining whether the Central Bank collects data.

They are doing all of the administration for this firm.  This may be very difficult for them to provide.  They may have done this some years ago.  It may have changed over time.  It is likely that with the data  they produce with the best of intentions - they are not trying to evade - they cannot actually work out who the beneficial owner of a firm is.  They may say it is a firm in Bermuda, but this may not be the case.  They have onerous data requirements to provide.  They are required to fill in a 27-page report for the Central Bank four times per year.  The Central Bank collects all these data.  It does not regulate these firms.  Why is it collecting all of these data?  It is a puzzle.  Corporate service providers are regulated.  They perform all of the administrative functions, including quite onerous data submission to the Central Bank.</p></speech>

In terms of the information collected by the Central Bank, is that a standard form that is completed?  Is it extensive?  Although the Central Bank does not publish the form, because the form is collected, it should have extensive information on these firms.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that the corporate service provider may firmly believe that the owner is located in Bermuda, but this is when the corporate service provider did that work one year ago or even six months ago.  It may change in the meantime, because the owner wants to hide the assets or whatever.  The corporate service provider may firmly and honestly believe that it knows the beneficial owner, whereas the truth is that it does not know the beneficial owner.</p> <p>  It may also be the case that the beneficial owner is disguised in a way in which the ownership of the asset is split among five or more companies, thus reducing the threshold for the definition of a beneficial owner, which is 25%.  If it is split among five different owners, the corporate service provider is returning that the firm is owned by one company but, in fact, that company is owned by five other companies.  If one amalgamates those, one can work out who the real beneficial owner is.  It is very difficult to work out who the true beneficial owner is.</p> <p>  The Central Bank collects largely data to do with financial flows, financial assets and other aspects.  The Central Bank does not collect data on beneficial ownership.  It collects data on whether the firm is a charitable trust but it does not collect other data on the firm.  It is basically collecting data relating to its function as a monetary authority and this is a requirement, certainly for financial vehicle corporations, by the European Central Bank, ECB.</p></speech>

Does it store them?  Does it read them?  Does it have a picture of what is going on?  It may be a matter between the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance or, generally speaking, this committee could ask the Central Bank.  In terms of the negative equity and large losses which Dr. Stewart spoke about in his opening statement, it is the debt providers that suffer those losses.  Is there a record, anywhere in the system, of a company registered as a section 110 firm having to renege on its debt?  Is there any record of what firms and how much?</p></speech>

The point I made is that for 2020, of 171 firms that were identified, 23% had negative equity of greater than 10%.  These firms are still solvent.  They still say they are solvent.  They are still trading but, effectively, they are insolvent because their liabilities are far in excess of their assets.  The firm has not gone into liquidation, but it may in fact be forced into liquidation.  This is due to the Covid crisis and the crisis in the air travel business.  It is compounded by Russia seizing all of these aircraft and the loss is being borne by Irish aircraft leasers.  What will happen there?  It is very difficult to know.</p> <p>  We should also note that a large portion of aircraft leasing assets in Ireland, the precise fraction of which I do not know, is owned by Chinese companies.  It is difficult to work out what would be the reaction of Chinese companies to aircraft seized in Russia which are owned by Chinese companies via Ireland.  That will puzzle me as to what exactly the reaction to or effects on the Irish aircraft leasing firm which is owned by a Chinese firm will be.</p></speech>

Any layperson reading that would certainly wonder why these firms are not regulated extensively by the Central Bank.  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

They are not regulated by the Central Bank, because it does not have the remit to regulate them.  The Central Bank's focus is on the domestic economy and on performing certain functions, at the request of the Government.  There seems to be no agency which is responsible for regulating these firms.  Revenue regulates them in the sense that they ensure their tax status but it is self-declared.  A firm tells Revenue it is a section 110 firm and then it becomes a section 110 firm.  It must meet certain requirements, but it is difficult to know to what extent the Revenue checks these requirements out.  A firm is supposed to have what I think is &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million when it sets up but, within a period, this can fall away.  The problem is that these firms are largely unregulated.  One should say that somebody should regulate them and they should be regulated by the Central Bank.  However, one would probably have to introduce legislation to require that.</p></speech>

In some cases, firms specialise in leasing jet engines or other aircraft equipment.  Their other assets would involve financial and legal corporations and comprise loans they have made to other companies and assets they have purchased.  Within that &euro;1,031 billion, there is a variety of securitisation firms, which probably make up the bulk of it, and non-securitisation firms.  The latter category comprises the aircraft leasing firms, Russian conduits and other firms.  There is an amalgam of real assets and assets resulting from securitisation.</p></speech>

The first table refers to funds raised on Dublin Euronext between 2018 and 2021 in the billions of euro.  Will Dr. Stewart talk us through that table and comment on the fact Russian Railways, RZD, raised a total of &euro;10.1 billion in the years 2010 to 2021, inclusive?  He stated that in addition, banks availing of section 110 raised finance for the Russian military.  Firms that are based in Ireland, because of whatever way they have been made up, are in a position to raise &euro;10.1 billion for the Russian Railways and God knows how much for the Russian military.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The first table show the sums raised each year, amounting to &euro;2.1 billion in 2018.  I think September 2021 was when a Russia-connected firm last raised funds on the Dublin Euronext market, bringing the total for that period to &euro;17.1 billion.  The number of firms involved, ranging from six to 11, is outlined below that.  These are the sums these firms have raised through the Irish market.  Ireland has, effectively, been a key part of financing many firms in Russia.</p> <p>  An interesting question relates to who provided the finance and which investors bought those loans.  Our hypothesis is these are Russian investors reinvesting in Russia.  They are happy to do so and to take that risk because the returns are tax free.  In addition, the loans are often raised under the laws of the UK, which may give greater protection to the owners of the funds than if they were raised in another country.</p></speech>

Can he quantify that?  Where did the money come from for that specific purpose?  Was that from Russian investors as well?</p></speech>

In fact, one bank that raised funds on the Irish market, whose name I cannot recall off the top of my head, was specifically tasked with providing funds to the Russian military.  It is difficult to know exactly how much of the funds ended up with the Russian military and how much were used for other purposes.</p></speech>

It is difficult to believe all this has gone on.  Would any of that information have shown up in the information being collected by the Central Bank, or is it so general that it does not get down to the granular nature of the answer to that query?</p></speech>

It would be easy to do given the prospectus is published.  It can be downloaded and is fairly readily available.  It would be possible to collect the data but I do not know whether the Central Bank collates them.  Certainly, the information is in the public domain.  Thousands of companies raise debt on the Irish stock exchange every year and anybody can check whether a named company has raised funds.</p> <p>  One aspect that is excluded from these data relates to Russian firms based outside Ireland that have raised funds on the Irish Stock Exchange.  One firm, Vimpelneft, has raised &euro;3 billion or thereabouts on the Irish Stock Exchange but is located in the Netherlands.  Similarly, a Russian firm based in the UK, Evraz, has raised funds on the Irish Stock Exchange but is based in the UK.</p></speech>

They are then handed over to the Russian entity and, perhaps, the debt has been repaid given the structure is often one of rolling debt.  The assets of these firms amount to about &euro;35 billion and not all of that will be owned by sanctioned firms.  It might be possible, therefore, to seize some of those assets but those assets largely comprise funds they have lent to Russian companies.  The net cash held by these firms is very little indeed; there would be nothing to seize.  If we decided we were going to freeze the assets, there would be nothing to seize.  There are few assets in Ireland or, indeed, elsewhere.  The assets comprise loans made to Russia and that is financed by loans made to the conduit, or Russian firm, in Ireland.</p></speech>

I presume the wealth leaving Russia is based on cash and the transfer of assets.  What action arising out of that knowledge can be taken, whether by US agencies, European agencies or Irish agencies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jim Stewart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022060100002#K01200"><p>That evidence to the US house committee related largely to the transfer of assets.  Little can be done because these are historical data.  Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the ownership of these assets has changed completely.  The ownership of assets with the break-up of the Soviet Union was very different from that under the current Russian regime.  There has been a significant change in the ownership of assets.  It may also be the case that any individual who made large sums, whether just after the Soviet break-up or subsequently, is suspect in nature and that questions should be asked about how he or she got hold of large amounts of cash or other assets.</p><p>Putting that matter to one side, there is nothing that can be done by this State.  It is just an historic fact that Ireland was used at the time as part of the chain in transferring wealth outside of Russia.  Many of the companies involved were liquidated within three years and there is little information about them, so we can only guess that they were doing this.  The time period more or less coincides with the evidence given to the US Congress.</p></speech>

The team of experts who put together the Chatham House report concluded that it was unlikely that Russian oligarchs were using LLC structures in the UK and that it was much more likely that they were being used by criminal activities, or what the report refers to as second order actors.  Where criminal assets are concerned, though, the largest ownership is by Russian oligarchs and oligarchs from other countries.  These may be connected to illegal activities and assets that are owned illegally.</p></speech>

There was a court case involving an asset in Russia that was owned outside of Russia and Ireland.  A chemical firm called Toaz, based in Russia, was owned by a particular family or oligarch.  Another oligarch tried to take it over and there was an allegation of intimidation and so on.  The court case was heard in Ireland because it was deemed that this was where the asset was owned or held.  The firm's ownership was actually held in Bermuda.  Nevertheless, it was decided that the court case on whether compensation should be paid for the alleged intimidatory behaviour would take place in Ireland.  It is an interesting instance of a dispute among oligarchs over the ownership of assets in Russia.  This is happening all of the time, but often in Russian courts.  Sometimes, it has happened in UK courts, where interesting information has been revealed.  As far as I know, this was the first instance of such information being revealed through an Irish court case.</p></speech>

It will be almost impossible to get the full picture.  We need to take a far greater interest in what is happening and regulate it more.</p></speech>

It would take a large amount of resources and skill.  Indeed, a great deal of skill is involved in examining this type of data.  Given the cross-country nature of ownership, it would be much more efficient if that was done at group level.  The EU is probably the most suitable way of doing it.  Regulatory and enforcement powers must be backed by law.  Regulation and enforcement cannot be done by an agency such as the IMF because it does not have the legal power to do so.  The only way that this could be done in Ireland would be via an EU initiative, that is, a directive agreed by the Council.  The EU has been moving towards that in its recent draft directives and in its moves to make it more difficult to operate shadow or brass plate companies that have no assets or liabilities.  The idea that Ireland alone could handle this problem is not a runner, but Ireland should support and advocate for EU initiatives.</p> <p>  We must also remember that certain countries within the EU &ndash; Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Malta and Cyprus &ndash; are key players in the ownership of Russian assets and facilitating cross-border movement.  The way to ensure a resolution and the rule of law is at EU level.</p></speech>

The Deputy will remember all of those German banking firms and conduits that folded, creating major difficulties for the German banking sector but not necessarily for the Irish banking sector.  It is more likely that the problems will cascade and emerge in other countries where borrowers and lenders live and reside.  That does not absolve Ireland of having some role in regulating these companies and activities, but it will require inter-country collaboration.  When one examines a company's structures, one will often find a connection between ownership of an Irish company and the Netherlands or Luxembourg.  Sometimes, all three are involved.  Increasingly, we are noticing that Malta is fitting into complex corporate structures.  Cyprus is important where the regulation of Russian-owned firms is concerned because I suspect that much of the cash that goes into the Russian conduits comes from Cyprus, where many Russian assets are held in banks and so on.  Cyprus has historically been important for Russian banking activities.</p></speech>

In this session, we are meeting officials from the Department of Health to discuss the order passed by the D&aacute;il on 31 May and by the Seanad on 24 May on the proposal that both Houses approve the following regulations in draft: Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95(3)) (Variation of Title: Chiropodist) Regulations 2022.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  From the Department of Health, I welcome Ms Alessandra Fantini, principal officer in the professional regulation unit, and Mr. Aidan Tumbleton, assistant principal officer.

These regulations are being made pursuant to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of the health and social care professionals designated under the Act.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles.  The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act.  Registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to fitness to practise rules similar to those applying to nurses, midwives and doctors.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies and the executive are collectively known as CORU.  The Act prohibits a person whose name is not on the register from using the title of a designated profession and provides that CORU may initiate a criminal prosecution summarily to enforce the prohibition on a designated title's misuse.</p> <p>  When the podiatrists' register completes its two-year transitional period on 31 March 2023, the title of "podiatrist" will be protected.  The Podiatrists Registration Board contacted the Department in 2019 requesting that the title of "chiropodist" also be protected as a variant of podiatrist.  The registration board's view is that the public cannot be adequately protected without protection of this title.  In its correspondence to the Department, the registration board set out a number of reasons for its view.  It stated that many members of the public, particularly the older generation, still use the title "chiropodist", and it is concerned that some of those who will choose to use that title may not have the correct skills to treat patients.  If the title "chiropodist" is not protected in the State, there will be practitioners who may take advantage of this and choose not to register with the regulator but continue to use the title.</p><p>The registration board highlighted that the HSE still uses the title chiropodist for some of its podiatric staff and grading system.  Therefore, the terms continue to be used interchangeably even in the professional field.  This only adds to the likelihood that the public could unwittingly use the services of an unqualified professional.  The fact that a high percentage of these professionals are in private practice raises the risk to the public in this regard.  In short, if the title of chiropodist remains unprotected then those practitioners who do not want to submit to the oversight of a regulator could legally continue to practise using the title and the public could unwittingly continue to use their services.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council would have no powers to initiate a prosecution against the practitioners.<br/><br/>The Department sought the view of one of the main professional bodies - the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists.  The society welcomed the protection of the title chiropodist as a variant of podiatrist and agreed that the two titles are used interchangeably by the public.  It highlighted that the term chiropodist is the original term but the English-speaking world has moved towards the term &quot;podiatry&quot; in the recent past.  The view of the professional regulation unit is, therefore, that the variant title of &quot;chiropodist&quot; should be prescribed in order to protect the public and ensure that its use is restricted to qualified professionals registered with the Podiatrists Registration Board.<br/><br/>Section 95(3) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Health &quot;After consulting the registration board of any designated profession ... and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate, the Minister may, by regulation, prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title specified in that section for the profession&quot;.  <br/><br/>Section 95(7) provides that:</p><blockquote>	A regulation may be made under <i>subsection (3)</i>only if&mdash;  	(<i>a</i>) a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  </blockquote><p>The Podiatrists Registration Board opened its register on 31 March 2021 and the transitional period for existing practitioners to register will end on 31 March 2023.  Once the transitional period ends the title &quot;podiatrist&quot; will become a protected title.  Subject to the approval of the Houses, it is proposed that these regulations will come into effect as soon as possible, which will allow the title &quot;chiropodist&quot; to be protected as soon as the transitional period ends.<br/><br/>I thank everyone for their attention and I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

How did use of the two titles and descriptions come about?  Was it a result of European law, European generated law, the professionals or between the new and old professions here?  I refer to the podiatrist as opposed to the chiropodist.  Who asked to be moved up the line?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Tumbleton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#B00400"><p>To be perfectly honest, I am not 100% sure.  Both titles have been interchangeable for a long time.  The Irish professional group had settled on the title "podiatrist" around the time that the 2005 Act was passed as the title it was going to use in future.  As Ms Fantini has said, there is still a bit of carryover and perhaps a generational thing where some people will still use the title "chiropodist".  I think that the third-level course is now called podiatry but we think, for the protection of the public and to remove ambiguity, we need to cover both titles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#B00500"><p>There is an obvious need to remove any confusion that might arise.  However, it would be helpful if the committee knew who requested, organised and progressed this initially so that we now have two professional descriptions?  We note that the older professional, which is the chiropodist, may or may not have the same qualifications.</p></speech>

It is the same profession but we have two titles that are in common usage.  I think that the title of "podiatrist" was decided on just at the time of Act, and that was the third-level course and that was what it was called but, historically, the two titles have been used interchangeably.  They are used interchangeably in other European jurisdictions so the UK and EU states.</p></speech>

Anybody who wants to practise under those professional titles must be registered with CORU.  If not, then CORU has an enforcement option to take a prosecution for the misuse of a protected title.

What about if someone comes here who is registered in Germany and has a qualification?  Will he or she still be required to register here before setting up a practice?  I ask because I know of instances where people have come here from abroad and set up a practice but I would seriously question whether they have the required qualifications.  For instance, there are people providing scanning services but there does not appear to be a registration system regarding the provision of scanning services.  I have no difficulty with suitably qualified people.  Will qualified people who come here from other European counties be aware that they must register here?  If so, what checks and balances are in place?</p></speech>

CORU will look at their qualification and map it out against the Irish qualification.  If there is a shortfall in training then CORU will offer a period of adaptation or, alternatively, the person can do a competence exam.  If CORU finds that a qualification matches with the Irish qualification then CORU will recognise the EU degree, and allow the professional to register and practise in the State.  Therefore, that professional will appear on the Irish register and the Irish public can check whether his or her qualifications are registered and thus be reassured that a person is a properly qualified practitioner.</p></speech>

In terms of the specific profession, I am not aware of any shortage but we know the agency has embarked on a big recruitment drive across all professions, including health and social care professionals.  It is targeting health and social care professionals to implement the shift to community care that it is trying to effect with the reform of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The number of health and social care professionals in general has increased by 157 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, from the end of December to the end of April.  The agency is addressing recruitment in a number of different ways.  I apologise that I do not have a specific view on shortages.  They have not come to our attention in this particular profession, but I can make inquiries of my colleagues.</p></speech>

I understand it has received approximately 20 inquiries.  The Medical Council of Ireland and the Dental Council of Ireland have both received approximately 100 inquiries from Ukrainian professionals but, as yet, have received no formal applications.  English language ability and qualification recognition will be key to ensuring they are safe to practise.  Departmental officials are actively engaging with the health professional regulators regarding practitioners arriving from Ukraine.  The intention is to ensure that these practitioners will be assisted and facilitated in gaining access to the professional registers, where possible, mindful at all times of the importance of maintaining and promoting public safety.</p> <p>  Departmental officials are part of a co-ordination group established by the European Commission to examine the registration of Ukrainian health and social care professionals arriving in EU states as a result of the conflict.  This group shares knowledge and best practice and is examining methods to streamline and expedite the recognition of Ukrainian professionals, including the use of electronic databases, the EU information centres for academic recognition and machine translation tools.  On top of that, all Irish health regulators have been linking with the Ukrainian Embassy, providing designated points of contact for Ukrainian professionals and translating the information into the Ukrainian language.</p></speech>

The Department has to provide some information in Ukrainian and target it at the various groups.  There are ways and means of doing that.  I am sure the ambassador would be very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

CORU has also put in place many measures to try to expedite and shorten the times.  Normally, somebody would have to apply for recognition of his or her qualification and then the person can register once his or her qualification is recognised.  One of the measures CORU has put in place is to implement a type of parallel track where it tries to ensure that applicants start on both to shorten the timeframes a little.  There also has been an increase in its staffing in respect of recognition and registration in the last number of years.  A backlog arose during the years of the pandemic, but the timing is between eight and 12 weeks.  I do not have the exact figure but I can refer back to you with it, Chairman, because we have it.  I will be happy to do that.</p></speech>

Again, the anecdotal evidence I have is that this is a challenge depending on where one lives.  In rural areas there is probably a smaller chance of chiropodists being in those areas.  Even in urban areas, however, and in Tallaght in my constituency, I have heard of people having difficulty trying to access services.  The importance of it for diabetics, in particular, is that one can lose toes and it is important that people go to qualified people who know what they are doing.  There is also an eye check for diabetics.  It is important that people regularly check their feet, particularly if they have diabetes although there are probably other illnesses as well.</p> <p>  You mentioned that in the legislation it is a criminal offence for those who are not qualified to practise.  Is there a fine as well, and what is it? </p></speech>

The first obstacle that is likely to arise is registration.  Presumably, qualification is the first issue and whether the professional qualification has been achieved.

You might think that this is quite a low level of activity but I believe that what usually is sufficient is that CORU will alert the practitioner and if the practitioner is not aware of the regulations in Ireland, it is sufficient for the enforcement team to contact the practitioner and inform him or her that he or she must go through the process.  In such a case, where it is simply a misunderstanding, it is often not in the public interest to pursue that case all the way to the High Court with all the expenses involved in that.</p><p>I understand that the particular circumstances in those cases warranted pursuing them all the way to the High Court.  It is often sufficient just to engage with the practitioner and to tell them what the rules are in Ireland and that they need to get their qualifications recognised and to get on the register.  However, it is my understanding that they are quite active.</p></speech>

If the individual is to continue operating during two years of court proceedings, however, that could be quite lucrative.  The other area that was pointed out was practitioners not using the title.  I assume they could call themselves foot care practitioners or whatever.  That is where the wriggle room is within the law, but I do not see that could be legislated for.</p></speech>

People often ask why we do not regulate by scope of practice but the reality is that many CORU professions, and medical professions generally, have overlapping scopes of practice, which makes that simply not possible.  In addition, the scope of practice in emerging professions will develop and change over time, often quite rapidly.  We protect by title because it is what we can hang the regulation on.  We then rely on public information campaigns and customer empowerment.  We tell people that these professions are regulated and that they should check the register.  That is what we rely on.</p></speech>

There was an issue a number of years ago with regard to physical therapists and physiotherapists.  Is there any similarity between that issue and the matter we are discussing today?</p></speech>

That is what we are trying to accomplish here.  Thinking back to Deputy Durkan's question, that was more problematic because there was a distinct group of practitioners who were practising as physical therapists and who had a slightly different scope from that of physiotherapists.  That does not arise in this case.  The same professionals are using the titles "chiropodist" and "podiatrist" interchangeably.  It is the same legislation but, if we look at the nuances, we can see that it is a different issue.  I would say that this is a lot less problematic or complex.</p></speech>

If someone goes in for an appointment and it lasts ten minutes while another person goes in for an hour, they will still be charged the same amount.  Again, I have no experience in this area but I am told that some practices operate like factories and just churn out patients.  I assume there are standards within the profession.  You also learn not to go back to that individual.</p></speech>

What the registration board is going to do is to set the entry-level standard for education so any Irish customer going to see a chiropodist or podiatrist will know that person has been educated to the appropriate level to be a safe practitioner.  They will also know that the practitioner has signed up to a professional code of conduct to which they are held accountable and that he or she is engaged in continuing professional development.  People will also know that any practitioner who engages in professional misconduct or whose professional performance is poor will be subject to enforcement measures such as fitness-to-practise hearings.  The Irish public will have that assurance once the register opens.</p></speech>

The Hepatitis C Partnership is a national network of stakeholders working towards the elimination of hepatitis C in Ireland.  It is our mission to end suffering, illness and death associated with hepatitis C.  We want to ensure that everyone has access to life saving treatment for hepatitis C.  Our members represent the statutory as well as the community and voluntary sectors with patient involvement at its centre.<br/><br/>Hepatitis C is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus.  If left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to the liver over many years.  Most people become infected with the hepatitis C virus by sharing needles or other equipment used to prepare and inject drugs.  From 2004 to 2019, 15,700 people in Ireland were diagnosed with hepatitis C.  Each year, 600 to 700 people find out they have hepatitis C.  There could be as many as 30,000 people in Ireland living with the virus.  To date, more than 5,000 patients have been treated with highly effective direct acting antiretrovirals, DAA&rsquo;s, for hepatitis C.  Many of these people were treated successfully.With a cure rate of approximately 96%, these highly effective drugs with minimal side effects transformed hepatitis C virus care globally. <br/><br/>Reflecting on the scale and impact of medical advancements as a utility of quality-of-life improvements for people living with hepatitis C we had an opportunity in the later part of 2021 to provide a platform for a range of stakeholders to share their insights and experiences across the hepatitis C care cascade, that is, testing, diagnosis, linkage to care, and living hepatitis C-free.  There are opportunities for growth as well as models of success across the provision of community care.  The report has outlines some key issues.  We have provided the committee with a more detailed written submission and here we will focus on three of them: first, understanding the challenge region by region; second, building pathways to support elimination in a sustainable way; and, third, driving hepatitis C elimination.<br/><br/>Understanding the challenge of addressing hepatitis C on a regional basis allows for the creation of community-based models of care with specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely, SMART, objectives for each county.  A named mode of delivery linked to the wider network provides opportunities for knowledge sharing and nuanced approaches.The national hepatitis C treatment programme, NHCTP, has already done a significant amount of work on a strategic plan, which is currently being reviewed by the relevant Government stakeholders.  The national and regional implementation plans should be developed in a manner consistent with the overall strategic plan.<br/><br/>The first recommendation is to establish regional needs with regional experts and identify any specific challenges in different regional areas considering at-risk cohorts, likely burden of disease, accessibility, and resource needs across the cascade of care.  The second recommendation is to set national and regional implementation plans and assign ownership to a named role for delivery, both regionally and nationally, and set SMART objectives for implementation.<br/><br/>I now turn to the second theme of building pathways to support elimination in a sustainable way.  There is an inequality in access to hepatitis C care as it is largely dependent on where you live and your characteristics as a patient.  Every effort should be made to create a policy framework that is driven by the need to test and treat as flexibly and locally as possible, to realise Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s vision for equality in the context of liver care.  This system should be tailored for specific regional needs but generally built around a flexible hub-and-spoke model with a strong patient-centred ethos, recognising that many people living with hep C may have experienced significant trauma in their lives.<br/><br/>On the third recommendation to unblock existing policy barriers and set policy to enable elimination, we should remove the requirement that patients need to be engaged with opioid substitution treatment to be treated in the community by their GPs and broaden the range of testing opportunities by enabling a diverse range of community testing initiatives.<br/><br/>On the fourth recommendation that we should build a community-based, nurse- and peer-led system to drive elimination, we want to use existing hospital-based consultant-led services in each regional area as hubs and existing community services such as opiate substitute treatment, OST, clinics and GP-led services as spokes.  Recognising the pressures that hospital and community professionals are under, support should be flexible and <i>ad hoc</i>, and it should leverage online tools, such as teleconferencing and emails, as a preference.  It should include paid peer workers with relevant lived experience to provide community-based testing, and patient support across the cascade, learning from the positive experience of the model in place at the Mater hospital in Dublin.<br/><br/>The fifth recommendation involves ensuring utility beyond hepatitis C.  We must ensure that the system has a role in addressing longer-term liver care in Ireland after the initial push to eliminate hepatitis C.  When a suitable system is in place to drive hepatitis C elimination, we need to help people access it.  Some people who are treated for Hepatitis C will have ongoing liver-care needs, will continue to be exposed to risk factors post-treatment, or will have other issues in their lives around which they seek support.  The drive to eliminate Hepatitis C should be seen as an opportunity to link people to formal systems of care.<br/><br/>The sixth recommendation is to find the missing thousands.  We want to ensure widespread and sustained public health promotion campaigns targeted at the missing thousands who are currently living with undiagnosed hepatitis C in our communities.</p><p>These campaigns should include a strong peer-led outreach component and can focus on the positive impact of addressing hepatitis C in the community.</p><p> Finally, recommendation 7 is focused on supporting good longer-term outcomes.  People who access treatment and require additional inputs, such as around housing, employment, education or psychosocial support, should be helped to access those supports as needed as part of the recovery capital approach.</p><p> I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today's session, and its attention to these important issues.  My colleague, Mr. Lawrence Murphy, a hepatitis C project worker, will now conclude our opening statement.</p></speech>

I am a project worker with the Hepatitis C Partnership.  Briefly, this is the story of my lived experience.</p> <p>  I first got my bloods tested in the late 1990s.  I was not even thinking about hepatitis C at that time.  It was not on my radar at all.  To be honest, I only got tested because there was mass testing at the addiction services, which I attended and which I am thankful for today.  I had no idea that I would get a positive result for what was at the time a lifelong illness.  After the initial anger and shock, I put it to the back of my mind.  I did not take much heed of it for a while.  The way I was told was that I had not got HIV; I had only got hepatitis C.  The information I was given was that it was a slowly progressing illness and it would not affect me for ten or 20 years.</p> <p>  In the circumstances I was in at the time, there was huge stigma and a lack of information.  There was minimum support around getting diagnosed, living with it and protecting others.  I did not know anything about hepatitis C at the time.  All I knew was that you do not tell anyone you have it and you do not talk about it.  Seven or eight years passed before I began to think of addressing it.  I realised that the hepatitis C diagnosis I had been ignoring was not a good thing to have.  I suddenly felt as if there was an intruder in my body.  I was in a different chapter of my life then and I began to comprehend the severity of living with this potentially life-threatening illness.  I sought out information on the disease and its treatment.  My fears around passing it on to loved ones were in the forefront of my mind.  It was a dirty and uneasy feeling, and it began to haunt me.</p> <p>  One of the big issues with hepatitis C was that, initially, I did not have any symptoms and it was easy for me to put it to the back of my mind.  The realisation was simple.  Hepatitis C was attacking my body, whether I was showing signs or not.  I had begun to start thinking about my well-being and quality of life.  I started to appreciate life and I wanted to keep going down this positive path.  The stigma of hepatitis C is very difficult.  You do not look sick.  It can be easy to almost forget about it until something happens, which for me would be when I was brushing my teeth or if I had an accident and any cuts.  I would react badly and would not want anyone to come near me.  I felt contagious and like an outcast.</p> <p>  I began treatment with the first batch of direct-acting antiviral drugs, DAAs.  I successfully completed this treatment in 2014.  When I got my first negative sustained virologic response, SVR, which meant there was no virus present in my blood, I felt relieved.  It was hard to believe that it was actually over.  It was surreal.  I asked myself if it could be real that I was actually cured, and that I no longer felt infectious or a risk to others.  I did not realise at the time that I could use my lived experience as a positive tool to support others in similar circumstances.  In my current role within the Hepatitis C Partnership, and my previous role working directly to support individuals accessing treatment as an outreach peer worker, I drew upon these experiences to relate to individuals in an empathetic way to offer support and encouragement for others choosing treatment.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today's session and for the opportunity to share my lived experience.</p></speech>

It cannot be easy to outline one's own story but I appreciate Mr. Murphy outlining his story to us today.  I am conscious that in a previous generation there were people who got hepatitis C from contaminated blood products through no fault of their own.  Some of their relatives listening at home are probably upset that this issue is being discussed here today.</p> <p>  I will call Deputy Shortall, first, because Dr. Austin O'Carroll is only able to stay with us for a number of minutes.  Deputy Shortall has a number of questions for Dr. O'Carroll.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#F00400"><p>I thank the Chair and thank our guests for the presentation.  I have a couple of questions for Dr. O'Carroll, if that is all right.</p> <p>  One of the recommendations is to include properly resourced GPs who can treat hepatitis C among any community-based population.  What would it entail, in Dr. O'Carroll's experience, to resource GPs properly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Austin O'Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#F00500"><p>I thank Deputy Shortall and the Chairman.  The issue is that certain populations that are prone to hepatitis C, such as people who use drugs, traditionally tend to avoid mainstream services.  For example, I had 40 people in my clinic for homeless people who needed treatment for hepatitis C.  I referred 40, but 23 missed their first appointment and 16 missed their second appointment and we ended up only getting three treated.  We set up a shared care programme with the Mater hospital - this was before GPs were being allowed to treat.  We brought the treatment to the clinic using a hepatitis C nurse and we actually got all those 40 people treated on site.</p> <p>  Since then, GPs have been allowed to prescribe and we are able to do that prescription ourselves.  It means that instead of referring people who come into hospital, as they are unlikely to get the hospital appointment letter in the first place, they do not keep regular lives and they do not tend to keep appointments, we can get them on the treatment then and there, get their bloods done, get their tests done and get the treatment prescribed in the pharmacy.  If they are on other medication, such as opiate substitution treatment, we can get it prescribed with that.  It is much more efficient in getting to a group who tend to avoid secondary care.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#F00600"><p>Does that entail a GP being linked in to a clinic in a hospital, going on Dr. O'Carroll's experience which has been successful with that cohort of patients?  In the general run of GPs, are there steps that can be taken to create a better awareness among GPs and stress the importance of testing?</p></speech>

The first issue is that there is definitely a lack of awareness among GPs.  I have always believed that, particularly down the country, GPs will avoid treating drug users.  Personally, I believe it should not be a matter of choice.  One is more likely to die of drug use than of diabetes.  The problem is if GPs are avoiding treating this particular section of the population, there will be a group of people with hepatitis C who are not accessing proper primary care services.  Opiate substitution treatment is an optional service and there are big black areas down the country where one cannot access treatment.  I have dealt with a number of people who have come up from the country to become homeless so that they could access both opiate substitution treatment and hepatitis C treatment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Austin O'Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#F00900"><p>Targeting the high-risk groups is probably a more effective policy than doing a standard blood test across the population, but when we say "high-risk" we have a low threshold for high risk.  GPs are saying that one should lower the barrier for testing for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  The high-risk cohort could include teenagers who may be in one's area - there may be a risk that they are engaged in drugs.  They are probably not, but one should still have a low threshold for doing the tests.  I would not test everybody, but I would create an awareness among GPs to have a low threshold for doing the tests.  We do them very frequently now in our practice.</p></speech>

Is there a substantial additional cost in testing for hepatitis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Austin O'Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#G00200"><p>I do not know the exact costs for testing.  All these tests cost money.  We are always balancing the cost of testing for hepatitis C against the cost of treating a patient.  The problem is that if people are not tested and cases are not picked up, firstly, those people will go on to develop cirrhosis, which is incredibly expensive to treat.  Liver transplants are phenomenally expensive.  Secondly, those people are likely to become spreaders of hepatitis C.  There is a cost involved in testing.  I do not know the exact cost, but it is not a particularly expensive test.  The costs of not testing are significant.</p></speech>

I have not heard of people asking for that.  I tend to think it is best to test the high-risk groups, but to have a low threshold for what is considered to be high risk.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of prison services and access to treatment in the prison system.  My understanding is that in some prisons people have to attend clinics in hospitals, which is obviously one of the problems in respect of whether we are rolling out a comprehensive service in all of our prisons for testing and providing a treatment programme for those who are affected by the disease.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Austin O'Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#G00700"><p>I will put my hands up and admit that I am not an expert in prison health.  I think access to treatment may vary from prison to prison.  I know that there is access to treatment in some prisons.  I cannot say that about all prisons.  I am sure there are some cases where prisoners have to go to hospital.  The provision of treatment on site is a much more efficient way of treating these people.  Anything that gets people treated quickly and efficiently should be done.</p></speech>

We know from the system that the treatment does not need to be provided in secondary care centres.  It can be done in primary care settings.  I fully support making the treatment accessible on site in prisons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Perry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#G01000"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  To add to what Dr. O'Carroll has said, I feel from my position that treatment anywhere and for any population is a positive thing.  However, rather like the findings of the report, I would say there is a disparity in terms of equality of care depending on where people are based.  My understanding is that the situation within the prison system is similar.  For example, as I clarified with a colleague in the Prison Service yesterday, if a person is currently in a Dublin-based prison, there is availability of treatment and an effective programme.  As Dr. O'Carroll said, secondary care is not required and those undergoing treatment do not need to leave the prison system to attend hospital, unless they are particularly sick, which is rare.  In respect of Cork, it was announced last summer that the national hepatitis C programme would endeavour to introduce a programme there.  That has not worked for staffing and resource issues.  The provision of treatment in the prison setting is a fantastic opportunity.  It is something that could be considered when looking at the prevalence of hepatitis C and where case numbers are higher.  Prisons would be one of those settings, but again, it comes back to the question of where people are based.</p></speech>

Has there been engagement with all the doctors within the prison system to enable us to set up a clear programme of action?  On the Cork issue, I suggest that it might be helpful for us, as members of the committee, to get information on why the programme has not been rolled out, even though it was planned.  There is no point in announcing the roll-out of a programme if we are to find out six months later that it is not happening.  The witnesses may not have the relevant information, but perhaps they can advise us on to whom we should write to get the information on why the programme is not in place.</p></speech>

The Hepatitis C Partnership is an attending member of the national hepatitis C treatment programme, which oversees the treatment of the disease for the island.  I was at a meeting last week where the issue of resourcing in prisons outside of Dublin was discussed.  That is how I know that the information I have provided is correct.  For detailed information on why it has happened and for clarification on the matter, the committee could contact the national hepatitis C treatment programme.</p></speech>

How could we start that work in real terms?  What decisive action needs to be taken to try to identify those who have hepatitis C?</p></speech>

The recommendations that we outline in the report are largely set out in a stepwise manner.  The first difficulty is in identifying what the challenge is in each particular region.  From talking to people, I do not think that the burden of the disease is likely to be exactly the same from place to place.  As Dr. O'Carroll has said, it is probably not a worthwhile endeavour to try to test everybody.  First of all, the issue is understanding how the burden of the disease is likely to be distributed across Ireland, working with experts on the ground who are able to tell us what it looks like from their perspective.  It might be that the burden of the disease lies with groups of people who are using drugs intravenously.  The burden may lie with people who come from communities that have high levels of hepatitis C.  The focus may need to be placed there.  The response must be varied based on the distribution of the burden of the disease.  Once we have that information and know exactly what it looks like, it is a matter of putting in place the resources and the plan to implement it.</p></speech>

It was an overbearing feeling that this may be something that was going to affect me and the loved ones around me.  The information I received was minimal at the time.  This is not to say the information was not there.  My way of sourcing the information was not as astute as it could have been.  When I started to get more information and when more campaigns around hepatitis C began, I really started to feel more contagious and more overburdened by the prospect of carrying this lifelong illness.</p></speech>

When I became aware that there was a cure for this illness, put myself forward and got a chance on a trial basis to use the DAA drugs, I was quite apprehensive and unsure about the outcome.  I started to see the outcome.  Every time I got tested, I saw that the virus was leaving my body and was being reduced.  When I got the sustained virus response, SVR, and was cured of hepatitis, it was a surreal moment.  It was something I never thought would happen.  It did not feel real but it has had a massive impact on me.  It has also shaped the way I work with people.</p></speech>

How effective does he think the State's needle exchange programme is?  Does it work effectively?

As the Deputy probably heard before, hepatitis C had a nickname - the silent killer - because nobody talked about it.  Nobody ever disclosed that they had it.  It was not something that you would be asked about if you went to one of these services the Deputy referred to.  People just went to those services to get the equipment they needed and then left.  There was not much talk about blood-borne viruses and the opportunities to get tested were minimal.  The opportunities can still be minimal.  It depends on where you live.</p></speech>

The profile here would be quite similar to that in western Europe, although there are other routes.  The Chairman mentioned the issue of contaminated blood and blood products, which had a significant impact on a cohort of people and their families, earlier.  Since 1992, blood and blood products have been tested so that is no longer a concern.  There is a small chance of sexual transmission, there is also the risk of mother-to-child vertical transmission and there are some figures around tattooing in unlicensed or unregulated premises.  There is also a culture of people using steroids and needles in gyms and fitness locations so that has been seen as another route.  Around 7% of people, a figure that is consistent globally, who are infected with hepatitis C who do not really know where they got it.  They do not have what we would phrase as a risk behaviour in which they engaged.</p></speech>

That is why I tried to be very clear.  We are usually talking about unregulated or unlicensed institutions.  Tattoos in prisons can be quite normal culturally.  The way hepatitis C is spread from one infected individual to someone who is not infected is by a blood-to-blood transmission.  When there is any avenue for that transmission to take place, there can be a risk if the individual is infected.  What we are looking at is tattooing.  Needles tend to come out of the ink into the individual and if that ink or needle is not replaced or sterilised, there is a risk.</p></speech>

There are a number of drivers behind it.  It is not difficult to understand if you look at how services are distributed.  Of the eight hospitals that treat hepatitis C in the country, five are in Dublin.  If you live in Dublin, you will be close to one of these hospitals and on a good public transport network so you will find it easier to live.  People in Dublin live closer to hospitals than people in the country.  Geographic distance is a large driver in terms of accessibility.  We spoke with people with lived experience who were living on the other side of the country and ended up having to travel to Dublin to access treatment .  The committee heard Dr. O'Carroll speak earlier about the links with the Mater Hospital.</p><p>I spoke to someone based in Dublin who had an incredible experience because they were able to access treatment locally.  A major driver is the fact that, on average, people in the country live further away from hospital-based care than people in Dublin.  This is one of the real issues driving the need to be able to deliver care in the community, and use a peer-led and nurse-led network to reach and treat people. </p></speech>

What is the typical care plan?  Does it involve regular visits to get treatment or is the treatment self-administered?  Does the treatment have to be administered by a nurse or doctor?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1395" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#J00300"><p>It depends.  It usually involves a certain number of visits to the hospital.  There might be people coming to do tests during the treatment process and they need to come up to hospital and get their medication through the hospital pharmacy.  That itself is a barrier.  There needs to be wider access generally in the community.  That is one part of it.  A person in the west might be coming up to Dublin three or four times over the course of the treatment.  Having to travel for treatment also has an impact on people's lives.  There are quotes in the report from people on this.  If someone is travelling for treatment it is not a case of just getting on a bus outside their house and then getting off outside the hospital.  They are getting up at 5.30 in the morning to get a bus, then a train and then a taxi to get to the hospital and then come back again.  It is a multiplier effect in that regard.  The further people are from hospital-based care, the more difficult it is to access that.  So much care for hepatitis C is still based in the hospital environment and that is why there needs to be a push to make things much more accessible in the community, delivered close to where people live.</p></speech>

I am not a clinician but from having spoken to a lot of clinicians about the issue, it seems it is something that can be delivered quite easily in the community.  There will always be people with complicating factors, such as cirrhosis, who will need to be dealt with under the care of a consultant through the hospital system.  For the vast majority of people, this is something that can be treated safely and easily in community settings.</p></speech>

I will focus on a number of areas, namely, prevention, elimination and treatment.  I will start with elimination.  This was mentioned quite a lot in the opening statement.  The World Health Organization is committed to a target of elimination by 2030.  Different things are said in the opening statement.  It seems to suggest Ireland's elimination progress could be pushed out to 2050 but elsewhere it says we could be on track for 2030.  Which is it?  Are we on track for that target of elimination by 2030?</p></speech>

I have no reason to doubt that that is absolutely true, or was true at that time.  The challenge now is whether that is still true.  When you start to treat something and start to have a push for it, there are a group of people already engaged in the system who you know require treatment.  It is relatively easy to reach that group of people.  The challenge arises when you have dealt with that group of people because then you have to try to reach the group of people who may not know they have hepatitis C.  This is what the 2021 paper was looking at.  It looked at a number of developed countries and could see Ireland being well behind these targets.</p></speech>

In order to do that, we first need to explicitly state that it is those World Health Organization targets we are going after.  If we look at the historical development of policy, we can see that the national treatment programme and the advisory groups that support it were set up at a time that predated the World Health Organization setting these goals.  When they were set up these may not have been explicit targets.  Now that the World Health Organization has set those targets, these are the things we need to be explicitly driving towards and we need a coherent strategy to be able to do that.  That is what the recommendations are aimed towards.</p></speech>

I do not think anyone could argue against that.  Given that over the next number of years we are hopefully going to see the establishment of regional health areas, which will align CHOs with hospital groups and result in much more streamlined and integrated healthcare, what kind of structure or model does Mr. Keane envisage on this issue to fit into regional health areas when they are established?  That will obviously take some time but he spoke about regional experts and regional structures.  What kind of structures are they?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#J01100"><p>In the initial part, the regional experts are to advise on what the burden of disease is.  They will need to establish whether it is predominantly within the group of people who use drugs or if there are other communities we need to consider, because when having peers and nurses on the ground who can reach those communities, they might need a different skill set.  More broadly, for reaching the regional areas, we are advocating for a hub-and-spoke network where the vast majority of treatment would be delivered in the community with nurses and peers reaching people on the ground and with support through GPs and clinics and then through hospitals and hospital consultants as needed.  That type of model is what would be needed in each region.</p></speech>

The witnesses will be aware that there were statutory entitlements for those who contracted or were infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions.  There is a range of statutory medical supports there.  One was the two-week rule whereby they would be seen by a specialist, and a rheumatologist in particular, within the first two weeks of seeking care.  That is not happening.  I have dealt with a lot of families over the last while and some of them have written to this committee.  One of the groups, Transfusion Positive, has lobbied the committee on this issue as well.  They are seeking access to audiology services, chiropody, physiotherapy, consultants, dental services, GP services and probably much more.  These are statutory entitlements yet these people are not getting them.  What chance then do others who do not have the same statutory entitlements have?  Within that model Mr. Keane spoke about, how does he envisage the HSE can be better equipped to deal with those services?  Are there capacity issues in some of these areas as well, specifically around some of those needs hepatitis C patients would have?  It is not just about the model; it is also about timely access.  The model is important but it is also about getting access.  If those who have statutory entitlements are not getting access to services, that troubles me.</p></speech>

There is an issue with capacity in the system that needs to be looked at.</p><p>When we spoke to hospital doctors and GPs in the community one of the things that was coming back very clearly was whatever the solution is to this issue, to reaching people in the community, it is not something that is going to be dealt with by the hospitals or the GP network alone.  There are people who are working in hospitals who cannot get on GPs' books, so it is a real challenge.  The solution to that is we need to look to peers and we need to look to people with lived experience who can reach into those communities and connect with people and support them to access treatment.  We need to look at making things much easier to access, much more community-based and much more nurse- and peer-led, rather than relying on the medical aspects of care.</p></speech>

As Mr. Keane rightly said, that was 2020, even though the programme asserted it again earlier this year.  The other one is international research done on modelling data.  Essentially, they look at things like incidences of disease, screening of disease, treatment rates and then from that they extrapolate what the outcome looks like.  To note something quite clear - and I am aware I am talking about the period under Covid - in 2020 the treatment programme treated 532 people.  Also in 2020, we had 326 new notifications of people becoming newly infected or newly tested.  My maths is not brilliant but I did it earlier and we cleared 206 people off the table, if you like.  If you look at the same figure for 2021 we took 179 off the rate.  You can compare that against the idea, which is well-researched in the absence of a full screening programme, which is not financially viable, that we know we have somewhere between 20,000 to 30,000 people living with untreated hepatitis C in Ireland today.  If we are looking at an elimination date of 2030 and you look at those figures - I know of course under Covid they would be higher - as you would be looking at us having eight years, you probably need to be treating a minimum of 3,000 people per year just to make that target.  Without it becoming a sort of he-said-she-said piece, if we look at how many notifications we get, how many we are treating and compare them against our understanding of the numbers here, then that gives us a slightly different picture than that we are on target.</p></speech>

I am interested in recommendation 3, which is "Unblock existing policy barriers, and set policy to enable elimination".  How is policy being set at the moment?

Under the national hepatitis C treatment programme, you have the programme advisory group and the clinical advisory group.  The policy barriers are not intentional and are not things that have been set up to frustrate the system; they are legacy issues.  There are examples of them having been dealt with in some locations and in certain circumstances but it is not consistent across the country.  I will give a couple of examples.  It is not consistently the case that medication is available through community pharmacies.  In some places it is still just coming through hospital pharmacies which is obviously a barrier to care for people.  Similarly, in Dublin we have very good examples of care.  We have nurses who do phlebotomy in the community, peers who can do testing in the community and link people very quickly to hospital care if they need it.  We can contrast that with experiences outside Dublin.  I spoke to some people where the situation was that a GP could test in the community but there was one test that needed to be done in a lab and the lab would only accept it if it had been signed off by the consultant.  That leads to a narrowing of the pipe where people must pass through a consultant's books in order to get tested.  It is about removing those types of barriers that may have made sense at some stage in the past but do not any more.</p></speech>

I will come to that question in one moment but to return to her previous question that Mr. Keane addressed, when we are talking about policy barriers, he has addressed quite clearly where they lie and where they do not.  Again, there is significant regional disparity.  As I said, we do not really see it now, especially since doing this report, as urban versus rural but more Dublin and everywhere else, to be perfectly honest.  It was a little more stark than we had realised before we started to do the research.</p> <p>  On the policy, the clinical guidelines for managing hepatitis C treatment are set by the clinical advisory group to the national hepatitis C treatment programme.  To be clear, we are a member of the national hepatitis C treatment programme as the general oversight but as we are not clinicians, we do not sit on the clinical advisory group.  They put a lot of policy and guidelines in place.  Some were led by international best practice and some clearly were to fit the context of Ireland today but we had a lot of people who were waiting for treatment back in say, 2014 to 2016.  The treatment landscape changed and became much easier to access and much more accessible.  Many of those people, as Deputy Cullinane mentioned earlier, were those who had been impacted by the infected blood products and who had been infected through haemophilia treatment.  They were treated quite quickly.  They had all been waiting for treatment.  The rest of the bulk of the people were those who had been infected through intravenous drug use, many of whom also were waiting and they were treated.  There was this huge bulk and much policy was built around intravenous drug use, which on one level makes complete sense because it is the bulk of the numbers but then it excludes people who do not fall into that category.  One of the biggest policy blocks we see and which is referred to frequently and on which we get feedback from patients is that if you are undergoing the services of an opiate substitute treatment, OST, programme and you receive methadone, your pathway to treatment is incredibly straightforward and simple-----</p></speech>

If you are an individual who has tested positive for hepatitis C but is not in receipt of an OST programme, then in order for a clinician to get permission to treat you, they must get a one-off permission given by the clinical advisory group.</p></speech>

In the European context, Scotland has been very effective and is reportedly on target to have met the World Health Organization's guidelines by 2024, which is a number of years ahead of target.  As for the way Scotland has done that, there are policy documents published about it.  It has looked to increase community access, to make things as accessible as possible for people, to set micro-elimination targets so to be able to encourage clinicians and healthcare professionals to work towards these clearly identifiable numerical targets, having those targets published and visible.  Scotland is therefore a good example to consider in the European context.  Egypt has also done a huge amount of work on hepatitis C elimination.  There are examples of good practice out there that we can draw on.  The recommendations we make speak to that and look to driving towards that.</p></speech>

Then there are what are termed risk behaviours.  People need to be aware of risk behaviours, that is, things they may have done in the past.  That may be getting a tattoo in an unlicensed setting or what is colloquially referred to as dabbling in drugs.  They may have used drugs, not necessarily in an ongoing setting, or done something when they were young once or twice without thinking about it.  We come across that in our day-to-day support of people, who come in to talk to us.  They have got a positive hepatitis C test result, they have no idea how they might have got it and then we may start to talk through some things with them and there is a recollection that perhaps 20 years ago they did something that could have been the risk number.  Deputy Durkan is right that there could be, and there are, a considerable number of people who may have hepatitis but who do not know it.  The only way they will know for sure is to test.  That is a simple black line.  You test and you know; if you do not test, you do not know and it is only suspicion or concern.</p></speech>

There is a pilot test to go ahead, the Deputy is quite correct, with apparently 1,000 test kits.  The structure for that to be rolled out is not in place yet.  The national hepatitis C treatment programme is apparently in discussions as we speak as to what that might look like.  The current prediction is that it will probably be rolled out in the first quarter of 2023 because they need to look at some governance issues as to how that will work.  Speaking just from my perspective, while at-home testing and anything that increases people's ability to test is clearly a positive thing, one would have to ensure full good governance and an ethical position that there is a clear pathway to follow up, that is, we would not ever want somebody to be at home by themselves finding out that they have got a positive result without a very clear pathway as to how that care pathway could be followed up.</p></speech>

Their number one concern in that regard was reaching everybody who needs to be tested for hepatitis C,  More of them were concerned with that issue than the other four issues put together.  They are absolutely aware of that challenge and the need to meet it.  That came back strongly through the consultation.  What also came back was the understanding that the system in place at the moment is not sufficient to meet the needs of everybody who needs to be tested.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the advice for members of the community who may be listening to these proceedings, may be hearing about this for the first time and may be concerned.  When we spoke to the public, we saw that there is a big knowledge gap.  More than 50% of people did not know what hepatitis C is and only one third knew where to get tested.  What people could do is to go to the website of the national treatment programme, which has a list of characteristics relating to people who might be at risk.  They could then take action based on that and follow the advice in respect of getting tested, as Ms Perry stated.  However, even if everybody in the country who needs to be tested did that and got tested, the system would struggle, for several reasons, to be able to link everybody in to treatment effectively.  To go back to the Deputy's original question, the medical professionals to whom we spoke were acutely aware of both those challenges, namely, reaching everybody and, if that is achieved, providing treatment to them all.</p></speech>

It depends where the person is.  If a person is based near Dublin city centre and can link in with a peer worker from the Mater hospital, to a network there or with Dr. O'Carroll, that is great.  He or she will receive top-of-the-line care and move quickly through the system.  That changes, however, if the person is located in a more rural area that is away from an urban centre.  There may be barriers to accessing community testing in such areas and the person might have to go to a hospital to get tested.  It is a barrier if the person has to travel for an hour or whatever it is to get to the hospital.  The split or disparity in terms of accessibility within Dublin and outside Dublin is a real issue.</p></speech>

How serious is the issue of access to testing and treatment outside of Dublin for both categories, that is, those with drug addiction problems in the past or present and those without such problems?</p></speech>

There are those accessibility issues that need to be solved and they are compounded by capacity issues.  Even if it is possible to make testing accessible, how can the capacity in the system be filled out to make sure people can be reached, linked into services appropriately and supported through the treatment process?  Another concern for clinicians and people working in healthcare is the drop-off between diagnosis and care and then sustaining care and getting out the other end.  There is a need to support people through the whole process.</p></speech>

We try.  I thank our guests.  I was following the meeting from my office but decided it would be more polite to come down to the committee room.  It is always good to see the white of a person's eyes when one is speaking to him or her.</p> <p>  I have read our guests' opening statements.  I am not an expert on hepatitis C, but we have often heard about it through the years.  The prospect of eradicating any such condition is fantastic.  I have been enlightened by our guests opening statements and the debate thus far.  Ms Perry referred to collecting regional data and regional testing.  I ask her to talk us through that.  It seems to be a feature of healthcare.  Obviously, healthcare is broken down into regions.  Is there currently variance in terms of what is happening in different parts of Ireland?  Is there best and worst practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Perry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#M01300"><p>Absolutely, yes.  We should start from the point that there is good reason that the services tend to be centred in Dublin, aside from it being the capital.  My colleague, Mr. Keane, referred to five of the eight hepatology units in the country being in Dublin.  Clearly, that is part of the issue.  Second, there is the issue of what clinicians refer to as the burden of disease.  Approximately 70% of those who have hepatitis C - known or unknown - are based in the Dublin region or on the east coast.  That makes sense.</p> <p>  In the context of the regions, unless one has a clear understanding of how many people in a region need testing or care relating to their treatments, one does not know what resources need to be put into the regions.  Each of the regions is different.  Let us take the south east, for example.  It has a profile and a population but it does not look like what we have here in Dublin.  We would need to know, for example, whether another clinical nurse specialist is needed, or an additional consultant.  There are no consultants currently based in the south east.  One would have to know whether there is a need to employ a peer worker.  We need to know the numbers with which we are dealing.  There is no point throwing resources at an area unless one is clear about what is the burden of disease.   That is important not only for the individual being able to access treatment when it is needed, it is also important that we use those data to plan the services and what they will look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#M01400"><p>Ms Perry answered that question very well.  It has been eye-opening for me because I have spoken with addicts in Dublin, down by needle exchanges and methadone clinics.  I always assumed that those one may meet outside one of those centres are born-and-bred Dublin people but many are not.  Their addiction journey has taken them to the capital out of desperation and because the supports offered in Dublin are better.  There is no regional support network of any significance around Ireland.  One would often  meet people from my county of Clare, or from Offaly or Cork, outside those centres here in Dublin.  The accents are very different.  One would expect the guys and girls one meets there to be Dublin people but that is not the case.</p> <p>  As regards those who undergo testing, obviously a test captures a moment in time.  A person may test negative but have a positive test a few months later.  How well does all that feed into the process?  I ask that because I recently became aware of a person in my home county who had cancer - this is a different realm of healthcare - but is now going through a totally different treatment regime for a different health issue.  It was only when the family stated while he or she was being discharged that this poor unfortunate person had previously had cancer that the care team became aware that was the case.</p><p>It is unbelievable that at times in Ireland people have been tested or have had a diagnosis confirmed but that record does not necessarily travel with them.  Much of that is due to the fact that we are still on a paper system and digital records are not shared between health services.  Our test results are not uploaded to some central database so that when somebody is admitted to hospital, that information is at everyone's disposal.</p></speech>

Hepatitis C has required mandatory notification since 2004, which means that in any setting where someone tests positive, it must be notified to the health promotion surveillance centre to keep records that help with planning and understanding the epidemiology.  The figures will be there.  The figures are also held on what is called a national treatment registry for hepatitis C that is taken care of within St. James's Hospital in Dublin.  My understanding is that there is no issue with any of those.  They work effectively and the numbers are clear.  However, they are what they are.  They are numbers.  If someone tests in a centre in Dublin, I would hazard a guess that the information is not always carried back to a GP in Clare or Waterford.</p></speech>

What we have discussed for the past two minutes could slot into any discussion about healthcare at this committee.  The transfer of information does not happen as succinctly as it ought to, unfortunately.  Mr. Murphy and Mr. Keane may jump in at any point.  I am homing in on some aspects of Ms Perry's presentation but our other guests are welcome to jump in at any point.</p> <p>  The report referred to the missing thousands.  Many people need testing and we need to capture their health data and treat them.  These are vulnerable people and they are not always the easiest people to get into a hospital environment or a testing environment.  Is a liver function test one of the required gateways before a person can be tested for hepatitis C?</p></speech>

The test for hepatitis C is a two-step test.  It is fairly straightforward.  I will note that I am not a clinician and there are no clinicians in the room.  However, I understand the first test searches for hepatitis C antibodies which means that at some point, a patient has had exposure to the disease.  That does not mean the patient has the disease.  The second test is a blood test that shows the presence or absence of a living virus within a patient's body.  A positive result in that test means the patient has the disease and there is no doubt about it.  For one in five people, their own immune system will clear that infection.  That does happen, which is a positive.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for everything they are doing.  The committee will support them in every way it can.  Is there any EU country or other country in the world at which we should be looking for best practice?  Are some countries a little ahead of us and doing this successfully?</p></speech>

That point was raised by Deputy Shortall earlier.  Scotland has done fantastic work.  The UK in general is doing well but Scotland is a good comparator because the population profile is quite similar, as are the numbers of cases with which it is dealing.  The services are similar and the countries are similar culturally.  We have invited experts from Scotland to come to speak to us many times in order to help us formulate our strategies.  Mr. Keane or Mr. Murphy may wish to add to what I have said.  I would recommend we look to Scotland.</p></speech>

It is always great to hear lived experience because it makes a difference when we engage with and listen to people's lived experiences.  I thank Mr. Murphy for that.  I also thank Ms Perry for her presentation.  The elimination of hepatitis C is an interesting and achievable aim.  It is important and appropriate for us to acknowledge the work of a former member of this committee, namely, former Deputy Kate O'Connell, in this area.  She has tirelessly campaigned on the issue.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about prisons.  It seems to me an absolute no-brainer that we must deal with the problem in prisons immediately.  We need to completely eliminate the virus in the prison community.  That seems to make sense.</p> <p>  I see in the useful booklet provided to the committee that there is a section on understanding the challenges of the regions.  Our guests might develop that conversation a little more.  How would they propose to do that?</p> <p>  I am also interested to know what our guests' relationship with the HSE is like.  Are there gaps there?  Does the HSE understand our guests' suggestions and recommendations?  What is their relationship with the HSE like?  What should be done?  Where are the gaps?  Perhaps the committee should at least ask the HSE to respond to what has been said by our guests today.  Perhaps our guests could comment on those points.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  The Hepatitis C Partnership is made up of a collaboration of members which includes people who work for the HSE.  They are there at that level and feed into the partnership.  One of the reasons behind the origin of this collaboration, going back to 2014, was that our view was that pockets of work were being done in different sectors.</p></speech>

I know that HSE staff are part of the partnership but yet we are behind where we should be.  That is what I am trying to understand.  Where is the breakdown, if you like?</p></speech>

The Hepatitis C Partnership believes we are behind because of the pandemic.  We can put that point on the shelf while acknowledging it.  Many people were treated initially.  It was important that nearly 6,000 people were treated after the advent of the use of these particular DAA drugs.  We have made the point a couple of times that many people were waiting to be treated.  They were on the books, if you like, and moved forward when the treatment became available and they took that treatment.  Because of the nature of the disease, as we have debated this morning, it is the case that people sometimes do not know they have it or know they have it for a period of time, as Mr. Murphy said earlier, but because it is not symptomatic, they do not feel compelled to do anything about it.  It may also be the case that a patient is afraid of people's perceptions, including those of the medical professionals.  I do not think there is a breakdown.  A concerted effort needs to be made.  If I am sitting in Athlone this afternoon and there may be some reason for me to think I have become exposed to hepatitis C, there are a couple of things that need to happen.  I need to know that might be the case so I need to understand the risks involved.  We learned from the report that only 30% of medical professionals would agree that everyone who possibly needs to be tested has been.</p></speech>

As Mr. Lawrence Murphy said, he did not realise until after he was cured that he did not feel good before the cure.  Some people are not living their lives to the full.  This is called a silent killer.  People do not talk about it enough.  The other big reason for the silent killer tag is that if left untreated, it can and does progress to significant liver damage, liver cancer and possibly death.  It is a serious disease that has this incredible opportunity of a cure in a matter of weeks, which is available in the community.  Apologies, I went slightly off track-----</p></speech>

I would like to hear the HSE's perspective on it at some stage.  I suspect we will not have time to bring its officials before the committee and engage with them in the way we have engaged with the witnesses.  Perhaps we could send them a transcript of the proceedings and ask them to respond.  Clearly, they have a very focused role with a substantial budget.  I would like to find out their views on this document and how we can achieve the ultimate goal.  I thank Ms. Perry.</p></speech>

I meant to ask if all contamination from blood transfusions has been eliminated at this stage.  The presumption is that it has been but it might not have been.</p></speech>

That is not quite my area of expertise but that is my understanding.</p></speech>

It is important to get the message about this issue out to people and some of my questions will focus on that.  The witnesses probably covered some of these points in their earlier responses.  Ms Perry said in her opening statement that most people become infected with hepatitis C virus by sharing needles or other equipment used to prepare and inject drugs and went on to say it can be shared from blood to blood transmission.  Can it be shared through saliva or urine?  This is a medical question but it would be helpful for people following these proceedings at home to know the answer to that.  Mr. Murphy might also like to add a comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Perry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#O01800"><p>The answer the Chairman's question is no, absolutely not.  It is a blood to blood transmission.  There would have to be a route of transmission and a movement of blood across two people.  The bodily fluids the Chairman mentioned would not carry sufficient amounts for transmission to take place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#O01900"><p>I am conscious that if one goes into community-based drug clinics, there are signs displayed throughout them advising people to wash their hands and to be very careful.  There is always the chance of a person getting a cut and the virus being passed on in that way.</p> <p>  On the fact that there may be no outward sign that people have the virus, most people would think someone who has contracted hepatitis C would have a yellow skin tone or a tan colour but that is not necessarily the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lawrence Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#O02000"><p>We have come across a number of individuals who tested positive for hepatitis C and may have had the virus for a decade or more but had no symptoms and were physically in good health.  However, when they got tested and scanned it turned out they had cirrhosis.  They would not have known that unless they came into contact with their peers and we were able to forward them to get FibroScanned and put on a pathway to get treated.  Those individuals, and there have been a few of them, have gone on to be successfully cured of hepatitis C.  They still have cirrhosis and need to link in and be monitored but the disease progression has been halted through the direct-acting antiviral, DAA, drugs.</p></speech>

That is referenced in the report.  I understand how difficult that would be.  There are streets workers going out trying to tackle crack cocaine addiction in my area.  Would Mr. Keane envisage his group trying to get people into the system in that way?  The importance of the needle exchange programme in tackling drug addiction was stressed in local communities and by community leaders in the past to guard against the passing on of the HIV virus or the hepatitis virus.  It was important to help people understand drug use was not been facilitated by having the needle exchange programme and that it was health-related.  When people are brought into the system, other health measures follow through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#O02200"><p>I agree with the Chairman.  In terms of reaching people, if somebody is struggling with drug use or living in chaotic and difficult circumstances, their focus is not always on engaging with healthcare systems.  That is why it is important to bring the types of service the Chairman mentioned, the needle exchange, outreach services and other such services to people where they are in the community.  The same thing is true of hepatitis C testing and treatment.  We need to be able to reach people where they are.  There are examples in Ireland of good practice in that regard, of peers going into community services, doing swab tests for hepatitis C and being able to link people in very quickly into services.  When people have not always had good experiences of healthcare, having peers being able to go in and speak to people is the best way best way of reaching people.  We have quotes in the report of people saying: "I am coming from the same place you were.  I have this lived experience as well."  That makes it so much more credible and real for people and makes them want to connect and engage with the service, particularly if they have not had good experiences of healthcare systems in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lawrence Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022060100002#O02300"><p>It is a great question. The understanding in this respect for people to get tested where they are at is a great incentive.  Many people for whatever reasons do not engage with services nor do they need to do so.  What they need is some information on potential risk factors they have encountered and it may have been decades ago or recently.  They have the opportunity to get an oral swab test, which is just an indicator, and they still have to get a blood test.  For them to get information that not only is such testing for the virus accessible in their community but that it is treatable in their community removes much of the stigma associated with it.  There is much stigma attached to having contracted hepatitis C which is associated with drug use and bad behaviour.  However, that is not the case for many people.  For many people it could have resulted from experimentation.</p><p>Allowing them to be tested in the setting of their own community or within their home would be a great incentive that should be pursued.</p></speech>

It demonstrates the importance of on-the-ground experience and information coming from one's own peers or someone who has experienced that journey.  Our guests made a point about the lack of information, minimal supports following a diagnosis, how to live with the disease and how to protect others.  They were all the big questions Mr. Murphy had and it is the same with many medical conditions.  If someone who has been diagnosed with cancer can talk to someone who has been down that road and gone through the process about what is involved, that will significantly alleviate the scare factor.  There is an element whereby some people might say they do not want to know the details, and Mr. Murphy hinted in his opening statement about not knowing for years what the next step was or where to go.  How important is that information?  He suggested that a peer-to-peer system be rolled out.</p></speech>

I understand this approach was mostly confined to Dublin but it could be replicated and that is the great thing about peers.  There are peers throughout the country who could be resourced and led in such a way that they could guide other individuals to the cure for hepatitis C.</p></speech>

If you are travelling to Dublin from the west, the first challenge is to get to the train station, after which you have to get to the hospital and so on.  How long does the treatment in the hospital take?  It probably involves queuing for half the day.</p></speech>

There is a battery of tests to take before getting the tablet itself.  There is a blood test, an ultrasound scan if the disease has progressed and a FibroScan test.  In some hospitals, the care is provided swiftly.  The period from first diagnosis to the pill being administered could be as short as four weeks, although that is not the case outside of Dublin and in certain regions.</p></speech>

They had linked in with services but had never availed of treatment.  This individual has severe liver disease.  When they did put themselves forward for treatment in recent months, they had to undergo some additional tests, such an ultrasound scan and other tests for what the Chairman just described, such as liver cancer.</p></speech>

The person may not be able to attend work any day that week, for example.  An economic impact arises, therefore, just as much as the other types of impact, from those local services not being available.</p></speech>

It is about being able to offer the support and the care within their own setting and community for this potentially life-saving treatment.</p></speech>

It is an issue throughout Ireland now but intravenous drug use, in particular, remains significant in Dublin.</p></speech>

In our experience, having talked to people, a couple of issues make it a challenge.  This disease has the potential to make people so ill and to be such a burden on the healthcare system in the long term, yet it can be cured relatively easily.  Nevertheless, if someone needs to travel long distances, that will affect his or her job, and if he or she is not working, he or she may not have the money to undertake the travel.</p> <p>  I can think of some real-life examples.  One woman who had two children under five years of age could not attend the hospital appointment because she did not have anyone to take them and there was no way she could bring them to Limerick from Dublin and back.  Another factor is that even if the person has money or does not have an issue with work, particularly for people who may have historically contracted the virus, he or she may experience discrimination or possible stigma about it.  How can such people explain to people where they are, where they are going or what the treatment is for if the individuals in their lives at that point are not aware of some aspect of their history or background?  It is not the same as getting a diagnosis of something that does not come along with any value judgments, such as becoming diabetic.  It has additional factors, as well as the medical ones, that should be considered.</p></speech>

Our guests referred to the idea of telling people to self-test, the efficacy of that and what happens when someone finds out they have the disease.  The positive message is that a cure exists and there is a way forward.  It is a silent killer only when the issue is not addressed.</p></speech>

I am aware there are probably people listening to this meeting who may personally have been, or whose family or friends may have been, impacted by hepatitis C.  Although it may sound like an ironic use of words, I often refer to this as a good news story because there is a cure.  Not only is there a cure but we are in a system whereby that cure is available regardless of income.  I have worked in addiction in this country for more than 20 years and I frequently say there is no cure <i>per se</i>for addiction.  We cannot give someone a tablet and expect it to be gone.  There is no cure, by waving a wand, for poverty or trauma but with this particular issue there is a cure.  In our experience with people, and this is so important, a person may feel as though he or she has failed at a lot of things throughout much of his or her life.  If that person then does something about it, even the feeling he or she used to have something, regardless of its origins and the fact it is now gone, may leave a mark.  The person may, as in Mr. Murphy's experience, physically feel better, but the emotional and mental impact can be very significant.</p></speech>

I accept there are governance and ethical issues, but they are structural issues that could be dealt with within a matter of weeks rather than a year.  If there is any one message from this meeting, it is that we need to speed up this pilot scheme.</p></speech>

What stood out for me from talking to everybody related to having that concerted goal and effort.  We are now midway through 2022 and the World Health Organization goals have been set for 2030.  Three thousand days, or whatever the figure is, remain in which to achieve those goals.  It is about having a focus on that, being explicit and saying whether the targets we are aiming for are what we are driving forward.  Once that is in place, everything else, such as the recommendations we set out in the report, aims to drive towards that goal.</p><p>The overall picture, when we step back, is one where we must ask if this is what Ireland is driving towards.  Are we seeking to eliminate hepatitis C by 2030? </p></speech>

Is that seen as being the way forward for Ireland?  It has been said it is a model that is clearly working in Scotland, where a similar cohort of people is affected.  If we are talking about rewriting the model in Ireland, would the Scottish approach be the nearest one that is functional or would examples from further afield be considered?  Egypt was mentioned, for example, where there is a different type of model but similar challenges.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Carroll, who spoke earlier, is involved in several initiatives.  We have outreach models, a pathway of care, as I said, and an accessible treatment.  What we do not have is everybody who may be impacted included.  We do not have a general understanding of this disease among the population.  Usually, it is people who are individually affected who understand what this disease is.  Even when people do understand it, they often do not know there is a cure.  When we think that a cure has been available for some time, this situation is concerning.</p> <p>  What we have, and what the research showed us, is the commitment, passion and drive of professionals working in the hepatitis field.  Those are mainly in hospital settings but also in outreach endeavours.  They know what to do in respect of how to work this out once we identify the people affected through implementing our national screening guidelines.  We have an excellent document drawn up in 2017 on the means of implementation.  It is like a handbook for everyone out there regarding how we can work with, or not work with, who we screen.  It is a matter of finding out where those people are and letting them know.  I remember in Germany a few years back there was an amazing campaign undertaken on public transport in this regard.  It consisted, basically, of a poster with three questions on it.  It was along the lines of "Have you done this, this and this?".  If people had done those three things, then it was recommended that they go to the equivalent in Germany of their GP or medical health centre and ask for a test.  I refer to that kind of initiative.  </p> <p>  Our clinical approach and clinical responses, particularly in certain locations, are excellent.  It would be impossible to take away from them or from the hard work being done on this disease.  Is it something that is always at the forefront of minds?  No, it is not.  Does everyone who needs to know this disease may be a risk for them know that it is?  No, they do not.  We can take lessons from models abroad.  Australia and Canada have done fantastic work.  Again, populations may be different but the scenarios are similar.  </p> <p>  We have, however, what we need here.  Regarding what the Deputy mentioned earlier, we have the budget and the resources.  The problem we have may be some blocks.  If I am being really honest, some people may also just wonder why people cannot just take a treatment that is available and being provided and paid for.  As was mentioned and emphasised, the key is information.  This is about addressing a situation where people will not go and get a treatment if they do not know they have the disease or they do not know there is a cure for it.  There are nuances around hepatitis C, because of its core group, that are not relevant in other medical domains.  It is important that we do not ignore these aspects and that we ensure there is a context to how we respond and that this perspective is considered.  </p></speech>

We often discuss how it is extremely important in a functioning democracy to have those key components to allow for different views to be expressed and to allow for people to campaign and engage in the public policy process.  For a number of years, there has been an issue with regard to the definition of "political purpose", and how it impacts on civil society organisations.  They argue that it is too wide and that it interferes with and limits the legitimate work of NGOs and civil society groups.  They argue that the basic freedom of individuals and organisations in Ireland to raise funds and campaign on issues that affect them is constrained by the Electoral Act 1997 in ways that violate their constitutional rights and EU law on freedom of assembly and association.  Organisations such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Amnesty International and others have stated that they are effectively banned from seeking funding for some of their work and can potentially be sanctioned for engaging in the public policy process.  There are examples of organisations being taken to court for accepting funding, being threatened with prosecution for raising funds to engage with the public policy process and being forced to limit or end their operations in particular specific areas entirely.  That is not healthy in a democracy.  It is worth noting that the civil society organisations make the point that they are only seeking to have these restrictions removed regarding their day-to-day campaigning work.  They are not seeking any changes with regard to the way they are governed with respect to elections or referendums.  They fully support being governed on those in the same way as anyone else engaging in them.  The amendment seeks to address those concerns.  I am happy to hear what the Minister of State has to say on how he wants to see those concerns addressed. </p></speech>

Amendment No. 66 is perhaps a simplified way of trying to address the issue of cryptocurrencies.  It is very difficult to define a cryptocurrency.  The easiest way I could find to do it was to limit it to the two currencies that are operational on the island of Ireland.  That being said, I think the Government amendments are far superior.  I am happy to withdraw that particular amendment.  Equally, amendment No. 67 seeks to increase the limit of the fine to a level of &euro;50,000 for some of the breaches of the section 23 rules on donations.  The idea that foreign donations will be included our system is an attempt to take a more serious approach.  I am seeking to introduce a more severe penalty for breaches I think could have an inadvertent influence on our democracy, particularly in the case of corporate donations.  We have very strong corporate donation limits.  Compared to the British system, we are leagues ahead in terms of our ethical stance on this issue.  We know that politics is not always about the simple transaction.  It is also about building capacity.  Sometimes, building capacity increases the ability to operate across the island.  That is not about one political party.  It is about any political party that operates in both jurisdictions.  Both amendments are being subvented by the Government amendments.  I am happy to withdraw both of them.</p> <p>  I wish to speak to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment No. 65.  I believe Senator Ruane has done some work in the area.  I have met representatives of ICCL and have spoken in the D&aacute;il in favour of addressing the issues.  It is not as clear a line as is perhaps being put forward.  In essence, there is no ban on civil society groups raising funds, but if they are using the funds for political purposes or purposes that may be seen to be political, there is a limit.  It is the same limit that applies to any of us.  I understand that the same limits that apply to corporate donors also apply to those civil society organisations.  That can result in the drying up of a source of funds that would otherwise be available to such groups in other countries.  I can absolutely see the perspective of the groups.  It is very difficult.  There are campaigns that I would very much like to see receiving that kind of funding.  However, there are other campaigns, such as those from the far right in the US, in respect of which I would not like to see such funding drifting into our political system.  In the same way that we talked about online political advertising, there is a differentiation between the electoral periods and the capacity-building that is often done in advance of a referendum or an election.  There could be civil society groups operating in an overtly political way.  It does not happen in Ireland but it could happen.  Perhaps the Minister of State will accept Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment but I do not think he will.  I ask the Minister of State to look seriously at this area to see how we can resolve some of these day-to-day issues for the civil society groups.  However, if such groups use the funding to build capacity and use that capacity in a political way, they have to be subject to the same limits that apply to any other political activists or influencers during election periods.  That is the point I wish to make.  I am happy to withdraw my amendments.  I ask the Minister of State to consider Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment with the note of caution that I have added.  </p></speech>

It is, in essence, about how we deal with the question of donations and fundraising in relation to NGOs.  It is a very live issue, as the Minister of State is aware.  It has been openly talked about in the NGO sector and across society for quite a long time now.  Amendment No. 68 seeks to make a distinction between a donation to an NGO or civil society group during an election period and outside an election.  It seeks to do something broadly similar to what Deputy O'Callaghan is trying to achieve with his amendment.  If the Minister of State is not in a position to accept the amendment today, perhaps he could come back to us with his thoughts on Report Stage, because this is an area that requires further clarification.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy McAuliffe for withdrawing his amendments.  I am opposing amendments Nos. 65 and 68 on the grounds that, as stated on Second Stage of the Bill on 7 April last, the Government is committed to the electoral commission, when established, undertaking a comprehensive review of the Electoral Act 1997 with a view to making recommendations to address, among other matters, the concerns raised by civil society concerning the definition of "political purposes" and its impact on the fundraising activities of certain civil society organisations.  It is my belief that the proposed review could be completed within a relatively short timeframe following the electoral commission&rsquo;s establishment.  Furthermore, given the complex issues provided for in the Electoral Act 1997, it is considered that the carrying out of such a comprehensive review of the Act would deliver an independent, objective, clear and efficient outcome for all affected parties with regard to the entirety of the interrelated provisions in that Act.  Like other Deputies, I have met representatives of the ICCL on a number of occasions to discuss the issue, as well as those of the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom more recently.  There is no doubt that there is a difference of opinion on the issue in terms of trying to achieve the same objective.  That is what we want to do.  There is a concern on the part of the coalition, in respect of the timeline of the establishment of the commission and the review of the 1997 Act, that the review may not be delivered within the lifetime of this Government.  However, we have given a commitment that it will happen very quickly, once the commission is established.  We have given that commitment.  I give a political commitment that we want the issue to be resolved as soon as is practicable, once the commission is established.  I accept the fact that the ICCL and the coalition were not happy with our response.  However, we believe that it is the most objective and independent way that we can carry out the review.</p></speech>

The points made by Deputy McAuliffe are very fair.  This is an area that requires careful consideration.  Any activity that impacts on the political system must be subject to boundaries and limits.  We need to bear in mind that a lot of corporate money and resources, which are not necessarily subject to restrictions, go into influencing the political process.  Having some counterbalance to that from civil society and NGOs can be healthy in a democracy.  We should be aware that large sums and resources are employed by corporate interests all the time to influence political decisions.  We need to be mindful of that.  Where is the ability for others, who do not have those sorts of resources behind them, to put forward their case?  I am happy to accept that there will be a process for that going forward.</p></speech>

I fully support the spirit and intention of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.  We need to make sure that however this is resolved, it does not create opportunities for other interests to influence our electoral processes or referendums outside the election period.  One of my fears, even with the wording the ICCL originally proposed, was that it did not guard sufficiently against that.  That is the challenge now.  It always gets my back up a little when the threat of unintended consequences is used as a reason for inaction.  This is an issue that has to be resolved but it has to be resolved in a way that does not create other problems.  For example, one could imagine a situation, as happens in other jurisdictions, where all the conditions of this amendment were adequately adhered to but money from economic or political interests, which many of us would strongly oppose, could still be used to finance campaigning activity outside an election period.  That would not necessarily fall foul of any of the conditions in the amendment even though it would impact on the outcome of elections, referendums or even just the legislative process.  Finding that balance is quite tricky.  I support Deputy O'Callaghan on this issue.  We would like the Minister of State to come back to the committee because there is a desire on our side of the House to find a way to resolve this matter that is fair and equitable, and to tackle that imbalance that Deputy O'Callaghan rightly noted.  If the Minister of State was minded to do that, we might be able to get cross-party agreement on the fix for this.  I encourage that approach because I am not sure that what is on the table at the moment achieves that fix.  However, we do not have the advantage of the skills and draftspeople the Department has.  If the Minister of State were to come back to us at some near stage, we might be able to progress it effectively.</p></speech>

This is a sector I have worked in and was involved in for many years.  I value the impartiality of civil society organisations and their ability to play a critical role in our electoral system.  It is important that they have the mechanism to do that.  Likewise, the corporate influence Deputy O'Callaghan raised is something we can address in the review as well.  It is important that we do that.  In meeting with the coalition, I gave a firm commitment that we want to resolve this in a manner that allows civil society organisations to campaign, lobby and advocate in the way they currently do, and do very well.  We want to do that in a robust way and we are of the view that this is the best way to do that.  I am more than happy to come back to the committee on the mechanics of how we might achieve that.</p></speech>

Online political advertising will be prohibited.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>I promised yesterday during my contribution on amendment No. 32 that I would not repeat it at the same length today.  I do not want to fall out with the Minister of State on this issue.  Despite all the negotiations I have had with the Department, the contributions made here and during pre-legislative scrutiny and so on, there are a number of questions that have not been answered.  First, there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why we are treating different media outlets differently.  Radio and TV have a prohibition on political advertising and yet we have made a decision in this Bill to facilitate it for online platforms.  There is no explanation or rationale for why we have done that and there should be.  Second, we continue to limit the regulation to the period of the election and not outside it.  Third, we have heard a lot of discussion from the platforms about how they do not want Ireland to have a different set of regulations from other countries, but despite European directives we still do not have scrutiny or sight of that European legislation.</p><p>The best way of protecting our democracy is by not permitting online political advertising, in the same way we do for broadcast media, until we have a comprehensive response.  The Minister of State might say this amendment is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Twitter says it does not allow political advertising and the amount of revenue Facebook gets from political advertising is a tiny fraction of the advertising market here in Ireland.  Banning political advertising online will not be a significant loss to those platforms but it would help to protect our market.  There is much discussion about what happens in online political advertising, and some people think other parties are better at it than others, but the real problem is that we do not know what is going on with a lot of the algorithms and microtargeting.  We need to have that level of trust in our democracy.  For all those reasons, I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this very blunt amendment, and to withdraw sections 120, 121 and 122 from the Bill, in order to prohibit the use of online political advertising until the Minister and the commission can bring forward proposals that would satisfactorily regulate the space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022060100002#D00100"><p>I admire the Deputy's optimism.  I have a few comments.  First, we already have different rules on non-online advertising.  For example, we know we cannot buy radio time or TV time but we can buy newspaper time and in many cases local newspapers would go out of business if it was not for the regular political adverts that are placed by Members of the D&aacute;il, both inside and outside of election time.  Therefore, if there is to be a standardised rule then theoretically it should apply to everybody.  There would not be many Members of the D&aacute;il who would argue that we should not be allowed to advertise in local newspapers.  I am a firm believer that those adverts in local newspapers do not get you a single vote but they keep people in employment and keep newspapers up and running.  Those newspapers have an important function and that is why many of us continue those advertisements.</p> <p>  I want to ask the Deputy proposing the amendment to consider the following issue: online advertising is cheap and the ability of people to boost Facebook posts, which could often be organic content rather than sophisticated ads, is something that gives small, non-party and small party candidates access to a way of promoting their work that they otherwise would not have.  I am not in favour of an outright ban on online advertising.  I fully agree with Deputy McAuliffe that the weakness of the regulation of online advertising and platforms is evident in this Bill.  Interestingly, none of the advocates for greater transparency or accountability in social media who came to the committee called for an outright ban.  They had a range of good and interesting policy recommendations on transparency and accountability etc. and the Government would do well to go back to those and reconsider them.  We also have to deal with the issue of spending limits.  While the spending limits do not change inside the election period, there are spending limits outside of it.  It is the same with posters and you will see all sorts of posters going up all over the place three months before the election that are allegedly for political meetings.  Those posters are not for political meetings at all; they are just election posters by another name.</p> <p>  I do not support the amendment but I support Deputy McAuliffe's concern that we could have a much more advanced set of regulations for online platforms.  We do not need to wait for the European Union regulations; in fact we should move much further.  There are certain activities like microtargeting that should be illegal inside and outside of the election period.  They should not just be illegal for political campaigning but for any kind of advertising.  It is acceptable when you open a newspaper and there is commercial content that is labelled as an advertisement.  We know about that but nobody knows when they have been microtargeted, regardless of whether it is in the commercial or the political world.  While I do not support the amendment, I support Deputy McAuliffe's call for the Department, the Minister and his colleagues to seriously look at this.  The one message we got clearly from the advocacy experts, who made an important presentation, was that the technology is accelerating at such a speed that not only do we have to play catch-up but we do not even know where things are going.  They made a strong case that the electoral commission should have the ability, in real time, to start to understand and make recommendations to the Government, which could then be acted on quickly by way of regulation to primary legislation.  If we fail to grapple with this now, during elections at some point in the future there will be serious points of contention over our failure to regulate and who has or has not done what on online advertising.  While I do not support the amendment, I support the intention and argument from the Government to come back on this at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>

We had quite a detailed discussion on this in the committee.  The Government needs to show leadership when it comes to political advertising, which this Bill proposes to regulate for a short period of time, during the election cycle.  That cycle can be only three weeks and as many contributors have spoken about, many elections are won and lost in the intervening periods.  On political advertising in general, I would totally support this amendment and I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1585" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022060100002#D00300"><p>This is an area that needs a lot more attention and I welcome that the amendment has been brought forward in that spirit.  With online political activity, an audience is built up over time.  A lot of that is done by the parties with resources and that includes anyone who is elected, such as a Deputy or another office holder.  They have the resources to be able to build up followers and audiences between elections and that is probably the biggest advantage they have.  There is a legitimate argument that people without those resources being able to do some online advertising can be a counterbalance and that needs to be considered.</p> <p>  When we were looking at this in the committee we got strong input from people with expertise saying they did not want a situation where after an election, such as the next election or another one, everyone in the country would be talking about what happened with online campaigning, how that influenced the outcome of the election, how we did not have safeguards in place and how the election was influenced by external forces or whatever.  It would be damaging to confidence in the democratic system if that happened.  I urge that this area gets sufficient attention and that should happen before the election.  The point Deputy &Oacute; Broin made is that they were arguing that the commission needs to be able to react in real time.  If something is happening during an election campaign that most people would consider as out of order and having an undue influence on an election, it must have powers or the ability to take measures then.  It is no good having a review after the election and learning some lessons at that point if people can see that there are things that need to be reacted to immediately.</p> <p>  I am not sure that this blunt measure is sufficient but I accept that in the absence of other measures, a blunt one like this has a certain attraction.  What is needed would probably be a much more detailed way of regulating this rather than an outright ban.  I tend to reach for outright bans on things from time to time but in most cases taking a more nuanced and regulated approach is the correct one.  Failing that, if we have no other options then an outright ban might be the best thing to do but it will not capture a lot of it and it will not counterbalance the issue of the resources that people build up between elections, which puts them at an advantage over newer candidates.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  There might be an opportunity for the committee to have a discussion on that at some point.</p> <p>  I take on board the points that all Deputies have made and there will be a review of Part 4 of the Bill after three years of it operating.  I take the point that Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Broin have made about reaction in real time.  I am not sure how the commission could play a role in that in the middle of an electoral event, which is the challenge.  The ability of the commission to review electoral events afterwards and make recommendations is a strong and useful one.  It is something that will help in the robustness of the political system and as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, this whole space is shifting rapidly and we are consistently trying to catch up with it, which is something we have to be mindful of.  On publication of the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, flagged a legislative proposal to protect the integrity of our electoral system and democratic process that has been developed by the Office of the Attorney General.  That is something I was going to flag in my closing comments but it is an added element to consider.</p> <p>  I will specifically respond to amendment No. 74 before Deputy &Oacute; Broin comes back in.  Amendment No. 74 proposes to replace section 119, on public information requirements for online political advertisements under this Bill, with an alternative section, which would prohibit online political advertising.  The amendment also proposes to oppose section 120 on obligations on online platforms regarding online political advertisements; section 121 on the identification and verification of buyers; and section 122 on the obligations on buyers regarding online political advertisements.</p><p> An interdepartmental group on the security of Ireland's electoral processes and disinformation was established in early 2018 to consider the substantive issues arising from experience in other democratic countries, having regard to the use of social media by external, anonymous or hidden third parties.  Its principal focus was on the risks to the electoral processes, including those arising from disinformation spread via social media and other means.  The interdepartmental group was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Its membership included representatives from the franchise section of our Department and the then Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Defence, Education and Skills, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as from the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the national cybersecurity centre.  The first report from the group was submitted to the Government in July 2018.</p><p> Overall, the assessment found that risks to the electoral process in Ireland are relatively low, taking into account the mitigating factors that are already in place.  It was recognised that the spread of disinformation online and the risk of cyberattacks on the electoral system pose more substantial risks.  That is in line with EU findings and recent international experience.  The report's recommendations included a commitment to regulate for transparency in online political advertising.  In this context, a public consultation was announced on 21 September 2018 and a discussion paper that outlined the issues and challenges involved in regulating online political advertising was published as part of the consultative process.  A total of 15 submissions were received by the closing date of 19 October 2018.  The public consultation was followed by an open policy form on the regulation of transparency in online political advertising, held in Dublin Castle in 2018.  The forum was attended by a wide range of representatives from media and political spheres, online companies and the European Commission.  A broad consensus emerged from the forum that there was a need to regulate online political advertisements during electoral periods.</p><p> The European Commission has published its Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transparency and targeting of political advertising on 25 November 2021.  Similar to the provisions in Part 4 of the Bill, the Commission proposal does not propose to prohibit political advertising in any media for reasons that are similar to those I set out earlier.  Indeed, the Commission proposal envisages the introduction of a transparency regime across all forms of advertising media that is broadly reflective of that being introduced under Part 4 in respect of online political advertising.  Given the very detailed provisions that we are introducing under Part 4, we will not accept this amendment.</p></speech>

In some ways, this blunt instrument is pulling the emergency brake, protecting our system and forcing the hand of the Government and Commission to implement regulations that would be more nuanced.  This is once-in-a-generation legislation.  One might be sceptical that the necessary protections will be implemented in the short term, when they are needed, for example, in advance of the next electoral cycle.  I urge the Minister of State to liaise with the commission.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment so that we can get the commission set up and it can deal with this.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about the small guy being able to spend a little bit.  I did that too when I was starting off.  When one looks at the advertising libraries, the medium-sized parties, as we call them now, spend vast amounts of money, which will only get bigger as activity increases online.  Unlike any other sort of media, transparency is different.  If I have an advertisement on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>stating that my priority is older people, that says something to older people, but it also says something to other groups who are not in that category.  One cannot see that transparency online.  Advertising can tell older people they are the priority, tell younger people they are the priority, and tell everybody else that they are the priority.  Politics is about allocation of resources and where one's priorities lie.  That is the difference between online advertising and other media.  The spending is clearly being done by the medium-sized parties, not smaller ones.</p><p>My two amendments were ruled out of order.  They dealt with mandatory take-down notices, which would allow the commission to act during an electoral event, and with a code of conduct.  I ask the Minister of State to look at those amendments and perhaps table changes on Report Stage.  I have pressed the Minister of State hard, but I am happy to withdraw the amendments.</p></speech>

We did not address the different treatment of different media outlets, such as radio.  I know there are different guidelines.  Local radio has its own mechanism by which it gives airtime to candidates.  That is all down to the local stations.  Everybody is appealing to different audiences online, in local newspapers and on local radio.  I think what we are proposing here is innovative and is a good approach.  We will take on board all Deputies' comments on this.  There is an opportunity for the commission to appoint an expert group to look at this area, which, as has been said, shifts rapidly.</p></speech>

It should be noted that section 137(1)(b) provides that on conviction or indictment, the guilty person shall be liable to a fine, a prison term not exceeding five years or both.  The current provision does not state the amount of the fine.  That is a matter for the courts.  What I am providing for in this amendment is an additional daily fine if the offence continues.</p></speech>

In this Part, &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; means the Electoral Act 1997.&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>The committee will be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government to:</p> <blockquote> 	Review our current electoral laws and the conduct of politics in Ireland, to ensure that donations and resources from non-citizens outside the State are not being utilised to influence our elections and political process.  We will legislate to prevent this, if necessary. </blockquote> <p>In early 2021, I wrote to all 25 political parties on the register of political parties seeking their views on the regulation of electoral funding from outside the jurisdiction and on other related matters.  The amendments being brought forward now are as a result of that consultation process.  </p><p>The amendments will strengthen the definitions of &ldquo;subsidiary organisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;donation&rdquo; as set out in the Electoral Act 1997.  They will impose a new obligation on the leaders of political parties to provide a written statement and an accompanying statutory declaration in respect of each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission stating that all donations from outside of the State, whether in cash or in kind, have been declared and that no other donations, either in cash or in kind, took place.  The amendments insert new requirements into the Electoral Act 1997 in respect of adherence to financial reporting standard, FRS, 102 and the inclusion of all property in the ownership of the political party and its subsidiary organisations when the annual statements of accounts are being prepared.  They also prohibit donations in any form of cryptocurrency and provide a wide range of investigatory and enforcement powers to the Standards in Public Office Commission, as the body currently responsible for regulatory oversight of the Act.  These provisions are modelled on similar powers in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which the Standards in Public Office Commission is already familiar with.  The amendments provide for the inclusion of credit unions in the definition of &ldquo;institution&rdquo;.  This will allow political donations accounts to be opened and maintained within credit unions by the recipients of political donations rather than such accounts being solely confined to banks and building societies.  They also provide for the amounts specified in sections 23C and 48C of that Act to be varied by order, having regard to changes in the consumer price index.  These amounts relate to the donation threshold in respect of which the obligations under the Act apply to third parties.  All other donation thresholds under the Act can already be varied by order in line with changes in the consumer price index.</p><p>I believe the proposed amendments will clarify and strengthen the relevant provisions of the Electoral Act 1997 against the malicious use of financial resources from outside the State to interfere with our political and democratic processes.</p></speech>

This amendment also provides for an amendment to the definition of "donation" in section 22(2)(a) to confirm that a donation from a subsidiary organisation of a political party which keeps an office outside of the State falls within the meaning of "donation".  Amendment No. 90 also provides for the insertion of a new definition of "cryptocurrency" in section 22(2)(aa) of the Act and for an update to the definition of "institution" in the same section to reflect changes in the banking sector since the Act was first commenced, that is, the dissolution of ACC Bank and changes in the European Union regulations governing the financial services sector.</p><p>This update will provide that credit unions are institutions within the meaning of the Act, and this will allow for political donation accounts to be opened in credit unions for the first time, which I am sure we will all welcome.</p></speech>

Our amendment seeks to go a little further.  Without it, such a party could still receive donations in the North that would be illegal here.  Our amendment to the Government amendment seeks to put an end to SIPO's contention, which is in the public domain, relating in particular to the Hampton donation.  I refer to that donation to Sinn F&eacute;in simply because it illustrated many anomalies between the systems North and South.  Our amendment would put an end to the SIPO contention that Sinn F&eacute;in - I refer to Sinn F&eacute;in purely because that is the case in point - is in some sense separate to and apart from Sinn F&eacute;in as registered in the South.  Has the Minister of State had the opportunity to consider the amendment we have proposed to his amendment and what is his perspective on that?</p></speech>

The Hampton case illustrated that as a problem because of the lack of transparency.</p> <p>  If the Minister of State will consider this in more detail on Report Stage, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.  We might even have a wider discussion between now and then because the issue requires considerable attention and I will be happy to work with the Department if he is happy to consider at least the principle of our amendment on the basis we can work together to try to get this right.</p></speech>

We are in a unique position on this island because there are two jurisdictions with two different sets of electoral law and laws governing political donations, and a number of parties operate on an all-island basis, including that of the Minister of State, Sinn F&eacute;in, People Before Profit and the Socialist Party.  This session, therefore, is a valuable opportunity to provide the maximum level of clarity in order that everyone will understand the implications of what we are agreeing to, and I reiterate I strongly support the Minister of State's amendments.</p><p>I am interested in the changes to section 22 of the Electoral Act 1997 given we will be adding subsidiary organisations operating outside the State to the scope of that section, which will have implications for donations made to subsidiaries operating outside the State, whether that is Sinn F&eacute;in or a branch of the Green Party in Belfast, or People Before Profit or the Socialist Party.  Specifically with respect to the changes being made to section 22(2)(<i>c</i>)(i) of the 1997 Act, will the Minister of State be as explicit as possible with regard to the new status of requirements for political parties with respect to donations made to subsidiaries outside the State?</p><p>The separate question Deputy Nash raises is an important one and, again, full transparency is required.  In consideration of any such changes, we also need to be clear we will not create additional anomalies.  His amendment, if I understand it, seems to suggest that where a donation to a party organised on an all-island basis is accepted in the North, the rules of electoral donations that operate for that party in the South should apply both North and South.  That would mean, however, that we would be extending the reach of the political donations legislation from the South to the North.  I have no problem with that, given the sooner we have standard and harmonised rules North and South, the better for me, as the committee knows.</p><p>Nevertheless, it would create an anomaly in the North, if it were even legally possible, because all of a sudden, for political parties such as those I mentioned, the southern standards would have to be applied in the North, as opposed to the standards that would apply for the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and Fianna F&aacute;il.  All of a sudden, there would be a two-tiered system in the North whereby the southern rules would apply to parties that are all-Ireland in nature and the Westminster rules would apply to those parties operating only in the North.  I am not sure whether southern law could be extended to the North in that way, but that is a separate issue.</p><p>In any event, would we want to create an anomaly whereby the SDLP could accept larger donations but Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, People Before Profit and the Socialist Party would be in a different situation?  I think that is an equally important part of the consideration.  I am not averse to the conversation at all but we need to be clear about the ramifications.  What could not be the case, and I know Deputy Nash would not accept this in the South, is that one group of parties could accept larger donations than others.  That makes no sense, but his amendment would have that effect on the level of donations acceptable in the North.</p><p>I acknowledge this is quite technical but will the Minister of State talk us through the ramifications that changes to section 22, especially for parties such as his and ours that are all-Ireland in nature?  He might also respond to my query in regard to Deputy Nash's amendment or, if he prefers, we can discuss that on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I had expected we could, perhaps, go further on some of them, which might have helped Deputy &Oacute; Broin in understanding the specific application of the provision.  I would like to see more detail and adjustment on Report Stage.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin makes a very valid point regarding the all-Ireland nature of some parties despite there being two jurisdictions.  Even so, as a basic premise, if a corporate donation is considered wrong, a party should not accept it regardless of what it is allowed to accept.  In this State, we have come to a settled will whereby corporate donations are deemed not to be appropriate, and just because they are permitted does not mean a political party should avail of them, regardless of what is permitted North or South.  I hear what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is saying, but I would imagine many people who support all-Ireland parties believe there should not be illegal corporate donations and would be surprised to learn that some of those all-island parties receive donations that would be illegal in the South.  Of course, it is a matter of regulation, but it is also about being honest with people and saying how we believe we should operate, and how we will operate, North and South.</p> <p>  There is more work to be done on this issue and I look forward to the Minister of State returning to it with further amendments.  He is aware of the areas of concern I have raised.</p></speech>

To be clear, the amendment relates to donations into this State and we are legislating for this jurisdiction only.  Important questions have been raised by Deputy Nash's amendment to our amendment.  The issue arose on foot of consultation we had with the political parties.  If there is a need to flesh it out on Report Stage, we will be happy to do that.</p></speech>

SIPO essentially conceded to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's argument and contention there are effectively two Sinn F&eacute;ins.  There is Sinn F&eacute;in in the North, which is organised and registered in the North and can take advantage of British laws where there is no limit applied to donations.  Even though the bequest by Mr. Hampton was bequeathed to Sinn F&eacute;in in the Republic, Sinn F&eacute;in made a corporate decision to accept it in the North.  SIPO accepted there is a legal difference between both jurisdictions, but that does not mean there is not a real problem.  There is a real problem as articulated by Deputy McAuliffe.</p><p> Frankly, from where I am standing, it is unethical to accept donations of that scale that dwarf the &euro;2,500 corporate limit on which we decided as a Parliament and as a society more generally because of the toxic and poisonous influence of money on politics.  It is not right that is accepted.  Either parties themselves must decide whether this is right and whether it fits in with their moral and ethical compass or we legislate.  I understand the challenges involved in legislation given we must deal with two jurisdictions on this island.  I am not blind to the arguments and points articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in terms of potential imbalances that might be introduced in the system in the North if we choose to go this way, but that should not act as a barrier to us dealing with this because it is a very real issue.  We have seen the corrupting influence of big money on politics in this country and we have learned those lessons.  I think we need to learn those lessons from a 32-county all-island perspective.</p><p> I will conclude my remarks by saying that in the last piece of correspondence we received from the Standards in Public Office Commission, it specifically suggested a new electoral commission, when formed, should prioritise and examine this issue.  I hope we can do so, that we do not leave it to the electoral commission, and that we look at every possible tool and weapon in our armoury to address this problem, because it is a problem.</p></speech>

To reiterate, Sinn F&eacute;in would much prefer there was one set of electoral laws for the island because it would make our job an awful lot easier.</p> <p>  To return to my question about the consequences of the Government's amendment No. 90 on section 22, I am trying to ascertain whether the reach of amendment No. 90 is solely with respect to any donation into this State from a subsidiary outside the State?  Is that where the new responsibilities and obligations lie?  That would mean there is no obligation on a subsidiary outside the State with respect to donations that are made and remain outside of the State.  It is only at the point when donations are transferred from one jurisdiction to another.  Is that the import of amendment No. 90 for section 22?</p></speech>

Amendments to section 22 relate to, for example, donations into the State from subsidiary organisations to a political party registered in the State, so if a branch of the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in or whoever in the North, makes a donation, either in cash or in kind, that must be declared.  For the sake of clarity, the income limits that would apply for non-declared donations currently in the South do not apply to donations that come from, for example, the North to the South because one must declare everything.  We are introducing a rule where there are two different sets of regulations.  For clarity, it is all donations no matter the amount that would, say, come into the jurisdiction by way of a subsidiary outside it, which is different from the current rules that operate in terms of political donations in the South, because it is all donations.</p></speech>

My understanding, which I mentioned in my remarks when we discussed the amendment, is that every donation, regardless of its size, needs to be declared now.  Is that presented cumulatively or individually in terms of the statutory reporting requirement?  An example would be if John Reilly in London makes a contribution of &euro;50 to, let us say, a race night or table quiz organised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>

This is a good opportunity for people to be very clear about the implications.  For example, if the Minister of State, Deputy Nash or I were to organise an election fundraising event in the run-up to the next general election and party colleagues or branches from outside of the State, such as the Green Party in south Belfast or Sinn F&eacute;in in north Belfast, were to sponsor a table or buy tickets or whatever, then irrespective of the price, even if they are &euro;5 tickets, they all must be declared and they are all now covered under the scope of this legislation in a way that would not be the case if a subsidiary organisation from within the State were to participate in the same event and make the same contribution?  This is important.</p></speech>

Therefore, for example, if Deputy Nash were to organise a fundraiser and a branch of the SDLP were to buy a table at the event, which it may well do because that party has a fraternal relationship and that is very healthy, that donation must be declared in its party leader's statement under this provision.</p></speech>

If, for example, there was an organisation like the Friends of the Green Party in the United States and it were to provide a benefit rather than a cash donation, let us say an office or truck or whatever during an election, that is equivalent to a donation.  If the Friends of the Green Party was to fly the Minister, Deputy Ryan, over to the United States, that equally would be a donation and would be covered under these criteria.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We appreciate the positive engagement we have had on Committee Stage.  During the discussion I flagged a number of issues to which we will give further consideration before Report Stage.  I assure members I will follow up on those matters.</p> <p>  In addition, there are a number of other issues that I have identified on which I will also consider bringing forward amendments on Report Stage.  These include: amendments to specify that in respect of the desirable skills and experience of electoral commission members set out in section 9, the expertise in financial matters be expanded to include membership of a recognised accountancy body; consequential amendments which may arise from the new Part 6 of the Bill, an amendment of the Electoral Act 1997 relating to political donations and accounts; amendments to clarify some of the provisions contained in section 104, which amends the Second Schedule to the 1992 Act in respect of the registration of electors - the amendments will clarify some of the new processes, in particular, the process regarding applications, identity and in respect of citizenship changes; and amendments to allow political parties to apply for a lottery licence in support of their fundraising activities.</p> <p>  Finally, the committee might also note that, as signalled by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the publication of the Bill, legislative proposals to protect the integrity of our electoral and democratic processes, which have been developed by the Office of the Attorney General were recently approved by the Government for drafting.  Arrangements are currently under way to publish these proposals and I intend to bring forward the proposed amendments as the Bill continues its progression through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  My officials have conducted briefings in recent days in respect of the amendments we discussed on Committee Stage and further briefings can be arranged, if necessary.  From my discussions with the members, I believe they found them useful.  We are more than happy to do that.  It has helped progress this Bill over the past two days as well.</p> <p>  I again thank my officials for the fantastic work they have been doing on this groundbreaking legislation.  I thank you, Chairman, and the members of the committee for their deliberations over the last two days.</p></speech>

Before we commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p><p>I ask members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones, as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  I ask committee members participating remotely to use the raised-hand icon on Microsoft Teams if they wish to contribute.</p><p> This meeting is convened to discuss pension issues and Department of Social Protection related matters for foster carers, which are listed as part of our work programme.  There are currently 3,948 foster carers looking after 5,265 children throughout the State, according to the latest figures from the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.  We are all aware of the reports on the shortage of foster carers and foster families, with more demands being placed on the fostering system each year.  Sadly, those demands are further compounded by the numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving in Ireland as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.  As the person who exposed and eventually secured the closure of the exploitative hostel system for unaccompanied foreign minors arriving in the State, which facilitated the scandalous disappearance of 443 children during the most prosperous decade this country has ever witnessed, I know how important the foster care system is in protecting unaccompanied children from being exploited and trafficked into and through this country.</p><p> The vast majority of foster carers have to give up their employment upon becoming a foster carer in order to meet the complex and at times challenging needs of those in their care.  While foster carers receive a weekly allowance for the child placed in their care, they do not receive any payment for themselves, which results in them falling through the cracks in the social welfare system and thus denies them eligibility for a contributory State pension on retirement.  This acts as a barrier to those wishing to take on the role of a foster parent at a time when we need to make fostering more attractive.</p><p> Last year, as part of the pre-budget submission to the Minister for Social Protection, the committee made a recommendation on addressing the pension issue for foster carers which is available on the Oireachtas website.  When presenting this committee's report on the Pensions Commission's recommendations to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, on behalf of the committee, I made specific reference to foster care parents who do not accrue a PRSI record as a result of the foster care payment.  It is our view that the Pensions Commission's proposal on pensions for family carers should apply to foster carer parents in recognition of the vital work they do in our society.  </p><p> I thank members of the committee for raising this important issue as a priority item on our work programme for this year.  I especially thank the committee's policy advisor, Ms Haley O'Shea, for her work in compiling the briefing circulated by the committee secretariat to members.  I welcome the representatives of the Irish Foster Care Association and Foster Care Ireland: Mr. David Taylor, Mr. Brendan Gillen, Ms Catherine Bond, Ms Clare Corridon and Mr. Raymond Nolan.  </p><p> Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such request.  I call on Ms Catherine Bond to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I also welcome the opportunity to briefly discuss the foster care allowance.  I am accompanied by the chairperson of IFCA, Mr. Raymond Nolan, and Mr. Brendan Gillen, foster carer and vice-treasurer to IFCA&rsquo;s board finance sub-group, and Ms Clare Corridon, who is a newly-approved foster carer.</p> <p>  Founded in 1981, the Irish Foster Care Association is the national organisation that supports foster families and the wider fostering community.  We advance and promote best practice in foster care through support, advocacy and learning provision based on evidence-based practice and research and counselling.  IFCA is a member organisation and members comprise mostly of foster carers, social workers, academics and all those who have an interest in foster care.</p> <p>  IFCA has charitable status.  It is a not-for-profit and is governed by a board of directors.  It is registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority.  We deliver targeted support to our members through our national support services and our local branches and hubs.  IFCA promotes the development of positive change for children in alternative care and influences policy, legislation and opinion through our advocacy work.  We believe in the value of foster care as an effective alternative for children who, for various reasons, are unable to live with their own families.</p> <p>  Foster care is complex and foster carers require a range of supports and expert advice to enable foster carers provide the best possible care for the child or children in their care.  There were 5,841 children in the care of Tusla at the end of 2021, of which 3,782 were fostered by general foster carers and 1,489 by relative foster carers.  There were 4,018 foster carers at the end of quarter 3 of 2021.  This is broken down to 2,437 general foster carers, 1,057 relative foster carers, and 524 private foster carers.</p> <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s adequacy review in 2020 notes an 11% decrease in the numbers of foster carers since 2016.  This is a grave concern, as the numbers of children requiring foster care have increased.  IFCA&rsquo;s submission to the committee is informed by its 40 years of experience in supporting foster care in Ireland and we welcome the opportunity to share this experience and knowledge with it.  I have included some more information about IFCA as an appendix with this opening statement.</p> <p>  Foster care is the backbone of care for children who are in the care of the State.  Ireland is unique in this respect, in that the majority of these children are growing up as happy and confident young people who attend school every day, some of whom will be focusing on the upcoming State exams, while growing up within the family environment.  Children in foster care are thriving and foster families are offering secure, happy and fulfilling childhoods to children and supporting them to reach their full potential. </p> <p>  The placement of children in foster care in Ireland is legislated for in the Child Care Act 1991, the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995, the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995 and the national standards for foster care, 2003, all of which are underpinned by the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child which was ratified by the Government in 1991.</p> <p>  A child comes into the care of the State when it is assessed that he or she is at risk and requires care and-or protection. Children are received into care in either a voluntary or court-ordered capacity.  Foster care is the predominant type of care for children in the State with approximately 92% of children placed in foster care.  Foster families offer warm, caring family life to children and tend to their physical, social, emotional and other needs which are underpinned by the stability of family life.  Foster care can be offered to a child on either a short- or long-term basis.  Short-term foster care is for a period of less than six months&rsquo; duration.  Anything over that is long-term foster care.</p> <p>  Foster carers support children who may be dealing with issues of neglect, abuse or abandonment and help them to feel supported, loved and accepted unconditionally.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has the statutory responsibility to approve foster carers and place children with them.  The national standards for foster care, 2003, set the standards for the recruitment and retention of foster carers.</p> <p>  The process of becoming a foster carer is rigorous and is governed by the procedures and guidelines for foster care committees 2017, which outline the assessment process of prospective foster carers.  Foster care committees are convened by Tusla and they approve foster care applicants.  When a person and his or her family apply to become a foster carer, they are subject to a thorough assessment to comply with Tusla&rsquo;s policy, procedures and best practice guidance, 2017.</p> <p>  Section 4.7 of this policy entitled availability to care for children in care, states that it is necessary, in the interests of meeting the needs of vulnerable children, that at least one foster carer is available to care for the child on a full-time basis.</p><p>Applications may be accepted from working parents depending on their actual availability to the child.  One carer must be available to provide day-to-day care for the child, work in partnership with Tusla, facilitate contact with birth parents and siblings, bring children to school, attend childcare reviews and attend training.  Consideration of approval of working applicants or carers looks at their availability to meet the child&rsquo;s needs.  Children who need short-term, emergency or respite care require a full-time foster carer from the time they join the family.</p><p> The vast majority of foster carers are requested to relinquish their employment on becoming a foster carer to meet the myriad complex needs of children coming into care.  Foster carers receive a weekly allowance for the child who is placed with them to cover their needs.  If the child remains in placement with them following six months, they can then receive child benefit.  Foster carers do not receive any payment for themselves, which results in their not having adequate social welfare credits for eligibility for the contributory State retirement pension.  Foster carers can qualify for the home carer period scheme if the following criteria are met: they are providing full-time care for a child or children under the age of 12 years, a child or children over 12 years who need an increased level of care, or an adult who needs an increased level of care; they are not employed, self-employed or training outside the home; they have not had a paid, credited or reckonable voluntary contribution during the period they are providing the home care; they are not in receipt of a weekly payment from the Department of Social Protection, other than child benefit; they can demonstrate that due to the nature and extent of their home caring responsibilities they were unable to engage in insurable employment and self-employment; and the person for whom the home caring is provided meets the required conditions.  The majority of children in foster care remain with their foster carers to the age of 23, which is the age of leaving care, and many stay beyond this age.  Foster carers are at a distinct disadvantage, as most of them have been requested to remain at home to meet the care needs of their foster children.  They are not entitled to sign on for social welfare credits as they are not available for work.</p><p> Recognition of the role of foster carers for children in State care is currently not adequately considered in the social welfare system, particularly in relation to State pension contributions.  Currently, the investment in time and care by foster carers does not trigger contributions towards the State contributory pension for the full duration of the care provision.  This leaves foster carers at risk of poverty in their later years while performing an essential service to the State.  This is not an equitable or sustainable situation if the State wishes to continue to leverage alternative home care as a State intervention in the alternative care system in the future.</p><p> While foster carers can qualify for the home caring period scheme, it is limited and restricted to children under the age of 12, or an ill or disabled person over the age of 12.  We believe this age restriction should be raised to a minimum of 23 years of age based on the aftercare supports required by vulnerable children in care.  This would be a more complete reflection of the time contribution given by foster carers and would acknowledge tangibly the key support provided by foster carers in addressing social challenges to the State.</p><p> Where a foster carer remains on the Tusla-approved panel of foster carers and remains available for receiving a child into foster care, he or she should continue to be included for State contributory pensions contributions purposes for the entire period of being on the approved panel.  This will facilitate retention of foster carers between placements, ensure a sustainable pipeline of foster carers and encourage the return of foster carers to provide the vital care they provide for the State&rsquo;s most vulnerable children.  We request that retrospective contributions be paid by the Exchequer for any gaps for long-term carers and we advocate for foster carers to be included in this long-term carer cohort for the period they are foster parents, even if it is less than the period defined by the Commission on Pensions of 20 years.  We also advocate for the age cut-off be extended from 12 years of age to a minimum of 23 years of age to reflect the additional support required by children in care and to ensure that continuity of support is provided by foster carers.</p><p> At present, foster carers are not getting contributory pension contributions for the period where the criteria I have just outlined are not applicable.  This needs to be urgently addressed.  Foster carers who have contributed to the State alternative care system to offer loving, stable, safe and caring homes to children in the care of the State are disadvantaged by the social welfare system while they play a vital role for our society.</p><p> If I may, I will turn briefly to the foster care' allowance.  Foster carers receive a weekly allowance for caring for a child who is in the care of the State.  The fostering allowance for children under the age of 12 years is &euro;325 per child per week and is increased to &euro;352 for children over the age of 12 years.  The allowance provides for the foster carer to meet all of the living needs of the child.  When a young person reaches the age of 18 years he or she is formally not in care.  However, where a young person remains living with his or her foster carer and continues to participate in full-time education or training, a reduced aftercare allowance of &euro;300 is given.  The foster care allowance has remained static since 2009.  The increasing costs of living, with inflation currently running at 12.3% to the end of April this year, has reduced the value of the allowance.  Economic forecasts inform us that inflation is set to rise further.  The IFCA intends to submit a pre-budget submission to Government on the foster care allowance.  We would welcome an opportunity to return to the committee to discuss this further in the near future.  I thank the Chairperson and committee members. </p></speech>

I very much welcome the invitation and the opportunity to share my experience insofar as it is relevant to the committee's deliberations.  I am the chief executive officer and chairman of a non-statutory fostering agency, Foster Care Ireland.  We currently meet the needs of 26 children in 18 placements.  My background is technical and managerial, and I have 35 years of public sector experience.</p> <p>  This submission outlines the role of fostering in the State&rsquo;s care for children whose families cannot care for them.  Tusla currently subcontracts the provision of less than 10% of foster care placements to the six non-statutory fostering agencies in Ireland.  I will talk about the challenges and rewards of fostering, focusing on the support the State offers to foster carers.  In my conclusion I will make suggestions for improvement in State support for foster carers, with particular reference to the benefits of recognition, the index-linking of the fostering allowance and the introduction of pension credits.</p> <p>  Foster care is the lowest-cost short-term response to caring for children who cannot rely on their family.  Whether through relative foster care or placement with foster carers, fostering closely resembles the family structure familiar to most children that is at the core of our society.  Tusla has the responsibility to safeguard children and provide for children in need.  It recruits, trains, supports, and supervises foster carers with whom it places children.  There are non-statutory providers of fostering services, that is, fostering agencies that recruit, train, supervise and support foster carers in providing placements for one or more children.  The service is provided directly to Tusla and the non-statutory providers account for a growing, but relatively small percentage of foster placements.</p> <p>  While there are differences in scale and structure between the statutory and non-statutory fostering bodies, they each operate to the same framework, observe the same standards and aim for similar outcomes.  Acknowledging that there are ownership preferences, it is worth recalling that monopolies, left to themselves, can become self-serving.  With competition and a healthy tension in the sector, providers can collaborate, co-operate and compete to drive service innovation and adaptation to the benefit of all.  The delivery costs under either model of ownership or market dominance are at the very least comparable.  Members will not be surprised if I claim that the non-statutory model, being smaller, less bureaucratic, more agile and responsive, delivers a superior service under contract to Tusla, as is evidenced by inspection results and independent research commissioned with other non-statutory agencies in the sector.</p> <p>  The recent history of fostering in Ireland shows a decline in the number of Tusla-provided placements.  This decline has been partially offset by an increase in the number of placements through the non-statutory providers.</p><p>This is against a background of a rising demand for placements driven by demographic and social trends.  The availability of foster care placements must improve if the demand is to be met.  A failure to do this can only result in poorer outcomes for children with higher direct and indirect costs for the State.  Common to both statutory and non-statutory organisations is the challenge of recruiting, training, supporting and retaining a sufficient number of foster carers.  In this presentation I concentrate on the aspects of recruitment and retention of most interest to the committee.<br/><br/>A decision to commit to fostering is as multifaceted as buying a house and greater, arguably, than deciding to change career or employment.  It invites compromise; compromise in making a decision that will bring rewards and entail constraints, and will only be possible if enabled.  The rewards are intrinsic to the process of fostering and being an active agent in the development of another human being.  The constraints are immediate, bearing as they do on personal space, time, freedom and the need to prioritise others.  Among the enablers are the training, support, collegiality with other foster carers, financial allowances and support and recognition that the current State framework promotes.<br/><br/>The pool of available placements is not static - it grows with recruitment of new carers and shrinks as carers retire.  With each retirement there is a loss of capacity and of valued experience.  Early retirement can be precipitated by weak enablers or the emergence of more attractive employment options.  The costs of recruitment are high and comprise advertising, inquiry progression, training and assessment.  Typically, there is a 1% yield of qualified carers from the initial inquiries we receive.  Inquiry progresses through a home visit, completion of a detailed application pack and assessment by a professionally qualified social worker.  There is training and, finally, approval at a Tusla area foster care committee.  Fallout can occur at any point in the process, at a greater sunk cost the later it happens in the process.  With such high recruitment costs there is an economic incentive to retain foster carers for as long as possible.<br/><br/>Although not ideal, many foster care placements can be for the duration of the remaining childhood.  Making a good match between child and carer is at the heart of what we do, and it is in the child&rsquo;s interest that the match endures as long as the child needs the placement.  Two of the most frequent criticisms of the care system are the frequency with which placements break down and the frequency with which social workers change.  Stability is a huge factor in a successful placement.  It is linked with carer resilience secured through careful recruitment and is sustained by training and professional support.<br/><br/>The committee has a direct interest in and can influence the evolution of the enabling framework, particularly how and when the framework adapts to the current need to attract and retain foster carers.  The financial support to foster carers in the form of the fostering allowance and the recognition that their work receives are salient in any decision to commence or cease to foster.  As the committee heard, foster carers of children over 12 receive a tax-free payment of a fostering allowance of &euro;352 per week.  This amount has been fixed since 2009, over which time inflation was 9.8% and is now rising rapidly.  As a positive enabler or incentive, it is weakening, and the weakness must be addressed for capacity to be retained.<br/><br/>Foster carers who would prefer fostering to working have to weigh up the consequences for their pension entitlement.  In the absence of pension recognition for fostering, potential carers may opt for employment.  This is on the grounds that there will be future pension benefits when their needs will be greater.  The fostering allowance and pension credits are two critical factors in the decision to foster and to cease to foster.  The adjustment of one and the introduction of the other, in particular a pension entitlement, could rebalance a decision in favour of fostering as a desirable activity that will benefit society and, by retaining foster carers, the overall costs of fostering.<br/><br/>Recognition is a powerful reinforcer and motivator.  It has tangible and intangible dimensions.  Recognition of qualifications brings status and respect.  Recognition and awareness of outcomes brings societal approval and reinforcement.  Pensions credits, to which family carers are now entitled, leave foster carers feeling, by comparison, overlooked and underappreciated.  This year&rsquo;s fostering week brought television coverage of successful fostering outcomes that reached out to many and improved the image of fostering in marked contrast to the high profiling of institutional failings that received so much news coverage.  This rebalancing is to be applauded and the imagination of those involved is exemplary.<br/><br/>To conclude, Foster Care Ireland supports all efforts to improve the image, societal regard and tangible recognition of the growing professionalism of fostering.  There is a <i>prima facie</i>case for the adjustment of the fostering allowance, at a minimum in line with inflation.  The provision of a pension entitlement proportional to the fostering allowance would help to level the playing field to make fostering more attractive and improve recruitment, retention, service level and cost at a stroke.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions and the first relates to child benefit.  I had a gentleman from my constituency who contacted me.  He is the grandfather of four children - his daughter is their mother - and he and his wife take care of them.  The daughter is having problems of her own and she does not see the children.  She continued to get the child benefit payment in respect of four children of &euro;560 per month for six months, or &euro;3,360 over the period.  She made no contribution to the children and it was money that she received and could keep.  I found that quite unusual and had not come across it before.  It is something I wanted to mention.  I know within the social protection system there may not be room for that level of flexibility when it comes to child benefit and the six-month rule is there.  What are the views of the witnesses on that?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the State pension.  What happens with former foster carers who reach the pension age?  How do they manage once they come to the age of 66 and cannot access a State pension?  I presume some of them can get the non-contributory State pension, which is means-tested, but there are obvious difficulties there as well.</p> <p>  Mr. Taylor of Foster Care Ireland argues that a pension entitlement would be proportional to the allowance received now but does he mean the group seeks a State pension higher than the current rate of &euro;253?  Is the group looking for a rate matching the fostering allowance or the State pension as it is today?  The difficulty with the State pension is that the important recognition from the Department of Social Protection is not there.  I imagine there is a huge financial cliff edge for foster carers once they reach pension age but cannot receive the full State pension.  In fairness, they are very much entitled to that.  Will Mr. Taylor speak a little more about what he would like to see with a pension?</p> <p>  I know the pensions commission in its report put forward recommendations for carers, including long-term carers, and the use of Exchequer funds to top up where contributions do not reach the full amount.  Will Mr. Taylor speak a little more about that?  I imagine the pension issue is probably making it harder to bring in foster carers.  Then again, on the other side foster carers might come into the system when the State pension is so far away.  Is the knowledge even there for them that this is an issue?</p><p>Does it only become apparent when they get to 66 and it is too late?  People cannot buy contributions now and there are significant difficulties there as well.  My questions are about child benefit and the State pension.  I thank the witnesses again for their contributions.  I have to go into the Chamber to speak, but I have a few minutes.  If I go out, I will be back again.</p></speech>

It is governed under the Children Act.  If the family, which is related, are not approved or assessed for foster care, therefore, they are in a private arrangement between the individuals within a family.  This is something IFCA sees to a significant degree based on calls to our national helpline.  It is something that needs to be addressed because we find that relative carers, in particular grandparents, are caring for their children's children - their grandchildren - but they are not entitled to receive child benefit.  There is no additional income to enable them to care for those children and keep them out of the care of the State altogether.  There is no recognition of the value and contribution the family gives.  That is something IFCA has been speaking about to the Department and Tusla.  They are traditionally known as private arrangements and the families caring for the children are not entitled to any income while the child benefit continues to remain with the birth parent of those children.</p> <p>  We have a number of foster carers who are now reaching retirement age who suddenly find out that they have no entitlement to the State pension.  Many of them have worked prior to coming into fostering and gave up their employment to take on the care of children from the State.  This is the real kernel of the issue in terms of pensions.  While the pensions commission recommended that home carers would get a 20-year entitlement to contributory pensions for long-term care, IFCA requests that this would not apply to foster carers.  There needs to be a unique pension status for foster carers that gives them enough credits for the duration of their fostering career, from the time they take on their first child to the time they retire from fostering, if they remain on the Tusla panel.  This adequately reflects the time they have given to the State, where they have not been eligible to enter the workforce.  That is only fair and correct and recognises the long service these families have given to the care of children on behalf of the State.  What we would like to see in the pension provision is that foster carers would receive contributory pension credits for their entire period of fostering when they were not available for work because they were caring for children on behalf of the State.</p> <p>  I will defer the question on the comparative merits of the contributory pension and the foster care allowance to Foster Care Ireland.  Many foster carers enter fostering with a big heart and pensions are probably the last thing on their mind.  I might defer to Ms Corridon, who is in this position at the moment.</p></speech>

It was not until I had the opportunity to speak to more experienced foster carers that I discovered this was going to be a problem.  I am a veterinarian by profession.  I have a PhD and I gave up full-time employment to become a foster parent.  There is so much going on.  We were approved at the end of August 2020 and within a month we had our first placement.  The child in our care had quite a lot of medical needs so that then became the priority - his medical care, his development and managing around the system.  I must admit that pensions were probably the last thing on our mind.  It is something we need to get a little bit more savvy about.  Thankfully, my husband works full time but I gave up full-time employment to become a full-time carer.  It very much depends on the needs of the child, as to how much time will be involved.  An infant was placed with us so that was very much full time.  It might have been different if it had been an older child.  We did not know what to expect when we were approved.  We were approved for children aged from zero to 17 in 11 months, so we did not know who we were going to get or even how many.  People just do not know when they go into it as it is very much down to chance and timing.</p></speech>

The thrust of my remarks was that we have a problem with declining capacity.  We have a second problem given that inflation is rampant.  Consequent on that, the conversations that we are witnessing between foster carers relate to the allowance primarily and the costs of providing for children.  Several of them are in a position where they might decide to desist.  The question is what kind of incentives are appropriate.  I am looking at it from the perspective of how we build, retain and ensure that we have enough capacity to address the issue.  The technicalities of the design of the pension are beyond my expertise and experience, but that is the market situation, if one likes.</p></speech>

We are a social welfare committee and it is obvious that other issues that have been raised are more appropriate to the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I will, therefore, focus solely on social welfare because that is where we can give the most help.</p> <p>  The no-brainer at the beginning is to just increase the foster care allowance in line with inflation from 2009.  Something is going to have to happen there or otherwise its value will go down rapidly.  I take it that if that happened, it would be a considerable start, although the witnesses might aim for a lot more.  We have people in every week with all sorts of requests.  Ms Corridon says she is a vet.  It is like any farmer at the fair.  The issue is what is realistic right across the board in all of the very valid, contending demands but this is a particular case as nothing has happened since 2009.  Most welfare rates have gone up in the meantime so that is sensible.</p> <p>  The second point that strikes me, if I understood correctly, was that in some care orders there is a requirement that the foster carer gives up work.  I am trying to latch it on to some existing payment rather than create a totally new payment.  The definition of the carer's allowance is that one gives somebody full-time care and attention.  It seems that rather than having to apply and make the case that there is full-time care and attention involved, where foster parents have to give full-time care and attention, by definition, that entitles them to the carer's allowance.  That would mean they would get a weekly payment over and above the foster care allowance, which I understand is to pay for the child.  That is something we could look at as a committee.  I am interested in hearing the reaction of the witnesses to that.  Sometimes it is easier to get something when amending an existing scheme than creating a brand new one.</p> <p>  I do not want to get too technical on the credits and pensions but, like everything else, it is technical.  I will try to keep it simple.  A credit is as good as a paid contribution if, first, one has ten years paid from the time one started work to the time one reaches pension age.  That could be achieved in gaps and reached by adding a bit here and a bit there, but one has to have 520 contributions paid sometime in one's life, between whatever time one started working, which could include holiday work and so on.  It is not confined to full-time work.  As long as one earns &euro;38 a week, one gets an A-rated stamp, but one has to have ten years.  I am curious to find out if the witnesses know or could find out how many foster parents would get caught by that, allowing for a child being with them for 20 or 23 years, depending on the age he or she is fostered at.</p><p>This would be, for example, 20 years out of a 40-year working life.  How many people will find the ten-year paid contributions a problem?</p><p> The next issue is of huge constraint, which is the 12 years and after.  If it is birth to age 12, or if the family got the child at two or three years old, it would be three to 12 years and so on.  There is an issue when the child is 12 years of age.  I definitely believe there is a case for an exception to be made here.  If the foster parent is required to be there until the child reaches the age of 23 then it is a very reasonable case.  It is about the term limits we come up against.  People are all the time coming into the clinic to see me where they have their pensions and so on and perhaps they are trying to get the care years credit, depending on the size of the family and all sorts of things, including caring for elderly people.  There is a limit, however, on the credit someone can get, which is 20 years.  The credits might be due to being out with illness, being unemployed, or due to caring credits.  The total limit is 20 years.  One might jump out of the fire, if the limit is raised to 23 years of age for fostering.  Because a person may have been ill, or may be ill in the future, or if a person was unemployed, or ends up on credits for all sorts of reasons, he or she may hit the 20-year ceiling.  It would seem to me that if they got rid of the 12-year limit and instead raised it to 23 years in the case of foster care, and if we got rid of the 20-year credit ceiling in the case of fostering, then all would be left is the barrier to the credit being as good as the stamp.  This is what I am trying to get at.  At some stage in a person's career he or she would have had to put up 520 contributions.  I should not use the word "stamp"; it is very old-fashioned of me.  When I started working they were actually stamps that one put on a card.  Would the ten-year contribution clause cause a problem?  Do the witnesses foresee it causing a problem for many?  Would most of the foster carers have worked before they fostered and perhaps returned to work once the fostering was finished and the child was over a certain age?  This is where I can see we might go in the short term.  Is this the kind of direction that would help to make it much more likely, while not absolutely cast iron, to get a contributory pension?  Would this help to do something with the foster care allowance?  Would it help to say that, by definition, foster carers are entitled to the carer's credit?</p></speech>

The first is the age restriction on the eligibility for children to qualify for the home caring period scheme.  If that age could be increased from 12 to 23, it would make a significant difference because in most cases of fostering the child has longer-term needs and longer-term development needs and stays with the foster carer for longer.  The second key point made by the Deputy was on the 20-year limit on the contributions.  Fostering can, and does, last longer than 20 years and in the case of multiple fostering, it can certainly exceed the 20-year cap.  If this limit was removed with regard to foster carers it would be another huge step.  With regard to the detailed analysis of existing foster carers and the existing level of pension credits they have-----</p></speech>

It is unusual for me to ask a member a question rather than the witnesses.

I am doing the same thing.  Perhaps this is something on which we as a committee could seek clarification.  It might be a mechanism.  I presume that quite a lot of foster parents would have some contribution record before they start in this particular role.  They could be made aware of the possibility of making voluntary contributions.  It may overcome that, and particularly from this point forward.  It would minimise the issue and the liability into the future.</p></speech>

We must look at the issue from a social protection point of view.  This is where we can be most useful.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the incredibly important role that foster parents play in the provision of care for extremely vulnerable children and children who very much need that care.  I have seen this work in my role as a primary school teacher.  I have seen many children who were going through the foster care system and were in extremely loving and caring placements that helped those children achieve their full potential.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has dealt in length with the issues around the credits and the pension.  I accept this is clearly not work foster carers do for money.  If people make the decision to enter the foster caring system, they are clearly not motivated by profit.  It was interesting for me to find out that I would not qualify as a foster carer based on the work that happens within my household.  To qualify as a foster carer a person within my household would have to make a decision to step back from work.  While we are both parents within our household we would not qualify as foster carers, which is interesting.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the far end of foster care.  I attended an Empowering People in Care, EPIC, event that was run on the Waterford campus of the South East Technological University, SETU, which I am now training myself to say as opposed to saying WIT.  Will the witnesses talk to us about what happens when the child reaches the age of 18?  This is very important.  I learned at the EPIC event that it can be a situation that places a great deal of stress and pressure on those children who are, essentially, exiting State care or foster care.  How do the witnesses feel this could be designed to be better supported?  In my own case, at the age of 45 I know that I could still turn the key in my parents' door.  When we go back to basics, whatever happens in life, we know that there is still a door we can turn the key in.  I believe it is the case with many foster parents that they still provide this lifelong relationship with children who have passed through their care.  I do not believe this is supported or recognised.  Will the witnesses talk to us a little about that?  Will they also comment on the pressure facing the foster child if he or she enters third level education and, for example, if a course is not working out for them?  What are the implications of this on their payments?</p> <p>  If a person has gone through the fostering experience, it seems to me very strange that foster carers would care for a child for a long period and then at the age of 18 or 23, the doors just seem to come down on the relationship.  I know, of course, that the doors do not come down on the relationship, but how does the State understand that relationship?  Perhaps the witnesses would outline their experiences of that, and if there are ways the State could support an ongoing relationship in a better way.</p></speech>

Legally, within the Child Care Act the legal age of adulthood is 18 years.  When a young person in foster care arrives at the age of 18, he or she is no longer deemed to be a child in care.</p><p>They then move into the aftercare space.  Many young people in foster care find the term "aftercare" does not reflect their status in life.  They are defined by their care status as opposed to the achievements in their own lives.  Foster carers also find the terminology of aftercare very frustrating and demeaning.  In 2021, IFCA held a series of focus groups specifically looking at the aftercare system and how it impacts on children in care and foster carers.  Foster carers felt devalued by the system of aftercare because when the child reaches the age of 16, many of them are told by an aftercare worker that they are taking over, the child is moving into aftercare and their job is done.  These families are hugely invested in these children, like Ms Corridon, who has had her little boy from two weeks of age.  They are investing all their lives into these children.  It is the same for Mr. Nolan, who is fostering three children.  To be told when the children reach 16 that they have done their job is quite demeaning and belittling for foster carers because they have invested in these children's futures.  They see themselves as part of these children's futures and the vast majority of them are, thankfully.  They have raised these children and brought them to all their appointments and access visits.  They have brought this whole young person out at the other end and want to continue caring for them.  The vast majority of foster carers continue to care for these children beyond the end of aftercare, which is at age 23.  We know of children of foster carers who are now fostering other children themselves and so it is almost like a family fostering.  The whole area of aftercare needs to be reviewed.  I am aware that Tusla is reviewing it.  The Irish Foster Care Association and Empowering People in Care, EPIC, have entered into a joint endeavour to get the views of foster carers and young people in care.  That report will be issued quite soon and we can provide that to the committee.</p><p> Within the review of the Child Care Act, we need to look at the legal age of leaving care being 18.  Not many parents would tell their child, on reaching 18, that they are on their own.  Not many parents would tell them at the age of 16 that they need to spend the next two years preparing them for leaving.  It is not natural in family life.  While these children may be chronologically 18, developmentally they are not because of the myriad of complex issues they have on coming into care, the early life experiences, loss and separation they have had in their lives.  We have a very responsible job in caring for these very vulnerable young people in our society.  There is a huge investment by the State for all these children in their foster care placements, as well as by the foster carers, only for it to fail at the last hurdle.  We in IFCA often wonder about that.  Sending these children out into the big bad world and severing ties with them sets them up for failure.  As many parents will know, sometimes when children go to college, they do one year of a course and do not really like it and want to change direction.  The system does not facilitate that for our young people in care.  There are young people in care who want to go on to do masters' degrees and need the financial means and support to do that.  This is also an area for the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  When we have published our final report, which is imminent, we can share that with the committee if it would help it in those areas. </p></speech>

They have invested a huge amount of their time in these young adults.  They want to support them and see them become fully contributing members of society.  We often hear that at the first meeting a child has on leaving aftercare, they will be given the number for Focus Ireland to find alternative types of living accommodation.  That can be quite disappointing and devastating for foster carers because they do not want their young people going into homelessness.  They want them to get the best in life that they have prepared them for, while also having that safety net under them.  We need a system where our young vulnerable people leaving care can have somewhere to come back to, a place of safety.  The Deputy said he still has the key to his mother's house.  Many of us do.  We need a safety net for our young people so we are not just casting them off into the ocean and hoping all the investment and supports they received during childhood will stay the course for them.  We need some kind of safety net for our young people to create an environment where they can fulfil their full potential and whatever vision they have for themselves.</p></speech>

As others said, we are delighted to have them here.  I pay tribute to foster parents throughout this land.  They have a very nurturing and caring approach to people.  I constantly meet people who have been in foster care who say they are heading back to their parents, which are the foster parents, to see how they are.  They might be coming from a different part of the country.  There are still many misconceptions about foster care.  There are many couples who would like to foster but say they do not have the ability or do not feel they can do it.  Is that something the witnesses come across a lot?  How can we approach that?  That is said to me several times a month by people who would like to foster.  I also raise the six month assessment.  I know we have to be careful and people have to go through an assessment but would the witnesses be in favour of shortening that to four months, as a way of bringing people on board quicker?</p> <p>  Whether we like to admit it or not, there are a minority of people who make terrible references to foster parents by saying they are in it for the money.  I deplore that comment.  First, foster parents do not get a payment.  The payment is towards the costs of bringing up the child and caring for them, ensuring that child can attend all the events children would and have as natural an upbringing as possible.  I hate that comment.  It is a minority of people who say it.  They will say it privately, which is appalling.  That is something I would like stamped out.  Mainly it is a matter of the misconceptions that still exist.  There are many people who feel they would like to foster but think they cannot.  I thank the witnesses for being here.</p></speech>

Anyone who watched the "Late Late Show" episode on fostering would be assessing whether they could have been the person who made the difference to that child's life.  That is where the image of fostering is terribly important.  People can assess, looking the outcomes and the children involved, whether they could imagine themselves in that role.  That partially addresses the negative connotation of people only being in it for the money.  That is why I said that anything members can do to highlight the importance and the societal benefits of fostering is a material contribution to building capacity.  The Senator asked about the length of the assessment.</p><p>I suggested in my remarks that it is a big decision.  It is actually quite complex.  You are surrendering quite a lot.  You need time to transition that.  What is actually going on in that assessment period is a conversation between a professional - a qualified social worker who has experience of fostering - and the person who is intending to foster.  There is a mutual informing process going on there.  At any time during that process, as I have suggested, people can part and be comfortable with the decision they have taken.</p></speech>

In fact, six months is the minimum number of months for assessment.  Many assessments can go on beyond that and take up to 12 months.  It is a for both the assessment of the social worker and for the family.  It involves not only speaking to the couple or individual but also to their children.  When bringing a new member into a family, one wants to ensure everybody is comfortable with that and they can make space for a new individual, as well as for the demands of fostering.</p> <p>  With the Chairperson's permission, I might hand over to our chairperson, Mr. Raymond Nolan, who is fostering three children.  He can speak of the demands of fostering and going into it with one&rsquo;s eyes open.</p></speech>

They are all well informed, which is great to see.  I would like to think that this may be the beginning of proper engagement to work towards meeting foster parents&rsquo; needs.  This will benefit the children who are in care.  We speak about issues such as allowance, pensions, etc.  These issues must be thrashed out.  People must feel they are respected.  I say this because the sacrifice that is made is enormous.  If you have not walked a mile in my shoes, you just do not know what I am talking about.  That is fair to say.</p> <p>  On the whole, the way fostering has developed in Ireland is great.  The work that Tusla does is fantastic in the main.  There are gaps.  There are gaps in every part of our society, whether that is health, public transport or whatever, and there are gaps in fostering.  Pensions are one of those gaps, as is the issue of the foster care allowance.  Senator Murphy mentioned mileage.  I cannot understand or process how something that was set in 2009 could be relevant today.  It is set in the foster care allowance that for the first 50 km I travel, I do not get any compensation.  I cannot process that and I am a smart enough individual.  If I travel 49 km per day with a child, I get nothing.  However, if I travel 51 km per day with a child, I get an allowance for 1 km.  For that 1 km, we get 25 cent.  That is not respectful to people who are doing this on a voluntary basis and bringing up children on behalf of the State and society.  It is disrespectful.  That is the feeling on the ground, if I may say that.</p> <p>  The Irish Foster Care Association is the association that supports us as foster parents.  I have to hand over &euro;70 from my pocket to Ms Bond so that I can be a member of the association.  I am a volunteer.  The State should be paying that fee.  I know Tusla has been asked to look into that and it has given it the side kick.  I do not see why we, as volunteers who do not get paid, do not get a salary and whose needs are not met, should have to take &euro;70 out of our pockets to be a member of the association that supports us.</p> <p>  We are moving in the right direction.  We are speaking today to members of the committee.  We cannot drop the ball now.  We need to engage with the Irish Foster Care Association.  Tusla has asked us to grow our membership.  However, we cannot grow it if we are asking people who are volunteers for &euro;70.  We need the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to increase the budget given to the Irish Foster Care Association.  It is minimal.  It is just not enough.  The Irish Foster Care Association does not even have the number of staff it needs to meet the demands for counselling and advocacy.  I have used the advocacy service in recent times and that is ongoing.  It is an invaluable service.  I could not put a price on it, and nor could Tusla.  It has saved three children in care.  It has saved the placement.  The advocacy worker was just phenomenal.  That is the quality of staff that IFCA has.  This is not recognised either in the funding the association is getting.  The funding needs to be at least doubled to support the people who are bringing children up on behalf of this State.</p> <p>  I can tell the committee one story that sprang to mind.  Last year, on Easter Saturday I think, I was outside doing something.  A ten-year-old child came outside and asked me if Theresa and I were going to buy a cottage in our 80s.  I said that we may not live into our 80s.  He said, &ldquo;You will".  When I asked why he said that, he said, &ldquo;You are good people&rdquo;.  I said, &ldquo;Thanks a million but why would you say we are good people?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;You change children&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;  That is powerful message from a ten-year-old child.  I relay that message to the committee today.  That is the basis on which we must move.  I thank members for listening.</p></speech>

All members appreciate the wonderful work foster parents do.  Let us be clear about that.  My question on the assessment, and I should probably know this, was whether people who are re-fostering have to go through the full assessment again, if there is only a short period between placements.</p></speech>

By the way, our assessment took two years, which is too long.  We were ready to throw in the towel a few times.  Thank God, we did not do so.  It is tough, and let nobody tell the committee any different.  There are great days, but there are many days where I ask myself what I am doing.  The rewards, such as when that boy said that to me, mean it all.</p></speech>

The 520 contributions have to be accumulated from self-employment or paid employment.  The committee should find out if many people get trapped in that.  If not, it would be a matter of having the carer&rsquo;s credits amended.  If that is catching a lot of people, there is a separate issue of the lack of actual paid contributions and the fact that people do not get paid contributions when they are fostering, unless they have some type of part-time work.  From what we heard, that is rare.</p></speech>

For many of them, it is a difficult process to gather all of the information.  The vast majority of them have been fostering for a long period of their lives.  We must remember that if I take in a child at the age of two weeks, as Ms Corridon has done, and I have the child until they are 23 years of age, I might then take in a five-year-old child five years down the road and have that child until they are 23.  Therefore, there are limitations to somebody taking up paid employment.  The only way someone might have the required number of contributions would be if they were made prior to that person entering fostering.  This is certainly an issue we could interrogate further among our members who are in this predicament.  We need the State to recognise the duration for which somebody fosters and to make contributions for them.  The comparative cost of children in residential care is substantially higher, and will always be substantially higher, than a State pension to foster carers.  The vast majority of foster carers foster more than one child.  We have members who would have fostered 30 or 40 children throughout their period of being a foster carer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1787" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022060100002#H01000"><p>I hear what Ms Bond is saying.  It would obviously be much better to have it as a contribution, but it is a bigger leap for welfare.</p><p>This is where we have to try to calculate where we are likely to make the most gains.  Making massive demands without succeeding is not much use.</p><p> When someone comes in with a pension contribution record, the first step is to count whether he or she has 520 reckonable contributions.  That gets you over step one, after which you get into what is currently the averaging system, although it will not last forever.  A total of 40 years' worth of contributions is being talked about for everybody in the future.  The contributions can be either paid or credited.  Once you get over the first hurdle, you just need to credit, as long as there is no limit.  If someone is required to provide care for the child well beyond 12 years, that case is a no-brainer.  The idea of the 12 years is that when the child goes to secondary school, most parents can at least earn &euro;38 per week.  I refer to cases that are not high dependency and to there being an out regarding children with a severe disability.  It is a question of what can be done in one year and, regarding the second year, where the best pitch is.  It is also a question of which arrangement will get 99% or virtually 100% through and of not getting everything you want while actually winding up with nothing.  It is a guessing game when dealing with Departments, as the witnesses know.  I have always found that the more one can operate within the existing system and tweak the system, the more one is likely to get what I describe in the next budget change.  I am referring to what occurs if you try to rewrite the rules more.</p><p> On the case that my good colleague raised, namely, that of the living wage, the matter is being addressed in a very tentative way in one Department.  It is not in the Department of Social Protection at all.  It kicked the matter to touch because it saw the implication of a living wage for everybody and so on.  It should be achieved in the future.  Having a living wage, with additional income taxed, is a very good idea but it is a question of how to get to all these great places and do so step by step.  It would be useful to get some data on how many people, before, after or even during very part-time work, manage to achieve the 520 paid contributions so we will know what the real problems are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022060100002#J00200"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I have a couple of comments and questions that follow on from where he left off.  It would be interesting to know how many foster-care parents come from a work environment into their role.  If they have worked for ten years, they can continue to make voluntary contributions for the rest of the foster-care period.  In that case, one is talking about the cost of the voluntary contribution, which is a minimal cost compared with the actual return one would get in terms of a State pension.  The feedback from raising awareness of this opportunity among foster parents might indicate the number of people who fall into the category.  If a considerable number of foster parents do fall into the category, the overall cost to the Exchequer of an extension for everyone is reduced considerably.  From the delegates' perspective, it would be useful for them to make their members and foster parents in general aware of what I am talking about and of potential eligibility.</p> <p>  The delegates raised the issue of making credited contributions where foster parents are between caring roles.  Am I correct that, in those instances, they are not in receipt of a payment?  Not being in receipt of payments could cause significant problems with regard to getting a credited contribution.  This is somewhat different from the issue we are dealing with in terms of family carers.  It might be one that the delegates may wish to revisit and revert to us on.  Am I correct that a foster parent is eligible to receive the carer's allowance if caring for a child with a serious or significant disability?</p> <p>  Could I have clarification on an issue concerning child benefit that comes under the remit of our committee?  My understanding is that if a child leaves the family home, for whatever reason, the parent continues to receive child benefit for six months.  If it goes beyond that period, the foster parent receives it.  I have two questions in this regard.  Does Tusla provide an additional allowance for the first six months to cover the shortfall?  Alternatively, could the child in question be left without an additional resource coming into the household?  Does that apply in respect of the children I spoke about earlier, namely, the unaccompanied minors, who, thankfully, are now going through the fostering system rather than the horrendous system that was in place prior to that?  Does child benefit kick in immediately for foster parents of unaccompanied minors, because the parents of the latter would not be in receipt of child benefit?</p> <p>  Excuse my lack of understanding, but Mr. Taylor might clarify a point for me.  He stated, "The delivery costs under either model of ownership or market dominance are at the very least comparable".  He was talking about the statutory and non-statutory models.  I have had no dealings with the non-statutory model.  The only dealings I have had relate to home help.  Where the home help is not directly employed by or paid by the HSE, the rate is decided by the company employing that individual to provide this support.  Do the parents Mr. Taylor engages with receive the fostering allowance?  What is the relationship between those parents and his organisation?  Do the parents receive allowances over and above the fostering allowance?  Mr. Taylor made the point that there are savings because his model is smaller, less bureaucratic and more agile.  How can there be savings if the payment rates are the same?  I would like that to be clarified because I do not understand how his system operates by comparison with that associated with home help funded by the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1790" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022060100002#J00300"><p>Points were made on the importance of awareness-raising in the foster care community and on people who have worked for ten years making additional contributions.  Awareness-raising can certainly be undertaken.  We can also undertake to collate the data on whether people would have the ten years of contributions, but we are aware that many do not.  We can continue to obtain the data.</p> <p>  On the issue of foster carers receiving a payment between foster-care placements, the carers are not given any retainer payment by Tusla but are on the register of foster carers and available to foster.  Therefore, there is certainly a gap for foster parents in the period.  The rationale for not paying the child benefit to the foster carer for the first six months is in the provision in the Child Care Act, which specifies that short-term fostering is for six months or less.  Therefore, the objective is to return the child to the family.</p><p>The rationale has always been that there is hope that the child will return to the family.  The disruption of that payment to the birth family would be too great, and the bureaucracy around having to reapply for it would probably take as long in that period.</p><p> On the Chairman's other question, the foster carers do not receive any additional payments other than the foster care allowance.  They may approach Tusla for extraordinary expenses.  Ms Corridon may be able to speak to the experience of taking in a new baby, and all of the expenses attributed to setting up a new foster care placement when I finish.  Funds can be provided on an extraordinary one-off basis, for example, if carers want to buy particular items for a child.  Without a doubt, however, financial pressures are placed on foster carers in the first six months of the placement, particularly if the foster carer has a teenager who is going to school, given the cost of uniforms.  In our recent survey carried out during fostering fortnight this year, we asked our foster carers what difference an additional allowance would make for them.  We received high levels of responses stating that an additional allowance would enable foster carers to bring children to more activities or perhaps even pay for therapies for children that are not provided by the HSE or Tusla.  Tusla does not make up the shortfall in the allowance; it is assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> On foster carers who care for children with disabilities receiving the home carers allowance, it is a real challenge.  Many of the children in foster care have highly complex needs, but a diagnosis of disability is required in order for the foster carer to avail of those other payments.  All of our children come into care with significant levels of need because they have very early traumatic experiences, but they may not be diagnosed as having a disability.  Our foster carers are providing high levels of care for children with very complex needs, but will be unable to apply for extra payments if the children are not diagnosed as having a disability.</p><p> On unaccompanied minors, we have not really seen cases of foster carers having an unaccompanied minor being placed with them in a official fostering capacity yet.  Just yesterday, an approved foster carer who has an unaccompanied minor placed with them contacted our helpline.  However, the placement is not within a fostering capacity.  The issue that the foster carer raised with us is the high levels of cost associated with housing a child who has arrived in the country, starting them in a new school and buying the school uniform, and dealing with very traumatised children who will require levels of counselling and trauma care.  As of yesterday, when the foster carer contacted IFCA, she had not received any financial assistance from anybody.</p></speech>

With the foster carer's permission, I can send the correspondence to the committee.  We are seeing unaccompanied minors being placed in family homes.  Some of the carers are approved foster carers and others are unapproved foster carers.  The carers have no entitlement to payments - not even child benefit.  I am aware that some unaccompanied minors are coming into Ireland with non-relative adults, and the adults are receiving the child benefit for that young person.  The families caring for the minors are receiving nothing at the moment.  I think that answers all of the Chairman's questions.</p></speech>

The first concerns child benefit.  I can fully understand why the child benefit is not withdrawn from the birth family.  It makes perfect sense.  However, the purpose of child benefit is to deal with he additional cost of rearing a child, which, sadly, has become far more expensive in the past 12 months than it was heretofore.  In that instance, those particular children are losing out.  The State is making the payment through the Department of Social Protection.  Surely, a similar payment should be made by Tusla for the interim window and period?</p> <p>  Second, I was very surprised by what Ms Bond stated in respect of the treatment of foster parents of unaccompanied minors.  The State did not covered itself in glory in respect of the treatment of these children in the past.  Many were found in appalling conditions.  I refer to those fortunate enough to have been found.  Sadly, 443 of them were never found.  No one seems to care about them.  Ms Bond has stated that in those instances the State is not supporting the foster parents involved in providing support, accommodation and far more to children who are coming from extremely traumatic situations.  We have seen first-hand what is happening at the moment with unaccompanied minors coming from Ukraine.  Such minors have been coming to Ireland from all over the world for the last 25 years.  We would like to hear more from Ms Bond on that issue.  </p> <p>  Does Ms Corridon wish to comment on her own experience of becoming a foster parent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1800" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Corridon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022060100002#K01000"><p>My husband and I had around 24 hours' notice that we were going to be taking home a two-week-old infant.  We had absolutely nothing and did not have a clue what we needed to get, so there was a mad shopping frenzy.  I should also say that this happened in the middle of the Covid pandemic.  I am sure members can imagine how difficult it was.  Thankfully, we had the means to buy the items we required.  If we were in that situation and did not have money in the bank to pay, it would have been difficult.  No additional payment was provided to help us get set up.  Anyone who has bought for a new baby will be aware how expensive it all is.  I mentioned that the child in our care has medical needs.  We have had to pay for surgery and a number of different medical expenses for him.  It will take time to be compensated for that.  It was more important to us that he got the surgery and the treatment.  We had to go private in order to do that.  It takes time.  There are additional expenses, but we put the needs of the child first.  We were in the position to meet these additional costs, but for other people it would be a huge financial strain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022060100002#K01100"><p>On the question of the comparison of models, I introduced the issue quite deliberately in order to make the committee aware that there are two systems and to highlight the benefits of having alternative models.  In other words, it is not a question of which is better.  The fact that there is not a total monopoly enables both to learn.  I will give one example.  Insofar as the six players are all subcontracted or service providers to Tusla, the agency can then exercise its own judgment as to how well or not these agencies are performing.  Inevitably, it raises the bar for them because it insists on full compliance with all the standards.  The success in doing this is illustrated by the fact that looking at the results HIQA inspections, we can see that the six non-statutory agencies score higher than Tusla regions do under the same tests.  The point I am making is that there is value in this model.  It empowers Tusla in certain ways.  It also provides learning for the overall system.  I am not trying to say that one model is superior to the other, but that a level of competition that is appropriate in the areas where it is public is useful.</p><p> We had a worry ourselves as non-statutory agencies that we were perceived as being expensive or in it for the money.  Those are both very pejorative comments to apply to us and, as the Senator suggested, they could be applied to the people who do it but that is not the case.  My agency was founded to prevent children from going into 24-hour care at a higher cost to the State, motivated by an earlier intervention.  That said, in the context of the service delivered, there are two aspects to a fostering placement, namely, that of the child, which is monitored by his or her social worker, and that of the foster carer, which is monitored by the link worker.  In the Tusla model, Tusla from separate Departments will provide both those inputs in order that it will have a rounded view rather than one person's view.  In the case of the non-statutory model, we provide the link worker and Tusla continues to provide the child's social worker, so the rapport between those two is very important for the health of the placement.  As a link worker, a case worker in Tusla could hold more than 20 placements, while in the private agencies it ranges from eight to 12.  The level of service delivered to the foster carer, therefore, is higher under the non-statutory model and it is not surprising the inspection results show full compliance.  Part of Tusla's issue relates to a staffing problem.</p><p> On the final question, which I have alluded to, the number of placements at non-statutory agencies is growing while that in Tusla is shrinking.  That has to do with the level of service foster carers experience.  Those trends should result in both Tusla's level of service and the overall level of service improving.  To return to the Chairman's question relating to how the costs of all this are paid for, we commissioned a study, given the accusation the cost was too high, that examined the value for money.  We asked whether, in comparison with Tusla, we were offering value for money and the answer was an unequivocal "Yes".   It would have cost Tusla more to deliver the level of service we were offering.</p></speech>

What is the position of each organisation in regard to child benefit when it comes to a private arrangement, as was mentioned, whereby a relative will take over that care?  The sums are quite large if they are not going towards the raising of the child, which is what child benefit is and should be about.  To help us as a committee in making recommendations and examining the issue, will our guests outline what they are seeing in regard to child benefit specifically?</p> <p>  The issue I raised earlier involved a private arrangement relating to a constituent of mine but, in other cases where it is not a private arrangement, how does the six-month period work?  I apologise if this question has been addressed.  Did Ms Corridon, for example, start receiving child benefit when she took over the foster care of the child?  If she does not wish to comment, that is fine but she might comment on the difference between private arrangements and the rest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1806" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022060100002#L00500"><p>It is the view of IFCA that child benefit should follow the child and that when a child moves into foster care, the payment for the child should go with him or her, particularly for the initial costs.  We often hear foster carers say they have to buy a bicycle, for instance, to enable a child to go to school if it is some distance away, and there are the set-up costs associated with a new baby coming into the home.  We are strongly of the view that child benefit should go with the child from the day he or she moves into a placement.</p> <p>  In regard to relative care and those private fostering arrangements, we certainly need to look at the issue.  These children do not sit within child welfare and protection or within children in care, and the families who care for them are under severe pressure, even in regard to something as basic as giving consent for the children to go on school trips, because they are not the legal guardians of those children.  It is an area IFCA has raised previously and we request it be looked into in detail and will be happy to assist the committee on that.</p> <p>  Certainly, child benefit is designed for children and should follow the child.</p></speech>

My husband and I started our training process in June 2020, were approved at the end of August and had a placement by the end of September, but at no point during that process was any financial information given to us, such as about how we should go about applying for supports.  I do not even know where we sit in regard to child benefit; I will have to look into that.  There was no information about the supports and there certainly was not financial interest in becoming a foster parent.  I was a little horrified to hear I will be financially out in regard to my pension and so on as a result of becoming a foster parent.  No discussion or information was given about that.  The focus is very much on whether we fit the bill and were good enough, with all the evidence required for that.  No information was given as to how we should then go about applying for any benefits to which we were entitled, including any additional ones we might have been entitled to as a result of having a foster child with specific needs.</p> <p>  It might not be a job for the committee, but we should examine the barriers to fostering.  I speak to people all day every day who would be fabulous foster parents but there is a great deal of fear and a lack of knowledge about what is involved.  That would be very useful, not least given the numbers of foster parents are falling.  We need to look at that and how we can encourage more people into it.  The Chairman's colleague stated he is good enough to be a parent but that he would not pass as a foster parent.  In that regard, we should look at the process and how we can draw in people who would be fabulous foster parents, who might have experience raising their own children or who are just genuinely good people who would love to give back to children who need it.</p> <p>  The main cost for us relates to the emotional side of things.  That is where we need additional help and it is why there being an organisation we can contact, outside of the Tusla system, is so valuable for that emotional support.  People talk about the money side of things, but they do not look at what we are expected to deal with in the system.</p></speech>

I asked whether her link worker or the social worker had told her about it and she said "No".  She had googled "support for foster care".  Tusla does not even tell new foster parents that there is an organisation that will support them.  That needs to be rectified.  We need action on these points, not just talk about doing it next year.  It is just not good enough.  Representatives of Tusla appeared before this committee on 10 May and I heard a member state his information told him many foster parents would not recommend fostering to a friend.  That is a sad state of affairs.  It was not the case 20 years ago but it is today.</p></speech>

There are so many people who would love to do this but who think they do not have the ability.  What she said was so true.  How can we overcome that or help our guests overcome it?</p></speech>

Fostering has an emotional impact on foster care families, not just on those adults who are fostering but also on their children.  We are building up a significant amount of information and research on the emotional impacts of fostering.  We really need to support all of these people who are supporting these very vulnerable children.  It can be a very lonely place at times and foster carers always say the best support they can receive is speaking to other foster carers.  The Irish Foster Care Association provides that platform.</p><p> I would like to return briefly to the issue of the unaccompanied minors.  With the permission of the person who sent us the email yesterday, I can send that on to the Chair.</p></speech>

A number of issues have been raised here.  One of the very basic issues is the issue of information and awareness of rights and entitlements.  As part of our recommendations, we will include a recommendation for engagement between the Department of Social Protection and Tusla to provide briefing and information to foster parents regarding eligibility in relation to child benefit and the likes of carer's allowance and making voluntary PRSI contributions.  That is something very basic that can be done based on the evidence we have heard this morning.  While we are happy to give a platform to foster parents to highlight these issues, quite a number of the issues raised this morning are not relevant to this committee.  The committee will make a copy of the proceedings available to the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and ask it to review this evidence and to engage further on these very important issues.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending today and for their constructive and very positive engagement with this committee.

T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm f&aacute;ilti&uacute; ar ais roimh an gcoiste chun tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute; strait&eacute;iseacha na Roinne a phl&eacute;.   The Minister of State and I are delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee on strategic priorities for tourism, culture, arts, sport and media.  The Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community will address Gaeltacht priorities.</p> <p>  Last November when my Department's sectors were among those most seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis, I spoke to the committee about my priorities and the vital importance of these sectors to Irish society, our individual and community well-being and our national economy.  I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society.  With it, our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead.  I am also delighted to see audiences back at arts, culture and event venues and I welcome the full return of fans to our sports grounds.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that there are factors casting a shadow over the recovery, not least the devastating war in Ukraine as well as rising inflation in our economy and internationally.</p> <p>  A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, so that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery.  I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a number of important developments in relation to these sectors.  This year, for tourism, I have allocated an increase of &euro;67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation.  The increased funding will facilitate a further &euro;50 million provision to assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until inbound tourism recovers.  There is a &euro;35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund in 2022 to support marketing strategy and restore inbound tourism to Ireland.  Further to the economic recovery plan published last year, the Government decided to extend the VAT rate reduction to the end of February 2023.  This extension covers the same goods and services as the original measure, including restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres and museums.</p> <p>  I was pleased to announce details of a &euro;50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022.  This included a further strand of the live performance supports scheme as well as the &euro;15 million live performance restart grant scheme, which opened for applications in March.  The Arts Council provides the vital investment needed to protect artists' livelihoods, support arts organisations, develop audiences and nurture young people&rsquo;s engagement with and appreciation of the arts.  Maintaining the record &euro;130 million allocation for 2022 allows the Arts Council to fund events and festivals in across Ireland while nurturing excellence.  From the earliest days of the pandemic, the dramatic realisation of the true intrinsic value of the arts provides an imperative for maintaining funding to the arts.  With regard to my Department's capital programme, the programme for Government makes strong commitments for continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure.</p> <p>  Ireland's tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits regional development.  Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages.  The Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are continuing to collaborate with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.</p><p>I am continuing to liaise with the recovery oversight group in respect of the tourism recovery plan and issues affecting the sector.  Work is also ongoing on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years and ensure that sustainability is at the heart of recovery in the sector.  This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment which includes investment in activity-based tourism.</p><p> There has been much recent discussion about the costs and availability of key components of the tourism sector, such as hotels and car rental.  While I recognise that businesses in the sector are grappling with increased input costs and that increased demand leads to an increase in prices, it is essential that all businesses in the sector are mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its value-for-money proposition as a tourism destination.</p><p> Evidence of excessive charges and prices for tourists, both domestic and overseas, has the potential to cause reputational damage for Ireland.  Furthermore, any negative impact could derail the positive recovery in that sector.  We must work together to ensure that our c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and good value continues.  The tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable.</p><p> With the climate emergency as our backdrop, the future we imagine is one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty.  Last year, the arts and culture recovery task force submitted its report, Life Worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors.  We have made significant progress on implementing the report.</p><p> I was especially pleased to announce &euro;25 million in budget 2022 for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022, as part of the three-year pilot&rsquo;s investment of &euro;105 million.  Applications closed on the 12 May with close to 9,000 applications received.  Under this scheme 2,000 artists and creative arts workers will be provided with &euro;325 per week for three years.  I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector and that it will provide an important legacy for our artists.</p><p> In February, Government also agreed in principle that the Creative Ireland programme will continue for a further five years to encompass the period 2023 to 2027 and will focus on the following pillars: creative youth; creative communities; creative industries; creative health and well-being and creative climate action and sustainability.</p><p> The report of the night-time economy task force was published in 2021 and contained a number of practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy, with some pilot measures to support new developments in this area.  A robust implementation structure has been agreed to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, which has the flexibility to react to new ideas and developments as work progresses.</p><p> In tandem with these developments, we continue to commemorate in a meaningful and respectful way, the events that shaped the foundation of the state, as part of the decade of centenaries programme. The all-party committee, which I established to contribute to the commemorations programme, is working proactively with me as we come to the closing years of the centenary commemorations, with a number of significant events scheduled over the coming years.</p><p> It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content.  Some examples from budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional &euro;4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which was the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the &euro;5.5 million allocated for the establishment of the coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.</p><p> I was glad also to be in a position to provide increased funding to the sound and vision scheme which will be allocated this year, to support the production of high quality television and radio content, including a special round to address climate action and climate change.  With regard to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I also thank the committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report with regard to the general scheme of the Bill.</p><p> The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill.  To address one of the key recommendations of the report, I established an expert group to examine the possibility of providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill.  I have now received the report of the group and am considering its recommendations.  It is a priority to ensure swift progress of the Bill through the legislative process, with a view to having it enacted as soon as possible.  While this is subject to the scheduling of each stage of the legislative process in each House of the Oireachtas, I will urge all Members to work closely with me to expedite its passage, especially against the backdrop of infringement proceedings which are being taken against Ireland in respect of the transposition of the  audiovisual media services directive.  The enactment of the legislation, without delay, is critical to avoiding significant penalties.</p><p> In parallel with the passage of the legislation, my Department is working with the Public Appointments Service with a view to shortly commencing an executive search for the key roles in coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n including that of online safety commissioner.  The establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to allow me to implement many of the recommendations in the report of the Future of Media Commission, which will be brought to Government shortly.  I am sure committee members will agree that all of these measures are critical.  I look forward to ongoing cross-party engagement on this important agenda, where I envisage we will require a rolling suite of legislation to address the effective regulation of this hugely important and influential sector.</p><p> Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and our democracy.  As Minister, I will continue to advocate strongly for these sectors as we emerge from a very difficult period.  I am happy to take any questions members may have.

Our key priorities in sport are to support the sector&rsquo;s continued recovery from the impact of Covid-19, to continue investment in vital infrastructure and to contribute to building a healthier and more active society by increasing sports participation across all sectors.</p> <p>  Consequently, we have set a target of 60% of the population participating in sport and physical activity by 2027.  The last two years have shown us how important sport and physical activity are for our physical health and mental well-being.  As we emerge from the pandemic, the Department continues to prioritise engagement with the sport sector and our significant allocation under budget 2022 will support a strong and vibrant sports sector and provide opportunities for everyone to engage in sport and physical activity.</p> <p>  We have started work on a number of actions which will be of real benefit to sport and we will be working on delivering others in 2023.  First, I wish to embed the sport-for-all ethos across all strands of the sports sector, whether at national governing body level or grassroots level.  The sports action plan includes 43 distinct actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board.  The emphasis is heavily oriented towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p> <p>  We have a record &euro;12 million budget from the Dormant Accounts Fund, for investment in 2022, with which we can focus increased efforts to ensure that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity.  I specifically wish to develop a funding line under the Dormant </p> <p>Accounts Fund that will allow clubs and other organisations to apply directly for sport-for-all funding that will be targeted at increasing participation.</p> <p>  The commitment to diversity, inclusion and equality within the sport action plan is also underpinned by a commitment to increasing female representation on the boards of sporting organisations to a minimum of 40% by 2023.  It is intended to give clarity to sporting organisations on the implications of non-compliance with this measure later this year.</p> <p>  Second, we will be working on other priorities, such as building on the 2022 winter initiative, in order develop a strong programme of events for this winter and beyond, as well as the development of a national swimming strategy and a national database of sport and recreation amenities to provide people with key information on sport and recreational facilities in their localities.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland has published its new long-term high-performance strategy until 2032 which covers the next three Olympic and Paralympic cycles and will support and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s position internationally.  We have provided an increased allocation of &euro;96.2 million in current funding for Sport Ireland in 2022; up 5% on last year.  This will enable it to continue to support the sector through its various funding programmes.  These initiatives support the fulfilment of the Government's high-performance policy, grant funding for sporting organisations and equality in grant funding for female and male players.</p> <p>  In recent years, Ireland has won bids to host the Ryder Cup in Limerick in 2027, games in the UEFA Euro 2020 finals, the women&rsquo;s Rugby World Cup 2017 and is the preferred bidder to jointly host the T20 men&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup 2030.  We will also host the prestigious US college football matches in Dublin for five years from 2022 and, it is hoped, beyond that.  We have engaged with the UK Government and have decided to support the FAI&rsquo;s submission of an expression of interest for a co-hosting bid for Euro 2028.  Officials from my Department will examine the feasibility of supporting a bid before a final decision is made by Government.</p> <p>  We are currently developing a major-sports-events policy and the public consultation phase of this process has just concluded.  Major sports events have the potential to deliver many benefits for sport, society and the economy.  The final policy and strategy, which will be published later this year, will seek to maximise those benefits for Ireland.</p><p>On capital investment in sports projects, the latest round of the sports capital and equipment programme closed for applications last year.  A record 3,106 applications were received, seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  The equipment-only projects were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced in 2021.  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers, with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million, were announced in February 2022.  This represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the programme.  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision and 146 appeals were received by the deadline of 4 April.  Some &euro;6 million was kept in reserve for successful appeals and the outcome of that process was just announced yesterday.</p><p> Resources have been provided in 2022 to continue to progress the projects allocated funding last year under the new large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  The priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects with a view to awarding new grants to projects that missed out under the first set of allocations.  On completion, the scope for awarding any additional grants, adjusting the level of existing grants, and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered.</p><p> I wish to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing the Sport Ireland campus at Blanchardstown.  The 2022 allocation of &euro;9.6 million will allow Sport Ireland to complete ongoing projects and progress the planning and design on the national velodrome and badminton centre.  A new campus master plan has been drafted that will provide the framework for the long-term development of facilities at the campus over the next 15 to 20 years.</p><p>I thank all members for their time and attention and both of us are happy to take questions on any policy issues.</p></speech>

In the Minister's opening statement, she stated, "our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead" and indeed it does.  You can already see an abundance of tourists throughout the city but for how long will that last, given the price gouging that is going on in hotels and the extortionate room rates people are being charged?  People are beyond furious about this.  During the pandemic, when hoteliers had asked the public to support them by holidaying at home, people did support them.  Now you have a situation where things are opening up again and are getting busy and the great rip-off begins.</p> <p>  For example, I checked on Monday morning, when a room in a Dublin hotel was priced at &euro;320 for the night, no breakfast.  I received correspondence yesterday from a family who, because they were concerned about missing their flight, sought to book a room overnight in order that they could depart early for the airport.  The family of two parents and four children were quoted a price of &euro;816 for one night in Dublin city with no breakfast.</p> <p>  Another hotel on a Saturday night in June quoted a Dublin price of &euro;393, where the price in Belfast it was &euro;193.  The cheapest price I could see for two nights in July was &euro;600, again with no breakfast.  Another hotel quoted the same two nights at two euro short of &euro;1,300 but the good news is that there was breakfast included with that.  </p> <p>  These are extortionate prices about which people are completely furious.  </p> <p>  This is going to cause significant reputational damage to Ireland as a destination without a shadow of a doubt.  When the word gets out to overseas visitors that this is a rip-off, that people are paying way above any other hotel rates right across Europe, that Ireland is starting to rip off people again, this will cause long-term damage.  </p> <p>  I was going to say it stinks of pure greed but it is pure greed.  When one goes on to any site to look for hotel prices right across any other major European city, they offer fair prices and value for money.  In Ireland, particularly in the cities and in the larger areas, they are literally engaging in extortionate pricing.  It is not fair on other hotels in quieter areas of the country which are not engaging in price gouging and are trying to do their best to encourage tourism.  When word gets out among overseas visitors, that reputation will be given to us unless a stop is put to it.  </p> <p>  We must also consider domestic tourism, as people are not going to forget these prices.  People will remember all the supports the industry was given during the pandemic.  People supported these hotels, stayed and holidayed at home.  At the time, people had said some of the prices were very expensive in comparison to other times but they were absolutely nothing to the price gouging and the brazen rip-off that is going on now.  In her opening statement, the Minister stated, "We must work together to ensure that our c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and good value continues [and that the] tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable."   What plans does the Minister have to ensure that this price gouging stops?  What is the Minister's assessment of the wisdom of extending the VAT reduction, given that demand is not the problem?  Would she be reluctant to extend this reduction further given this phenomenon or what measures does she plan to take to call out the hotels on these prices because we have to sustain our tourism in the long term?  Once a place gets a reputation of extortionate prices, people will just stop coming.</p></speech>

As the committee is aware, there are significant cost inflation pressures for businesses, including tourism, at present but nonetheless, as the Deputy has said, Ireland has well-known attractions, many of which are in the Deputy&rsquo;s own constituency.  I think of the beautiful Carlingford which I go to myself and other places which again and again bring visitors back.  It is very important that businesses consider both their pricing levels and the added value and extras that they offer to help keep that reputation and that overall good-value proposition and competitiveness.  It is important that we attract back customers time and again and that their experience is one where they want to return.</p> <p>  On the hotel pricing issue, the 2022 rebound in the Irish tourism sector is very strong and stronger than expectations.  It could actually reach two thirds of the 2019 levels.  This has been helped by that stronger than anticipated recovery in air connectivity, as the 2022 peak summer access will be back to 90% of 2019 levels.  </p> <p>  April occupancy levels in Dublin hotels reached over 83% and the expectation is that the equivalent figure for May will be 90% or more.  Dublin is currently seeing at least 10% higher occupancy than cities such as London, Rome or Amsterdam.  No one thought that would happen so soon.  There is strong customer demand on the ground with a great deal of deferred travel, which is the key part here.  There is also the wedding activity, which is putting a real squeeze on available accommodation.  Other key domestic factors are also back in play now as we, thankfully, see the resumption of large concerts and matches.</p> <p>  We are seeing increasing numbers of those anecdotal reports of excessively high prices in the hotel sector and the Deputy has given examples there in this regard.  Whether these reports are reflective of the general market or of the prices that are being sought online for remaining rooms is somewhat moot because, as the Deputy has noted, such reports can have a really negative impact on our reputation as a visitor destination.</p> <p>  As I have said, I am very aware that businesses, including tourism businesses, are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors and the hotel-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are cost rises and inflation but while other businesses across Europe are also facing these pressures, the rip-off is here.</p></speech>

These challenges are not unique to Ireland.  They are shared by many countries around the world.  It is very important that Ireland retains its reputation as a value-for-money destination.  That reputation cannot be threatened.  Value is not just about the price you pay; it is about what you get for the price too.</p></speech>

We cannot compare them with prices across Europe.  Would she send the message out that should this type of thing continue, it will cause long-term reputational damage to this country and that she will reconsider the wisdom of extending the VAT reduction if the benefit is not being passed to the consumer?  The problem is not demand; the problem here is pure and utter greed.</p></speech>

There is ongoing engagement with the officials.  The hospitality and tourism forum that the T&aacute;naiste and I co-chair will be meeting again.  That is a good forum to address the issues.  There has been engagement already, but my officials will be meeting with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation tomorrow to consider how value for money can be maintained and how to restrain excessive pricing and ensure that visitors continue to feel that this is a place they want to return in the context of obtaining value for money.</p> <p>  The reduced VAT rate applies to a wide range of businesses that need to be considered in addition to the hospitality sector, which are trying to rebuild.  They have had a stressful two years.  They include catering, restaurant supply companies, cinemas, caterers and museums.  The Deputy knows the type of businesses that are on the list.  Nonetheless, no potential options should be off the table, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to the protection of the value-for-money perception relating to Irish tourism.  That is a critical priority in the years ahead.  I think that addresses Deputy Munster's question.</p></speech>

It should be acknowledged that they have continued to secure record investment in tourism, sport and arts, which says something about the priorities.  In particular, I thank the Minister and her officials for 20 hours of Committee Stage debate on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p><p>I will start with a very specific question to the Minister of State on the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.  Does he now believe it is appropriate that there should be an independent investigation into the association?  We have seen another high-performance director leave, an election take place in which votes were not counted and members being expelled in a move that was subsequently found to be <i>ultra vires</i>.  There is clearly something wrong.  The Minister of State has indicated that he will consider withholding funding, but the concern, as expressed by Kellie Harrington yesterday, is that this may impact directly on the boxers.  Nobody wants to see that happen, but there is clearly something rotten at the heart of the IABA.  It is my view that there should be a complete independent investigation.  I would be grateful to know the opinion of the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1833" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022060100002#D00600"><p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  As he is aware, there has been an independent review of IABA with very strong recommendations.  If he reads the review and recommendations fully, it sets out many difficulties, the dysfunction, the governance concerns and the issues that arise in terms of the connection with the grassroots and between the core organisation and the board.  That is why we have been very clear that we want IABA as an organisation to fully adopt at its extraordinary general meeting in June all of the recommendations that have been proposed.</p> <p>  To be clear, there has been an independent review, which has produced very clear and frank recommendations, which underpin best practice around governance and other aspects of how to run a sporting organisation.  We want to see them fully implemented and for the board to embrace all of the recommendations.  We want an implementation plan that is decided within a minimum of three months and then monthly meetings overseen by Sport Ireland around the implementation.  If that does not happen, there will be very severe financial consequences.  We will look at protecting athletes like Kellie Harrington and others.  We have seen great success in the European championships and in the world championships in the past week or two.  We want to ensure our high-performance athletes and grassroots are protected, but there will be immediate challenges for IABA as an organisation if it does not implement the recommendations.  We are not standing over ongoing cyclical dysfunction, zero women on the board and multiple other challenges.  We have had the resignation of Bernard Dunne recently and previously that of Billy Walsh.  It is important that there is full implementation of the recommendations.</p></speech>

Just like the Minister of State, I am concerned by the level of dysfunction, and I do not have confidence in the current board.  It is important that the grassroots and athletes are protected.</p> <p>  I will ask the Minister a couple of questions.  One of the issues she mentioned is that we would be seeing the imminent publication of the commission on the future of media's report.  We have been anticipating that for a while.  The Minister might indicate when that might happen.  She also stated that the recruitment process for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will begin shortly.  Is there an indication as to when we might see that happen and when the members and, in particular, the online safety commissioner will be in place?</p> <p>  I echo the concerns around tourism and the VAT rate.  There is one area where I think we have been successful in tourism.  Tourism Ireland has been active in promoting regional development, especially through the regional co-operative marketing fund.  Specifically speaking to what is happening at Rosslare Europort in the context of attracting international visitors, through the investment we are now seeing, Irish Ferries, Brittany Ferries and Stena are all promoting Rosslare and Ireland.  Will there be an extension of that marketing fund?</p> <p>  In terms of addressing some of the accommodation issues, I know there has been discussion around legislation with regard to the registration of short-term accommodation and letting.  It is crucial that we get this right because short-term letting does fill an important role in the holiday market as well.  I realise what we are trying to achieve on the housing side, but are there specific proposals with regard to legislation in this area and when might we see them?</p></speech>

It deals with matters that go beyond the remit of my Department, which is the reason a number of Ministers have been involved in key discussions.  That process will come to a conclusion shortly.</p> <p>  The programme of work regarding coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise needed to lead an coimisi&uacute;n and to carry out the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions.  That includes managing the transition of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, staff and functions to an coimisi&uacute;n while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulations.  I touched on the matter a little bit last night in the Seanad.  The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage an coimisi&uacute;n is a priority.  Work is under way with my officials and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of those staff.  I may have indicated this last night in the Seanad.  That includes the executive chairperson and an online safety commissioner.  The recruitment will be done through open, transparent and effective public competitions.</p></speech>

He said it has gone quiet.  He said the GAA is there to help and that is the extent of it.  Is the fact that Croke Park is not a fully seated stadium and would require Hill 16 to be turned into a seated area an issue of concern with regard to its part in the bid?</p></speech>

We had a meeting with the large-scale team last week.  There have been some initial drawdowns and we can send on a detailed project-by-project note on this.  Early projections for this year are that the full allocation will be drawn down and a number of the projects have progressed.  Some have not been able to balance finance, as the Senator is aware, and this is a challenge for them.

We are looking at future calls.  Dalymount Park will play a key role.  The reason we are funding it in the design stream is because projects such as this are able to continue to a further stream.

She has brought forward a charter to deal with abuse of officials in sport.  We had a very good discussion and departmental officials were also present.  Something she asked for was that terms of admission would be linked with State funding from the capital sports grant, whereby all of the 1,900 clubs that were awarded &euro;150 million by the Department in February and are in receipt of State funding would have a sign affixed to their grounds stating the terms of admission, including that abuse of referees would not be tolerated and that such abuse would lead to rejection.

I thank her and the officials for their work on the online media Bill.  I know the Government Whip is delighted we finished it last night.  On a separate issue, I acknowledge that the Minister has said the report of the Future of Media Commission is being discussed by her, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  How will it progress when the Cabinet publishes it?  Several weeks ago in the Chamber, when responding to a question, the Taoiseach stated it is important the Cabinet comes forward with proposals following the document.  Having contributed significantly to the report, the committee has envisaged that we will be able to discuss it.  What will happen now is that the Cabinet will come forward with its own proposals.  Will the report be brought to the committee for discussion?  Will there be a <i>fait accompli</i>when the Cabinet produces its proposals?</p></speech>

I concur with the comments of Senator Cassells on the Future of Media Commission.  It is important that our committee gets an opportunity to discuss any recommendations.  Deputy Cannon and I were involved in putting in a submission on behalf of Fine Gael in respect of ensuring a fund is in place to support all forms of local media, whether those are involved with radio or with the written word.</p> <p>  I compliment the Minister and her officials on the time they have spent on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  We have still only passed Committee Stage in the Seanad.  There is a long way to go yet with Report Stage.  I thank the Minister for the time she has given to it.  It has been a significant amount of time.  I think it is the most time spent on any Bill during my term in this Oireachtas.  It was important for everyone to have an opportunity to discuss all the amendments.  I also thank the Minister&rsquo;s officials for all their work on this Bill.  Regarding the report commissioned following the recommendations from our committee concerning the individual complaints mechanism, when does the Minister expect to have that report and a recommendation?</p></speech>

I will have to give it close consideration.  The Senator's question is timely.  As the Senator can imagine, it is a substantial report because it is a detailed body of work.  I am now going to examine the recommendations in detail.  In that context, I will be consulting my Cabinet colleagues and the Office of the Attorney General in considering whether and what amendments are required to the Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, as I said.  Therefore, the report is with me as of today.</p></speech>

My colleagues mentioned the extension of the VAT rate and the high prices being paid in that context, particularly in the hotel end of things.  This has not occurred in the restaurant sector.  Several other countries in the EU have a split VAT rate.  If this price gouging continues, perhaps we may seriously need to consider looking at the VAT rate, and perhaps splitting it and allowing the restaurant industry to continue with a reduced VAT rate.  I say that because the same type of gouging is not happening in the restaurant industry.  It only seems to be happening in the hotel industry.</p> <p>  Turning to sport, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for finding that extra money for the sports capital grants programme.  It has been welcomed by all the clubs throughout the country, including mine.  What is the possibility of the large-scale infrastructure fund, which was mentioned before, opening for applications?  It was referred to in the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening statement.  We must examine where there are infrastructure deficiencies concerning various sports.  I refer to identifying in the context of funding.  I am going to be parochial and say that several counties in the midlands, including mine, do not have proper athletics tracks.  A city the size of Galway, which has roughly 250,000 people, has only one hockey pitch.  When this large-scale funding scheme opens, the funding must be targeted to where there are deficiencies.  It should not be a case of putting large amounts of money into one or two or three projects.  This is an aspect we must explore.  Therefore, what is the likelihood of this type of funding scheme opening?</p></speech>

I refer to certain projects that missed out.  There is also the aspect of broader demand.  We will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the possibility of an additional budget line in this context.  Some &euro;100 million was made available.  Equally, the previous Government, and the then Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, allocated &euro;86 million at that time.  We are, however, cognisant that there is a necessity in the context of existing projects and the level of ambition across the country.</p> <p>  I also share the Senator&rsquo;s point about ensuring we intervene where facilities are needed.  We must move beyond single-sport facilities.  We must embed a municipal concept in sport and particularly where we invest on a bigger scale.  This will require sporting organisations to look beyond their own specific interests and to work together for the broader community.  That type of approach works much better across Europe and also gives better delivery for the State.  There is also the matter of how we can better integrate our education system with sporting and community facilities.  Any future iteration of the large-scale funding programme will mandate sporting organisations to come together to undertake larger projects in regions or communities.  This is what investment of this type should be targeted at, rather than for single and specific projects, as we have seen happen over many years.  This municipal concept must be at the core of any future budget line in this regard.</p></speech>

Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the IABA and I also have my concerns in this regard.  To be quite honest, there must be wholesale change at the top of that organisation.  An independent review was commissioned at short notice because this committee was seeking to look at the governance of the IABA.  The review was undertaken by the same person who carried out the previous review and yet the recommendations do not refer to the senior management in the organisation.  This is where the problem seems to be, and I say this having spoken to representatives of the clubs and to volunteers on the ground.  I do not have faith in the organisation.  I will be honest about this.  The situation must be re-examined.  Having talked to the people on the ground and in the clubs, they are not happy with the recommendations that have come from the report I referred to.  Therefore, this issue must be looked at again.  A significant number of people, some 30 volunteers, were suspended.  Those were people who had devoted thousands of hours to this sport throughout their lives.  Those suspensions were appealed and those appeals were upheld, but the people concerned have had to fund the cost of those appeals that vindicated them.  I do not think this is acceptable in any sport.</p></speech>

There is also the absence of women on the board, which is a problem, and we must deal with it.  The review also highlighted issues such as the independence of the board, the disconnect between the board and the grassroots, issues around oversight and control, the lack of diversity more generally and a range of other issues.  If the IABA fully embraces all the recommendations, it will go from being an organisation that is clearly dysfunctional when it comes to governance to one that can demonstrate best practice in future.</p> <p>  What we should not have, and what we cannot have, is people in the IABA, at whatever level, undermining clear recommendations.  People with obligations in that sport need to front up and to fully implement the recommendations.  What I will not stand for is anyone in the IABA undermining clear recommendations.  I want full follow-through on them.  I am not going to entertain a campaign that seeks to undermine recommendations.  The recommendations here could apply to many other sports and some of those sports have implemented similar recommendations already.  What is it that the IABA does not like about having women, independence and diversity on its board?  What does the organisation not like about changing the culture and behaviour of its board or about building a better connection between its board and the grassroots?  Therefore, if people within boxing think we are going to allow a kind of a campaign to undermine the current recommendations, we will not entertain any such campaign.  In the context of IABA, we will protect athletes and the grassroots, but we will have reform.  I am clear that the recommendations, when broken down and analysed, identify clear problems that we need to resolve.  This is my bottom line on this issue.</p></speech>

There are concerns in the community about what some call a de facto exclusion of artists with disabilities insofar as the scheme may put someone at risk of having their other supports cut.  Can the Minister make some assurances on that?  If not, can the scheme be made exempt to disability allowance, the blind pension, the medical card and so on in order that people will not risk their supports being cut?</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the night-time economy task force.  It is good to see that a robust implementation structure has been agreed.  Importantly, the flexibility is there to react to new ideas.  That is positive.  I commend the Minister on that.  I have been struck by the struggles people are facing, as well as the streams of people who we see walking out of town late at night trying to flag down taxis.  We have lost over 2,000 taxis from the industry since 2019.  My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, had a briefing in the audiovisual room at Leinster House yesterday, which called for the ten-year rule to be looked at.  In speaking to the Minister as an environmentalist, I note that when walking out the main arteries of town, you see streams of people who are unable to flag taxis and often, there is only one person in those cabs.  This is not a good use of resources.  The report of the night-time economy task forces called for an increase and extension of eight new routes to be in operation for 24 hours in Dublin.  There are currently three such Dublin Bus routes.  We need to see policy change if we want people to change their habits and to view the bus as an option late at night.  This is obviously the area of the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  It is a key recommendation in the night-time economy task force.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment on the unavailability of taxis late at night.  People will not go into the city centre if there is no way to get home.  </p> <p>  I will add my voice to another issue because if we do not say it, it will not happen.  The report of the Future of Media Commission must be published.  We are getting fobbed off time and again by the Government and it has to be published.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill must now go through the D&aacute;il without Deputies having access to that report, as has been the case for Senators as well.</p> <p>  My final request to the Minister is to consider in her budget allocations a ring-fenced allocation to RT&Eacute; for the development of the RT&Eacute; Player.  </p></speech>

It is our intention to publish that shortly.  We are having final meetings about it with the Ministers.</p> <p>  As for the basic income for artists scheme, it is the case that I have no statutory function in social welfare means tests.  That is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  The participation of artists with disabilities is a matter that I take very seriously.  I have sought to ensure that all artists, including those who have a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot.  Helplines were established for them so that they could see if they would be impacted.  We are encouraging everyone to apply.  A key research question that will arise from this entire basic income scheme process will be around the impact that such a payment could have on artists with disabilities.  To that end, I was determined since the outset of the basic income for artists scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate.  We therefore worked closely with the Department of Social Protection to enable their earnings to be treated as earnings from self-employment and to be taken into account in respect of the earnings disregards that apply to many social welfare payments.  That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income that a person in receipt of social welfare payments earns from employment.  Not all disabled artists are on social welfare supports, but for those who are dependent on income supports, the issue to which we have referred relates primarily to the manner in which social welfare schemes assess income from other sources.</p> <p>  Again, eligibility for social welfare is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, this is all shining a necessary light on this.  This will be a key piece that will arise from this research pilot scheme.  We have done everything possible to encourage them, as far as we could within the constraints of not being the Minister for Social Protection, in terms of trying to get the basic income for the arts over the line.  Of the approximately 9,000 applications that we received, 6.9% of those are from people with a disability.  They will therefore be represented on the scheme.  They definitely will have a chance to feed into and to be part of the research.  I am sure that like other artists, some will be on the control group as well.  I have done what I can within the constraints of the scheme and given the fact that I am not the Minister for Social Protection but Minister with responsibility for arts. </p> <p>  In relation to the night-time economy, I acknowledge what the Senator is saying about taxis and how it is not sustainable to have one person in a taxi.  On the issue of the eight proposed bus routes, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very supportive of any developments there and in the night-time economy sector.  His Department, as well as the various transport agencies, are on the implementation group.  I agree fully with the Senator.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is determined to get that done too, from a sustainability point of view.  </p> <p>  RT&Eacute; is not funded by the Exchequer, but by licence fee receipts.  Therefore, that is a matter for RT&Eacute; to decide on.  A portion of the funds from the recent sale of land by RT&Eacute; have been ring-fenced for digital.  I think that may include the RT&Eacute; Player.  It will also go towards the paying down of debt.  I think I have addressed all of the Senator&rsquo;s questions.  </p></speech>

It is an access issue, as well.  If you are watching Netflix on a poor broadband connection, the Netflix app will adapt to that.  This is an access issue for people across the country, who do not have access to good broadband.  You need a pretty good broadband connection to run the RT&Eacute; Player at times.

I will quickly go through my questions.  Sports clubs are being crippled by ever-increasing insurance costs or by unsuitable insurance that will not cover small but still significant injuries.  For example, a number of insurance companies will only cover accidents such as the loss of an eye or a limb, or those that result in a person being in a wheelchair.  Another example of this is in the circus and street arts sector.  They cannot secure affordable or suitable insurance at all.  Is the Department doing anything on this issue to help to lower insurance costs for local clubs and organisations?</p></speech>

We have a recommendation in the sport action plan.  I am trying to find it here so I can give it to him.  It is very much focused on insurance and it is working with the Federation of Irish Sport.  I know that Mary O&rsquo;Connor was before the committee.  It is also working with Sport Ireland.  We engage with the sports sector and then present that information.  There is an insurance working group within the Government that is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, that has specific responsibility for insurance reform.  In the sport action plan we have tried to reflect some of the local concerns the Deputy has outlined and to ensure that they are central ideas or issues that need to be addressed in a sporting context.</p><p>There is an action plan on insurance reform as well.  We can submit the specific action.  The sport action plan is a long document but it references the issues around insurance relating to sport and we can send that on to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We know that disproportionate prices are being charged but is there any oversight, research or monitoring by F&aacute;ilte Ireland or the Department, to consider the reduction in VAT?  Is there any evidence that any part of this reduction was passed on to the consumer or holidaymaker?</p></speech>

There is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow between our officials, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC.  Although the VAT reduction applies to a wide range of businesses, no potential options should be off the table when it comes to protecting our reputation as a value for money tourism destination.  That is a critical priority for the years ahead.</p> <p>  The demand right now is slightly related to a deferral of many travel plans.  It cannot be taken for granted that as we go into the shoulder season and into next year everything will be as it was this year.  A lot of people postponed holidays who did not see their families and all of that is coming to a head as we approach summer 2022.  We need to be cautious and my officials will be communicating that in the meeting tomorrow.</p></speech>

Instead it is a payment in recognition of the time spent in creative practice.  We are trialling the basic income pilot and one of the key characteristics of it is that it is not means tested.  It will be randomised but it will be proofed to make sure there is proper geographical representation and diversity of arts, population, gender and all of that.</p></speech>

Besides the legal consequences for the individuals involved, does the Department intend to introduce any specific consequences or are there any specific consequences for this despicable act?  Is there anything contained in the Department's remit to tackle this type of awful action?</p></speech>

Match fixing and corruption are a threat to all sports at all levels and they undermine public confidence in the fairness of sport.  We are a sport loving nation and we have an inherent understanding of the need for fairness, honesty and good sportsmanship at all levels in our sporting codes.  Not only that but as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na points out, match fixing can allow organised crime to infiltrate sport in order to use it to make illicit gains or launder the proceeds of crime.  On the specific question the Deputy asked, there is a live investigation which began in 2019.  In this case the FAI and UEFA reported their suspicions to the Garda around some League of Ireland matches and I commend the FAI on its zero tolerance approach to such behaviour.  It is vital that all sports remain vigilant of any suspicious activity which could bring their sports into disrepute.  There is an ongoing investigation so I cannot comment beyond that.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I want to ask the Minster about the ongoing shambles in Dublin Airport.  I know it is not directly under her remit but what is under her remit is the reputational damage to Irish tourism that arises from this.  Is there a strategy to try to deal with that reputational damage?  We know the debacle has been broadcast by international news agencies.  Is there a way to try to restore confidence to people who are considering holidaying in Ireland that they will not be spending half of their holiday in the airport trying to get out of here again?  What has been going on there is awful.  Is there a plan to try to fix some of the damage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1900" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022060100002#H00900"><p>As the Deputy knows, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening.  I welcome the fact that as we speak the chief executive is up before the Committee on Transport and Communications and a lot of those issues might be teased out there.  Dublin Airport is a regulated entity and the Commission for Aviation Regulation is an independent regulator for charges at the airport.  It also sets out a comprehensive range of quality standard targets, including on security times, to ensure a high quality service for passengers at the airport.  The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling so far short of the service that our citizens, tourists or visitors should expect at our largest State airport.  The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, ministerial level meetings have been held since the security delay issues first emerged at the end of March and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, met the authority earlier this week.  They have requested that the DAA report back within 24 hours on solutions that can be put in place as we approach a bank holiday weekend, which is a pinch factor.  Up until last weekend queue times had improved on those experienced by passengers at the end of March, with over 90% of passengers getting through security in less than 45 minutes but what we saw last weekend is not acceptable.  As the Deputy said, it has a real risk of doing severe reputational damage to our tourism.  I have written to the chief executive of the DAA to express my concern and I hope that the recent engagement with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will see immediate solutions put in place because we need that to happen.  I am waiting to welcome with open arms the assurances of the smooth operation of Dublin Airport because that is key, as the Deputy has said.  What people are seeing on social media and in our newspapers risks doing huge reputational damage to us.</p></speech>

The other thing I wanted to ask about is regional tourism and the Minister might look at this again.  We have the Dublin to Kerry route and the Dublin to Donegal route but if one flies into Dublin and wants to hop on the Dublin to Kerry or the Dublin to Donegal flight one has to go back out through security and start into the chaotic process again.  Similarly, if one is flying from Kerry to Dublin and is going to take an ongoing flight one has to go out again and come back in, which is bonkers and makes no sense whatsoever.  I was on to Kerry Airport about this on Monday to see if it could do something bilaterally with the DAA and I was also on to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, about it.  The experience for tourists trying to get to Kerry or Donegal or trying to go home could surely be helped by squaring that circle and it should not be impossible to fix that one.  It is a matter that the Minister could perhaps look at with her tourism hat to see if she can encourage the DAA to do the right thing there.</p></speech>

That would be more the remit of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, but I will bring that to their attention and suggest that they engage with the DAA on that specific issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1903" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022060100002#H01200"><p>These passengers have already gone through security in Kerry Airport and I can assure the Minister that a flea would not get past the security there.  They are good and thorough and have been well-funded with some good equipment.</p> <p>  Car rental is another massive challenge facing Irish tourism and I raised it in the D&aacute;il last week.  It is a factor that is particularly detrimental to rural tourism more than it would be to short city breaks.  Awful prices are being charged.  I went on a few of the car hire websites last week and we are talking Monopoly money, which is not acceptable.  I accept the principle of supply and demand but just because a price can be charged does not mean it should be charged.  That is an area that needs to be addressed.  We are spending a fortune marketing the Wild Atlantic Way abroad, for example, yet when people come here they cannot afford to rent vehicles.</p><p>One thing I tried to progress when I was in the Department, and I came up against brick walls, was the concept of a hop-on, hop-off Wild Atlantic Way bus service.  It is a linear route, so it would not be very difficult logistically.  It would be a very doable project from a sustainability perspective, a tourist experience point of view as well as from the perspective of local engagement and local benefit.  It would be something that would greatly benefit both the communities and the visitors.  Certainly, in the context of the situation where people cannot rent cars at present, it would be a very sought-after service.  I cannot see how it cannot be done.  It is very possible to do it with a few daily services running each way.  Is this something on which the Minister could throw her shoulder to the wheel, if she will pardon the pun, and try to get the bus moving?  It would be a massive addition to the Wild Atlantic Way.  That is one matter I ask the Minister to bear in mind.</p><p> I have questions on two other matters.  The Carlingford cove initiative is in the programme for Government.  When I was in the Department I believed it was an important one to progress.  There is a vast offering along the eastern seaboard, perhaps more so from a walking and cycling point of view than as a driving route.  There are all the peninsulas on the west coast, but that is not the case on the east coast so it probably lends itself better to walking and cycling.  Is there any progress on that in respect of F&aacute;ilte Ireland?</p><p> Another initiative was the concept of the invitation follow-up to The Gathering.  Is there any progress on that?  It is something that would be, perhaps, useful and timely considering the rebuilding process we are in after Covid-19.</p></speech>

I would like to see the possibility of local transport and tourism transport working together not only for what the Deputy is suggesting but also, for example, because there is major potential at the Cliffs of Moher, too, that would serve the locality as well as providing for tourists.</p></speech>

We are in the final process of extensive engagement on that.  I will not announce what the decision is, but that has been ongoing between the officials and the tourism agencies.

With regard to the situation with the Liverpool fans at Saturday night's match in Paris, how many Irish Liverpool fans were in Paris for the UEFA Champions League final as well?  The fans, some of them children, were treated disgracefully by the French authorities and the commentary afterwards rubbed salt in the wounds.  Obviously, UEFA has a stake in all of this as well.  Clearly, the venue appeared to be quite unsuitable and the organising, or lack thereof, appeared to fall well short of what one would expect for a major European final.  Would the Minister of State consider conveying to UEFA his concern that there is nothing to stop this from happening, for example, to travelling Irish fans for an Irish international game in the future, if that is the poor level of organisation at UEFA events?  Would he consider expressing his concern?  As I said, many Irish lads were caught up in the hassle, through no fault of theirs, on Saturday night.  They appear to have been treated disgracefully.  It is not acceptable and we should express our concern about it.  Cities like Paris that have been awarded big tournaments such as this should not get them again if they have mishandled them and dealt with them badly, as Paris clearly did on Saturday night.</p></speech>

We have seen that broadly reflected.  It was terrible that fans were being blamed.  I am absolutely concerned.  Certainly in the Irish context, we have good event planning.  From a security perspective, the authorities there did not plan this well, and blaming everyone else is not the solution to that.  Other authorities have reflected their concern and I share that.  From an Irish perspective, I am confident that if we ever host a match, and I believe we have the UEFA Europa League final in 2024, we will make sure that everything is in place to provide an excellent fan experience so there would be none of these scenes in a Dublin context.</p></speech>

Deputy Chambers referred to the aspiration to have 60% participation in sports.  One big obstacle to that happening is the Safeguarding 1 course, the child protection course.  Every volunteer has to do it.  It is a requirement if one wishes to work with children under 18 years of age or vulnerable adults.  I have done some research.  When I looked it up last night I found there are no courses available anywhere in the country.  It seems to be a complete mess.  Different sports partnerships put it on different platforms if one wishes to access it.  It is very difficult to find out and there is no uniformity with the application process.</p> <p>  The FAI, the GAA and the IRFU run their own courses, which is good for them, but smaller sports organisations such as Hockey Ireland, cricket, basketball and other sports have to get their volunteers to do the course, but there is no centralised platform.  Smaller sports are not in a position to run it.  This means clubs are going to lose volunteers and participants.  I ask the Minister of State to intervene in this to ensure there is a centralised platform that it is easily accessible and understandable and that there is a good healthy supply of courses, so there is no queue for the course.  Will he undertake to have a centralised mechanism that would allow volunteers to do it?</p></speech>

As he stated, safeguarding is a fundamental pillar and a basic minimum when it comes to anyone's participation in sport and we must ensure volunteers have received that training and also that we have the statutory protection in place in terms of Garda vetting.  I will reflect that to Sport Ireland and also the Deputy's proposal for a centralised platform.  We are providing unprecedented funding to Sport Ireland and to the local sports partnerships to roll out courses fully.  There might be an issue of pent-up demand post Covid-19, but I take the Deputy's point and I will refer it back.  We are anxious to ensure that we fully embrace all the volunteers who want to be involved in sport.</p></speech>

I have made Sport Ireland aware of the issue.  There is a real concern that volunteers will be lost.</p> <p>  I also have a question about clubs that received the sports capital grant.  Different clubs received different grants over the last few years, but due to Covid-19 they were unable to progress projects.  Now, with inflation many clubs are finding they either cannot finish a project or cannot start a project.</p><p>Will the Department look at giving top-ups to successful sports capital grant applicants in circumstances where they have suffered as a result of inflation?</p></speech>

In fact, the funding ask against what was allocated is as close to what the ask was historically as well.</p></speech>

It is getting a significant amount of contact about clubs that want to draw down capital and get it mobilised and utilised.</p> <p>  In terms of historic grant allocation, there were smaller percentages in previous rounds.  We have a huge level of ambition across the sporting system for a new round for new applicants who have new ambition to go beyond and might be able to put in a pitch to improve their existing facilities.  We have to look at that as well in that context.  If the Deputy looks at the most recent round, he will see that it actually mitigates some of the issues that he referenced because it is very close to their actual asks.  It is not 20% of what they sought, rather, many of them got up to 100% of what they asked for.  Therefore, the funding gap will be less than perhaps it was in historic rounds.</p></speech>

There is an issue, however.  Clubs have contacted me.  There is an issue regarding inflation in that they cannot finish their projects.  I would ask that he take on that.  As he said, the capital grants people in the Department are looking at that.  However, many projects will be under strain because of the inflation.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned in his report that he intends to give clarity to sporting organisations on the implications of non-compliance with gender balance.  Does that include penalties?  Does it include extra support for those that are compliant?  Is that something the Department is considering?</p></speech>

However, there will be financial consequences and we will publish a range of consequences that will be financial and not tokenistic.  They will be very clear, transparent and have a significant impact on their core funding.  We will publish that later in the year.  For organisations that comply, we are in a process of expanding our funding.  Obviously, sporting organisations that comply will see increased supports as we continue to increase our level of support for the sport system.</p></speech>

However, we need best practice around governance, around having independence and having diversity on boards.  If there happens to be an elected representative who comes through that, that is one aspect.  There are certain boards that I have a concern about, and I spoke about one of them earlier.  However, it would be unfair to cast aspersions.  There could be-----</p></speech>

To deprive him of his input would not be fair to him, as an elected representative.  There may be people like him in other sports who want to play a role.  We need to have good structures around governance that underpin best practice, that have independence, good sub-committees and that are based on a broad range of recommendations.  It is important not to kind of categorise or exclude elected representatives from participating within the amateur side of sport.  It would not be fair.  It is about the underpinning structure of a board within sport and what the level of best practice is.  It is about looking at the structures that are in place.  There will be some democratic input into sporting organisations in terms of people coming through a sport who may happen to be elected representatives simultaneously.  Would the Deputy remove any elected representative from any board anywhere?</p></speech>

First, I sincerely congratulate the Minister on getting the basic income for the pilot relating to artists.  This scheme is truly groundbreaking and will set our country apart in terms of how we value art and those who create it.  I echo the concerns, which the Minister addressed comprehensively, about how the basic income for the arts, BIA, payment might impact on people with disabilities who are in the arts sector.  I know there is an ongoing engagement happening between the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  I ask that would continue during the pilot .  At the conclusion of the pilot, we will have a scheme that works very well for everybody who wants to participate in the creation of art in Ireland.</p> <p>  Second, I thank the Minister for her extraordinary work during the pandemic in putting the live performance support scheme in place and for the significant collaboration that happened with local authorities and with practitioners in the industry.  Those same practitioners are finding their way back to work, albeit very slowly in some cases.  They are asking for us, as legislators, to consider looking at the reduction of the VAT that applies to many people in that industry.  I know there is an ongoing engagement with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, with a view towards having that looked at under our national tax strategy.  I would ask the Minister if she could perhaps make her feelings known as well.  Again, we are getting very conflicting information from various quarters as to whether this is possible or not from an EU VAT legislation perspective.  However, if it is, I ask the same sort of supports that have been extended to those in the hospitality industry also be extended to those in the arts industry, especially our musicians, entertainers and technicians.</p> <p>  On tourism, there is one point I want to make.  I make this point whenever I have the opportunity.  I refer to the much maligned Airbnb.  We need to look at how this platform and those similar to it can impact on the supply of housing in locations that have a very significant challenge around supply.  I live in a small, rural community in east Galway.  I live in what F&aacute;ilte Ireland beautifully coined as the Hidden Heartlands, which I think is wonderful.  For us in that small community, Airbnb has been truly a game changer in terms of how we market ourselves to the world, for families who are willing to welcome travellers from all over the world into our small, rural, east Galway community and how we market the very interesting activities that one can partake of in those communities.  That is replicated across the whole of the Hidden Heartlands in that there is a challenge around hotel rooms in many parts of it.  Airbnb and other platforms like it have given those less-visited locations an opportunity to market themselves to the world.  On foot of that, we need to be careful in how we move forward in regulating Airbnb and other industries or platforms like it.  We do not throw the baby out with the bathwater and deny an opportunity for particularly rural and remote locations to have people visiting them.</p> <p>  I live beside a very successful forest walk that was developed by our local community in conjunction with Coillte.  With the advent of Airbnb, certainly before the pandemic, I, for the first time, met people visiting there from Germany, Scotland, Italy and France.</p><p>They were all staying in local Airbnbs, an opportunity they did not have prior to the advent of that platform.  That is something of which we need to be mindful.</p><p> I thank the Minister for the additional funding for the extraordinary work of TG4.  I acknowledge the quality of the content emanating from that station and the work it does to connect with Irish communities worldwide.  The TG4 player is used extensively abroad by people who are trying to learn the language and also by people who are anxious to have a deeper understanding of Irish culture, the Irish people and our beautiful island.  TG4 is doing valuable work in throwing open a window to the world on what it means to be Irish and to live on this beautiful island.  I thank the Minister for her support for it.</p><p> Turning to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, I congratulate him on his work on seeking to ensure increased and more diverse participation in sport.  That was very much reflected in the sport capital grants awarded earlier in the year and by those clubs and entities that are ambitious in increasing particularly women&rsquo;s participation in sport being very well funded and supported.  The Minister of State may not have specific information on the development of our velodrome project.  We are anxious to see it get under way.  New Zealand, which is similar in size to Ireland, has two national indoor velodromes which is beginning to produce very positive results in terms of New Zealand's participation in the sport of cycling from the grassroots up and success at international cycling competitions with wins and medals awarded.  It is beginning to have an impact.  Something similar could happen in Ireland as soon as we get our national velodrome under way.</p></speech>

I share his enthusiasm for the widest possible participation in it.  I also agree with his comments on TG4.  I was very happy to increase its funding significantly in the past two years.</p> <p>  On the VAT on live performances, currently, artists and live entertainment event workers benefit from a favoured VAT regime but for shows or events where food and drink are not served, VAT is not charged.  A lower VAT rate is already applied to tickets for cinemas, theatres, some musical performances, museums and galleries' exhibitions.  I understand one of the issues raised by some representative industries is that musicians and performers charge 23% on the fees they charge.  There is push on the sector to reduce this amount.  I hear their point of view on this and I will make sure I raise it with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for consideration.</p> <p>  Regarding short-term lettings, peer-to-peer platforms like Airbnb are an important part of the tourism accommodation mix but we need a range and choice.  At the end of the day Housing for All identified short-term lettings as a housing constraint in urban areas especially.  Therefore, getting the balance right is key and there will also be stakeholder engagement along with the way.</p></speech>

I take his point on the velodrome project.  It has been spoken about for many years.  The velodrome and badminton centre project is a priority for us.  It is a key project referenced in the national development plan.  We have a draft master plan we are progressing.  There is funding this year to advance its planning and design and it is something we want to progress properly.  That is why it is signalled and specified in the national development plan.  I accept that within the broader cycling community it has been spoken about for many years but we are anxious to progress it.  I have spoken to Sport Ireland in recent weeks about the need to advance this project.  We are all on the one page in trying to do that.  It is a major project.  We will not only have a velodrome in the centre but it will have major potential for multi-use in sport and in what it can do for other indoor sports.  It will have major potential on the sports campus.</p></speech>

It has been convened with the Minister, Deputy Martin, to discuss a safe and respectful working environment in the arts.  On behalf of the committee, I thank her and her officials for engaging with the committee on this important topic and for the measures introduced by her Department in response to the Speak Up: A call for Change Report commissioned by the Irish theatre Institute as part of its Speak Up initiative.  This will be our third public engagement on the topic, having received significant evidence from a range of key representative groups and agencies to date.  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite the Minister to make her opening statement, which will be followed by questions form members of the committee.  As the Minister is probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members again of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in a public meeting.  I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Martin, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

T&aacute; timpeallacht tuillte ag gach oibr&iacute;, ina gcaitear leo le d&iacute;nit agus le meas agus nach nd&eacute;antar leithcheal orthu, is cuma faoin gcomhlacht ina n-oibr&iacute;onn siad n&oacute; lena bhfuil siad ar conradh. Creidim go n-aont&oacute;dh sibh go l&eacute;ir leis sin.  Every woman and every man has the right to be treated with dignity and respect.  All workers, regardless of the company they work for or who they are contracted to, deserve an environment where they are treated with dignity and respect and are not subjected to discrimination.  I believe all the members would agree with that.  Ensuring a safe and respectful working environment for everyone working in the arts and in the creative industries is one of the most important issues I have engaged with as Minister.  Every person has the right to dignity in the workplace.  Damaging behaviours such as bullying, harassment and victimisation will not be tolerated across this sector.</p> <p>  Over the past number of years, report after report points to unacceptable behaviours in the arts and creative sector right across the spectrum from inappropriate language and insults to sexual assault and violence.</p><p>The fact that similar behaviours have emerged in other sectors is cold comfort and I believe it is my responsibility, as Minister with responsibility for culture and the arts, to take action to ensure that such behaviours in the creative sectors are consigned to history.</p><p> In this important area of work, my Department has partnered with the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI.  I am providing funding to the ITI which to date has amounted to &euro;400,000.  The ITI has been working in this area since 2017 to undertake extensive research and analysis, assist in the drafting of that, which will respond directly to the key issues, and work with my Department to implement those policies in an effective way that will, I hope, make a real and lasting difference to anyone working in this sector.  Last year, the ITI undertook a landmark survey of the arts and culture sector, the results of which led to the launch of the Speak Up: A Call for Change report in November, with five important recommendations.  Each of the five recommendations has a range of actions, all of which have been progressed by my Department, in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with agencies, Screen Ireland and the Arts Council.  The recommendations include short-term actions, practical initiatives and the longer term challenge of changing mindsets, behaviours and culture.</p><p> Overall, in working through these recommendations and associated actions, I consider that there must be a fundamental change at a systemic level, which requires a change across society.  In helping to achieve this, a comprehensive awareness campaign is under way in combination with practical initiatives, such as bystander training, to effectively tackle sexual and gender-based negative behaviours on the ground.</p><p> For the past year and a half, I have funded Minding Creative Minds to provide a range of counselling and advisory services to the creative sector, free of charge.  Some &euro;530,000 has been allocated to date for this very valuable service and I will continue to fund this into the future.  The Minding Creative Minds service is a 24-7 confidential mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and is delivered by Spectrum Life.  Over the past six months, my officials have been working closely with Minding Creative Minds to expand its existing services and to incorporate some of the recommendations contained in the report, namely, offering specialised support for victims.  Minding Creative Minds is in the process of road-testing these additional services to ensure that practices are up to the necessary standard.  I expect this work will be completed shortly and that I will be in a position to make announcements soon.  It is very important, in such a sensitive area, that the services are adequately tested before they are rolled out to the public as each and every case may represent a traumatised individual.  Appropriate consideration for the victims of these damaging behaviours is vital.</p><p> Resourcing availability of information is another key focus of the work under way and the Irish Theatre Institute has been working on developing a new website which will incorporate elements of all five recommendations, and will have relevant resources and information available, including sectoral codes of behaviour, policy documents and other toolkits for artists and arts organisations.  It will also have an online register whereby organisations can formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to its implementation.  This should help to build awareness and transparency across the sector.</p><p> Screen Ireland is collaborating with the Arts Council to develop bystander intervention training, which should be ready to roll out next month.  Screen Ireland is also developing a suite of dedicated online training tools for arts organisations, artists and arts workers.  These include self-led training, free of charge, in bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias.  There will be additional bespoke elements for particular areas, for example, intimacy co-ordination for stage and screen.  It is intended that these will be self-led.  It is planned that the basic self-led modules, such as bullying and harassment, will ultimately become compulsory for workers in all organisations receiving grant funding from the Arts Council and Screen Ireland.  The Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also introducing a new condition of funding for all recipients of grant funding whereby they must confirm that they have taken all necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour on behalf of a board member or staff members.</p><p> In the meantime, I continue to engage with stakeholders and all interested groups, as do officials in my Department.  I have had many meetings that have been helpful to me and, in particular, I recall Fair Pl&eacute; telling me that I was the first Minister to engage with it.  Most recently, I had a very constructive meeting with members of Safe Arts of Ireland, some of whom gave evidence to this committee.  I assured them that I would continue work to implement Speak Up: A Call for Change and would keep them updated in the coming weeks and months.</p><p> I am pleased that the committee has taken a strong interest in this issue and am happy to take questions from members.  T&aacute; dul chun cinn maith d&eacute;anta again.  T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre ach t&aacute; b&oacute;thar fada le siubhal againn f&oacute;s.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh muid ag taisteal le ch&eacute;ile.  We have made good progress but we still have a long road to travel.  I hope we will do this together.</p></speech>

Having read the opening statement, we can see the Minister has comprehensively addressed the issues.  I welcome the level of interest she has shown in this issue, which has been of concern to the committee.  The fact that she met with Fair Pl&eacute; and the other groups is very positive.  We have had quite a number of witnesses before the committee who have expressed concern and, obviously, some of them have been particularly brave in coming forward to express their point of view.  It is essential, whatever the environment in the arts, in music and in the other areas under the Minister's remit, that everybody feels the environment is safe.  Although the education system is not entirely the Minister's brief, a lot of work is being done in that area.  Is there any more that can be done within that space?</p></speech>

For example, great work is being done in Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, where education and tuition are being provided in traditional Irish music and Comhaltas is the main body doing that.  I look forward to the return of the Fleadh in Mullingar.  Following the launch, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, which is directly funded by my Department, welcomed the Speak Up: A Call for Change initiative as a timely report and Comhaltas stated its mission as being all-embracing and inclusive of everyone, regardless of race, religion or ability.  Comhaltas has its Cothroma&iacute;ocht: Respect, Equality, Opportunity programme, which details statistically its status in regard to gender balance throughout the organisation.  It outlines the delivery of a range of training and mentoring supports, which are vital, as well as resources designed to advance a positive and lasting culture of respect and dignity throughout Comhaltas, which really is an education setting.  I welcome that.  Comhaltas updated me on that as recently as 13 May.  It reported that it had delivered a wide range of training, including modules on a positive working environment and on its gender mainstreaming strategy, as well as reviewing and upgrading its websites and social media platforms.</p></speech>

This is an initiative that Safe Arts of Ireland talked about and it referred to similar facilities being available in some of our third level institutions, as I know from my engagement with it, and UCD in particular must be noted in this regard.  Safe Arts of Ireland has asked for a new independent body to which complaints can be made by non-contracted workers, contracted workers and artists.  My Department has been working on this for some months now in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with Minding Creative Minds.</p><p>Progress is being made, and I am hopeful I will be in a position to make an announcement on that issue in the summer.</p><p> As for the matter of investigation of allegations of assault, sexual assault and rape, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the civil authority in the State for policing and investigation, and that should not change.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has reported that every Garda division in the country now has a divisional protective services unit with specially trained officers available when victims of domestic or sexual violence present to the Garda.  As for a place where people can go to register complaints anonymously, I have a sense that that is being taken seriously.  It is being progressed in my Department.</p></speech>

We are working on that.

They must have in place appropriate policies dealing with workplace bullying and harassment.  In line with the Arts Council equality, human rights and diversity policy, and in compliance with the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015, they must avoid any form of discriminatory practice and have regard for the need to promote equal opportunities in the area of work.  In the event of any board member or member of staff having behaved illegally, wrongfully or inappropriately or in breach of relevant policies and procedures in respect of any person, or in the event of the grant recipient becoming aware of any allegation or complaint that any board member or member of staff has behaved in such a manner, the grant recipient must take all necessary actions in respect of such board member or member of staff to ensure absolutely the safety and protection of such persons and members of the public.  The Arts Council will carry out the compliance checks.</p></speech>

As for the progress that has been made, I hope, by way of progress next month, to be able to launch a range of actions.  What I can tell the Deputy about the website is that it will incorporate a code of behaviour, which I think I referred to in an earlier contribution, that organisations in the sector will be asked to adopt voluntarily.  The code will include the following broad key principles: zero tolerance of the seven damaging behaviours, along with policies and procedures to maintain the code; published procedures for accepting complaints of damaging behaviour from individuals while protecting them from reprisal or retaliation; timely investigation and resolution of complaints of damaging behaviour; and awareness-raising of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace and roll-out of training using free training resources, ultimately to all workers in the organisation.  In due course it will be expected that all organisations that receive or hope to receive funding from the State will adopt the code of behaviours.  That is one element of the website that I can share with Deputy Munster.  The dedicated website will also incorporate a dignity-at-work toolkit containing comprehensive information on supports and resources for all arts workers.</p></speech>

As Minister, I assure the committee that it is my firm policy intention that organisations that are not found to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams.  Damaging behaviour is simply unacceptable.  While I fully expect organisations across the sector to embrace this agenda and to respond proactively to the matters raised in the survey, I wish to be crystal clear that where that is not the case, funding is at risk - full stop.</p></speech>

I have been engaging with the various organisations attached to my Department.  I have made it crystal clear that I am very committed to this.  As I said, I am making it crystal clear that funding is at risk unless this is adhered to.  The vast majority of funding of the arts sector, as Deputy Munster will know, is disbursed by the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions.  Both agencies have already been very clear in their approach to dignity at work and expectations that dignity at work policies are required for continued funding.  They have known from their very first engagements with me early on that I am absolutely committed to this.  The Irish Theatre Institute and my Department will continue to work with both agencies on this matter.</p></speech>

I commend the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council and the Department for helping to bring this report together and Jane Daly and Siobh&aacute;n Burke, who worked on the report.  When they were before the committee they said that just after this report was launched, another was launched by, I think, the Law Society.  As the Minister says, this is an issue across the entirety of our society and all its sectors, but that is cold comfort.  No one wants to talk down any industry, but when there are problems we need to acknowledge and to address them.</p><p>I have engaged with people over the years, like the women in FairPl&eacute; and the #misefosta women who came out online as well, who have led the way in getting this committee to address the issue and progress the conversation with the Department.  I want to commend all of those people and express my solidarity with them.  There has been a lack of research in the arts and culture for years and we have been relying on outdated data.  It is important we continue to develop data and this is just one example of that.  Is there any plan to keep an eye on all of the art forms in terms of research and data?  This was obviously an Irish Theatre Institute report and it mentions everything from traditional arts to theatre.  Are there plans in terms of research across all the different art forms?</p><p> The second question relates to the talk about funding conditionality.  The agencies have various requirements.  Can I be confident that the Department has the same requirements as the agencies do?  The Arts Council seems to set a very high bar.  It allocates funding to the tune of &euro;130 million thanks to the Department's increased allocations.  Screen Ireland allocates &euro;36 million.  The Department allocates a significant amount of money to organisations.  Can I be assured the same rigorous application process for moneys takes place by way of the Department's funding channels as it does in the Arts Council or Screen Ireland, for example?  Does the Minister have any numbers in terms of people who have engaged with Minding Creative Minds for counselling and advisory services?  How many people have used that service?</p></speech>

It was striking.  The bravery was remarkable during my engagement with them and I commend them.  Things are changing because they spoke up and engaged with us.  I mention also the survey done by the Irish Theatre Institute.  I want to take a moment to praise these women and commend them on their bravery.  I have heard their voices as they bravely told their stories of discrimination and sexual harassment and that is why we are absolutely committed to it.  It is a priority.</p> <p>  Senator Warfield asked whether we were as rigid as the Arts Council.  It is worked into our service level agreement so that absolutely is the case.  I do not have the numbers here for those who accessed Minding Creative Minds services but we can come back to him on that.</p> <p>  On further surveys, the speak up survey was really the first of its kind.  It was made possible because it was funded in its entirety by the Department and carried out by the Department's partners.  Since the publication of the report in November, it has been my intention that further surveys will be carried out in line with recommendation five of the report.  I will provide funding accordingly.  We are already discussing the next round of research.</p> <p>  One of the issues will be the marketing of the survey.  My officials will be proactive in seeking the assistance of resource organisations such as the national campaign for the arts, in encouraging as many people in the arts and creative sectors to complete the survey.</p> <p>  I see the potential in the basic income for the arts pilot as a research project.  It might throw up some interesting data on this because it will give artists the independence to say "No".  That might come out of the research.  They might say they were not comfortable working in a particular area.  We can then delve deeper into that.  There is potential in the basic income that might reach out to more people in the sector.  I think they were all the issues.</p></speech>

As the Minister pointed out in her contribution, not alone are there going to be very significant impositions placed on the bodies that represent the sector but there is also going to be a very comprehensive set of resources and tool kits available.  It is exceptionally important that, as a condition of funding, organisations in receipt of grant funding must confirm that they have taken all the necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour.  We also need to provide some of these organisations that do not have the in-house expertise to be able to develop good practice within their organisations to access resources online or wherever else that allows them to do exactly that.  I stress again that this is an equally important part of the endeavour.  Well done on providing that.  That brings us to the conclusion of this session.</p></speech>

I am pleased to welcome Mr. Dalton Philips, chief executive officer, CEO, of the DAA, who is accompanied by Mr. Gary McLean, deputy managing director, Dublin Airport;  Ms Catherine Gubbins, group chief financial officer; Mr. Vincent Harrison, managing director, Dublin Airport; Mr. Maurice Hennessy, chief information and security operations officer; Ms Louise Bannon, head of marketing; Mr. Brendan O'Hanlon, head of ER-IR; and Mr. Kevin Cullinane, group head of communications.  I thank Mr. Philips for agreeing to meet the committee on this important matter at such short notice.  Obviously, we wait with great interest to hear the outline of his plans.</p> <p>  Transport falls within the remit of our committee, but this is really about the public today.  The meeting is being screened live on RT&Eacute;NewsNow.  What the public want at this stage is reassurance that if they turn up at Dublin Airport over the June bank holiday weekend they will be able to get their flight and they will not be in the airport for an inordinate amount of time, as well as future plans for dealing with this.</p> <p>  I must read a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that the Constitution requires them to be physically present in the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not able to meet this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be reluctantly asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating using Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution.  Members attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Philips to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

To begin, I will take this opportunity to address our passengers directly and to apologise unreservedly to everyone who was impacted by the challenges at Dublin Airport last weekend.  That experience jars with our tradition of providing a positive passenger experience for our passengers.  While the past number of weeks have been challenging, I fully appreciate that what our passengers experienced at the airport last weekend fell extremely short of our desired standards.  I appreciate the anger, frustration and upset that this has caused.  Put simply, we failed in our duty to our passengers and I offer my deep apologies to everyone impacted and, indeed, to Members of the Oireachtas, as I also recognise the reputational damage to our country, for which connectivity and ease of access are our lifeblood.</p> <p>  I also assure passengers who were affected by last weekend&rsquo;s queues that they will not be left out of pocket.  These challenges were not of passengers&rsquo; making in any way, and we will work closely with everyone impacted to make sure that they are not impacted financially.  If passengers were affected by last weekend&rsquo;s events, I ask them to complete the online form on our website at dublinairport.com or email customerexperience@dublinairport.com and we will ensure speedy recompense.</p> <p>  I also take a moment at the outset of today&rsquo;s meeting to acknowledge the incredible efforts of all DAA&rsquo;s employees, during what has been a hugely challenging time.  Our people, and the members of the committee know this, are fiercely proud of our organisation.  Their commitment and their efforts have been outstanding, particularly over recent weeks and months. </p> <p>  However, I appreciate that apologies are not what people are most interested in today.  The committee and the public will be very keen to understand, and the Chairman asked me about this, first, exactly how these challenges have arisen and, second, the immediate steps we are taking as a business to address them and to ensure that last Sunday&rsquo;s events will not be repeated.  There are three factors which have led to the current situation, which I have outlined in detail in my statement.</p><p>I would like to briefly state the following for the record.  The unexpectedly rapid rise in passenger numbers affecting the global aviation industry, the significant challenges in recruitment, particularly in security screening as a result of the new European Union's enhanced background checks and the absence due to Covid-19 at the start of the year combined had a significant impact on the business and created very significant queues for our passengers on 27 March, following which we implemented a significant work programme to address these challenges.  First, since recruitment began in 2021, we have now recruited more than 300 new airport search unit officers, with 150 officers recruited since the end of April 2022 alone.  We will bring another 70 officers on board over the coming weeks.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has set no upward limit on recruitment numbers.  However, given the absolute criticality of security training, the process of on-boarding these new staff cannot be rushed.  While we are making significant progress, it will take us another month before we get the full complement of additional trained security officers deployed on the floor of the airport.  We have deployed a company-wide task force of office-based staff and senior management.  This includes more than 400 people, who have now worked over 2,000 shifts and over 8,500 hours in support of our front-line team.  All of my team here have done multiple 3 a.m. starts in the airport over the previous months.</p><p> We have also introduced overtime and incentives for our security staff, secured additional external queue management resources and introduced a very wide range of process improvements, passenger experiences and communications initiatives.  I wrote to you, Chairman, as recently as last Friday on the positive progress we have been achieving across a whole range of key areas, which have led to an improved service level.  Until last weekend, 94% of all departing passengers travelling through the airport had cleared security in 45 minutes or less during May, while almost 80% had cleared security in 30 minutes or less.  However, the fact remains that we have been, and are still, managing a resource gap as we pivot from losses of nearly &euro;1 million per day and 1,000 redundancies during the Covid-19 pandemic, to a dramatic recovery of air travel which has been faster and earlier than anyone could have predicted.</p><p> In parallel with our substantial recruitment and resourcing up process, set to deliver a further increase in processing capacity this month and next month,  we have been operating to a plan, albeit one that is predicated on very fine margins, and the Herculean efforts of our staff.  Reflecting on last weekend, Friday saw a similar number of passengers as Sunday pass through Dublin Airport, and travel on Friday was without incident and without undue delay.  On Sunday, that plan failed.  Let me explain why and also why I have confidence in our updated plan.</p><p> On Sunday last, we had rostered and resourced staff to meet the demands of serving 50,000 departing passengers across both terminals one and two, with 200 security officers and a further 24 team supervisors and co-ordinators on duty.  This would have allowed us to open sufficient security lanes and X-ray machines to cater for the first wave of departing passengers.  However, on that day, we were 37 officers down.  Some 17 of these officers were new recruits who were on our rostering system and it was anticipated they would have completed training to allow them to work last Sunday but, in fact, they had not yet been certified.  This anomaly in our processes has since been resolved.  Some 17 recruits were not there but who should have been there.  It was a process issue and we have since fixed that.  We also incurred a loss of 20 officers that were absent from work on that day.</p><p> Many of those 37 staff have particular clearances and certifications required to open and operate a lane.  They cannot be readily substituted by other DAA staff.  Without this capacity, we were unable to bring in substitute staff at short notice in the early hours of Sunday morning.  This compounded the queueing problem throughout much of Sunday.  The impact of this reduction in our anticipated team meant that we were unable to open six security lanes, three in each terminal, which was a loss of 30% capacity in the first wave.  Each lane ordinarily screens about 200 passengers per hour and being down six lanes, we had a processing deficit of 1,200 passengers an hour.  We were unable to achieve our anticipated productivity and this quickly led to queues forming in security.  As more and more passengers joined the growing queues for the available security lanes, the situation became compounded.  This led to a decision at 10.30 a.m. to advise those passengers queueing outside the terminal with flights departing before noon that they would not make their flights.</p><p> This leads me to what will be a very different bank holiday weekend and into the extremely busy summer months of June, July and August ahead.  We are focusing on passenger experience improvements across three core areas, while also introducing new escalation and triage mechanisms in the event of any unanticipated issues arising.  We have submitted a detailed plan to the committee that is focused on a better passenger experience around a number of key areas: maximising the availability of staff resources, increasing the number of security lanes open at peak times and improving queue management.  There is a detailed plan which hopefully at a later stage in this session, I will be able to take the committee through.</p></speech>

Our advice to passengers due to fly out of Dublin Airport over the coming period is to arrive at the airport at least two and a half hours before the departure of a short-haul flight to Europe and the UK, and at least three and a half hours for long-haul flights.  At times, when the terminal gets particularly busy, be it this weekend or into the future, we will triage access to the terminals and only allow departing passengers into the departure level who have a flight departing within two and a half hours to short-haul destinations and three and a half hours to long-haul destinations.  Passengers who arrive too early for their flights - that is, if we need to invoke the triage - will be asked to wait in a dedicated passenger holding area outside of the terminal, with special considerations being given those passengers who require special assistance and those important fliers with autism, etc.  Access to the appropriate terminal for departing passengers will be controlled and will require the presentation of documentation indicating the time of flight, such as a booking confirmation or boarding card.</p> <p>  DAA will put in place bad weather-cover, seating and toilets in the holding area as quickly as possible in the coming days, following trials of this system over the June bank holiday weekend.  We do not anticipate it will be needed this weekend but this is what we will be building for the summer, and we can go into more detail.  Following these incremental measures, we are confident that we have a robust plan and we do not envisage a repeat of what occurred last Sunday.</p></speech>

Should unanticipated issues arise, we will have appropriate escalation and triage mechanisms focused on ensuring no passengers miss their flights.</p> <p>  I hope, Chairman, and members of the committee that the specific initiatives and actions DAA has been taking in recent weeks and months show that we have made a lot of progress.  We had a very difficult Sunday and we let many of our passengers down.  We have a plan around our staffing plan and for this weekend we will have 40 additional security officers working over the weekend.  We will increase our staffing by 10% versus last weekend.  There are a number of other details we could go into.  We will have a very detailed security plan, which will increase our productivity by 10%.</p><p>It was a 10% increase.  There are a number of details we could get into.  We will have a very detailed security plan, which will increase our productivity by 10%.  Last Friday and this coming Friday, for example, there are fairly similar numbers.  We will have 10% more people in place and we will have 10% more productivity.  We will have a number of activities in place to ensure that people can have confidence that they will make their flights.  We have an operations and safety plan in place.  Clearly, safety has to be the number one issue - getting people safely onto the flights.  We will have a strong communication plan around the two and half hours and the three and a half hours.  Challenges remain but we continue to operate a very tight operation with finite margin for error.  A significant programme of work is ongoing by our dedicated people to bring the operation back to the standards our customers should be able to expect.  We want all of our passengers to have a positive experience travelling into and out of Dublin Airport.  As the summer season ramps up, we will continue to drive improvements in our overall service offering to this end.</p></speech>

I will now go to the members.  The public are looking in, so we want to get answers from the DAA as to how this happened and how he is going to ensure the details of the plan will be put in place.  I will give seven minutes.  Members will have six minutes initially and then they will have a further minute.  In the interests of getting the maximum use out of this particular session for members of the public who are looking in on the RT&Eacute; News Now channel - we thank RT&Eacute; for covering it - and extract the maximum information in order that members of the public who will be flying from Dublin Airport this weekend will have absolute clarity and assurance that they will get their flight and will not be waiting an inordinate amount of time, as well as about the facilities in general at the airport.  The first speaker is Deputy O'Connor.  He has six minutes.  When the six minutes are concluded, I will allow a further minute.  I want him to keep an eye on the clock.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I welcome the representatives of the DAA before the committee today.  What happened over the course of the weekend is profoundly regrettable and has done remarkable damage to the organisation and to the State.  It is important that this committee would ask a number of key questions regarding the operational failures at Dublin Airport over the weekend.</p> <p>  In 2021, the DAA received approximately &euro;97.2 million in direct Exchequer supports, in particular in Dublin, for the operational parts of the airport.  Was any of the funding used for the retention of staff at the airport?  If not, why was it not used for the retention of security staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1987" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Philips" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022060100002#C00400"><p>The &euro;97 million was from the Government explicitly for the airlines to incentivise them to operate schedules this summer.  The Deputy will remember that no commentator believed that traffic would come back to pre-Covid levels until 2024 or 2025.  Out of concern for that and all that needed to be done to incentivise traffic in and out of the country, the Government put in &euro;97 million.  We did not receive a single penny of that.  It went to the airlines in terms of reduced airport charges.</p></speech>

Mr. Philips outlined in his opening statement that the DAA was losing approximately &euro;1 million each day.  What was the DAA in receipt of when it came to those types of financial supports?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.1989" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Philips" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022060100002#C00600"><p>We were in receipt of the supports that any other business in the country would have received.  We get no special supports whatsoever.  We are a fully commercial organisation.  We have to access debt markets to raise capital and we received no extra support.  We did avail of the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and there were some rate waivers in place, but they were the same for any company right across the country.  We did not get any specific supports directly to the DAA because of our unique situation.</p></speech>

I am sorry, but I have really limited time.  Why was the EWSS the DAA got, like so many other businesses, not used to retain critical staff, in particular the staff members in question, who take a significant amount of time to get trained for their positions?</p></speech>

Our net debt doubled.  We had to reduce costs.  We did not know how long the pandemic would go on for.  We certainly did not think it would recover in 2022 to the extent it has.  As it said, the estimates were that it would be 2024 or 2025.  We reduced our overall staffing level by 25%, with a voluntary severance scheme across the business.  That got us down to about 70% of what we needed.  We felt that going into 2022, with 70% of our staffing, we would be okay, and we were wrong.</p></speech>

Did he tell them what potentially could happen, which effectively has happened?  My understanding is that approximately 50,000 people travelled through the airport at the weekend, in particular on Sunday, but we could go up to as much as 100,000 people per day in the coming weeks.  Did Mr. Philips communicate the potential ramifications of these staff being let go to the Minister and the Department?</p></speech>

When we were downsizing, we took all the data of the industry analysts and we worked through those to try to predict what the traffic levels would be for 2022, 2023 and 2024, and we reduced our overall cost base to meet that.  We were wildly wrong in terms of the recovery levels that happened once the travelling public started travelling from March onwards.  As the Deputy is aware, January and February were very concerning months.  We had Ukraine and Omicron.  From March, it took off at a level we had not expected and therefore we were behind where we needed to be in terms of our recruitment.</p></speech>

That is interesting.  We were told in this committee repeatedly that it would be approximately 2025 before we returned to 2019 levels.  Based on today's figures, how quickly does Mr. Philips feel the airport will get back to going north of 30 million passengers a year?</p></speech>

We were at 33 million passengers pre-pandemic, and we will be at 30 plus million next year.  At the moment, the limiting resource we have is security screeners.  Neither Deputy O'Connor nor I can do that as you need to be certified; it is a skilled role.  We need to dramatically increase the amount of screeners we have in our business.  At the moment, we do not have enough.</p></speech>

He knows what is coming down the tracks.  We are going to reach a position in a few weeks' time that will be remarkably difficult for Dublin Airport to handle.  Would he not look at relocating routes as a temporary measure to the key regional airports, that is, to Cork, which his organisation manages, and to Shannon, to get over the situation we are in?  Some 1,000 people missed their flight.  If this gets any worse, the number could be much more significant than that.  Would Mr. Philips not look at that potential emergency action and work with the other airports to redirect some flights on a temporary basis to get the DAA over the position it currently finds itself in?</p></speech>

That was the sense and this is what I have been picking up.  Staff in large numbers contacted me over the weekend who are afraid to speak on the record.  These staff, who are still there, were clarifying that their discussions with me would not go anywhere.  The culture is such that they have this fear.  It is incredible.  I felt like a Cold War spymaster trying to talk to people.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Smith has a good understanding of our airport and I think he knows the people.  I do not dispute that people may have said that to him but we have staff engagement in the work we are doing with our staff and the work I do personally as a CEO in terms of being actively on the floor.  All these people who are with me today, one day per month prior to the pandemic, would have done a front-line shift, be it cleaning, customer service, security or whatever to be upfront with our colleagues and listen, learn and develop.  Do we have everything right?  We absolutely do not.</p></speech>

I thought I had a good understanding of the staff culture.  This weekend has shifted it.  I know it is a crisis weekend but we have a staff body who feel very low and very battered and bruised.  This is my final question.  There is no upward ask in terms of the number of security staff the DAA wants to hire.  Is the DAA going to go higher now in terms of security staff based on its projections thus far?</p></speech>

We are going to take that number from 535 to 702 members by the end of June.  That is a gap of 167.  We will increase it to 702 and then we will try to go again to 800 through the summer.  Of that gap of 167, therefore, we have 104 in training and 63 who are in a pipeline.</p> <p>  The reality is that it is slow to get people in, however.  We want to get people on the flights.  There is a reason why the staff are feeling like that.  I have had an opportunity to work in a number of different companies.  I have never worked in a company where there is such pride, which I think the Deputy knows as well as I do, felt by the front-line officers right across the board.  There is incredible pride.  That is why they feel down, and we feel that we have let them down.  We let them down this weekend with the rostering error that occurred.</p></speech>

The DAA cut too deep and it is struggling to recruit quickly enough to keep up with demand.  Mr. Philips said there is a resource gap.  What level of search unit staff does the DAA ideally need to cope with the demand that is there at the minute?  What is the gap?  Obviously, the DAA is aiming for 702 by the end of the month.  What would it be content with at this point?</p></speech>

The DAA does not have enough suitably qualified staff to match the demand, and that is a pressure point.  Mr. Philips says the DAA is running on a finite margin of error.

If the same scenario arises this weekend and the DAA has a little more of a buffer with its 10%, what will be different?</p></speech>

We have brought officers up from Cork, which we are grateful for.  We have an extensive overtime package in place, which is triple time.  We are releasing all available security staff from other activities they might have been doing across the airport and we will be consolidating some of our gate posters.  Those are some of our outside gate posts where some of the cargo and other equipment comes into the airport.  We will be doing a consolidation period to make sure we have 10% more lane processing.  We have our task force of 450 people who do not work in front-line roles who are all doing activities.  I worked Monday last week at 3 a.m., and I will work Friday and Saturday to get in there and help.  Those are the sort of contingencies we are putting in place.</p></speech>

There is a suggestion that there are other personnel that the DAA could draw on such as the Defence Forces and the Civil Defence.  Is there any other pool of people that the DAA is looking for?  I will make the following point on Cork Airport, and I have made it in respect of other airports.  There is a challenge to find suitably qualified people who have suitable clearance and expertise.  If the DAA is leaning on other airports in its hour of need, that favour must be returned in the future.  If Government has a role in that, such as in the upcoming national policy, it needs to make due note of that.  Are there additional resources that could be drawn upon?</p></speech>

I cannot speak more highly of the work it has done.  The local team at Dublin Airport has been exceptional, and Drew Harris has gotten right behind it.  Next is Cork Airport.  We have somewhere between three and six officers coming up and helping us from there.  The Deputy might think three is not a lot but what we need is X-ray certified officers.  That is our key bottleneck and having those officers up, even though it is only three to six of them, depending on the day, makes a material difference.  We have also gone out to other airports, both regionally in Ireland and internationally.  I have put this out to the EU to try to get security officers over here.  We need to recertify them but that can be done quickly.  The problem is that all the other airports are scrambling for these workers.  When I went out to the regional airports, they all wanted to help but they had nobody to give.  Shannon Airport and its CEO, Mary Considine, have been terrific.  Ms Considine wants to help in any way she can but she cannot free up any security officers as she needs them all.  That is the issue we have.</p></speech>

We have had 5,000 applications for the jobs we have in place, and they are people who have chosen to come in to us.  There were people who left voluntarily so our preference is for our current pipeline.</p></speech>

Mr. Philips pointed to international indicators - we have heard others point to that at the committee - but is it not the case that the DAA has failed to read the Irish market?  Is it not the case that the DAA has failed to read the Ryanair factor?  Is that not what has happened here?  Ryanair, one of the most successful and aggressive airlines on the planet, has come back stronger than airlines anywhere else.  Ryanair said that it predicted a rapid rebound in airline travel on 31 August 2021, which was reported by BBC News.  Did the DAA not miss that?</p></speech>

We had a budget that we looked at when we went into Christmas 2021, which was to be at 75%.  When I talked to other airport CEOs across Europe, they said that was a pretty aggressive budget we had.</p></speech>

Terminal 1 is at 95% and terminal 2 is at 85%; it depends on the day.  I sit on a council with the CEOs of all the other airports.  When I talked to them, they said that 75% of our budget was chunky.  In February, as oil prices spiked, Ukraine kicked off and the cost of living was going through the roof, we were looking into the summer and we were deeply concerned.  We should not have got rid of that number of people.  If I knew then what I know now, I would have made a different decision.</p></speech>

It is good to hear him make that admission in his last comment because that is where the problem lies.  I want to ask about passengers with reduced mobility in particular and how they will fit into the DAA's plan.  I have feedback from people who were stopped at the weekend and I know the weekend was chaotic.  Mr. Philips and his team did not want that and none of us want to see that again.  We just want people to avail of a State service and to do so in a comfortable and appropriate manner.  People were stopped coming up the ramp.  It caused great distress having to walk and queue, which affected many people.  Can the DAA be sure that the information given is very clear?  Where will people with reduced mobility be able to access the airport?  Will they be able to drive right up and be dropped at the door?  Will they have to queue or make extra arrangements?  The DAA has brought in new staff and will be bringing in more.  The figures Mr. Philips mentioned were a 10% increase in staff and 40 new security people and I ask that they be briefed fully.  It is very difficult when you get new staff in.  When staff have been there for a long time they know the ropes and they know what to do but new staff can be overenthusiastic and the DAA needs to be careful of that.  I ask the DAA to be sure that information goes to those passengers who have booked for assistance on where the meeting points will be and that information must be clear.  That has to be a priority.</p></speech>

It is something we were good at before.</p><p> Deputy Smith talked about food and beverages.  Many of the services we offer at the airport are being challenged at present.  This is an area on which we must focus, particularly with so many people in the terminals.  It is a matter about which passengers are very concerned.

While we cannot do too much to reduce volumes, etc., we can focus on awareness, empathy, training and information.  That is where we need to redouble our efforts with OCS, our partner, but also with all our staff on the ground to make sure they are highly aware and behave in a very emphatic way.  That is what we need to focus on over the next couple of weeks in particular.  That is all I wanted to say.</p></speech>

Obviously, the safety of our staff and passengers on their security is number one and paramount in everything we do and it is first and foremost on our board&rsquo;s list of anything it discusses with us.  It is critical.  We have a very good record on that.  Mr. McLean might update the Deputy.</p></speech>

The reason we have had access control into the building for short periods in recent weeks was to ensure the safety of our passengers.  We work very closely with Dublin Fire Brigade.  It was on-site this week with us in order to ensure that all the processes and procedures we have in place are used to manage the process safely and within the parameters of the building controls within which we are obliged to operate.  That applies to all our plans and all those holding points.  We do not intend to be in car park holdings.  If we are, however, that will be done within the parameters of the building controls and in a safe and effective manner.  That is the whole purpose of those controls.</p></speech>

However, this is a planned procedure now.  Taking account of the numbers and those extra places, will the DAA be staying within building capacity requirements, security requirements and fire regulation requirements in respect of people in the building and within airport's curtilage?</p></speech>

I read his statement.  It is a frustrating and a sad irony that an entity which is all about moving people has been a in state of paralysis quite a number of times.  I was one of the members who was here at the end of March or early April when we were given reassurances and provided with timeframes within which the DAA would have this matter rectified.  That has not come to pass.  Just last week we received reassuring emails that everything would be fine.  There is a saying "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me."</p> <p>  Members of the public interface with the airport and will be travelling through it today.  I travelled beside one of those passengers this morning on the train to Dublin.  That person had left hours upon hours in advance of her flight because she was petrified she would miss it.  Those travelling are people going on holidays or going back to UK for family funerals.  The DAA's public relations people were on the airwaves this week stating that it will compensate people.  When asked about the level of compensation, however, their responses were totally vague.  I do not think anything appropriately compensates people for this.  I would like Mr. Philips to address that issue.</p> <p>  I do not know if the witnesses can see what I am holding up, but it is an image of the departure gate in Shannon.  It has a lovely graphic arch asking people to please queue here.  There is no queue, however.  In Shannon, can drop one's bag off and seven minutes later be having a cup of coffee and waiting to board one's flight.  The solution to Mr. Philip's problem lies in airports like Shannon and the other State airports.

We have obviously run a variety of scenarios as we look forward to determine the future demand and future capacity.  As part of that scenario planning, we have actively discussed with the airlines whether they have the capability and desire to shift capacity to other airports should the need arise.  When I say that, they obviously have the prerogative to move capacity at any point and we have had open engagement with the airlines.  There are a range of logistical challenges in that regard, not least crew and resources on the airline side, but we have been open and explicit in our discussion with the airlines on that.</p></speech>

The current advice to passengers is to arrive two and half hours before their flights are due to depart and to allow an additional hour on top of that for a bag drop.  Yet KLM and Air France advise their passengers to arrive two hours before the flight.  People are in a state of flux.  They are looking at airline advice and at the DAA&rsquo;s advice and they do not know when to arrive.  How chaotic does Mr. Philips envisage things being when the new runway opens?</p></speech>

We have a complex situation at the airport in that if a passenger has a bag to check in, not all airlines open their bag drop desks at the same time .  As a result, we have a range of two hours in advance to four hours in advance, and that is just in terminal 1.  Our advice to passengers is they should arrive two and half hours in advance of their flight if they can.</p><p>We also advise that if one is checking in a bag then allow additional time.  People need to check with their airline about when its desks open.  Some airlines offer nigh-before check-in and we encourage people who can to avail of that option.  It is a complex message.  The two and half hours works for the majority.</p></speech>

On all shifts throughout the weekend will we see an extra 40 people or is that a total of 40 people who will be dispersed intermittently to various shifts?

This is a key process so there should be checks and balances.  A situation should never reach a point where one must apologise.  Maybe someone in the chain of command says he or she messed up but somebody else will catch it.  To have such a critical error that led to such consequences, financial for the DAA and disruption for everybody else.  It is not the person who made the mistake but the box in which it was made.  It is the chain of command.  It would be helpful if the witnesses explained this matter a bit better and if not then at least come back to us.  I ask that because this matter speaks to an overall cultural issue around the processes that are in place.</p> <p>  There is now talk of cordons and that is a good idea so people are held back and move along in stages.  To me, that is a fairly obvious option and I do not understand why cordons were not deployed quicker.  My query goes back to the process, and ensuring there are checks and balances.  The DAA conducts risk profiling, risk analysis and risk planning.  For example, when a suspect package is found then people must be moved from the area.  Has the DAA thought through its processes?  There was nobody to process people but there are other things that cause chaos from time to time at an airport.  It does not seem to me that the DAA had something to deploy and that people were trained to cope with various scenarios no different from a fire drill in this building.  We know when a fire drill happens here that there are people in each corridor to tell us what to do and we follow their advice.  Such advice was not available at the airport.</p></speech>

We had the Irish Aviation Authority in the other day.  The IAA is responsible for the way planes fly and it cannot have an off day because if that happens then 30 aircraft will crash into each other.  The DAA seems to have a more lax approach.  I say that because I have not got a sense from Mr. Philips or his team that the DAA has a response or drill available.</p><p>When the muck hits the fan, there does not seem to be a response that follows a rigorous routine in which, if a given thing happens, you proceed through certain steps.</p></speech>

I get that.  I thank Mr. McLean for that.  I have a concern about the way in which the security lanes operate.  We have all had experience of different airports.  Terminal 2 is outdated.  It was outdated when it was built.  Based on what I have seen at other airports, I do not believe there is enough space.  People have to snake around.  The point from the back to the front is poor.  For want of a better word, the basket delivery system is like something you would see in some kind of antiquated airport.  The baskets come back more quickly even in terminal 1.  I go through the airport quite a bit and I see the things that cause delays.  The layout is very poor even in comparison with terminal 1.</p> <p>  Shannon Airport has been mentioned.  New equipment has been installed there but not in Dublin Airport.  Perhaps Mr. Philips can tell us about that.  This equipment allows people to leave liquids in their bags, which gets passengers through a lot more quickly.</p> <p>  I am concerned.  Anytime I go through the airport, I see a new concession or shop opening in the mall.  There are new construction works around that.  I do not mean to be overly critical but it seems that the DAA is more interested in the retail offering and in operating as a glorified department store than in processing passengers.  I contend that the reason for this is that it has the airlines by the throat because there is no effective competition.  If it wants to, the DAA can ease off on the passenger experience as long as it is getting money from them in the shopping mall.</p></speech>

The DAA dismissed hundreds of experienced staff.  There is no doubt, as has been conceded, that this was done too quickly and that the DAA cut too deep.  What process did it engage in before making that decision?  It possibly started with the managing director looking at the issue.  I am sure the decision went through the DAA's financial unit.  It will have gone through at the executive level and through the board.  Am I correct in saying that there are four worker directors on the board?</p></speech>

Was Government informed of this?  At that stage, the DAA was like any other company, as the witnesses have said.  I presume it was drawing down a wage subsidy for some of its workers.  How much money did the company generate through wage subsidy schemes?  I have a business but I did not engage with the wage subsidy scheme.  I knew for certain that if I did not keep my staff during the Covid pandemic, I would have no business when it was over.  I cannot understand how all of the intelligent people in the DAA did not understand that with all of the advice they had and the communications they had with the Department of Transport.  That Department is a huge unit within our public service.  We have two Ministers, who have busloads of advisers.  I cannot understand how nobody picked up on the implications of the decision the DAA made to dismiss so many people so quickly.  I find it difficult to understand how the DAA did not anticipate that this was going to be a problem.</p></speech>

There were no material analysts reporting that 2022 would be where it was going to be.  There were none of any credibility in Ireland or in Europe.  Not one of S&amp;P, Fitch, Airports Council International or the International Air Transport Association saw this.  They all saw reaching this level in 2024.  We took the best advice we could.  The Government was fuelling in &euro;90 million by way of incentives.  We acted with the best information we had.  Nobody saw this coming.  That is why there are restaurants, hotels and bars up and down this country that are not open.</p></speech>

It is a strategically important part of corporate Ireland.  The DAA was losing all of this money while, at the same time, drawing down the wage subsidy scheme from the national Exchequer.  I cannot understand why somebody did not go to Government and tell it what the likely result and implication of this decision would be.</p></speech>

As somebody who has some clue about business, I know that the cost of what the DAA has done will outweigh what it has saved because it is now paying treble time and compensation.  The exercise it is now involved in is very expensive and nobody can put a price on the reputational damage done to both the DAA and the country in general.  If you picked up <i>The New York Times</i>last weekend, you would have seen the international publicity the events at Dublin Airport got.  Nobody could buy that kind of bad publicity.  The point I am making is that this decision was badly thought out from the start.  While I accept that the witnesses are totally genuine and are saying what they are saying in good faith, I really do not believe the answers we have got today will address the problem.</p><p>I will not ask for a guarantee because it is impossible to give one.  However, on the basis of everything that has been said, there seems an inevitability of further delays at Dublin Airport.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely right that the DAA is a critical piece of State infrastructure.  We are a semi-State body but we are also a commercial entity.  We are required to fund ourselves from our profits.  We also fund ourselves through accessing debt in the capital markets and historically from the European Investment Bank.  We have a credit rating and need to protect our financial profile so we can continue to access capital markets on a go-forward basis.</p> <p>  When this crisis hit, it became evident that the aviation industry was one of the most significantly impacted industries.  As the months and weeks passed, it also became clear that this crisis was going to impact us for a significant amount of time.  Mr. Philips has on a number of occasions referenced the fact that all the industry analysts throughout the course of the two years that the pandemic impacted us suggested we would not be back at 35 million passengers until 2024 and 2025.  To be clear, we had a payroll cost at the end of 2019 of &euro;20 million per month, with 3,000 domestic staff to service 35 million passengers.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, supports were approximately &euro;4 million of that.  Our staff took pay cuts which amounted to approximately &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million per month.  We were able to remediate our &euro;20 million per month payroll costs by reducing them to approximately &euro;9 million per month.  We absolutely needed to do that or we would have been losing &euro;1 million per day for those two years.  That would have categorically damaged our financial profile for the next number of years.  We were always mindful that we needed to be able to get back up off the mat when the pandemic stopped impacting us and we could do our business again.  That is a little bit of context around why we felt we needed to make that decision.</p></speech>

I would have thought the DAA's reputational profile was more important than its financial profile, particularly when it could have reached out to the Government and sought support in view of the circumstances in which it found itself.</p> <p>  What is the ratio of permanent staff to casual staff to temporary staff at the airport?  We have heard a lot of discussion about the contracts and I know people who have applied for the jobs that are available.  Our guests have told us that the contracts guarantee an employee 20 hours per week, possibly 40 hours per week, and staff are required to be on stand-by.  The DAA is restricting itself when it comes to recruitment.  For instance, somebody in Tipperary might apply for a job at the airport, be given 20 hours per week and told they are on stand-by for another 20 hours.  That means the person must get from the midlands to the airport at short notice.  The DAA must go back to having a permanent, fully trained, qualified and professional staff who can expedite proceedings.  It has been too reliant on casual staff.  The contract that the DAA has out at the moment leads me to believe that it intends to go forward with casual contracts.  Will our guests tell me that ratio?</p></speech>

It is important we get across that the last thing the DAA wants is to offer our colleagues contracts that would not allow people to have a decent standard of living and some certainty with regard to when and how they work.  I can understand how people see those types of contracts that typically exist in the retail sector but they do not operate the same way in the aviation sector.  The vast majority of our employees are permanent, full-time employees, particularly in this area where 75% of the airport search unit, ASU, officers work what are called static rosters, which mean there is no fluctuation in the number of hours they work or when they work them.  They have absolute certainty in that regard.</p> <p>  In the model we have brought in as a result of Covid-19, 25% of people are on a flexible pool roster and will work between 20 and 40 hours per week.  They get 30 days notice of a 30-day roster.  It is 60 days before there is any change to people's rosters.  I can tell the committee that the DAA has no intention to go down the road of bringing in casual contracts of employment.  It is not in our interests because retention would be an issue.  We have issues around Garda clearance and training.  It is not at all in our interests to have turnover of employees.  We want to make sure we offer a package that attracts people to work in the DAA and I believe we do.  The 4,000 applications that came in for these roles in the ASU are demonstrable proof of that.</p> <p>  We are committed.  I, as the head of employee relations, work with the heads of HR and each of the business units.  We look at the contracts and engage with our trade union partners.  All the contracts we have are negotiated and agreed with all the unions that exist in DAA.  I can assure the committee that it is not our desire to have contracts that encourage people to leave.  That is not in our interests and it is not how we want to treat our employees.</p></speech>

I speak to members of DAA staff in Dublin and Cork.  I think the organisation has wonderful staff.  However, I am told, rightly or wrongly, that part of the issue is the staffing contracts.  For example, what happens if the same thing happens this coming weekend and 17, 20 or 37 people do not come in for a 3 a.m. shift?  What happens then?  How can the people who are due the 3 a.m. shift be incentivised?  Are the contracts wrong?</p></speech>

It is important that through social media, the national airwaves and our media, the DAA communicates directly with people.  I ask Mr. Philips to do that on a regular basis.  I ask him not to communicate with people through this committee meeting.  It is important that the DAA communicates with people.</p> <p>  Mr. Philips's presentation referred to issues with processes.  The travelling public have no interest in who can open and close a particular lane.  Have staff been empowered to do that this weekend?  Mr. Philips said that certain staff members have not been appropriately certified so they cannot readily replace other DAA staff with the necessary clearance.  Have those process issues been solved now?</p></speech>

An average of more than 300 articles or interviews have been published or broadcast every day since last Sunday about what transpired at Dublin Airport.  I assure the committee that I and my communications team have been readily available to all members of the media, including those present today and those in the broadcast, print and online media, at all times.  That will continue to be the case.  We will have a rigorous and robust communications plan around the four-point plan for the bank holiday weekend.  We will certainly be engaging with the media immediately after this session with the committee.</p></speech>

There was a process issue, as the Senator pointed out earlier, with respect to our planning for the weekend so that certainly was a process issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.2228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022060100002#K00900"><p>Okay.  I will conclude by saying two things.  I thank the DAA representatives.  I apologise but I have another meeting.  Dublin Airport is a strategically important State asset, facility and service.  It should have been classified accordingly.  I believe, and Mr. Philips, to be fair, is right that nobody foresaw what was happening because I have gone through the newspapers and articles.  Around the world there are issues with aviation, so those who claim to have a knowledge that it was going to happen, I am sorry but they did not.  I stand over that in this room.  It is not acceptable that on a continual basis some people have said today they want to redeploy staff from Cork Airport to Dublin.  We must not cut the capacity of Cork Airport or indeed Shannon Airport because it is critical the capacity of Cork, which is under the DAA's watch, is kept to its fullest.  On another day, there needs to be a re-emphasising and a re-accentuating of Government aviation policy and the airlines.  The DAA, Government and the airports have a role to play because 85% of our travelling public are coming in and out of Dublin Airport and that is far too high.</p> <p>  I conclude by wishing Mr. Philips well in his new move.  Today is a disappointing day for him and his staff here are doing their best.  I thank the staff on the front line last Sunday.  I had people ringing me at 6 a.m. in the morning and I thought they were imagining it or making it up.  They were not, unfortunately.  I hope we will never be back to where we were today but I thank the DAA representatives for coming in.</p></speech>

For the public looking in at the moment Mr. Philips, if they turn up Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday to Dublin Airport to get a flight, what will be the situation?  How long will they be queuing outside terminal 1 or terminal 2?  How long do you anticipate it will take for them to get through their airline and then from the airline they have to queue to get into security?  Once they pass just checking at security then they go into the security checks themselves, so how long will they be waiting?</p></speech>

Allow an extra hour if you need to check a bag in.  We will do everything we can do get as many through.  As I said, 95-odd% of all people through May went in under 45 minutes.  There will be periods over this weekend, Chairman, where queuing could be an hour.</p></speech>

As I said, this morning we had people out for ten minutes.  People were making their flights, the queue was moving well.  We want to be at 20 minutes.  That is our goal.  That is where we were and that is where we will get back to.</p></speech>

Tomorrow there is rain from 2 p.m. onwards.  On Friday there is rain forecast on the airport's early morning flights between midnight and 1 p.m.  The rest of the weekend at the moment seems okay.  If it is raining outside terminal 1 and terminal 2 what is Mr. Philips going to tell his passengers?</p></speech>

It was stifling and they did not have access to services.  I ask on this occasion that if people are queuing the authority ensures they get access to water.  Free water should be handed out.  There should be proper sanitary services, toilets, food and those sort of things.</p> <p>  Going back to Mr. Philips, I want to get to a point where when people turn up in terminal 1 and terminal 2 how long before they get to board their flight.  I had a couple on to me on Saturday night.  They turned up for a short-haul flight of two and a half hours to Madrid to go over to their family.  It was a 6.20 p.m. Ryanair flight.  They arrived at terminal 1 at 3.30 p.m. in the afternoon.  They did not get to departure on gate 119 until 6.30 p.m. and there was no-one there and the plane was gone.  To say people only missed their flights on Sunday is incorrect as they missed them on Saturday.  Tell me the time period on that.</p></speech>

In the media there are reports you flew to Saudi Arabia on Saturday.  Is that correct?  How long did you queue?  Obviously you are a businessperson - they were waiting four hours and they still missed their flight, on a human level on Saturday night, to go over and meet their family.  Did you fly to Saudi Arabia on Saturday night?</p></speech>

I was going out to the Middle East - as you know for 40 years DAA has been operating internationally.

As anyone who has travelled will know, this is an issue across Europe.  For people who were travelling with Aer Lingus and needed to do a bag drop over the last while, outside the Saturday or Sunday, they went in and dropped the bag and disappeared through the security checks.  If they were travelling with Lufthansa or another airline, they had to wait until two hours before the flight to drop their bags.  I assume that is partly due to airlines not putting sufficient staff on.  I have been told Ryanair has failed in certain places to put enough staff on to facilitate their customers.  I am throwing these questions out.  It has been put to me that this is the case so I ask Mr. Philips to address that.</p></speech>

It is a pity it did not happen last week.  Do we have enough people for the triage process?  The first thing everybody watching the scenes on Sunday would have thought about was the person who had checked in and was carrying a bag on but was stuck outside behind the people who needed to swing right to the bag drop but could not.  That is something that should have been built in beforehand.  We need to have these processes in place while accepting the situation is not perfect.

The question is whether the authority is at that point.  What is Mr. Philips's view on the case for that proposal, which is being put out there?  It has to be a request of the DAA.  It runs the airport.  Our guests are the professionals and they are given a remit to run the airport.  How can they deal with that?</p></speech>

The Army is not aviation-security cleared, so it cannot work in an airside environment.

The platinum services have been our best performing business over the pandemic period, given people were concerned earlier during the pandemic.

I worked on Saturday and then went straight to the Middle East.  When I heard there was an issue, I came straight back.  If there had been an issue before I left, I would not have got on the flight, but instead I left and then came all the way back.  I would have saved myself the company cost of travelling to the Middle East.  Had I known Sunday was going to be how it was, I certainly would not have travelled on Saturday.</p></speech>

He is very well paid, but I do not doubt he works very hard for that money, as do many of the other people working at the airport who earn much less money.  He stated he likes to use the different types of security lanes, whether the fast-track, the regular or the platinum, in order that he can get a feel for the experience of people coming through the airport, but did he choose to use the platinum services on Saturday because he already knew significant delays through the airport were developing and it meant he would not have to queue because he was able to bypass the queues?</p></speech>

I travel a lot and I would normally travel through either central search or fast-track.  I move between the two and that is an opportunity to meet different officers.  As any of those officers will agree, there is always a bit of banter when someone they know is travelling through security.  I certainly would not have gone to the Middle East if I had known this was happening, and that is why I immediately turned around and came back.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not want to share the information with the Senator but I know that many of the competitor airports throughout Europe would like to know it.  Both fast-track and the platinum service are very successful products.  Our staff win many awards throughout Europe for the product they serve.  The &euro;295 fee, compared with the price for a similar product elsewhere in Europe, such as at Heathrow Airport or Brussels Airport, offers incredible value and the staff do a brilliant job.</p></speech>

I believe a member of the committee held up a picture of Shannon Airport earlier, where there were no queues.  Is it not in the interests of the DAA to have some delays or queues, so that there is a product to sell to those who can afford to bypass the "ordinary person" queue and pay their way to a faster service?</p></speech>

We compete against all the other European airports.  Our goal is to get people through as quickly as possible, to get them into the departure lounge and get them comfortable.  It is very standard across all major airports to have a fast-track product.  The airlines, in many cases, will demand that airports have that.  If we are competing for airlines such as Qatar Airways or Emirates to come to Dublin Airport, one of their prerequisites will be that we have to have a fast-track product.  Aer Lingus is very proud of its fast-track product.  It is not the case that it is in the interests of the DAA to have queues.  Perhaps Mr. Harrison wants to share some points on that question.</p></speech>

Earlier I shared my recent experience of travelling through platinum services.  If I travel through platinum services, my cost centre will be debited &euro;295.  It is not a product that we use willy-nilly.  There are no gratuities.  However, I think it is important that as a CEO I experience all types of service through the airport.  Certainly, I would have not travelled to the Middle East if I had known that the events of Sunday were going to happen.</p></speech>

We have heard that over 1,000 people missed their flights at the weekend.  Are there figures available for delays in baggage?  How many bags did not make it on to planes, went to the wrong place or were left in the airport?  Are there any updated figures available on that?</p></speech>

The actual statistics around whether bags make flights are held by the airlines.  We do not measure or have that information as an airport.  We work with our partners to ensure the systems work to get the bags to where they need to be, to bring to the aircraft.  Beyond that, we have no way of tracking whether the bags are put on aircraft.</p></speech>

We have seen that in many media reports.  The issue is not specific to Dublin Airport.  It is part of the wider challenge across industry that we are discussing today.  Baggage is being repatriated at airports all across Europe at the moment.  An issue with baggage may arise at any airport and the baggage may be repatriated through Dublin.  It is very hard to pinpoint if a particular baggage issue is a problem that is specific to Dublin Airport.</p></speech>

The service levels that would have normally been provided pre-Covid are all a bit diminished.  That includes the number of staff working in the baggage operation.  We do not have figures relating to baggage staff.  They are ground handlers working for airlines who are doing those activities.</p></speech>

I am conscious that a lot of the ground that I might have wanted to cover has already been covered.  As one of the few Dublin-based members of the committee present, I can say that Dublin Airport is not just an asset for Dublin; it is an asset for the whole country.  I believe that 87% of national aviation traffic goes through Dublin Airport.  When something goes wrong, it reflects badly on the DAA, on Dublin and on Ireland.  Ultimately, we become a bit of a laughing stock.  I know that is the last thing that the DAA wants to happen, and the last thing we want to happen.  The DAA is a 100% State-owned company.  It is giving ammunition to people who say that the State cannot run things.  I do not want that ammunition to exist.  Suffice to say, the service has not been satisfactory in any way, as the witnesses have admitted.  People presumably missed not just holidays, but also weddings and funerals.  It is just not acceptable that people are missing flights.</p> <p>  I have a few short questions not just on the issue of delays, but also on the general passenger experience through Dublin Airport at the moment.  Is it correct that 248 of the original staff complement were let go?</p></speech>

What will happen if we have another outbreak of Covid or if something else goes wrong or some other thing happens?  I am very concerned about the fact that last weekend was nice and dry but if it was not - and other members referred to this - then lots of people could have got very wet.  I am thinking in particular of people with young children, older people and people with disabilities.</p> <p>  I appreciated the trip.  I remember journalists came to me afterwards and said that the test will be Easter, and the DAA passed that test quite well.  The DAA made reference at the time - it did not want to overly advertise the fact - that it would be combing the queues to try to comb out people who were further down the queues than they should be with regard to their flights.  Did that combing concept ever take off or did it just fail at the weekend because the DAA did not have the manpower to do it?</p></speech>

It would ensure if there was bad weather, as in the Senator's example, that people would not be standing out in the rain for significant periods of time.  We would use the car parks to do that.  We would have it available to turn on should we need to turn it on this weekend.  We may trial it at some point but as a general rule we are not planning to use it yet.</p></speech>

It is a very serious issue.  We witnessed really chaotic scenes in Dublin Airport.  These were scenes we really do not want to see again.  Lasting reputational damage could be done to our country.  I welcome Mr. Philips's forthright apology to the travelling public and to the staff who work in the DAA.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the 17 people who were scheduled to work as security officers on the Sunday.  It is not really credible that they were rostered to work and that they could not work because they had not finished their training.</p><p>I find it hard to understand how that could happen.  How did it happen?</p></speech>

Classes are coming through.  It is a manual process, given we are dealing with individuals, and we had a very poor hand-off between one part of the business to another part of the business.  Nobody was trying to do anything wrong but we did not catch the issue in our plans.  We anticipated the 17 people.  They should never have been there - they could not have been there - and it was absolutely our mistake.  Mr. Hennessy might want to add some colour to that.</p></speech>

There was an error in the hand-off within the organisation.  As Mr. Philips said, we are training a lot of people and trying to get a lot of people through the organisation.  Our time and attendance system supplier, Kronos, suffered a cyberattack last December and our time and attendance system was down from December to April, as a result of which many of our systems had to be manual, and we have not yet fully recovered from that.  A number of our underlying processes were compromised.  We had to go manual on a number of those processes and we have not yet fully recovered them.  Going manual in such situations is prone to error, and that is one of the reasons-----</p></speech>

We are running on very tight margins.  Had we made this mistake in a pre-pandemic world, there would have been enough redundancy in the system.  Every person makes a material difference now.

There was not a pattern but rather a host of reasons.  There were one or two cases of <i>force majeure</i>whereby people for urgent family reasons could not do their shift, while for others it related to sickness.  There was no pattern that gave us cause for concern.  It was just one of those sets of circumstances whereby many people were absent on the day, which, coupled with the time of day, compounded the problem for us.  Picking it up that morning was just too late; we could not respond to it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there have been challenges at the seams, but these people are really leaning in.  They want the travelling public to travel and they are giving everything.

We need to ensure we look after our employees.  We are not asking people to do more than can be reasonably expected of them, and some people have gone well beyond that even before the summer has fully begun.  We need to manage and look after our staff and ensure they will be to the fore of any decision-making.</p> <p>  One of the Deputy's colleagues asked earlier what type of contracts and contingency we offer.  It is one of those things whereby if we do not have resilience built into the roster, we might have to go down the road of having people "on call".  We do not want that to be the type of work we offer.  That is not what we are about.  The roster should have enough resilience built in to be able to accommodate and soak up absences and so on.  We do not want to get into an on-call scenario whereby we would have to call people at 2.30 a.m. to ask them whether they can come in to work.  That is not what we are about.  It is not how we run the organisation and it is not what we want to do.</p></speech>

These are highly skilled people whom the State cannot do without, and they were cut adrift too quickly.  There was no foresight.  Of course, it is easier to see in hindsight, but the EWSS was set up to retain a link between the employer and the employee.  It was put in place for essential, critical staff, such as airport security officers, so it is very disappointing that this happened.</p></speech>

We have to be a sustainable organisation.  The Government gives us nothing.  Ms Gubbins has to go out to the debt market and borrow, and she has to compete with all the other commercial enterprises that are also trying to borrow.  We really felt, based on all the data, that the recovery would not be until 2024.  That is reflected in the fact the Government has offered a &euro;100 million-plus scheme directly to the airlines - we do not get any of it - to incentivise travel.</p></speech>

I can see the aggressive approach of the Dublin Airport Authority to all the other airports in the country, to the extent that it receives 87% of all the traffic.  That is the underlying problem.  Even when Adare Manor was selected to be the host of the Ryder Cup in a couple of years time, the first step the Dublin Airport Authority took was to state online that Dublin Airport would be the local airport for anyone flying in for the tournament.  That is so disingenuous but it shows the attitude and the predatory approach of the Dublin Airport Authority to receiving passengers.  I think our guests have a brass neck in that they are looking to Shannon Airport and Cork Airport to bail them out with security staff from those airports to ensure Dublin Airport will keep going.  It is very hypocrtical of them.</p><p>It is not really an issue for our guests, but national aviation policy needs to change to rebalance that whole equation.  Dublin Airport was not able to cope with the masses trying to lift off from it last weekend.  The DAA was not able to cope or to manage the situation, which got out of control.  We are a small island with five airports - one on the east coast and four in the west.  Basically, Dublin Airport has 87% of the traffic, while the rest of the airports have 13% and are scrapping over the crumbs.  Would our guests support a change in national aviation policy to the benefit of the country as a whole?  If that pie was distributed more evenly, Dublin Airport would be able to cope and the DAA would not be scrambling for personnel, trying to hold onto them and to avoid them becoming burnt out.  There would not be queues starting to form at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  If it was spread out, passengers could be catered for at Shannon Airport, Cork Airport and the other airports.</p></speech>

Shannon Airport has been incredibly supportive of us and we have a very good relationship with it.  We have two-way communication going on with it on many different issues.  We reached out to it and there are times when it will speak to us about things.  We work very well with Shannon Airport.  In the context of airlines such as Emirates, Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific, before the pandemic, if they were lost to Dublin Airport, they would be lost to an airport such as those in Vienna or Manchester.  We are competing against these other airports.  If we lose those airlines, they will not come to Ireland.  We can work very effectively with Shannon Airport.  We do not deploy to where the airlines go.  They choose where they wish to operate.</p></speech>

I would love Shannon Airport to have more traffic because that would be good for the economy.  We do not dictate that, however, and neither does national aviation policy.  We have a commercial mandate to develop traffic at Dublin Airport.  That is what we are challenged to do.  If another Irish airport can attract an airline such as Etihad Airways or Emirates, that will be fantastic, but those airlines choose to go to Dublin.  Mr. Harrison may wish to add some colour on that.</p></speech>

We in Dublin Airport take the view that we have responsibilities to passengers throughout the country and, in fact, throughout the island of Ireland.  We have a high proportion of passengers travelling to or from Northern Ireland who avail of our services.  Our remit is to meet the demand that is required of the airport.

Shannon Airport could be used now if airlines choose to use it.  Mr. O'Hanlon referred to issues in respect of rostering and things like that but Shannon Airport is an option now that could cater for a flight, make sure it is on time and ensure passengers get through security in a timely fashion.  In the case of flights to America, for example, passengers have to go through two security checks at Dublin Airport whereas they would only have to go through one such check at Shannon Airport.  It would make far more sense to divert some flights to America to Shannon.</p></speech>

Ironically, we have an airport with capacity for 2 million additional passengers.  We very much welcome working in harmony with Dublin Airport to assist it with those 2 million passengers.  That is for another day.  The point is well made by Deputy Carey.</p></speech>

They stated that the net debt of DAA has doubled.  Does that explain a potential shift in management priorities?  I am talking about more aggressive revenue generation.  I refer to initiatives such as the forthcoming set-down charges at the airport.  DAA has stated that is being done for sustainability reasons but we know there are issues with connections to public transport at the airport.   In the case of the soaring parking charges, DAA has stated they are due to a dynamic pricing model even though we know there are 3,500 fewer parking spaces.  Our guests have given the impression that is outside of the control of DAA.  There are reports that costs to airlines have increased by 88%.  Can our guests share their current key strategic priorities?  Have those priorities changed in the past year?  Where do the customer experience and value for money sit?  What about the maximisation of margin?  Our engagement today is about consumers.  Given that consumers have been let down and are facing inflation and cost-of-living pressures, is DAA going to continue with those additional charges and pressure for consumers?</p></speech>

It is a really good question.  We are a fully commercial organisation.  We have to carry our own water.  Ms Gubbins has to raise debt in the debt markets.  We have to fund the expansion out of our balance sheet for the critical infrastructure the State needs.  We need to be commercial and we obviously need to have a revenue that can support the cost structure that we have.  We clearly need to be competitive in the marketplace, however, and we need to offer value for money.  We are trying to triangulate all of that.</p> <p>  Mr. Harrison may wish to address the set-down charges specifically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.2597" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Harrison" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022060100002#R01500"><p>In broad terms, the model in which we work within the regulated environment in which we operate is that our commercial revenues - all of the revenues the Senator mentioned, such as car parking and others - are taken into account in what is referred to as a till and they are netted off against our costs.  The more we generate commercially, the lower, essentially, the net cost for our aviation customers in terms of airport charges.  In theory, that operates as a virtuous circle.  The more efficient and commercially driven the organisation is, the more benefit that ultimately goes to the travelling public in terms of lower costs for using the airport.  Obviously, that model has been disrupted through the pandemic, as have all of the bases in which it was set.  That included a 23% reduction in our capability to generate aeronautical revenues in the most recent determination.  We are now going through a new process to reset all of those bars and we have made a submission to the regulator to say that, for example, when the much lower traffic base we are operating on and the much higher operating costs in many cases, particularly in the context of payroll costs and energy,  are taken into account, that should generate a change in the parameters that were used the last time and generate an increase in that charge.  That is part of a submission to the regulator.</p> <p>  Specifically in respect of the set-down charges, there are a great number of mobility initiatives that will contribute to climate change targets, but also to the improved passenger experience that we are looking to introduce.  One of those initiatives is to limit the access of cars through a congested area.  It is not simply for the good of the environment, let us say.</p><p>We also need to ensure that we can continue to have mobility in the airports.  We have therefore said that we will ring-fence that funding that is raised into environmental projects.  That whole project is subject to planning, so it is not in our current operation.</p></speech>

Most airlines will not allow passengers to drop off bags until two hours before the flight.  If the DAA is asking people to show up four and a half or three and a half hours before flights, have they squared that circle?</p></speech>

Even temporarily, has the DAA looked at diverting routes to airports that can handle the traffic, until they sort out their house themselves?  There is loads of capacity in the other airports but right now, the DAA is flying all the people in and out of what is a cattle mart at this age.</p></speech>

We do not have the capability to divert traffic, other than in a weather emergency or something like that.  Therefore, we have asked to gauge their level of interest in operating.  The indications from them are that it would be logistically very difficult for them to operate increased schedules in other locations-----</p></speech>

For example, we have the Donegal-Dublin route and the Kerry-Dublin route.  Passengers who land in Dublin Airport have to go out and come back in through the chaos, even if they are flying on to another destination and <i>vice versa </i>if they are coming into Dublin and are flying on to Kerry.  Surely that can be sorted.  It is not logistically impossible to sort that.</p></speech>

I will try to keep my questions short.  I thank the DAA for coming in.  It has been absolute disaster.  I know this.  I have heard about it.  I come from Roscommon-Galway and Knock Airport is our main airport.  This affects not just families who are on holiday.  People doing business have cancelled their flights this week.  People in business in Ireland have cancelled their flights because of the fear of having to wait four or five hours out of a working day.  That again has a huge impact, as my colleague has mentioned, on our reputation.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Philips.  Dublin Airport Authority is a semi-State organisation.  Is that correct?  </p></speech>

The Dublin Airport Authority is acting on behalf of the Irish State and that service has been supplied on behalf of the Irish State for the people of Ireland, the tourists, the people who come into this country and the people who leave this country.</p> <p>  In terms of the unions, our Chair asked a question earlier.  What work will be done in the next number of days to encourage the unions and to work with the unions to bring on people with those contracts?  I refer to the people of whom Mr. Philips has spoken.  I believe it was correct that these were to have an extra six months plus two months.  </p> <p>  My second question is on the communication.  I think Mr. Cullinane was working on this.  He spoke earlier about it.  He said that he would be communicating directly after this meeting.  What is going to be done from today, this evening and tomorrow in the national media and in the international media to communicate how our airport is open for business now?  How will it be communicated that the airport is open and that it will be able to handle things, with the measures that the DAA will put in place over the next number of weeks?  What will be done to reassure people about the measures that the DAA is putting in place right now?  I will leave it at that, and I thank the Chair.  </p></speech>

If we had dealt with things like reductions in pay, terms and conditions, we would have lost staff and had major industrial relations issues.  We tried to avoid that in our approach.  We met the unions on a weekly basis to agree how we would engage.</p> <p>  We did not reduce people's terms and conditions; people availed of a voluntary package.  Nobody was laid off.  We did not make the package available for anybody until six months into the pandemic.  Some of the predictions we heard about how long this was going to last had well and truly gone.  We were six months into a pandemic, with no sight of it ever stopping in the future.  We had to start making decisions whereby if people wanted to go, we let them go.</p></speech>

That has been accepted here today.  What has got the airport to this point is how business was restarted.</p> <p>  The new jobs in the airport have been advertised, with a closing date of Monday evening for people to apply.  I note the airport is competing against 51 other employers looking for security personnel in the greater Dublin area.  The airport wage of &euro;14.41 per hour compares favourably with most rates, but many employers are appealing to the same pool of people and offering far better pay and conditions, without the requirement to commute from Dublin city centre to the airport and back every day.  Does it concern the DAA that it does not have enough cherry on the pie to entice people?</p></speech>

However, the fact that we received 4,000 applications for those jobs proves that people are looking at the package and the fact we have very attractive pension and sick pay arrangements to cover people when they are, unfortunately, ill.  People can progress to &euro;21.97 after seven years on the scale.  The fact that many chose not to avail of the package is proof that the people who stayed on the new terms and conditions see the benefit of remaining with the DAA.  It gives them job certainty.</p></speech>

There were some problems.  When we engaged with the unions, we predicted what 2021 might look like in terms of passenger numbers.  It is important to clarify that we did not have any pay cuts in the DAA; rather, working hours were reduced.  People worked fewer hours, which obviously affected their pay.  We did not expect people to work for five days and get paid 20% less.  When we did not see the recovery that we were expecting in 2021, we made the decision to let those people go.  In hindsight, should we have kept them?  We probably should have.</p></speech>

It all seems to come down to capacity.  The witnesses say they are right at the edge, which brings me back to asking whether there is anything else that can be done by the State.   If we are talking about bringing people in who can do some of the checking, I understand the DAA has access to the resources at Cork Airport but not necessarily to the resources of the other airports.  It can request help from the Government, and the Government, in turn, can request that assistance.  Is that conversation happening?</p></speech>

However, I get the point that the competition goes to Vienna, London or wherever else.  Change in this regard will require State aviation policy and there is no point in going down that road today.  The witnesses have made a promise today and we hope they can follow through on that because people require it to be done.  That is the best message that can go out today and how we can restore confidence following the damage that was done.  People want assurance that we will not have another incident like what happened last weekend and passengers will never again go through that type of scenario.</p></speech>

They have been very open to the discussion.  It is not too harsh to say there was a cock-up in regard to the rostering at Dublin Airport last week.  There were 17 trainees who had not been certified.  That was the major source of the cock-up.  Then there were the further 20 people who were absent, which compounded the problem.  The witnesses are confident for the current week.  I assume they have checked, double-checked and treble-checked the rostering system and that it is foolproof.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Mr. Hennessy gave his view on the Army but there may be a role for it to play.  Dublin Airport is vital infrastructure.  It is not just about the DAA as a commercial entity.  It is about Ireland Inc. and Dublin Airport is the gateway to the country.  Shannon and Cork are also gateways but Dublin is the global gateway.  It is extremely important that the airport be fit for purpose.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Philips and his colleagues for assisting the committee.  This is a matter of high importance and we will be monitoring developments over the coming period.

We recently had a productive meeting on this matter with The Irish Postmasters' Union, and we are expecting An Post to meet the committee on 15 of June to continue our consideration.</p> <p>  Today I am very pleased to welcome, on behalf of the committee, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, who is accompanied by Ms Jenny O'Hora, principal officer with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  I thank the Minister of State for accommodating the committee with this rescheduled meeting.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not be able to permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precinct will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard I ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, members are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to give an update today on the future of the post office network.  I am joined today by principal officer, Ms Jenny O'Hora from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p>  Colleagues will be aware that An Post is a commercial State body with a mandate to act commercially.  It has a statutory responsibility for the State's postal service and for the post office network.</p><p>Postmasters are independent SMEs contracted by An Post to run post offices and the Department does not have a direct relationship or contract with them.  They are not State employees, nor are they employees of An Post.  As such, they are not paid a fixed salary.  Their income is derived on a fee-per-transaction basis.</p><p> The agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, in 2018, which was supported by 80% of the IPU's membership, has underpinned significant change and investment to redefine the post office network, including reducing the number of post offices, modernising the postmaster contract and an acceptance that new business lines were required, along with capital investment in the network.  This is a vital part of the delivery of An Post's strategic plan.  To implement the plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150 million, the Government provided a long-term low-interest loan of &euro;30 million to the company in December 2017 to support and protect the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a five days per week mail delivery service.</p><p> As set out in the programme for Government, we are committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure of Ireland.  I have met the chairperson and the chief executive of An Post.  They fully understand the Government's position.  I have met the IPU three times.  I addressed its annual conference last October and will do so again on 4 June.</p><p> The Government recognises the importance of a high-value and high-quality post office network to our citizens across the country as well as the central and trusted role of postmasters in our communities.  The network's social value was particularly evident during the pandemic and the demonstrated commitment of staff and management to supporting our communities, in particular the elderly and vulnerable, has been commendable.  Through its network of 900 post offices, An Post continued to provide key Government services to citizens, including through its existing commercial contracts with the Department of Social Protection and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.</p><p> The financial challenges facing postmasters are well documented and arise mainly from the decline in mail volumes and the move to electronic transactions in both mail and the post office network.  The pandemic has exacerbated these challenges and impacted the transformation programme for the network.  In recognition of this and the significant role played by postmasters during the pandemic, I worked with An Post and introduced the pandemic relief fund in 2021, which was worth &euro;8.5 million over an 18-month period.  This commenced on 1 July 2021 and will continue until the end of this year.  The fund aims to incentivise new business by increasing product commissions while also incorporating an element of protection for business declines due to the pandemic.  In addition, An Post undertook to invest &euro;400,000 over an 18-month period in postmaster training to help equip postmasters with the skills and information they need to maximise the business going through their post offices.</p><p> I recognise that there are genuine concerns around the future of the post office network and a potential cliff edge scenario where significant numbers of postmasters choose to retire at around the same time in late June or early July.  This could see citizens losing their local post offices as well as the wealth of services available to them through those offices.</p><p> I am pleased to advise the committee that, as announced yesterday, I secured approval this week for a proposal that will see a funding intervention by the Government of &euro;10 million per annum over a three-year fixed term from 2023 to 2025, to be distributed by An Post to the post office network.  This is the first time that the Government has agreed to introduce such a package.  It will help to support a sustainable, nationwide post office network in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  It also aims to ensure access to important services of social value across the post office network and that there is a network of sufficient scale in place for the public to access these services across the country.  It also provides clarity for postmasters in terms of any decision that they may need to make about their future.  It will be disbursed in a manner that seeks to mitigate the genuine financial challenges faced by many of our post offices while acknowledging the need for continued commerciality and modernisation, as has been the company's strategic goal for the network in line with its agreement with the IPU.</p><p> An Post is a strong commercial semi-State and its strategy seeks to build on its growth and diversification.  The network is one of the company's core strengths and the continued development of the network and its services is a vital component of its sustainability.  An Post will continue to seek and win new business actively and to explore opportunities to develop new or enhanced product lines for the post office network.  I understand there are a number of initiatives under active consideration by the company.</p><p> The Government is committed to working with An Post and postmasters to ensure that the network continues to play a strong role in delivering State services.  The Government will continue to engage on the issue to ensure that we can protect and safeguard the network in line with the programme for Government commitment.  The one-off nature of this intervention seeks to copper-fasten the transformation under way and incentivise a network of strong, commercially focused enterprises.</p><p> Decisions regarding retirement or closure are ones for each of the independent postmasters to take.  The Government's intervention does not mean that some post offices will not close due to retirement or personal decisions, only that they should not close due to lack of Government support.  It is the Government's intention to avoid those decisions being necessary on foot of economic hardship.  The Government hopes that closures will decelerate in order to facilitate initiatives by the company to take off and bear fruit, permit time to assess the findings of census 2022 and whether demographic changes might change the trajectory of rural businesses, and allow for the transformation programme to conclude and new commercial practices to be adopted.</p><p> I thank the committee for affording me this opportunity to address it.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions to raise.  Many Members around the country will have heard from their local postmasters about the need for additional supports, so this funding commitment is welcome.  When will it kick in?  I am conscious that the IPU asked for &euro;12 million.  How does that compare?  What is the Department's assessment?  In what way will the fund be allocated?  The Minister of State mentioned it would be distributed by An Post, but on what basis?  There is an interdepartmental group.  What is the prospect of other services making their way to An Post?</p> <p>  Regarding closures, we heard from the Minister of State about natural attrition.  What will it look like in practical terms if a postmaster or postmistress does not want to continue?  Will there be an opportunity for someone else to pick up the baton or will that office be let go?</p></speech>

The pandemic relief fund was agreed and put in place.  I worked on it with An Post, the IPU and officials in the Department.  It comprised &euro;8.5 million over 18 months and will come to an end on 31 December, hence this intervention's start date of 1 January.</p> <p>  The Deputy's next question was on the &euro;10 million following the Grant Thornton reports.</p></speech>

This unprecedented development was hard fought for.</p><p>This is the first time in the history of the State we have had State intervention in the post office network.  A huge amount of work happened.  I will give the Deputy a little background on the &euro;10 million.  There has been long-standing engagement with An Post on the viability of the network.  There have been meetings between the Department and An Post over the last two months.  I would say there have been two meetings per week on engagement around what a financial support package would look like, and especially the social value.

We engaged and the Department engaged with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There were two economists involved in this as well, so again this is all based on evidence and looking at the scale of population these post offices were going to service.  That is where the &euro;10 million has come from, namely, through an awful lot of research and evidence and in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is public money and we need to ensure it is well spent.</p></speech>

Did the Department build new models on how to account for social impact or social value?  Are those publicly available?  Is this a departure from Government or the Department?  There are a lot of groups that make their case based on their social impact and it can be hard to quantify.</p></speech>

They are not State employees.  The economists, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and An Post fed into this to assess the population, the distance within populations of access to a post office and the services they provide.  There was a huge amount of work on that figure.</p> <p>  How it is going to be allocated was the Deputy's next question, I think.  A grant from the State will be given to the postmasters through An Post.  How that will be worked out is something on which An Post and the IPU will be in consultation.  It will then be approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Something very important I should have said at the outset is this has to be approved in terms of the state aid rules but we have got a clear run and all of this has been talked through with the relevant officials and there should be no issue there.  It is subject to state aid rules, it will be worked out with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to how it will be administered but it will be An Post paying the postmasters, and there will be consultation there.</p></speech>

It is like a pyramid system and my focus is on the post offices that need the support the most.  They are the target area.  What I wanted to do with this package is ensure there is no postmaster who is closing because he or she feels his or her post office is not viable.  The number one target here was to ensure our post office network is intact.  If anyone wants to retire for personal reasons, which I think was one of the Deputy's later questions, it will be his or her decision.  If somebody wants to take up the postmaster role it will be advertised again.  We are all very aware in our own constituencies of post offices where somebody retires and when the role is advertised it is not picked up because it is not viable.  This unprecedented package gives postmasters certainty.  Talking to one or two, they are now not going to retire, knowing this package is in place.  This is for their communities.  It is about what this does for our local communities so they have access to those critical public services.  I was talking to one postmaster about what would happen if they closed down, as they were intending to do before this package came.  The local community would have had to do a 30 km round trip to access banking facilities but now the postmaster can provide them.</p></speech>

When I came into this role this was my number one priority, that is, trying to bottom out the offline services in that report.  It was very clear, and I think the postmasters knew this themselves, that the offline services report was not going to be the silver bullet in itself.  However, we have to look at providing offline services not just within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications or in the Department of Transport.  We are looking, for example, at motor tax and the potential around that.  Likewise, the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are looking at other services.  This financial package is giving the breathing space and the time for all of Government to look at what potential offline services could be provided.  That is in line with our Town Centre First policy as well.  That relates to the interdepartmental group, so this is a whole-of-government approach to try to identify this.  As members know, the Government has a digital strategy and 90% of our services are provided online but 10% of the population cannot, or do not want to, access services online.  The post offices would be able to facilitate that.</p></speech>

It is a cross-Government matter.  It is not just one Department.  There are potentially some services that are available but they are under contract at the moment so we have to wait for those.

I was down home in Clare last night and met a group of postmasters.  It was the latest in a sequence of meetings I have had.  There was the IPU and Mr. Tom O'Callaghan of the Independent Postmasters Group and I was just getting a gauge from the small and the large postmasters on what they are facing and the challenges, and trying to take the pulse of the whole thing.</p> <p>  Today is historic because this is Government committing funding it never has before to the network.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It is also important to say the genesis of the problems facing the network lies in the slow dismantling of that once-famous S52 contract.  It was very much a fit-for-purpose contract.  As the Minister of State said a moment ago, postmasters do not receive a salary.  They are paid on a transactional basis.  The old S52 contract ensured if you went in for a social welfare payment or whatever transaction, the larger post office received a little bit less in transaction payments.  It was positive discrimination to put more money into the smaller rural post office.  Cumulatively across the year, and across many years, that ensured the network as a whole remained viable.  What was on offer a few years ago was a brand new contract.  Some jumped at it.  I think there are now 440 remaining on that old S52 contract.  Some of them are struggling but they see a future.  However, the 560 or so that moved onto the brand new contract are in trouble.  Today's announcement is positive.  It throws a lifeline but they will continue to be in trouble unless there is a whole suite of new transactions and services that breathes viability into those post offices and puts money in their pockets.  From the outset, Mr. O'Callaghan, the IPU and all individual postmasters looked for money and for subvention but were very clear that alone would not be enough.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The first is the postmasters sought &euro;12 million, so why &euro;10 million and not &euro;12 million.  I want to qualify that as well because last week the IPU was upstairs here briefing Deputies and its representatives said for every &euro;1 million less than the &euro;12 million, 100 post offices were put at risk, so why &euro;10 million and not &euro;12 million?  I would like an answer to that first.</p></speech>

Again, this was work on foot of information coming from An Post, working with officials in my Department, the  Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and economists to look at quantifying the social value.  It is important to say as well the pandemic relief fund is an &euro;8.5 million fund over 18 months.  What I am announcing this week is a &euro;10 million fund every 12 months.  It is significantly more than what postmasters are currently receiving from the pandemic relief fund, which runs out at the end of the year.  It is very important to say getting this unprecedented package for postmasters in place is no small feat.</p><p>We want to give them the space to attract more business and incentivise them to drive more business through the post office network.  That is through banking and all of the other services but to work with An Post to drive that business.  An Post is providing training and supports to postmasters and postmistresses.</p><p> Today, I want to call on the public to use their local post office.  We have all attended public meetings across the country to talk about the survival of local post offices but there is an obligation on people.  People value their post office but they need to use it as well and this funding gives post offices a timeline or a breather in which to drive new business.  Also, the funding will act as an incentive for postmasters to increase business.</p></speech>

I welcome the funding, it is historic and shows that the Government has stepped up to the plate.  One can juxtapose that with everything that was said here on 18 May by Mr. Ned O'Hara, and Mr. Sean Martin who said "Anything less, even &euro;11 million, would probably put 100 post offices at risk."  How can we reconcile that?  Is there scope for review?  In the greater scheme of Ireland Inc. and all of the public expenditure in the country then &euro;2 million is small money but when one juxtaposes it with what Mr. Martin said then it becomes quite significant and stark.</p></speech>

AIso, if a post office closes then it is not because there is a lack of viability or income.  That is very clear in terms of this package.  This is evidence-based.  A huge amount of work has gone into this package over the past few months between NewERA, my Department,  the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and information that came from An Post and the IPU.  I understand that the IPU has welcomed the funding.  We are saying that no post office will close because of a lack of income.  It is up to post offices to drive more business through their network and this package will incentivise them to do so.</p></speech>

Is it conceivable that some post offices, including the largest one in the country on O'Connell Street, will get none of this funding while others will get plenty?</p></speech>

The aim of this funding is to help the post offices that are in most need.  I do not want to see unnecessary post office closures and not because they lack viability for those reasons.  Every community is afraid that the local post office might close so this week we have put in place an historic package to ensure that every postmaster now knows that if they want to retire or step away then that is for their own personal reasons.</p></speech>

So I divided &euro;10 million by 900 and came up with &euro;11,111.  Such a sum is insulting to post offices, leaving aside the GPO even on its worst day.  The Minister of State has said that there must be a scheme but post offices have closed in County Clare such as Broadford post office.  The post office in Lisdoonvarna closed but, thankfully, it will reopen as a new contractor has been found.  My party colleague in west Cork, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, has been fighting to keep the Goleen post office open, which is due to close this week.  Closures happen far too often and a pyramid approach probably will not work.  I would say that a threshold and anything over that would not get it and anything under that should get huge subvention.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has answered my query to a degree when she responded to Deputy O'Rourke.  Postmasters have asked whether the funding will be tax free.  Will the funding be an overhead fund to cover the costs that they face?  Will it reflect the fact that some post offices struggle more than others?</p></speech>

Postmasters have said that the funding is good and welcome it but funding alone will not save the network and a whole range of offline services are needed.  My dad does not use a laptop or a smartphone but he is one of those people who drives to his local post office on a Thursday to collect his pension.  Let us be ageist.  The Minister of State and I are of a similar age and I probably only go to a post office to buy stamps or post a parcel.  We need to find a way to get way more people in through the doors of post offices and not just people who are drawing down pension or social welfare payments or people who post a parcel once or twice a year.  We need to see an awful lot more offline services available in post offices too.  The postmasters have made some suggestions to the Minister of State and they made some suggestions to me when I met them in County Clare last night.  The payment of college fees is possible through bank and student services but that is not possible yet through post offices.  Now, when a woman in paid employment goes on maternity leave her maternity payment goes through the bank only but the children's allowance can be paid through banks or a post office.  That is another situation that could be changed by ministerial order.</p> <p>  The passport issue has become a debacle.  It was insulting to the post office network that the Passport Express service was renamed last week.  A pay per passport was always something good.  The application was always something good and rapid but it is not like that anymore.  The postmasters have said that they have undertaken a huge amount of anti-money laundering work for the last number of years without being compensated.  What more can be done?  A sum of &euro;10 million is good but it does not bring them up to the full sustainable level of &euro;60 million per annum and postmasters will need a lot more.  I ask the Minister of State to tell us more about the offline strategy. </p></speech>

It has been made very clear that the report will not be a silver bullet hence the real need to have a financial package in place while those services are being identified but not just one Department, not just my Department and not just the Department of Transport.  For example, the Department of Transport is considering the possibility of motor tax but it will take time to roll that out and assess feasibility.  Revenue has considered the potential of possible services.  The Department of Social Protection is also considering further services for the post office network.  All of that work forms part of our Towns First strategy and there must be a whole-of-government approach when it comes to the provision of offline services.  I agree with everything that the Deputy has said and how a certain number of people do all of their business online.  Offline services must be available and need a whole-of-government approach and in the meantime a financial package is in place to protect the post offices that are in danger of closing.</p></speech>

Last July, or 11 months ago, we believed that we were going to hear about the offline strategy and we need it now.  There are really smart ideas coming from guys like Mr. Tom O'Callaghan in County Clare in regard to the introduction of something like Kiwi Bank and Sparkassen.  The ideas have been fed to the Minister of State's Department and IPU have supplied them to it so the Department knows what can be done.</p></speech>

She has used the analogy of a silver bullet and I believe that the S52 contract is the poison arrow in the side of the post office network because, as all of the postmasters will state, it is slowly ensuring that 300 post offices will eventually close, unless there is a sustainable model for them.  Some post offices have already closed, including post offices in Whitegate and Broadford in my own county of Clare.  We need a comprehensive plan and it needs to happen quickly because January 2023 is the cliff edge on which the S52 contract's dismantling will come back to haunt the network.  I ask the Minister of State to focus on this matter and thank her for her work.</p></speech>

Why was the figure of &euro;10 million chosen rather than, say, &euro;8 million or &euro;15 million?</p><p>These were figures based on information we received from An Post working with the Department.  It was quite difficult to get an assessment because postmasters are sole traders, are not paid by An Post, are their own brokers and are small or medium-size enterprises.</p></speech>

It knows from its own database that there is a post office at the bottom of the list which earns very little and one at the top of the list which earns a great deal.  It has a full range of data and presumably knows how much income every post office generates.</p></speech>

It is also important to say that the pandemic relief fund announced last July was &euro;8.5 million over 18 months.  This is &euro;10 million over 12 months.  This is substantially more than the pandemic relief fund which comes to an end at the end of this year.  The postmasters wanted clarity by the end of June, this month, on that because many of them were going to retire or leave.  Now, a number of them - I am obviously not speaking for them because it is a personal decision for them - will reflect and perhaps stay on, knowing that this package has been put in place.  If the post office is readvertised and if somebody is interested, they know that they will be taking on a viable post office.</p></speech>

I expect and anticipate that with broadband and as more of the population becomes digitally native, or grow up in this area, that we will have fewer people who are less comfortable with it.  Many people became more comfortable than they had been before the Covid-19 pandemic out of necessity.  As we get more and more broadband, there will be more people applying for services through this medium.  We know over the past week or so about passport applications virtually going fully online or perhaps that being the direction of travel.  </p> <p>  Certain services that were used in the post office a great deal will be used less.  There is more mail being delivered through emails as opposed to by An Post.  That does not affect the postmasters as such because that is more the commercially generated items and An Post would be more concerned with the delivery end of these services.  There are about 880 post offices, plus about 50 company-owned post offices, giving a total of 930.  Does the Minister of State believe that in ten years' time we will still have 930 post offices or does she anticipate that there will be a natural progression towards consolidation from where we are now? </p></speech>

It is my aim and objective, as well as An Post's, to drive more business and to get more services into these post offices.  That is why, as well as part of my call today, which is a very positive and historic day for post offices, that we are asking local people to start using their local post offices and to find out about their services.</p> <p>  We have two banks leaving the State now and there is great potential there for An Post and for the post office network to provide these services in local towns and villages across the country.  This is giving the post offices and postmasters that breather to work with An Post through the extra services that can be provided.  My objective since day one when I came into this Department was to get this over the line and it has involved a great deal of hard work, including by the officials within my Department which I cannot overstate.  It is unprecedented because it is about saying that we value our post office network and want these services to remain in our rural and urban communities, but we also want them to build now and to drive business and extra services.</p> <p>  That off-line piece will be very important.  This is an all-of-government piece where every single Department will be looking at what services it could provide in the off-line space.  There is the digital strategy of Government which states that 90% of the services are to be provided online but that leaves 10% of our population who will want to use off-line services.  This is the time and there is further work to happen in this space.</p></speech>

The An Post brand is far more trusted than many of the pillar or other bank identities are.  There is an element of doubt about the banks but everybody trusts the An Post network even if it is piggybacking on the AIB and Bank of Ireland networks to provide the front end of those banks which are pulling out of towns.</p> <p>  There is an age problem with the customer base in that it is generally older people.  I have asked people, both younger and older, how often they use and are in post offices and what they were there for.  I know people in their 60s and 70s who would be there two or three times a week and would use it for many things.  I know people who used to go to my local shop which had a post office.  They would go in, get their money at one counter and then bring it to and hand it over at the other counter. </p> <p>  People, however, under the age of 50, 40, or 30 are not using them in anything like the way that people of an older cohort are.  My worry about that in the longer term is that we need to provide additional services.  We are talking about these &ldquo;additional services&rdquo; in a vague sense but has the Minister of State any particular services which her Department is targeting?  </p> <p>  We set up, for example, a national driver licensing system.  Could we have done that through the post offices?  This might not have involved every post office but perhaps 100, 200 or 300 of the larger post offices could have said that they could handle taking photographs, processing the paperwork and spreading that revenue instead of having 25 driving licensing centres, or whatever the number is.  The alternative was that we could have had that service process through the post offices.</p> <p>  Perhaps there are other systems, such as social welfare payments and identity issues to ensure there are is not fraudulent activity and so forth, even if these payments are being made directly to back accounts, where recipients may have to come in, present themselves, and show that they are available for work, etc.  What exactly is the Minister of State talking about in respect of these services?</p></speech>

That Department said that it would potentially have services that could be provided off-line and could go through the post office network.  The Department of Social Protection has also said that.  That is why that as part of that interdepartmental group this needs to be a whole-of-government approach.  It is not for me to certainly say that within the Department of Transport we can look at these services.  Some of these services across government are out on contract at the moment, so one has to wait until those contracts end.  The identification of a robust off-line service has to be done at an all-of-government level.</p></speech>

I do not know what the percentage is but I presume that the percentage of people doing that online at this stage is very high.  We all remember the old days of having to go in, queue up, and bring this, that, and the other document.  Now one can do this with a series of clicks and it arrives two days later.  Over time that is going to happen more often.  It is about the services which involve checking people's identities, whether it is for jobseeker's allowance or pensions, and establishing if they are still in the State and are still entitled to get what they are getting.</p><p>There is scope there.  However, I wonder if we see the network being 930 five or ten years hence or if we see it being 600 or 400.  Has there been any examination of that?</p></speech>

That is what my aim is.  At the end of the day, this is about communities.  What is the aim here?  The social value is difficult to try to quantify but we all appreciate it.  It is that the service is there.  We know the effect.  I spoke to a postmaster yesterday, as I mentioned earlier.  The impact of that postmaster closing down will be huge across a 30 km return journey radius for local communities.  Regarding the value and the services that can be provided locally, offline as well as online, I believe An Post will be well equipped to provide that.  My answer to the Senator's question is that now is the time to do this, but also every Department needs to be identifying those potential offline services as well.</p></speech>

Ideally, it is all the better where it can be commercially viable without the need for subsidies.  The message that needs to go from this committee to all our friends and to all the people who value the service is very much a case of use it or lose it.  They need to give people the business.  We had a ferry service in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and marine is in the portfolio of the Minister of State's other Department.  There were 1.5 million people going through D&uacute;n Laoghaire ferry port in 1998 and there were 150,000 people going through it 15 years later, so the service closed.  If a service is not used, it will close.  If people want the service to be maintained, they should use it more often and encourage friends and family to use it as well.  That is how we will have a thriving network.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State and her departmental officials for all their work.</p></speech>

I sincerely thank the Minister of State for what she has achieved.  In 2016, when I was the Opposition spokesperson on this issue, I and others, through engagement with the Irish Postmasters Union, An Post and others, produced a paper which circulated as Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  It spoke about the provision of a public service obligation.  The genesis of that was a methodology for providing funding to post offices that were not viable, with the intent of ensuring they would remain open to provide a service that was needed but which was not viable because not enough people were using it.  People had moved to digital platforms and that is continuing.  The paper recognised that people in a certain age cohort were never going to change and go onto the digital platform and stated a belief that they were still entitled to that service regardless of whether others had adopted a digital platform.  There was certain resistance in the Government at the time.  I am pleased today to see the culmination of that work and the Minister of State's input into it along the way.  I am very thankful to her and her departmental officials for seeing the merit of it.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that this is a battle that was hard won, and I have no doubt that the Minister of State encountered resistance in different quarters.  During that time, I and others have continued to engage with various Departments and particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which took some convincing.  I am pleased that has happened.  The Minister was certainly on board at an early stage.  With a push from the Minister of State she has succeeded in getting officials to a point of understanding the benefit that a post office means for rural Ireland.  It is actually greater than just the service that it provides or the number of people to whom it provides it.  I have used the phrase previously, but the harp over the door of the post office has a significance.  It says to other businesses and people who live in the community that the State still has a value in this gathering, collective or community.</p> <p>  I could quibble over the &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million, but that would undermine the massive achievement that has been made.  Next year, when the Minister of State returns to the committee, and I hope she is still in office, we can argue the toss about whether it is &euro;11 million, &euro;12 million, &euro;13 million or &euro;14 million, but I do not want to take from what she has achieved.  Knowing the resistance that would have existed within the bowels of the greater government, the Minister of State has achieved an amazing amount.  I talk regularly to Mr. Ned O'Hara.  I have great respect for him and his team in the IPU, who really value and recognise what has been achieved here.  Mr. O'Hara has been a pioneer.  There have been detractors who have gone their own way.  They have not amounted to much.  There are people who seek to undermine the work of the IPU.  I believe that is wrong and negative in the extreme.</p> <p>  There are issues around services that need to be addressed.  We will look at that in another piece of work.  People are throwing in ideas, and I have heard for years about Sparkassen banks and community banks.  There is a failure to recognise the work of the credit union movement.  In Germany, there are various banking systems.  It is entirely different.  It has community banks, but we do not have community banks.  That is not the solution in the short term.  If we go to a community banking model, how long will that take?  It will take a lifetime.  What we want is a recognition that the State values post offices, and it is always the case that if one values something, one must be prepared to pay for it.  The Minister of State has achieved that, and well done to her.</p> <p>  I have ongoing engagement with postmasters.  Again, I do not want to quibble about the details, but I will make a point.  An Post has done very well under David McRedmond, who has a phenomenal team around him.  He has shown great leadership and a great vision.  He has turned the company around.  I recall when I was in that role in 2016, and the Minister of State and I have discussed this, that the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, called me at midnight one night to tell me he was taking a memorandum to the Cabinet the next day that was going to increase the price of a stamp to &euro;1, such was the perilous state of the finances of An Post.  That is only a few years ago and that has changed because of the work of David McRedmond and his team.  The only suggestion I have for this is that the &euro;10 million be spread among the postmasters rather than the post offices that fall within the ownership of the company.  They will be well able to manage the viability issue or lack of viability if such exists.  I appeal to the Minister of State that in the disbursal of that &euro;10 million she limit it to those post offices that are on contract to postmasters.  That may help to resolve the &euro;2 million gap between where the IPU is and where the Minister of State is.  I do not expect a direct response on this, nor am I posing it for such.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work Ms Jenny O'Hora does.  What she does is well known and recognised.  It is a huge achievement for her, the Minister of State and the Department to have moved the dial so much in what is being done, because the State does not take decisions like this lightly.  There are others who will wish to move on and talk about other aspects of it.  I just wish to reflect on that and to thank them so much for what they have achieved.</p></speech>

We all have been here previously for previous iterations and there is no need to go through what we all believe regarding the post office network, the vital work that is done by the network and by postmasters in particular and the part that plays in rural Ireland.  Post offices also provide major services in urban settings.  It is about ensuring we have a viable network.  Is it possible at this stage to get any detail about some of what Senator Dooley was saying?  How is it intended to break up the &euro;10 million grant allocation?  Has there been any discussion on how that will be divvied up, for want of a better term?  Is it on the basis of size?  Is it going directly to the post offices run by postmasters or what is the situation?</p></speech>

My next question concerns the review process that is being completed across every Department in respect of State services, including the banking services that An Post has started to provide.  There is a need for those services, as some of the major banking institutions are closing their more rural branches.  What is the timeline for bringing that process to a conclusion and putting those services in place?  Long term, it will probably change the amount the State will need to pay, whether it is &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million.</p></speech>

On the review process that the Minister of State is engaged in, I am referring to the notion that at some stage we will be coming up with a battle plan for An Post from the point of view of State services that it may be able to employ on the basis of a transactional payment.  Beyond that, there is the work that An Post is doing.  It should be facilitated as far as possible.  I am referring to State services and banking services.  Where are we in respect of the timeline?</p></speech>

That is something it is working on.  The work on offline services or other State services is happening at an all-of-government level.  As I said at the outset, when I looked at the interdepartmental report, it was very clear to me that this alone would not be enough to keep our post offices open.  That is why the historic financial package needed to be put in place.  An all-of-government approach must be taken on the issue.  There is the Town Centre First policy.  The post office network providing services is at the heart of it.  That is why the process has to involve every Department.  The work on offline services and other potential State services must be led at a government level.  An Post itself is very well placed to tap into more of the online, as well as offline, services.  That is what it is looking at currently.</p></speech>

Alongside that, the financial package can ensure that the post office network remains viable.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has come before the committee to discuss the post office network, but usually I request some element of leeway.  I will digress now to another element of her portfolio that has received significant media attention recently.</p> <p>  Representatives from the DAA appeared before the committee earlier.  We all spoke about the disaster, from a reputational point of view, that was Sunday at Dublin Airport.  Beyond that, we discussed the impact it had on individuals who missed their flights.  Upwards of 1,400 people were affected.  It was an absolute shambles and there were chaotic sights.  We have seen the four-point plan that has been published.  We realise that staffing is an issue, without getting into the ins and outs of the number of staff who have been laid off.  During the meeting we tried to raise some issues with Mr. Dalton Philips.  I accept that the Minister of State's engagement with him has been significantly greater than the interaction we have had with him.  We want to know if there are any resources that can be brought to bear on the situation beyond those which the DAA is engaging at the moment?  We understand the difficulties involved in getting staff cleared to work in particular parts of the airport.  Has everything been done to put in place as many resources as we can to allow for circumstances where, for example, staff are absent due to illness or for some other reason?  There is not a huge amount of leeway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.2854" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022060100002#CC01300"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I have had ongoing engagement with the DAA.  I do not need to say it, but we are all very clear that what happened on Sunday cannot happen again and cannot be repeated.  We have had very robust engagement with the DAA.  I know that representatives of the authority appeared before the committee earlier and, therefore, members are well briefed on its plans.  I will monitor the delivery of the plan over the weekend very closely, as will the Minister for Transport and the Government.  I have told the authority that it needs to put in place all measures to ensure that passengers catch their flights this weekend, that it must communicate clearly with passengers, and ensure that passengers can move safely through the airport.  I have made clear that anything that can be done should be done to accommodate those measures.  I am constantly engaging with the DAA.  We will review the matter, which is critical.  It is about passengers having confidence in flying not only this weekend, but beyond it.  It is all about the delivery of the plan that the DAA presented to the committee over the weekend.  We will monitor the situation very closely.</p></speech>

If the system works, it will address the reputational damage that has been done.  It is fair to say that the DAA representatives told us that they have a plan in place.  They told us that if the authority has all resources that can possibly be put at its disposal, it will get through it.  However, the representatives made clear that there is no element of wriggle room for the authority.  The organisation is still understaffed.  I am sure the Minister of State has had multiple discussions with the DAA on matter, but the part that I am not clear on is whether any other staff can be made available in the short term, while accepting the difficulties and the issues with clearance and all the rest that needs to be done.  I am sure that the Minister of State has had a significant number of conversations on the issue, and has considered every State service that we have at our disposal and every airport.</p></speech>

The crux of the issue seems to be around the security staff who are X-ray scanners and are specially trained.  That seems to be the issue.  There are other issues across the airport around managing queues.  There are plenty of companies out there that provide services to manage crowds going to concerts, for example.  If the DAA needs to hire such companies, it has the resources to do so.  The authority must put in place what is required.  The organisation has presented its plan.  I will engage with the DAA every day this week.  I will be actively monitoring progress and ensuring that the plan is delivered.  That is what the passengers are looking for.  To answer the Deputy's question, I have told the authority that the resources must be put in place for whatever needs to be done.</p></speech>

We had much conversation around the use of the Army.  Sometimes these things can make good press releases and do not necessarily deal with the reality of the issue.  From the Minister of State's response, am I correct that the DAA has the facility to use outside resources?</p></speech>

The DAA is a commercial entity.  On the issue of the use of the Army, it has been mentioned by the DAA and it has come up in discussions.  It is unclear what the Army would do at this point, particularly coming into the weekend.  As I have said, the crux of the matter is around security officers who are specially trained and have to have a particular certification to do that specialised work.  On crowd control, there are plenty of companies across the country that could be employed to do that kind of work.  Nothing is off the table regarding Government assistance.  However, the DAA must ensure it is maximising every resource it has, including looking outside the organisation itself.  The DAA is a commercial entity.  It is the authority's responsibility to manage passengers and do whatever is needed for that.</p><p>We meet them every day to discuss whatever is needed.

We obviously had the issue of the 37 employees, including 20 people who did not show up for multiple different reasons.  I accept the staff are under pressure.  There were also the 17 where the DAA made a mistake in rostering.  There may be an issue with its systems.  There was a cyberattack at some stage resulting in more of a manual process than it would like.  The DAA has said it dealt with that issue and it should not arise again.</p></speech>

I am listening to them.  I have met the chair of the DAA and I have met members of the DAA management board every day this week.  Yesterday I met representatives of SIPTU to discuss workers.  I am acutely aware of all the issues.  This comes back to the delivery of the plan announced today.  This is not about Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; or me.  It is about the passengers having confidence in their safety and ensuring they can get away for their holidays or wherever they are travelling to.</p></speech>

I also thank Ms O'Hora for her great work.  I do not think there is a grouping of Deputies in Leinster House with more concern about the post office network than the Regional Independent Group.  In the term of this D&aacute;il we have introduced three Private Members' motions in October 2020, July 2021 and May 2022, which the Government accepted.  Today is largely a good day.  I welcome the Minister of State's announcement of an annual subvention of &euro;10 million.  It begins to recognise the social value of the post office network.</p> <p>  I support Senator Dooley's call that the subvention would not be given to post offices owned by An Post - it has enough resources to manage its own business.  It should be kept for the private ownership within the post office network which is where it is most needed.  The Minister of State mentioned several times that the subvention is to be given through An Post and then on to the individual postmasters.  I ask her to confirm that no PRSI will be applicable if it comes through An Post and is paid to the postmasters.  Will it transfer to the individual postmasters without a tax implication?</p></speech>

There is no tax liability from our side on it.  A tax liability would be up to An Post.  The intention here is that this funding is going to the postmasters, protecting the most vulnerable.  It is a direct grant from the State to the postmasters via An Post.  We do not have any involvement with tax, PRSI or anything like that.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to take that up with An Post or get approval from the Department on the treatment of that.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has spoken at length about the activity that may come on stream down the line.  A couple of things have not been mentioned so far today, including the immediate ability of post office franchisees to develop additional transaction revenue.  A previous proposal was for post offices to be able to print all government forms.  Rather than people needing to go to the local authority office or request forms from the tax office, they could go to the post office where they can be printed from PDFs.  The post offices have access to every form the government produces and they could charge a transaction fee of 50 cent or something like that based on a PPS number.  That is a social service that could be provided really quickly.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about An Post linking in with the banking sector.  There is already an agreement between bankers and An Post.  The problem is the transaction fee is very low.  However, that model could be replicated for KBC and Ulster Bank which are exiting the market.  We know that will not be without pain.  Perhaps An Post could get in the middle of that bun fight, for lack of a better term, to provide services.  It is obvious that the banks acquiring those assets are having considerable difficulty subsuming those accounts into their banking systems.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned motor tax a number of times.  People in local authorities always tell me how pressed they are for staffing.  In the D&aacute;il today we were shouting about not having enough staff to process disability grant applications and yet we have people retained in motor tax departments throughout the country.  Surely that is something that could be expedited.  I know the Minister of State spoke about a whole-of-government approach.  Can the Department of Transport not move responsibility for motor tax into the post office network straight away?  Why do we need to wait for every other Department to figure out whether it is a good or bad idea?</p></speech>

That is a good idea and I will ask my officials to explore it with An Post.</p><p>The Deputy is right about the opportunities with the provision of banking through the post office network.  The commercial contracts are negotiated by An Post and so it would need to be through that avenue.  I believe representatives from An Post will appear before the committee this month.  The Deputy should raise the transaction fees for banking with them.  I agree that we need to look at more offline services and Government services.  Motor tax, from the Department of Transport, is an area that needs to be fleshed out.  I know the Deputy is saying that rather than waiting for all Departments to come forward, one service from one Department could be provided.  However, I do not want us to lose track of the bigger picture of every Department working together on this.  It should not be <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal.</p><p>This has to be like a Town Centre First approach.  We are looking at-----</p></speech>

It was opportune, given what happened  at Dublin Airport over the past weekend.  As she is probably aware, a media probe in recent days reported that it seems private investment of approximately &euro;8 million has been secured for Waterford Airport.  Local authority funding of &euro;2 million is additional to the Government's previous commitment to provide &euro;5 million for the development of the runway extension and ancillary buildings at the airport.  This will allow Boeing 737s and Airbus A340s to land there for the first time.  The visit of the Minister of State was welcome, but I would like to hear very shortly that once shareholder agreement is hopefully reached and an application is submitted, the Department will be ready to go.  I ask that this money not be tied up as part of a public procurement piece in terms of development.  I request that it be given to Waterford Airport in the form of grant moneys and that the airport will be able to spend it as it wants, as was the case with national aviation funding that was paid directly to Kerry Airport last year in the form of subvention funding.  Otherwise, we will be caught up in a plethora of public procurement issues and difficulties.</p> <p>  The cost of building the runway extension has increased by nearly &euro;2 million since it was first mooted approximately 18 months ago.  Potentially, it might increase again.  The people of Waterford and the south east and I will be expecting that the Government will provide for any shortfall and that no one will come back and state that the estimate for the cost of the runway extension has gone beyond the envelop that was previously discussed.  I remind the Minister of State that &euro;160 million was put into a national aviation package more than two years ago and that Waterford Airport was completely bypassed in that regard.  The stopgap funding that was being paid up to 2019 was also withdrawn.</p> <p>  What has happened at Dublin Airport has shown for the first time that our aviation policy is flawed.  Too much traffic is going through Dublin.  We are trying to build capacity in one place, and we are not looking after the regional airports such as Waterford, Cork, Shannon and potentially Sligo and Ireland West Airport Knock.  I ask the Minister of State to have a serious review of this matter.  It is stated in the programme for Government that it is the Government's intention that circumstances in the south-east region will improve and that Waterford will be the driving economic power there.  In order to have a functioning region, we need to have a functioning airport.  That is long past due.</p> <p>  The retention of rescue services in the south-east region is also very important.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State reiterate that Waterford will remain a 24-7 base in the new configuration.  It is very important that we move on to the next step.  We have been too long waiting for this to happen.</p></speech>

It was a very positive visit to Waterford Airport and to celebrate 20 years of the search and rescue service there.  To reiterate what I said when I visited the airport, the commitment from the Government to help fund a runway there still stands.  There are conditions around that, of which everyone is aware, regarding a proposal coming from Waterford Airport in respect of private investors.  We await the outcome of that.  Developments in that regard sound positive on the basis of the Deputy's account.  As he is aware, we have to go through the public spending code, as does every project.  This is public money.  I await the proposal, and I look forward to that for Waterford Airport.</p> <p>  The continuation of search and rescue services in Waterford is critical.  We have seen the value of it.  The event I attended was a wonderful occasion to mark the Trojan work, dedication and commitment of all those involved in search and rescue and all the volunteers, and, of course, to remember those who lost their lives in the act of rescuing or being rescued.  I reiterate my commitments on the importance of search and rescue services and in respect of working with Waterford Airport in respect of the Deputy's plans.</p></speech>

This is a very positive day.  I congratulate her and her team on securing &euro;30 million for the An Post network.  We have had many conversations in recent times, both here and in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party room, with colleagues including Deputy O'Donnell, me and many rural Deputies and Senators.  I congratulate the Minister of State on her strong engagement with us, as politicians.  I pay tribute to the Irish Postmasters Union and to Ned O'Hara, who engaged with us a very constructive way.  I also pay tribute to the postmasters in County Clare with whom I engaged when they came to my office.</p> <p>  What is being done is ground-breaking.  It is the first time the Government has invested directly in the post office network.  It is a realisation that the post office is much more than just a service.  I understand that more services will come on stream as a result of this injection of moneys.  The report from the interdepartmental group is yet to be published.  Will the Minister of State provide some insight into what she envisages it will contain?  What type of additional State services does she envisage will be available from the post office network?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-01a.2896" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022060100002#GG00600"><p>I thank Deputy Carey for his engagement with me and my officials in respect of this important matter.  It is important that we get the message out to people that they need to use their post offices in order to support the network as we roll out services.  An Post, which is an independent, commercial, semi-State company, has a strategy and a mandate to ensure that there is increased services and that it helps the post office network to get these services on board.  That is its role.  Representatives from An Post will come before the committee in the next few weeks.  It is important that the committee asks them about the company's plans to support the services and to help postmasters and the network to grow.</p> <p>  The interdepartmental group was looking at offline services and what different Departments could provide in regard to such services.  It was clear to me when I became Minister of State that that alone was not going to keep the network of 900 post offices throughout the country open.  That is why we needed this financial support.  In the meantime, we need to look at taking a cross-Government approach in order to identify potential offline services that An Post would bid for.  They would be put out to public procurement, and it would be up to different agencies to pitch for them.  This is why it is important that when An Post comes before the committee, members talk about the importance of it bidding for these potential services in order that, according to its mandate and strategy, it will help to grow the network.</p> <p>  The Department of Transport has identified motor tax as a potential service that could be provided.  The Revenue Commissioners have also outlined a number of services to be looked at.</p><p>These are being fleshed out the moment.</p><p> The Department of Social Protection is also considering some services.  This needs to be driven by the Government rather than just the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This is the problem.  We have a Town Centre First strategy, which I know the Deputy is very aware of because he comes from a rural constituency.  How do we ensure that our villages and towns thrive?  The post office will be a key part of that but we need to make sure that every single Department is looking at potential offline services.  Online services should also be considered.  It is part of An Post's remit to look at online services.  It is important that we work across Government in that regard.  It is a work in progress.  This is giving the post offices and the postmasters breathing space.  An Post has a very significant role to play here because it is part of its mandate and strategy to ensure the network grows.  We had the census recently.  That will shed new light on where people are living and on remote working.  Many people have gone back to their home towns and home villages.  New light will be shed on the services that people now require in their local areas and where these services are required.</p></speech>

The role postmasters, postmistresses and all of those involved with the post office network played during the Covid pandemic was clear for everyone to see.  As we emerge from the pandemic, this injection of money is really welcome.  It gives postmasters and postmistresses certainty for the future.  They can plan and look forward to developing their businesses and their services further.  It is very encouraging to hear the Minister of State say that the State will be there.  She is not just saying it.  She has managed to put this package together and she deserves great credit for doing so.  It is fantastic.  I have no doubt that she had many a battle in many a room with many officials and other Ministers.  A great deal of credit is due to her on this.  Well done.</p> <p>  I will move on to the Minister of State's other area of responsibility, that of aviation.  We had a long meeting in committee room 2 with the DAA earlier.  I will not go over it, but I have heard the Minister of State's comments in recent days.  I know she is trying to do the best she can as Minister of State with responsibility for aviation.  It has been a problem of mismanagement in the airport.  Mr. Dalton Philips assured us today that the DAA hopes to have plans and resources in place to deal with the numbers it expects to go through the airport this weekend.  This issue exposes the frailties in our national aviation policy.  Some 87% of passengers are funnelled through Dublin Airport, which is a really sad indictment of our national aviation policy.</p> <p>  Last week, Mr. Conal Henry, the recently appointed chairperson of the Shannon Group, came before this committee.  He was put forward for the job by the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  He got a ringing endorsement from the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  In the course of his interaction with us, he pinpointed amendment of the national aviation policy as a key ambition of his as chairperson of the Shannon Group.  He pointed out that there is one really dominant airport and four others that fight over the remaining 13% of traffic.  That is not sustainable on an island of our size.  The Minister of State will understand the economic importance of an airport to a region.  I represent County Clare, Shannon, the mid-west region and the western seaboard.  It is just critically important.  Some 40% of foreign direct investment, FDI, companies are based in the Shannon region.  They need connectivity, whether to mainland Europe, the US or anywhere else in the world.  They need that.  One of the primary reasons many of those companies set up in the region is that connectivity.</p> <p>  We should consider the investment Government has made in Shannon Airport, even in recent years.  The committee visited the airport and looked at the new scanning system it has.  Some &euro;4.6 million was invested in that equipment, which means that, having gone through pre-clearance for the US, people can now go through just one security check.  Passengers travelling through Dublin have to go through two, and that airport's equipment is not up to date.</p> <p>  It is easy to make the case that it would make more sense to have more people flying to and from Ireland through Shannon, as was previously the case with the stopover.  We need, by means of a national aviation policy, to encourage airlines to provide for that.  We also need key hub connectivity through the airport, especially in this post-Brexit era.  We have connectivity to Heathrow, which is very welcome, but prior to the pandemic it was planned to have connectivity to Paris.  There was also a Lufthansa service to Frankfurt but this is not back on track yet.  I know Government has given money directly to airlines to fly and to re-establish routes, which is very welcome.  I hope that will happen but we really do need a fair slice of the cake to enable airports outside of Dublin to take the pressure off Dublin Airport.  It cannot all be about one really dominant airport.  We need to spread it out.  National aviation policy should be brought in line with key Government policies like Project Ireland 2040.  The aviation policy is in total variance with that.  It is also at variance with the regional economic strategies, which the Minister of State will be familiar with.  We need to recognise airports like Shannon Airport as economic drivers.</p> <p>  In some ways, the airports are like the post offices, which the Minister of State is after sorting out.  They should be looked at in that way.  They are more than just airports.  They are of regional importance.  They are also of importance to the country in providing a counterbalance to Dublin.  The events in Dublin over recent days tell us that everything is being funnelled through Dublin because of existing policy, which needs to be amended.  Deputy Shanahan mentioned the need to amend national aviation policy as well.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Donnell will also do so.  The Minister has confirmed to me on the floor of the D&aacute;il that he is committed to reviewing aviation policy.  When will that happen?  For me, it cannot happen quickly enough.  It must also involve consultation with stakeholders in the regions and throughout Ireland.  This could result in a win-win for everyone.  We can have a sustainable network of airports which all have specialties.  I was talking about Shannon Airport and American transatlantic traffic.  The airport could major in that.  There could be something for Cork, Knock and Waterford as well.  We need to cut up that cake in a more equitable way so that we all benefit.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge Ms Jenny O'Hora from the Department.  She was instrumental in leading on this matter and getting this package over the line.  With regard to aviation, regional connectivity is absolutely critical.  I am from Galway and use Shannon Airport regularly.  It is great to walk through the baggage control having all your liquids.  You do not have to take anything out of your bag, not even your laptop or phone.  It is a very swift and easy route to travel.  As the Deputy will know, we included Shannon Airport in the regional airports programme because of the Covid pandemic and the concern I had to ensure that Shannon, and Cork for that matter, would be in a position to rebound coming out of the pandemic.  That is why they were included in the regional airports programme for the first time.  There is also a marketing fund available for the Shannon Group, which was also doing a really good job before the Covid pandemic.</p><p>With Ms Mary Considine, the CEO, and the new chair, Mr. Conal Henry, the group has a dynamic team who are up for driving more connectivity to the mid-west.  I do not need to convince the Deputy about the importance of this.</p><p> Airlines will choose where they want to go in the market.  The review of the national aviation policy started in 2020 just before the pandemic.  A pause was put on the review and rightly so because we had to deal with the pandemic.  The thinking, which was correct, was that we needed to wait until the pandemic ended to see how aviation would settle, what the travel patterns would be and whether people would travel for business again.  The census will also feed into the review.  We will resume the review this year and it will involve a large amount of consultation.</p></speech>

I understand that, to qualify for the programme, an airport must have fewer than 3 million passengers to be in compliance with EU state aid rules.  This year is the first year that Shannon was ever in the programme, which is welcome.  Shannon has not reached 3 million passengers in a long time.  Will the Minister of State assure me that it will continue receiving this critical revenue until such time as it reaches at least 3 million passengers?  She is the Minister of State who allocated the money and she can see the good use that it has been put to, for example, installing important security equipment, baggage haulage facilities and so on that make it easier to get through the airport.  The public might not see all of that, but significant amounts of money have been invested in Shannon, much of it directly by the Shannon Group.  For the first time, we are receiving money under the regional airports programme.  It is being put to good use.  We are in competition with the likes of Dublin, so it is not an even playing field.  Surely we should be included in the airports programme going forward.</p></speech>

Shannon Airport is critical for the mid-west.  I am constantly reviewing this matter.  Shannon meets the criteria for the regional airports programme - it has scheduled flights and its passenger numbers are what they have been for two years in a row.  We must ensure that we maintain Shannon Airport and that it thrives and develops as we come out of the pandemic.  In 2021, &euro;22.4 million went to Shannon Airport in current capital funding under the regional airports programme and the Covid supplementary support scheme, which allowed the airport to negotiate with airlines directly and to do the business it does best.  It was not just a case of the Government giving money.  The regional airports are commercial entities and they, including Shannon, were functioning well before Covid.  The funding went to them to increase their connectivity.  Under the regional airports programme, Shannon has received &euro;4.3 million in capital allocations this year.</p> <p>  I am committed to ensuring that Shannon is supported as we leave the pandemic.  We are not out of it fully yet.  Passenger numbers are increasing in Dublin Airport, as they are in Shannon Airport, but we are constantly examining this matter in order to ensure that Shannon is getting the supports it needs for aviation and connectivity.  I am from the west, so I understand the situation well and know the importance of having the airport for foreign direct investment, tourism and so on in the region.  I am preaching to the converted.</p></speech>

If Shannon continued to have access to the vital funding stream of the regional airport programme next year and the year after until such time as we reached 3 million passengers, we in the Shannon region would broadly welcome that.

Regarding the interdepartmental report on Government supports, what was the main emphasis in terms of the post office network's future?</p></speech>

Under the Government's digital strategy, 90% of services are to be provided online.  That leaves 10% that could be offered offline.  We need to undertake a larger body of work to identify those services.  An Post would be in a position to bid for services, be they online or offline.</p> <p>  There are two strands to this.  First, there is an all-of-Government approach to identifying the offline services, bearing in mind the digital strategy.  Second, An Post could bid for services as part of its mandate to ensure that we have a thriving post office network across the country.</p></speech>

In other words, it will not be because of economic reasons.  As such, a viable post office will be on offer to someone else who might be interested in taking up that position.</p><p>The issue throughout the country was that in many cases where postmasters decided they were going to retire for whatever reason, nobody came in to replace the postmaster in a particular town or village.  This financial package ensures that where that happens, and if somebody wants to retire for personal reasons that is fine, the position will be advertised and somebody can potentially come in and take over that post office.</p></speech>

When a post office is threatened with closure, its future is not just a Government activity.

There will be incentives for providing more services, be they banking or whatever, working with An Post on the provision of these services.  An Post is providing training to postmasters.  It is also its role to identify and work with postmasters on the provision of extra services.  There is also a call on members of the public to use their local post office.  If they want a viable post office network, they should ensure they go out and support their local post office.  This is-----</p></speech>

The public - an gn&aacute;th duine, the citizen, and all of us living in our communities - are not thinking about or using our post office network in sufficient numbers.  How do we make the public - men, women and children - use it?  I remember going to school when we had post office stamps, which helped us to save.  We then had TSB Bank staff come into schools.  Have we lost our way a little in terms of the public and the citizen?  How do we attract them to come in?  In fairness, the postmasters have been extraordinarily strong advocates of the post office network yet the people are voting with their feet, which is little unfair because the post office network is a fantastic service delivering a multiplicity of services, as we know.</p></speech>

We have a role to play in saying members of the public need to use their local post office and getting that message out there.  I have attended public meetings where people were outraged that their local post office was closing but, when we go through the numbers, the footfall is just not there in some post offices.  We have a role to play, as does An Post.  This is part of the modernisation of our post office network.  An Post representatives will come before the committee in the next few weeks, as will the postmasters working with them, regarding those extra services that will hit every age group in society, be it for banking or local services, and will attract people and communities to using the local post office in their towns and villages.</p> <p>  There is a body of work to do.  I agree with the Senator on that.  This is a role for postmasters and An Post.  This financial package is giving them time to ramp up the level of service, and the awareness in our towns and villages, and help them modernise the post office service throughout the country.</p></speech>

I have often thought about this.  I have followed our committee's work and I appreciate the major effort the Minister of State has made to engage with An Post for which she deserves huge credit.  Her last comment concerned getting the public to use the post office network.  Should the Government consider a citizens' assembly to discuss the future of the post office network and how we can get the public to use our post offices?</p></speech>

An Post has a strong role in that.  It is focused on the modernisation of the network.  It has done a significant amount of work over the past number of years on turning it around.  This is a very important and pivotal moment for the post office network.  It is down to the company, An Post, working with postmasters and the Government to identify services, especially banking.  Let us be innovative and creative.  This is the time to do it but fundamentally this is a commercial entity and a semi-State body.  It is up to An Post, working with the IPU and the Government, to identify services that will make the network attractive for people to use.</p></speech>

An interdepartmental group was set up to examine the feasibility of government services being moved over to the post office network.  There was also an announcement today.  I believe we need a citizens' assembly to discuss the future of the post office network because it is not just Ireland that is having difficulties with its post office network and the delivery or use of postal services.</p> <p>  I will digress, with the Chairman's permission, by returning to the issue of aviation in the short time left to me.  I will remind the Minister of State, members of the committee and those watching that Cork Airport is the second airport in the country.  It had 2.8 million passengers pre-pandemic.  I support Deputy Carey's call, which is a call I have made, that the regional airports programme, notwithstanding the European Union state aid rules, must be retained for Cork and Shannon airports to incentivise marketing and route delivery.  If it is not, we will have worse chaos than we had last weekend.</p></speech>

I am on the record in stating the importance of having that regional connectivity.  As the Senator knows, we funded part of the new runway at Cork Airport.  I was honoured to officially open it.  It is critical we maintain our existing airport network, which was what I was focused on during the pandemic.  We now need to keep reviewing this constantly to ensure our airports have the necessary supports in place to increase connectivity, not only regional but international connectivity, as Cork and Shannon airports do.  I am very much focused on this issue and on ensuring we have a strong aviation sector.  We work with our airports but it is up to them to negotiate directly with airlines.  It is important to state they are commercial entities.  Cork Airport is exemplary in attracting-----</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister of State has to wear the Ireland hat, despite the fact she is, like Deputy Carey, probably coming from the perspective of the west, as is the Chair, which is fair enough.  Has the Minister of State, the Minister or the Government sat down with the airlines, to which we gave money for route incentivisation?  This afternoon, Mr. Dalton Philips informed us in his presentation and under questioning, that the money, some &euro;97 million, went to the airlines for route development.  Some 85% of air traffic passengers are using Dublin Airport.  There is now a duty on the Minister of State or the Minister, or both together.  The Taoiseach is from Cork, as is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  We have three Cabinet Ministers from Cork and if they cannot deliver balanced regional aviation development, then God knows where we are going.  There is a need for the Government to sit down with the airlines to say how we can distribute the 85% of passengers going through Dublin Airport between Cork and Shannon in a way that makes Dublin Airport less congested than it was last weekend.</p></speech>

Surely the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the Minister for Transport, the Minster of State or someone sat down with Aer Lingus and said "Hang on a second.  Aer Lingus has not resumed a number of flights, for example, out of Cork".  Has it been asked why?  Will those flights come back?</p><p>Emerald Airlines is taking over some of the short-haul flights.  What is its policy?  What is its mission statement now in respect of the short-haul flights in Europe?  I appreciate that the Department cannot do everything - I am not trying to suggest otherwise - but the Government can proceed on behalf of the people.  We have Project Ireland 2040, of which we are all supportive because it is about regional development, but if everybody who lands in Ireland lands in Dublin Airport and if suddenly things are going nowhere other than Dublin, we will not benefit from the increase in passenger numbers as we should.</p></speech>

Cork Airport received over &euro;22 million last year in a range of supports.  That included the regional airports programme and the Covid supports.  Airlines make their own commercial decisions as to where they will go.  It is up to the airports to deal directly with them.  I take the points raised earlier about regional connectivity and having balance in respect of our airlines, but we need to be careful as a Government.  The airlines would be the first to tell us that they make their own commercial decisions as to where they will fly.  The national aviation policy, as I said to Deputy Carey earlier, was under review in 2020.  The pandemic put a hold on that.  We will resume that review at the end of this year.  I know that these issues are very important, but regional connectivity is of critical importance, from my point of view.  That is why unprecedented funding was given to our regional airports in particular over the past two years.  I will continue to review this constantly in order to see what else we can do to ensure we have that connectivity.</p></speech>

I thank her for that.  Dalton Philips said today that the airports were losing &euro;1 million a day.  My point is that the Government, like the Government before it, is all about regional development and the regions.  If, however, in the context of aviation, everything centres on Dublin, we are really at nothing.  That is why I am concerned.  I hope and I ask the Minister of State - Chairman, you might take up this point again later - that our committee is involved as part of the review of the national aviation policy.  I am not sure how the Minister of State will do this or what her proposal in respect of that review is, but it is critical not only that airlines are sat down with and spoken to about their plans and the need for that regional connectivity, as the Minister of State said, but also that we look at the tourism bodies and how they interact in respect of promotion of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East or whatever else.  It is critical that the future of our airports and our aviation sector not be just about Dublin Airport.  I know that that is not the Minister of State's aim, but it needs to be said to the airlines as part of the review.</p> <p>  Finally, I thank the Minister of State for being here and for her engagement, in particular on An Post, which has been very positive.  I thank her for her work and wish her well in her endeavours.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  I very much welcome the &euro;10 million for An Post.  Nothing is more locally based than An Post.  There is a post office in Caherconlish, a rural village in my constituency, on the outskirts of Limerick.  It is having difficulty securing a successor to Kitsy Hickey, who has been the postmistress there for over 40 years.  Her predecessor was there for nearly 60 years.  Between them they have done nearly a century.  The position has been re-advertised by An Post.  I very much welcome that this funding has come forward and that Kitsy Hickey is staying on for an additional month to enable us to secure a postmaster for Caherconlish village.  It is in that context I welcome the funding.  I have just a few brief questions.  When will the &euro;10 million come into being?  What will be the process for people to draw it down?  There was a pandemic support payment.  The Minister of State made reference to it in her speech.  Was it for &euro;8 million?  Was that provided by the State to An Post?</p></speech>

The postmasters must give six months' notice to An Post if they decide to retire.  Many of them will want to make a decision at the end of June.  It is extremely important that the Department give some outline as to how the scheme will work and, generally, the level of payments that will be involved.  The last thing we want is for there to be any degree of uncertainty as to how much they will get.  There may be postmasters deciding to relinquish their positions at the end of June and they will go for the safe bet of retirement.  That is not what we want.  I know this is a really tall ask, but I ask that a serious body of work be done between now and the end of the month to give a general outline.</p><p>I am not expecting it to be the finer detail but, generally, the postmasters would be aware of the level of support they get from the State.  I know it is a tall ask but they have to give six months' notice and 30 June is the date.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with that.  It is very important so we might follow up on that.  Overall, it is a very good news story.</p><p> It is important that people would understand that the &euro;8.5 million is over 18 months and the &euro;10 million is over 12 months.  I cannot say enough for the post office network.  I remember many years ago hearing a certain businessman speaking about setting up a business in Ireland and he said the network is where the cost is.  We have to harness An Post as a community service with its network.  There are several points.  When the driving licence comes up for renewal, could An Post tender for that?  We have to find other elements and have a national perspective to bolster what it does.  It has gone into banking and I believe there is huge scope to promote this area.</p><p> The committee might follow up with the Minister of State to get some flesh on the bones prior to the end of June.  I suspect the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and its members will be very interested in that, particularly given the pandemic payment has been a huge factor with them in terms of support.  I very much welcome that and commend the Minister of State on the great work she has done in this regard.</p><p> It would be remiss of me, given Deputy Naughton&rsquo;s role as Minister of State with responsibility for aviation and international travel, not to make reference to our meeting with the DAA today.  I do not know if she has had the opportunity to watch it.</p></speech>

There are a number of factors and we would ask the Minister of State to follow up on that.  If the weather is bad, there can be people queueing outside T1 and T2 in the rain, which is unacceptable for us as a committee.  We ask the Minister of State to follow-up.  We made it quite clear to Dalton Philips, the CEO, and his colleagues in the management team that that cannot take place.  It is unacceptable in this day and age that people need to do that.</p> <p>  Second, those in the DAA appear to have very little wriggle room in terms of the available manpower.  They were given additional manpower of 40 people but 30 of those will be trainees, three are coming from Cork and seven are part of an internal reallocation.  They were down 37 during the weekend, with 17 of those due to a monumental management cock-up with regard to trainees who were not certified but who were included in the roster, and there were 20 absentees on the Sunday.  To get through this weekend is very important.  There are many things that we welcome.  They are opening a lot more lanes and there will be 12 lanes at peak times, and they have the 40 staff.  However, they do not appear to have any contingency in terms of staff on call, which is a worry for the committee.</p> <p>  The rain is a huge factor and it needs to be quickly nailed down.  They need to find some way to ensure that if it is raining, people are inside.  It is not acceptable that people are outside.  We ask that when people are queueing, they would give out water and look after people with food, which was not happening last weekend.</p> <p>  We ask the Minister of State to keep a serious eye on what is happening.  We have said to them that we will look to bring them back in again by the end of June.  They expect that, by that time, they will have all of the 167 additional security checkers in place for the summer schedule.  It is very regrettable what happened last weekend.  We can talk about this all we want but the bottom line is that there was a cock-up in the rostering and that was a management failure, pure and simple.  It should not have happened.  There will be absentees.  Our only concern is that there is very little headroom in terms of staff.  If they get fair weather and the 40 are there, it looks like they will get through with a pinch, but it is something that we need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>  I assume the State stands ready so that if there is a need for further supports in any form and things happen over the next couple days, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Government stand ready to provide support.  I do not believe it is tolerable for any member or any customer, and the general public will not put up with what happened last week if there is a repeat of it this weekend.   Whatever needs to be done will have to be done.  Is the Minister of State committed to that area?</p></speech>

I have had daily meetings with the DAA and I met with the chair of the DAA and with the SIPTU trade union because I know staff are under huge pressure there at the moment.  I agree with the Chairman in regard to ensuring that passengers are not outside in the rain and that cover has to be provided for them, and I am categoric on that.  Yes, those in the DAA are under pressure with staffing, particularly security staffing, which requires experience, specialised training and expertise in that area.  What they really need to do is communicate with the public and reassure the travelling public that people will be able to make their flights safely and with ease of access.  There may be some queueing but people will be moved through as quickly as possible.  For anything they need to do now, they need to start doing it in order to ramp up their resources.  If that means going out to a private company to help them with managing queues and to relieve their own staff on those duties, that needs to be done.</p></speech>

All going well, it will be okay at the weekend.  People will be queueing but, hopefully, not for an inordinate length of time and they will get their flights.  However, if there is any question at all that this is running into serious trouble very early or at any stage, passengers and the general public will not accept anything like what happened last weekend.  It is unacceptable on every level.  It is very important that the Ministers keep a watching brief and whatever supports are required at any moment in time, the State must provide that support.</p></speech>

This plan has to work this weekend and I will be monitoring and watching this acutely.  Passengers will be the first to say whether they have confidence in this plan or not, so this has to work this weekend.  I will be in daily contact with them.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and her official, Ms O&rsquo;Hora.  As I mentioned, the joint committee will be meeting An Post on 15 June and we will be closely monitoring progress in regard to the An Post network.  We will follow up with the Minister of State to get some outline of what is due to be in place by the end of June.  It is critical to ensure we do not have people retiring because we need to maintain the postmasters.</p> <p>  The next meeting of the joint committee will be in private session on Microsoft Teams at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 June.</p></speech>
