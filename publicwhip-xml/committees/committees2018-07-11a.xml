As we have a quorum, I wish to call the meeting to order.  I remind members to turn off their phones as they interfere with the sound system and with broadcasting.  I have received apologies from Senator Paul Daly, for whom Senator Horkan is attending as a substitute.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the election of a Chairman.  There are no provisions in Standing Orders that require a nominee to be seconded.  I call on members to make nominations.</p></speech>

It is an honour to be elected Chairman of this important committee.  The work we will do over the next few months will have a huge influence on Ireland's future and it could also mean that we will show world leadership in the area of climate action.  I take this opportunity to commiserate with my colleauge Deputy Timmy Dooley, who was a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment with me.  We have worked very well together in the past and I know we will do so again.  I look forward to working with all members in a very open and collaborative manner.  I commend the work of the Citizens' Assembly because it is because of it that we are here today as a special committee to consider its work under the great chairmanship of former Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  We will recommend in our report at the end of our work whatever actions we, as a committee, consider appropriate.</p></speech>

It is important that we mark the work of Stop Climate Chaos, which is a coalition of environmental NGOs.  Following the Citizens' Assembly's report, Stop Climate Chaos wrote to the D&aacute;il Business Committee asking that the D&aacute;il follow up on it.  The Business Committee referred the matter to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, of which the Chairman and I are members.  Deputies Dooley, Stanley, the Chairman and I have worked well together on that committee, so I am confident now.</p> <p>  When the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment was asked to consider this matter by the Business Committee, we realised that we did not have the scope or strength to take on what needed to be done.  That is why this committee has been established.  We have done some preparatory work at the relevant Oireachtas committee, but we now have a major opportunity to make this Oireachtas work and to follow on from some of the experience of recent committees, particularly the repeal committee, which followed on from a Citizens' Assembly recommendation, in doing a similar scale and importance of work.  We should recognise the role of Stop Climate Chaos and the Environmental Pillar in helping to initiate the establishment of this committee.</p></speech>

In view of the short time available to us before the final report is to be produced, the committee needs to have a focused work programme that is both targeted and realistic.  The work should result in meaningful recommendations that can be monitored and achieved over time.  The Citizens' Assembly report contains all of the relevant evidence.  As with the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, there is little value in trying to duplicate the assembly's work.  Therefore, it is proposed that the committee should not actively seek submissions from the public and should seek expert opinion only where the committee agrees to that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

That will all be covered in what we are about to discuss, namely, a terms of reference group.  We can change the date; I am in members' hands in that regard.  Is it agreed that we only seek experts where the committee agrees to do so?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Regarding the structure of the committee's work programme, a modular approach is proposed.  In light of the short timeline and the imminent summer recess, it is proposed that we agree a format at today's meeting for the first two modules of our meetings: setting out the context and background; and the departmental Secretaries General.  The proposed modular approach to our meetings will be based on the structure that I am about to outline.</p> <p>  I propose that module 1 comprise two meetings.  First, we will seek an overview from the chair of the Citizens' Assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, on its report and ask her to highlight any gap in the report that the assembly may be aware of.  Inviting the chair of the assembly to present this overview is a recognition that the key provision of the special committee's orders of reference is to consider the third report and recommendations of the assembly.  Inviting the chairperson of the assembly to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment on the Constitution proved especially valuable, as she identified specific areas that the assembly's report on the eighth amendment did not cover.  Doing so informed that committee's work programme significantly.</p> <p>  Second, I propose that we seek overview statements from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council, Professor John FitzGerald, Professor Alan Barrett of the ESRI, and the Environmental Pillar.  The ESRI's statement would be of particular significance, given the emphasis placed on climate change at the national economic dialogue.</p> <p>  Turning to module 2,-----</p></speech>

Secretaries General can also inform us as to how the recommendations of the assembly can inform changes to those plans.</p> <p>  It is proposed that, over several meetings, we will engage with the Secretaries General and senior officials of seven Departments to examine their sectoral mitigation plans and adaptation plans and consider how the recommendations of the assembly can inform changes to those plans.</p> <p>  It is proposed that the meetings of modules 1 and 2 will be as follows.

I will go through my opening statement briskly in order to deal with the select committee's questions and comments.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware of the objectives I have set for the medium term in terms of future budgetary choices, ensuring steady growth in living standards, how we can rebuild budgetary capacity, the need to be careful in spending choices, the need to avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies and ensuring budgetary policy will focus on ensuring fiscal safety.  Colleagues will be aware of where the economy stands in terms of growth forecast for this year and next.  I expect that in the year after next, all things being equal, we will see a growth rate that will move more into line with the potential growth rate of the economy, rather than the heightened figures we have seen recently.  </p> <p>  The committee will be aware of where we stand on employment.  The unemployment figure in June was 5.1%.  The figure for those unemployed for more than one year fell from 200,000 in 2012 to 50,000 in the first quarter of 2018.  We potentially face new challenges as the economy moves towards full employment this year.  As we approach that point, we have seen more gradual improvements in living standards, rather than an all or nothing approach which characterised some choices in the past.  Because of this, I want to be careful to ensure our policies can be consistent in coming years.  I have laid out my views on how that can be done in the summer economic statement. </p> <p>  This year, to date, has seen very positive Exchequer returns.  They have increased by 5.4% cent year on year, which is ahead of target.  I am confident that we are well positioned to achieve the overall annual tax target of &euro;54.2 billion for 2018.  Against this, I plan to broadly balance the books by running a very small deficit next year of 0.1% of GDP.  The main driver of this is the plan to increase capital spending substantially in 2019, bringing capital expenditure to in excess of &euro;7 billion, an increase of one quarter on the figure for this year.  I will not put in place any taxation or spending measure that will result in a deficit of larger than 0.1%.  If that is accepted, it will accommodate a budgetary package of &euro;3.4 billion, of which &euro;2.6 billion has been pre-committed to expenditure measures, leaving &euro;800 million for further allocation.  Any unfunded taxation or expenditure measures that go beyond this figure will necessarily involve even more borrowing and result in a subsequent increase in the deficit position.  If that deficit position worsens, it will mean borrowing more and spending money we are not raising within the country.  </p> <p>  There are choices which are open but which I will not pursue.  For instance, targeting minimum compliance with the expenditure benchmark allows an additional figure of &euro;900 million, but it would increase the deficit by 0.3%.  If the rainy day fund was also used instead to increase expenditure by the same amount, it would be a further deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  If both were pursued, it would increase the deficit from 0.1% of GDP to 0.6%.  That would be highly inappropriate at this stage of the cycle and ensure we were in breach of the fiscal rules as we would miss our medium-term objectives next year.</p> <p>  I will refer to why I believe we need to take a different point of view now on the fiscal rules.  We need to avoid the adoption of pro-cyclical policies.  Our debt is still high; external risks are beginning to develop and I want to use a different approach by moving away from fiscal space into the approach of a budgetary stance.  The approach to public expenditure I want to take next year is to take care regarding pre-committing to large increases in expenditure.  We have many demands in place on the budgetary framework, not all of which I will be able to meet fully.  If expenditure continues to exceed revenue and we are still borrowing to meet the shortfall, even if more resources are allocated, the deficit will be even larger and our debt will increase.  From our current economic position, borrowing to meet a higher rate of Government expenditure could create further risks.  </p> <p>  In the medium term I have outlined the capital framework I propose to follow in terms of Project Ireland 2040.  It is looking to increase capital expenditure and integrate it within a better planning framework.</p><p>In addition, I indicated during oral parliamentary questions this morning - I will say the same again this afternoon - that what I would do as part of budget 2019 was publish a longer term budgetary framework than I had to date.  My economic forecasts have been for a two to three-year window.  What I will do - I have asked my Department to begin the work on it - is publish a five-year outlook for what we think will happen in the economy in order that all parties will have information on choices that will be open to me on budget day and beyond.</p><p> On other developments in expenditure, I will be publishing, as I did last year, papers on the comprehensive spending review which I can debate with the committee at another point.  They will lay out observations we have agreed on 40 areas of Government expenditure.  One of the reasons it is important is, with the &euro;60 billion we spend in any given year, the focus is always on the increment in terms of what more we will spend, but we need to be aware of efficiencies and opportunities to do better with what we are spending.  I am also very much aware from a revenue point of view that we need to ensure any commitment we make regarding spending in the future is based on revenue we are confident we can continue to collect.</p><p> While the latest economic data point to an economy with very considerable momentum, a continuation of robust growth in the future cannot be taken for granted, given the increasingly uncertain external environment.  The United Kingdom's imminent exit from the European Union, changes to the international corporate tax landscape and the possibility of disruptions to the global trading system are just some of the risks we face.  More generally, it is important to consider that the reasonably favourable external conditions we faced in recent years were just another wave of - to quote the American economist Paul Krugman - a great moderation.  If these conditions were to deteriorate in the coming years, what would the impact be on the economy?  It is for that reason I want to take a careful approach to where we are with the deficit and establish a rainy day fund.  If expenditure or tax commitments move beyond the budgetary framework I have outlined, we will have to be able to establish how it will be paid for.  </p><p> To end on a positive note, while there are risks, I continue to believe there are great opportunities.  Clearly, there are important things we have to deliver at home, but there are also opportunities for Irish companies and the economy abroad.  As I have always said, economic growth is a means to an end, not always an end in itself.  It enables us to pursue our goals and what we want to do in our society in terms of how we can promote inclusivity and continue to improve public services, all of which have the objective of trying to deliver better living standards and a better society in our republic.</p></speech>

I thank him for abbreviating the opening statement.  I will pick up on one point he mentioned, which he also mentioned in answer to oral questions.  </p> <p>  On forecasting, in the budget the Minister will project over a five-year period, to 2023.  Is that right?  There will be fiscal and economic projections which will encompass the full suite of measures, including growth, unemployment, debt, deficit expenditure, tax and so on.</p></speech>

It will be a five-year framework to 2023.  There are a number of reasons I want to do this, one of which is there has been commentary from the committee on how we could have a longer horizon for planning.  I am also increasingly conscious that the IMF will put forecasts in place up to 2023 and we should also be able to do so.  They will be our economic forecasts of what we believe the budgetary outlook will be each year.  What I will not be doing within them is making choices for how resources should be allocated between tax or expenditure or anything like it.  They will just be what we believe the outlook is and beyond a certain point, all other things being equal, where the economy will stack up and what the impact will be on based on the different financial indicators.</p></speech>

If it can be quick-fire, over and back, I will be happy to deal with it in that way.  </p> <p>  In terms of the fiscal stance next year, the Minister set out in his opening statement that if he had made the choice to spend the extra &euro;900 million within the expenditure benchmark, as well as the figure of &euro;500 million, the headline deficit would be 0.6% and the structural deficit, 0.9%.

The particular impact on the structural deficit was due to the impact on contract manufacturing in a quarter.  I cannot answer the question about whether I am anticipating another change later.  The figures from the Central Statistics Office are shared a little with me before they are shared with anybody else.  At this time it is difficult for me to give an indication as to whether another surge is likely.</p></speech>

The three he identified were Brexit, changes to the international corporate tax landscape and possible disruptions to the global trading system.  From his perspective as Minister for Finance and the overall guardian of the economy, does he regard them as the top three risks we face as a country?  We are all aware of the risk matrix, the stability programme update and so on, but are they three risks that may result in the headwinds we could be facing?</p></speech>

There are additional things internally that are of concern to me such as ensuring I do all I can to make sure prices and wages continue to grow at a moderate level and try to make progress on the issue of how we can deliver more homes and better schools without it generating inflationary pressures within the economy.  More generally, even though the economy is growing quickly and was growing particularly quickly in the first half of this year, the rate of expectation of what I might be able to do next year is always growing at a quicker pace.  When I finish the summer, there will be an array of demands on the Exchequer and how we manage them, while trying to maintain the budgetary outlook about which I have talked, is always a risk.</p> <p>  I will address one question I could not answer when it was asked about the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>The total allocation for 2018 is &euro;1.6 billion moving to &euro;2.03 billion in 2019.  Specific funding within this allocation is set aside for the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness in the amount of &euro;325 million this year, rising to &euro;400 million in 2019.</p></speech>

Does the Minister not believe the greatest challenges facing us now from a social and economic point of view include, at the top of the list, housing?  This is now a severe crisis that is making it impossible for people to live here, especially young people.  In consequence, we have to significantly ramp up from the level where we are to make it affordable and possible for people to live here.  The same applies in areas like education, water infrastructure and public transport.  There is talk about the fear of overheating and the need for caution but all these areas are suffering major deficits in investment.  Does the Minister not believe we need radical increases in levels of investment in these areas?  Otherwise, we are actually going to exacerbate the overheating measures because we will not have sufficient people here.  We are now talking about labour shortages.  We must ask ourselves how we are to resolve labour shortages.  It seems to me we can only resolve labour shortages if we educate far more young people to do the jobs that need to be done, get people back into this country and prevent them leaving.</p> <p>  We are in something of a vicious circle in that sense.  At the heart of resolving the vicious circle is the question of housing.  It is not simply a matter of absolute supply, although we must have that too, but the supply of affordable housing.  Does it concern the Minister that the last time the supply of housing increased, price went up as well and it led us into a big crash?  There are real signs that could be happening again.  We need a far greater supply and we must have a plan for that but, crucially, that supply cannot remain unaffordable.  We cannot have a situation where supply increases but price increases with it.  Otherwise we will simply be doing what we did the last time.  Does the Minister recognise that as a problem?  Does the Minister fear that we could be about to repeat the mistakes of the past?</p></speech>

At the same time, as the Deputy said, we are already experiencing the so-called capacity constraints in some parts of our economy.  That is code for not being able to get people to do the work in sufficient numbers or not being able to reach agreement on the price at which a project should go ahead.  It is a concern regarding how we manage this in future.</p> <p>  We need more homes in particular and we have to find a balance for delivering more homes without, at the same time, kicking off an inflationary trend within the economy because of two things.  The first would be if houses were at a price that kicks off the spiral to which the Deputy referred.  The second would arise if, in our efforts to build more homes, we find out that we do not have the people available to do it.  That, in turn, creates another inflationary spiral within the economy.</p> <p>  How are we going to manage it?  There are two ways.  I am outlining the difficulties Deputy Boyd Barrett has touched on.  This is why the rules of the Central Bank on macro-prudential lending overall are really important.  What is different for our economy now is that we do not have the same levels of credit within the economy as we did the last time.  That is one important point of difference.  Even if we were to see a change in the property market in future, since we do not have that quantity of credit the situation does not offer the kind of doom loop we had in the past.  We need to stand by those rules.  The second point is that we have to look at measures to try to move capital and workers better around the economy.  Deputy Boyd Barrett recognised this at the time.  The taxation measures we put in place in commercial property were not only about trying to get a yield; they were also an attempt to make an effort to shift economic activity into houses.  We need more houses.  The third point relates to how we increase capital expenditure.  We are increasing capital expenditure by a quarter next year with an additional &euro;1.5 billion into the economy.  It is not clear to me at the moment that were we to go significantly beyond that next year with an Exchequer contribution, that we would be able to translate it into more construction and economic activity at a price that we could all afford.  It is not clear to me that we could do that.  This is why it is important that we pace increases in capital expenditure in a way that we are confident will not create further risk or lead to problems in the supply of more homes or investment in higher education.</p></speech>

Every publically-built house that remains in public ownership requires an initial capital cost but then revenue starts to come back.  In other words, that revenue replaces current expenditure, which is now going out in housing assistance payments or rental accommodation scheme payments, with a capital expenditure that is once-off and then brings back revenue.  If the Minister is concerned about excessive spending, why does he not significantly ramp up in this regard, with the intention of eliminating spending on social housing that will continue to escalate as current expenditure?  The majority of the Rebuilding Ireland plan, even with the somewhat increased plans for public housing, remains dependent on major levels of current expenditure going out in the form of RAS and HAP.  That represents a drain on the public finances.  Why does the Minister not radically shift on that?  I am asking not only from a public housing or social point of view but from a financial point of view.  Is it not better to start to eliminate or phase out massive annual expenditure going out to the private sector in favour of having a far greater stock of public housing?</p></speech>

It is not that I am for any reason against additional expenditure.  I have overseen expenditure move ahead over the past two years as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My key point is that if we have expenditure that goes beyond a certain level, then we must have additional taxation plans to be able to pay for it.  Of course, if that is paid for out of additional taxation within the economy, that intervention should be neutral.  This is because what we are getting in additional expenditure we are paying for through higher taxation.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the mix between current and capital spending at the moment in our involvement in the housing market.  Over time, I want to see our current expenditure in these programmes go down as people go into public housing that is provided by the State.  I want to see that change for many of the reasons that Deputy Boyd Barrett has outlined.  However, if we did not make available current levels of expenditure for HAP or RAS payments, then our housing difficulties would be even more acute.  In those circumstances I imagine the Deputy would be calling for me to bring in such programmes.</p></speech>

That is a legitimate policy choice that he can advocate.  Will he, however, give me an example of anyone - an economist because he frequently quotes economists, the Commission and other agencies to me - who would say that with debt as high as we have, with an economy moving to full employment, with growth as high as it is and with the capacity constraints we have in our economy, that we should borrow more?</p></speech>

The major domestic risk of shock to the economy is the issue of housing.  It is nice sitting in here in a cosy chamber but when interest rates are below 1% and the fiscal rules allow us to carry out an additional level of borrowing, I would tell the people in emergency accommodation today that I would borrow.  I would borrow to invest in building houses for those people and their families in emergency accommodation, to invest in the education system to ensure we do not slip any further down the international rankings and to ensure we strengthen the foundations of our economy.  I would borrow to deal with the level of investment the Minister's Government refused to do, as did the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, which resulted in a decade of lost investment.  </p></speech>

I represent the people who want more housing, whether that is public housing or more affordable housing.  I represent those citizens as much as does the Deputy.  I have as much engagement with them as he does.  I did not ask the Deputy if he wanted to increase borrowing more because I know that - he does.  Out of all the agencies and economists he has regularly quoted to me, I asked him for any backup or evidence of anybody supporting the view that we should be borrowing more at a time of near full employment and with the capacity constraints we have.  I did not ask for his view, I asked for anybody who would support such a strategy.</p></speech>

How will it impact on the fiscal space or budgetary stance the Minister has outlined with discretionary amounts of &euro;800 million?

A form of additional funding will be needed for the Department of Health at some point this year.  That has been the case in previous years and I will have to work on that later in the year.  On whether that can be done in such a way so as to not impact on the budgetary parameters for next year, that is what I am aiming to do.  I have work to do on that and I anticipate it will take me through until September.  On the degree of wasteful spending, I have had much engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health on this matter and a key factor is that a massive number of additional people have now joined the HSE and our health service over the last 12 months.  Up to the end of April this year, just under 400 additional workers were recruited every month.</p></speech>

The Minister has changed some of the words this year, but he is giving us the same old tune, particularly regarding tax expenditures.  Is it still the Minister's intention to cut income tax significantly?  A figure of &euro;266 million was thrown around at one stage.  Do I detect tension between the Minister and the Taoiseach in that area?  Given his ideological positioning of the Minister's party, it seems the Taoiseach would like to see a major tax giveaway and the Minister and his Department are trying to hold the line against this.</p> <p>  To broaden that out, as reflected in the discussion with Deputy Doherty, it seems to be a no-change scenario.  For example, the Minister talked about stable and predictable tax revenue, expanding the tax base and so on, but there is no evidence of any thought about that.  We have large tax expenditures in the area of research and development and so on.  Will the Minister quantify our current tax expenditure?  What is the total tax expenditure and what kind of redistribution of that expenditure is possible?  Could the Minister ease our budgetary pressure by allocating it somewhere else?</p> <p>  When I was questioning him about crime this morning I intended to ask the Taoiseach about the profile of the Department of Justice and Equality, which has had a supplementary budget every year since 2004.  Is that the case?  Will there be a supplementary budget for the Department of Justice and Equality as well as for the Department of Health?  Is there some way for the Minister's Department to produce budgets that do not keep needing supplements later on? </p></speech>

The Taoiseach shares that view.  I do not have a figure on tax expenditures available to me now, but I will get it for the Deputy during the committee meeting.  Could I reallocate that tax expenditure to additional expenditure or additional investment?  My answer to that question is that I do not think there is a massive opportunity to do so.  My experience of tax expenditure to date has been that it is either delivering something in our economy that we want to deliver or it has become an integral part of how people calculate their take-home pay and disposable income at the end of a week or month.</p> <p>  On the question of supplementary budget for the Department of Justice and Equality, I cannot give any indication at the moment except that I am planning one.  I am working on that with the Department of Justice and Equality at the moment.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a budget of between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1.6 billion this year.  </p></speech>

This again seems to be an incredible ideological position.  Sometimes listening to the type of words that are used, "prudence" and so on, one could be listening to the Minister's predecessors back in the 1920s or 100 years ago.  They took a very narrow view of the new independent State's finances.  It is ultra-cautionary.  There sometimes seems to be a tension between the Minister and the Department of the Taoiseach in that regard.</p> <p>  We have had many submissions from all kinds of interest groups.  For example, we have had submissions from IBEC on entrepreneurial tax relief and so on.  How does the Department evaluate those?  Does the Minister foresee any significant tax giveaways in response to them?  The Minister has received the same submissions from the property sector and other sectors.  Most of us on the committee believe these are not worthy of consideration.  We need to run a tighter ship, but we need to be able to raise more revenue and address the great needs of our society.  </p></speech>

In response to the Deputy's third question and his somewhat odd attempt to attribute some kind of Herbert Hoover mentality to me, I point out that this year I have increased capital expenditure by &euro;800 million.  A further &euro;1.5 billion is planned for next year.  That is a 25% increase in capital expenditure for next year, which is as far from Hoover economics as one can possibly get.</p> <p>  As to the Deputy's final question about how we analyse submissions to the Department, there are two different ways in which that is done.  It is done on the advice of my officials at the end of August and into September as we frame tax choices.  It is also done through the tax strategy group, TSG, papers that we publish, which will come out at the end of the month.  In those papers, of which there are a number, we go through nearly all of the different options that different groups raise with us.  We cost them and my Department gives some top-line views on them.  Those TSG papers frequently end up being the source of budgetary submissions the following year.</p></speech>

Can we be reminded of IBEC's submission to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight concerning &euro;800 million?  I am not being antagonistic, but the Minister asked what expert groups had recommended.  While it was not necessarily borrowing, IBEC recommended that &euro;800 million of the money the Government has indicated it will not spend should be invested in higher education.

I thank the Chair.  That question is then null and void.</p> <p>  As the Minister will be aware, the committee does not take a view on the issue of equalisation between diesel and petrol.  We heard recently from representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Minister will have received representations from the association as well.  It was a very interesting discussion.  There is not yet an alternative to the pulling power of diesel for industry and farming.  Some of the evidence given by Professor Edgar Morgenroth on the 2008 changes and the reduction in car tax gave the impression that these were successful in that they led to a switch to diesel cars, as intended.</p><p>YesYes, it was successful in that there was a switch to diesel cars, which was the intention, but the saving which was abiding by the science at the time, that if one switched to diesel it was more environmentally friendly, according to the science available in 2008, was off set by the fact that people bought bigger diesel engines because the tax was cheaper.  Many people, up to this year, have opted for diesel engines thinking they were doing the right thing, but science now tells them they were not doing the right thing.  Any change must be sensitive to purchases that consumers make.</p><p>The scientific evidence at the time suggested switching to diesel was environmentally friendly.  However, the environmental benefit was offset by the decision of many people who bought diesel vehicles to opt for bigger engines because the tax was cheaper.  Many people opted for diesel engines thinking they were doing the right thing, but science now tells us they were not doing the right thing.  Any change must be sensitive to purchases consumers make.  </p><p> Professor Morgenroth referred to 300,000 Volkswagen vehicles parked in a desert in the United States.  They were returned or were unsold because Volkswagen lied to people about the emissions standards.  We learned yesterday that Nissan has done exactly the same.  We have devised policy around automotive science which has been lying to us, and we did it in the best interests of the environment.  This leads to a question for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Members of the public have followed this debate and have adapted to it by adopting measures in the belief that this is in the interests of reducing their carbon footprint.  There is a move towards equalisation because it is an environmentally good thing to do.  What does the Minister say to those who bought a diesel vehicle in 2017 or 2018 given that the value of their cars will potentially decrease?  How can that be addressed?  </p><p> Another question, which is aligned to the same point, came up in the context of electric vehicles.  Given the impressive range of incentives to switch to electric cars, has research been done to show why there has not been a significant take-up of these vehicles?  Without giving them away for free, what additional measures could be implemented to encourage people to buy electric vehicles?</p><p> The European Commission described the Government's proposals for a rainy day fund as vague.  While they are obviously still under development, will the Minister share his thoughts about how his proposals will develop?</p></speech>

Expectations of the performance of vehicles were created which turned out not to be the case.  This is a serious problem for the environment and for governments across Europe in terms of how we will respond to it, not to mention for the families and citizens who have these cars.  I have not made any decisions on taxation in response, particularly on something as sensitive as how we equalise diesel and petrol or change taxation on diesel.  No decisions have been made but any decision in that space can only be implemented gradually.  Many citizens bought diesel cars on the basis of expectations that we now know were not true.  I can only assume there has been some form of impact on the price of diesel vehicles given everything we know now.</p> <p>  In regard to the take-up of electric cars, a large suite of different options and supports is available.  In the most recent budget we made further changes to encourage greater supply and purchase of these vehicles.  One thing that will make a difference is that as the travel capacity of these vehicles begins to increase, more and more citizens and families will want to own them.  That is now happening because technological developments mean they are now capable of travelling further.</p> <p>  The European Commission's views on the rainy day fund were offered before we published legislation on how the fund will operate.  I hope, now that we have published the legislation, that the Commission's concerns about the perceived vagueness of how it will work have been addressed.</p></speech>

There is a balance to be struck when increasing expenditure.  Are there any concerns about capacity and meeting the needs to implement that policy?  Has the Minister had any discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, about capacity issues?   Much has been said about overheating the economy.  Will the Minister outline some of the ways that can be prevented, for example, by broadening the tax base or investing in capital infrastructure?</p></speech>

Much of the engagement we had in the past couple of years involved these organisations calling for increases in capital expenditure to be placed in a planning framework.  I believe the CIF now accepts we have planned significant increases in capital expenditure, and our engagement now is largely about how we can make that happen and ensure Project Ireland 2040 takes place.</p> <p>  On capacity constraints, the CIF tells me it is difficult to get the people needed to do big projects.  However, it also tells me that what I need to put in place to attract more people to the economy is a longer-term framework for capital expenditure that will allow companies and potential employees to have greater confidence about increased or steady capital expenditure for the years to come.  I have done that.</p> <p>  I can take a number of different steps to address capacity constraints and the possibility of the economy overheating.  These include looking at the way we manage the wages of people who work for the State, reviewing procurement and the price we set for projects and increasing capital expenditure at a pace the economy can absorb.  We have made judgment calls and tried to do the right thing on all these issues.</p><p>In an economy as open as this, however, it is fair to say that there are responsibilities on others, in particular employers and employee representatives, to ensure that the rates of wage growth delivered inside companies and sectors of the economy are genuinely affordable.  That has been the case in many areas this year and last year, but the rates can quickly get out of hand and we need to be careful.</p></speech>

Either we tax new areas or, if it is justified by where the economy stands and we need the revenue to do something in our country, we increase taxation on areas where there are currently very low levels of taxation.  In last year's Finance Bill, we introduced a sugar tax, which commenced at the end of April, and we increased stamp duty on commercial property.  The tax strategy group, TSG, papers that will be published at the end of the month will lay out many options for broadening the tax base.  I have made decisions on none of them.</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of quick-fire questions and then a longer one at the end.</p> <p>  In light of current developments with Brexit, how are we planning to safeguard our economy next year and beyond?  Would spending more on our health service have a greater impact on outcomes, bearing in mind that our spending is the third highest in the OECD?  More focus probably needs to be put on terms and conditions and career paths to recruit and retain staff than on throwing more money at the system.</p> <p>  Interestingly, people always ask why we are not building or spending more, but they never have to say how that policy could physically be delivered.  It is easy to throw out a one-liner when one does not have to come up with the implementation process required.  The current drought has caused a loss of income to the water sector that was previously going towards servicing sites that were needed for housing.  Everything has a knock-on effect.  Someone might have a one-liner about getting rid of water charges, but the unintended consequence would be a lack of funding for the area.  We are spending &euro;8 billion on Irish Water, but that is just for bringing Irish Water to the point of functioning.  The amount Irish Water requires is twice that.  These factors are never considered when people throw out one-liners.</p> <p>  We have spent nearly &euro;750 million delivering housing this year, with far more spending needed.  However, emphasis is never placed on the question of how to deliver that.  It is up to the Government to devise an implementation strategy.  It is easy to tell people to spend more and build more without having to say how that can be done.  I understand how difficult it is and what the restrictions and complexities involved are.  It is great to say that we are spending too much on HAP and RAS - we all accept that - but no one ever explains what can be used in the interim before houses are up and running for individuals and families.  I accept that this expenditure on our rental sector is needed while we are getting supply up and running, as I understand the complexities involved.  I want sustainability in the construction sector, not populist remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018071100002#T00600"><p>As to whether I believe that spending more on health is consistent with not getting better outcomes, the fact is that the State will need to spend more on the health service in 2019 because of the impact of demographics and the decisions that I anticipate the Government will make on the funding of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We will also have to spend more to deal with issues like new drugs.  The narrative surrounding the reason for the difficulties in our health service is that the service is significantly underfunded.  That is not true, though, given that &euro;60 billion is being invested in public services.  In the second half of the year, it is imperative that the work being undertaken by the Minister for Health in respect of governance, how the HSE will be run and how Sl&aacute;intecare will be rolled out is seen through.  We have to make that happen in a way that has not happened in the past.  Otherwise, increased levels of expenditure will not deliver the better outcomes that I want.</p> <p>  All I will say about water charges is that, in all of the public and political debate, I made the point that, if we did not have water charges and a separate income stream to support water services, they would be paid for through general taxation.  That was acknowledged by those in favour in the abolition of the charges.  It is now just a fact that investment in water infrastructure competes with other forms of infrastructure for investment.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's third point on how to translate the calls for more investment in housing into the delivery of more homes, the decisions that have been made on planning guidelines and bringing greater certainty and speed to the planning process have been important.  They are not as important as an increase in capital expenditure on housing - clearly, we must do that - but they have had a significant effect.  That planning permission was granted for more than 8,000 homes in the first quarter of this year is a positive sign, but I will say no more now.  The Deputy will be as aware as I am of the anxiety and stress over housing currently.  We are also aware of the risks involved in intervening in the market.</p></speech>

First, Brexit will happen next year; as matters stand, the UK will leave the EU.  Things could then happen that have not been forecasted.  It will be the first time an event like this has occurred.  It is possible that the global economic environment within which we trade could shift because of that.  As such, that period of uncertainty is the right time for us to increase investment in our economy.  I am aiming for higher spending levels in areas that we can influence at home to take place at the same time as the external environment is dealing with new levels of risk.</p> <p>  Second, we must try to have national finances that are sustainable, with a low level of borrowing and visible progress on certain matters, for example, a rainy day fund.  That some colleagues disagree with me on this is fine, but I will put a thought experiment to the committee.  If Brexit had happened three years ago when we had a greater deficit and much higher unemployment, it would have happened at a more difficult time for our economy.</p></speech>

It is a good book and well worth reading.  It questions how economics is taught.  Economics as taught is all about profit maximisation, growth and material measures of progress, and that is the first thing that must change.  I arrived late to the meeting because we were setting up a climate advisory committee next door.  That is going to do interesting work, including inviting the Department's Secretary General to appear before it in the autumn, to consider our new national energy and climate action plan.  We must have a first draft of the plan for the European Union by the end of this year and finalise and sign off on it next year.  From my knowledge of what is happening in Brussels that will be the primary plan and we will have to vary our national mitigation plan to ensure it works.</p><p> At a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment yesterday we heard the latest analysis from civil servants.  Not only are we going to miss our 2020 targets by a country mile, we will be 50 million tonnes short in 2030.  It is clear from the analysis that has been presented by the European Commission and experts such as Marie Donnelly, a civil servant in the Commission, that we are facing &euro;500 million a year in fines.  We are giving out &euro;500 million in the fund announced by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, yesterday, but that is the amount in annual fines we will face in the not too distant future because of this issue.  In addition, everybody I spoke to with an expertise in this area at the national economic dialogue admitted that while the national planning framework got it right in terms of having to bring development back to the core, going low carbon and strengthening local government involvement in decision-making, the national development plan threw all that away and reverts to the same old model.  With 63 motorway and national roads projects, the national development plan is sprawl as we go.  Everything must change.  It is neither environmentally nor socially sustainable.  The commuting times and congestion we are about to experience will cripple our economy.  That and housing are the two big constraints and they are connected.</p><p> How can the Minister set out a budget when he knows that the national development plan on which it is based is no longer fit for purpose and must change?  It is a serious economic issue because if we do not do that not only will we be seen, as we are, in international leagues as one of the worst countries on climate it will also have a material effect on the budget.  The Commission is not going to go easy on us on this because we have no capital left.  We have used up all our political capital in trying to get a soft deal and the European Union and others are saying that Ireland can no longer do that.  We are going to get hit by those fines.  How do we change our national development plan and the capital plans to start making the changes we have to make to move towards the low carbon economy, which will be a better economy in a range of ways?</p><p> I wish to make another point.</p></speech>

I have asked the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Employment Affairs and Social Protection what plans there are to recognise that some people who are not in the paid economy are doing work that matters and is important and valued.  We are close to full employment now and we should not create a society such as that described by Senator Elizabeth Warren as the dual income trap, where it is all about the paid economy, those who are not in the paid economy do not count and those who stay at home do not matter.  Is there any sign that the budget might stand up for that important community?  It could be a range of caring work and should not be sexist oriented.  Are there any plans to recognise that carers matter in the budget?</p></speech>

We must grow our economy to create resources to do good things in our society and to create jobs.  That is my approach to the role of economic growth.</p> <p>  With regard to climate change and potential sanctions or fines in the future, one of the reasons I am introducing a five-year budgetary framework as opposed to what we did in the past, which was to look ahead for a couple of years, is to create greater clarity regarding issues and risks we will face in the future.  The response from the Commission to our position on environmental change could well be one of them.  I will certainly examine that.  More broadly, I have accepted the vast majority of ideas or proposals that have come to me from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that I could afford in a given year.  The climate change element of Project Ireland 2040 and the capital expenditure associated with it point to big increases in capital expenditure to deal with challenges related to climate change and the agenda laid out by the Minister.</p></speech>

I certainly will not have time to do all that reading.  I thank the Minister and his officials for attending and being so forthright.  I will begin with the issue of revenue leakage from our economy.  Have we a method of calculating that?  I refer to it because I come from a Border county where there is major fraud, illicit trade, leakage from the Exchequer and pressure on the retail sector as a result.  There is also online trading, where no rates are being paid and there are no overheads.  People are able to get .ie domain names relatively easily and purport to be trading in the economy when they are not.  Is there a calculation of those figures?  I am aware there was a Grant Thornton report on that a number of years ago, but have the Revenue Commissioners a method of calculating it?</p> <p>  With regard to the labour force, one of my concerns is the issue of full employment.  Today a businessman contacted me about bringing 20 labourers from England onto a building site.  He was having difficulty securing accommodation and temporary PPS numbers for them.  To what extent are we planning for that?  Clearly if there is going to be immigration as a result of creating jobs in this country we have to fast-track them.</p> <p>  Finally, there is the issue of demographics.  We know from the CSO that our population will grow.  The projected increase is in excess of 60% for the cohort aged over 65 years.  To what degree is the Department planning for that ageing population and ensuring they have the services they require?</p> <p>  I will conclude on the housing issue.  It is great to see the economy growing in various sectors.  For example, there have been major factory announcements in my region.  However, how will people find a place to live?  What planning are we doing for that regional development?  There were three announcements of new factories for Dundalk, and I am sorry to be parochial about this.</p><p>This was massive news, as massive employment will come to the area but no housing.  What planning are we doing to ensure we do not end up on a slippery slope on which people will say they can create opportunities in Ireland but cannot create places to live for those who would be critical to those factories?</p></speech>

I do not have available to me from the Revenue Commissioners an estimate of the amount of tax revenue that is leaking out of our country.  One has not been shared with me over the past year.  The only point on which I would caution is there might be different things at play here.  The loss of tax revenue due to illegal purchase of goods and bringing goods illegally into our jurisdiction is tax that is foregone.  I perceive tax lost due to Internet and online shopping as being very different, in that we do accrue some tax back in that regard and it is a legitimate legal activity.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question about capacity constraints and how we are trying to plan for it, one reason we are implementing Ireland 2040 is to try to have a better plan as to how we build homes and where.  In particular, the plan announced by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, earlier in the week of putting together a fund to encourage higher density development in our five largest cities is an important way of ensuring more homes are being made available as we either keep the jobs we have or create more jobs.  </p> <p>  Our approach to dealing with demographics is that the expenditure plans we publish contain how much we set aside to deal with the impact of demographics in any given year.  That is then broken down by Department.  We already know what additional expenditure we will be making available, for example, to the Department of Health, to cope with the effect of demographics next year.  In the latter part of the final chapter of the summer economic statement, for example, the Deputy will find a considerable amount of text on the impact of demographics in social protection and the State pension.  We also lay out there some of the figures we believe we will need to deliver across the coming period to deal with the effect of aging on our society.</p></speech>

While we have been talking in generalities here, in the case of my local hospital, Letterkenny University Hospital, the number of people waiting over 18 months has increased by 17% since the start of the year.  Every single day last year, an average of 19 people lay on hospital trolleys.  Within metres of them lying on those trolleys is a 19-bed ward lying empty, which the management of the hospital want opened.  It will cost &euro;1.8 million in staffing costs to open that ward.  The ward is available and it used to be open.  It was closed under the Government's watch, and it is continually refusing to open it, indirectly, by not funding the HSE appropriately.  The Minister can say that we do not need any additional money to deal with some areas of the health service.  The reason people will lie on trolleys is that people like the Minister decide not to fund the health service adequately.  Consequently, the HSE cannot make the &euro;1.8 million available to enable management to recruit the staff necessary to open that ward.  The management has stated it will not have a challenge in meeting those recruitment requirements.  This is replicated right across the system.  Does the Minister accept that he is in a privileged position, albeit one in which he has to make decisions?  As we heard from Deputy Broughan, the Minister is borrowing &euro;350 million to-----</p></speech>

I am constantly aware of the solemn responsibility I have in discharging it.  As to what I said about health, I never said that health did not need more money.  While answering the questions Deputy Bailey put to me, I acknowledged the Department of Health will need more money next year, and I outlined some of the reasons.  More than &euro;15 billion in funding is going into the HSE and the Department at present.  It is the highest level of funding they have received.  By metrics provided by the OECD, it is one of the higher levels in the world <i>per capita</i>.  Within that, I hope and expect that choices can be made to deal with the kind of issues to which the Deputy is referring.  The Mater Hospital is in my constituency, Connolly hospital is down the road from me and Beaumont hospital is near my constituency.  I am keenly aware of the kind of pressures and issues with which they deal and the worries citizens face if they feel they cannot get into their health service.  I try to respond to that by making as much funding available to the health service as I reasonably can, inside the constraints of other choices.</p></speech>

I will continue on the housing vein.  Given we all accept there may be capacity problems in ramping up the construction sector, what measures does the Minister intend to take to ensure no housing is built that is surplus to requirements and that the housing that is built is the housing we need, that is, is affordable housing?  I know of a number of estates that are being built by the private sector in which the price range starts at &euro;650,000 and goes up to &euro;1 million.  Is that not a waste of building capacity?  The building that we need is public and affordable housing, namely, housing that is built either for the public sector directly or is affordable.  Does the Minister intend to address that problem?  Does the Minister think it is very foolish to be giving tax breaks, supports and incentives to builders who may build housing like that, when we need housing that is public and affordable?</p> <p>  On the subject of housing assistance payments and the rental accommodation scheme, to clarify for Deputy Bailey and for the Minister my question is far from being a one-liner.  The Rebuilding Ireland plan, if it succeeds in its own terms, envisages 87,000 of the 133,000 housing units being annual expenditures, with only 50,000 being capital housing stock.  That, to me, is a bad plan.  It is not just about this year, it is a bad plan.</p></speech>

I am working with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on a further contribution the State can make in that regard.  We cannot end up in a situation where all 8,000 planning permissions granted in quarter one will be for houses at the higher end of the price range because that will not meet the needs of the economy and our society.</p></speech>

I have no plans to put in place additional tax reliefs for the construction sector which would lead to outcomes I could then not control.  I will not be doing so.</p> <p>  On the mix of expenditure, we are ramping up expenditure on social housing at a quick pace.  I know that the Deputy would like more, but one in every four or five new houses built will be a social house.  We are doing all we can to increase the stock of social housing, while at the same time accommodating people in need of social housing through the housing assistance payment and others.  I supported the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in saying we should move from leasing homes for social housing and competing with people who want to buy them to direct build.  That is what we are looking to do.</p></speech>

For example, when the sugar tax was introduced last year, there was synchronisation to ensure it would have no detrimental effect.  Is there dialogue on a regular basis in the run-up to budgetary decisions, in particular on taxation, to ensure there will be balance North and South and the implications in the context of Brexit?</p></speech>

For example, in the aftermath of the budget I said I would not implement the sugar tax if we were disadvantaged.  We had a lot of contact with the authorities in Northern Ireland to ensure that in introducing the tax, we would not disadvantage Irish businesses and consumers.  On whether there is a lot of contact between the Department of Finance and the UK revenue authorities, there is significant contact, particularly on illegal trade and counterfeit goods.  I recently attended an event at which a significant cigarette factory was shut down.  It was a gigantic operation involving UK and Irish police forces and the revenue authorities.</p></speech>

I recognise that one year ago we could not have considered this because the priority had to be the provision of housing for vulnerable persons.  I welcome the cost rental and affordable purchase proposals which have been issued to local authorities to entice them to come up with more ambitious plans.  We are moving in the right direction in that regard and also in the licensing agreements and public private partnerships.  I recognise that the aim is that, by 2021, we will have more people in permanent social housing than under the HAP scheme or the RAS.

As the Chairman knows, the European Commission published its proposal for a regulation on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment on 28 May 2018.  This is part of the important agenda of Europe's transition to a circular economy.  The main objective of this initiative is the prevention and reduction of plastic marine litter from single-use plastic items and fishing gear containing plastic by complementing the measures already envisaged under the EU plastic strategy.  Ultimately, the proposal will further reinforce the EU's systemic approach to this issue.  The proposal is designed to complement the EU's established legislative framework in the fields of waste and water.  These include matters such as the waste framework directive, packaging and packaging waste directives, the marine strategy framework directive and a number of other waste directives, including those concerning wastewater.</p> <p>  The Department greatly welcomes the proposal to tackle the problems posed by plastic single-use items.  The Minister had strongly urged the Commission to tackle this issue urgently.  We believe that working proactively with our European colleagues, we will achieve a greater environmental benefit.  The problem of marine litter is transboundary by nature as marine litter can originate in and affect different countries.  Joint action is particularly effective in this context.  Marine litter can be more effectively prevented and reduced through a coherent approach of policy and measures at EU level, while ensuring a single European market for the general public with high environmental standards and legal certainty for businesses.</p></speech>

I wanted the committee to engage in further scrutiny of the proposal, against the advice in the Department's note, or the wider advice note.  The provisions contained in this European draft directive mirror pretty much exactly, if the key provisions are boiled down, the provisions we set out in our Waste Reduction Bill, which the D&aacute;il approved on Second Stage over a year ago.  We have done some very good, detailed research.  The Library &amp;amp; Research Service has done a lot of good work that has been very useful in looking at the consequences.  This is a highly complex issue, particularly the introduction of a deposit refund scheme.  There are all kinds of complex estimates that must be worked out, including how much money would be raised from the plastics and cans that would be recycled, the level of recycling that would be achieved with the scheme and what the scheme would cost to operate.  The Library &amp;amp; Research Service did really good work reviewing all the various international examples that give us the broad parameters of what would be involved.</p> <p>  I fundamentally disagree with the Department if I heard Mr. Collins right when he said this is a transboundary issue and that marine litter must be dealt with on a transboundary basis.  In fact, it seems clear from the European legislation that they are looking for national governments to legislate.  Anyone who has been out during this beautiful summer on any beach, canal or river will know we have a huge litter problem, particularly with plastic bottles and cans at the most sensitive sites.  This is not just an international, transboundary issue; it is a local litter issue.</p> <p>  The Minister agrees with the provisions of our Bill relating to the banning of certain plastic items, which again mirrors what is in the directive.  We agree with him on the introduction of a levy on plastic cups in an attempt to switch to the compostable variety.  The only thing on which he disagrees with us is the introduction of a deposit refund scheme.</p> <p>  There is every indication the directive will be passed.  I do not hear a single voice in the European Parliament opposing it.  It will not be contentious.  I do not believe a single voice in the European Council is against it.  There may be, but it will be carried, it seems to me.  It is hugely politically and publicly popular.  There is an obligation within it that by 2025 we would have to have a 90% recycling rate for plastic bottles, for example.  The Department's own note states that, if it is agreed within a year, we will have to have a two-year post-agreement before we then legislate, which again mirrors exactly the provisions within our Bill, which does not demand that the Department do something instantaneously, but rather provides for such a two-year period to process all the details.  Given all this, and given that the industry representatives, who took a negative position on our Bill in our hearings here, have met me recently and said I was right that the European directive matches exactly what is in our Bill, why should we not proceed, or why would the Department argue we not proceed?  How does the Department intend to achieve a 90% recycling rate and meet the estimates set out in the provision?  This was debated at the D&aacute;il reform sub-committee yesterday evening, where we sought senior counsel's advice on the idea that the only mechanism we may have is to take legal action with the European Union once this legislation is put through to show up the failing of the Irish Government to take seriously its obligations in respect of environmental legislation.  This is why I wanted to bring the proposal before the committee for further consideration.  I do not believe the advice that this does not have consequences; I believe it does.  We should proceed to Committee Stage to tease out any differences of views on the introduction of a deposit refund scheme.  In the absence of that, for the Department just to say we need more analysis and not to have any proposals itself as to how we might meet the 90% target rate we face would be a dereliction of duty on our part as a Parliament.</p></speech>

To be clear, we greatly welcome this proposal.  It is very valuable in providing the ability and powers for member states to take actions in this area.</p><p>It is not I who am saying this is transboundary.  In terms of disagreeing with the transboundary nature, it is the European Commission that considers this a transboundary issue.  The material we are talking about has been identified as the majority of waste litter arising in the marine environment.  The materials can arise in one member state and affect another.  It is not that we are arguing that it has to be a transboundary issue; the reality of the environment means that it is transboundary in nature, and the European Commission agrees.</p></speech>

I certainly hope it would be accepted.  Negotiations will have to take place in the European Parliament and at Council.  I hope it will proceed quickly.  I think it has already been prioritised by the Austrian Presidency as one of the issues it wants to progress as quickly as possible.  I am sure there will be considerable support in the European Parliament.  Member states have, at both official and ministerial level, been pushing this action very vociferously for a long time with the European Commission.</p> <p>  I was asked how we would respond.  That is the normal way we approach much of the legislation that would appear.  The Commission is very clear that it is open to member states as to how they reach whatever targets are set.  The Commission's proposal is open in that sense.  It could be an extended producer-responsibility scheme as we currently operate and which has been operating very successfully or it could be a deposit-and-return scheme.  Both options are on the table.  In that sense, it is slightly different from the Bill.  I know we are not discussing the Bill, but the Deputy mentioned it.  The Bill provides for it to be mandatory, whereas the Commission's proposal leaves it open to the member states to determine the scheme most suitable to their circumstances.  They recognise that the same-structure schemes have different types of performance levels in different member states.  We need to understand how to achieve that target.  We do not have a preconceived view that it must be done in a particular way; we want to discover what options would actually deliver on the targets.</p></speech>

Our <i>per capita </i>plastic waste is twice the European average.  We are facing a European tax system which may tax countries on the amount of plastic waste that is not recycled.  This is not without consequence as well as being a local, environmental and transboundary environmental issue.  Having done all this work on the issue, how does the Department intend to meet a target of having 90% of plastic bottles recycled as per the directive?</p></speech>

We will not focus on a single item, we need to develop a new policy to address the entire remit under the circular economy package.  This will be a key element of it, but a number of areas will need to be covered as part of that.</p></speech>

We are not in a position to say what the best option is at this stage.  This issue requires more analysis.  I do not think the Minister has said he has no objections; he has signalled that he is concerned about the cost of the deposit-return scheme, DRS, proposed in the Bill.  We want to establish how we can achieve high-level targets in a cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

The Commission is leaving it open to the member states to look at their own national circumstances and determine the best way of achieving the proposals.  At this stage, it is a proposal and there are a number of stages involved.  The Commission would never approach us at this stage to ask us how we will achieve it.  The Commission has made a proposal that has to be approved by the Council and the European Parliament.  There is a timeframe for implementation of the objectives thereafter.  Then the objectives will be set with certain dates as well.</p></speech>

I would love to be able to sit down and work out various cost estimates or, indeed, any other proposals.  Thereafter, the Bill could be amended.  A lot of very good work has been done, particularly including two international examples.</p> <p>  While the Commission does not direct exactly which mechanism should be used, at various points in its circular economy package and directives it specifically puts forward the DRS as one of the very effective ways of doing it.  Having talked to industry people and other experts in the area, having gone through this process in the past year, we know of no other mechanism that would achieve what will be an obligatory target when the directive goes through, as I expect it will.</p> <p>  Parliament has been considering this in real detail.  It is not appropriate to shirk the responsibility and say that we will wait a few more years when the Department does not have an alternative proposal.  If the Department had an alternative proposal with a better way of doing it, there would be a valid argument that we could debate on Committee Stage.  After a year of extensive research, it is inappropriate for the Department to say it needs to do more research.  I assure Mr. Collins that the research will come up with no conclusion.  It is not possible to get an exact figure because it is such a complicated costing exercise involving multiple variables.  For example, how can we apply a figure to the cost of the litter that is polluting our country this summer?  It is very difficult to put a price on that.  It is very difficult to debate it when the Minister is refusing to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage and the Department does not have an alternative proposal.  It would bring shame on this Parliament if we were to wait for everyone else to legislate in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

It is not that we do not have a proposal.  We have a fully-functioning and operational extended producer-responsibility scheme that is achieving and far exceeding its existing targets.  That is the current status.  We do not yet have a mandatory obligatory target.  The Commission will admit that this is a proposal.  We are very hopeful that it will be approved.  However, no targets have been set yet.  It is subject to negotiation at the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</p> <p>  Different countries have many varied experiences.  We need to understand the dynamics within countries.  For example, Belgium does not have a DRS and is achieving the current recycling target of 86%.  Is a DRS the only solution to this problem?  I cannot say that it is; we do not have enough evidence to say that is the current situation in Ireland.</p></speech>

As a result of discussions with the environmental pillar, it has been agreed not to proceed with the pilot.  That is in accordance with the views of the NGO pillar, as I said.  As a result, we will not be doing that.  Instead, it has been agreed that we will carry out a national study on a full implementation of how a DRS would operate in Ireland.  Those are the actions we are taking.  At this stage, when we have examples of these schemes enjoying high and low performance in different countries and also examples of countries, including Ireland, that have good performance or high performance - as is the case with Belgium, which does not have a DRS - it is not really feasible for me to say what is the best or the only option with which we should proceed at this point.</p></speech>

I was in Cashel last weekend and I wondered how we could possibly get any sort of scientific results from it other than having some kind <i>cordon sanitaire</i>around the town whereby we would know that the plastic bottles used there would remain there.  I am glad the Department has moved away from that.</p><p>Further to the agreement with Irish environmental pillar, when does Mr. Collins expect that research to be concluded?  Given that we are all of the view that the legislation will be passed in Europe, do Mr. Collins and Mr. O'Donoghue believe that our current system could deliver the 90% target that the Department's information note indicates will need to be in place in two years?</p><p>Regardless of what happens in Belgium, does Mr. Collins believe the system here could deliver the more than 90% recycling rate we seek?</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise that any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system and our televised broadcasting service.  They should switch them to flight mode.</p><p>I welcome our witnesses.  They are here to engage with the joint committee on illegal dumping and environmental issues.  I advise the witnesses that they should refrain from commenting on any ongoing court proceedings.  We have a limited time for this session.  We have agreed to conclude at 3 p.m. because we have a meeting of the special committee on climate change later this afternoon.  If some of the questions are not answered by the time we conclude proceedings, the witnesses might submit written replies to the committee in respect of them.  I ask the witnesses to be as brief as possible in making their opening statements because it will allow members more time to engage with them; members have read their written statements.</p><p>From the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, I welcome Mr. Gerard O'Leary, deputy director general, Ms Mary Gurrie, programme manager, and Mr. Mick Henry, senior inspector.  From Donegal County Council I welcome Mr. Seamus Neely, chief executive, Mr. Michael McGarvey, director of services for water and environment, and Mr. Sean Scott, waste enforcement regional lead authority and Leitrim County Council.  From Offaly County Council I welcome Mr. Sean Murray, director of services for water services, environment and the national waste collection permit office.</p><p>I invite Mr. O'Leary from the EPA to make his presentation.</p></speech>

From an EPA point of view, it highlighted some of the challenges we face in regulating the waste sector.  There are other regulators in the area and I have detailed those in our paper.</p><p> We have concerns about the waste sector.  While I have pointed to some successes we have had in regulating the sector and the 200-odd activities we regulate, many of the successes have been achieved by dragging companies through the courts system.  We do not see the sector coming voluntarily.  I suppose I am comparing it to other sectors.  We did a review between 2009 and 2013.  A total of 40% of our prosecutions were in the waste sector.  Regarding the total activities we regulate, between waste and industry, we regulate approximately 800, 200 of which are in the waste sector, so the committee can see that a lot of time is consumed by one sector compared to the other 600.  </p><p> I cannot recall any other sector that we regulate that has changed so dramatically in the past number of years.  Essentially, we now regulate the private sector.  We have had to evolve some of our enforcement strategies over the years.  I will discuss one of the changes we made two years ago, which, again, has been successful.  Across the 800 activities we regulate, we have five regions.  We used to be all paper but we are now all electronic and, therefore, we get intelligence much faster than was the case previously.  Every three months, we publish on our website the list of activities that are not just regulated by local offices but involve national enforcement.  That involves all sections of the EPA in trying to bring what is a small cohort back into compliance.  We will publish again next month because the three months are up.  The small cohort within the waste sector has featured on those national priority lists so it is something we will publish every three months.  Of the activities on the national list, approximately half of them have been prosecuted.  We are bringing the most non-compliant activities to the surface and adopting a national approach.  </p><p> The third issue, which I touched upon and which was featured in the programme, is the fact that we have published three reports on the performance of local authorities with regard to their environmental functions.  While the programme focused solely on waste, we cover air and water activities.  In the first report we published in 2014, we determined that approximately one third of local authorities' performance in waste enforcement was poor.  At that stage, we had pressed for something that was in an earlier Government policy statement in 2012, namely, the establishment of three lead local authorities that would support local authorities.  Thankfully, they are now in place.  While we can see an improvement in 2017, I do not want to suggest to the committee that just because of the establishment of these lead local authorities, everything will be solved but it is a step in the right direction.</p></speech>

That was about three minutes so I might ask all our other witnesses to keep to three minutes if possible.</p></speech>

The programme touched on staffing and resources quite a bit.  I wish to draw the committee's attention to the fact that Donegal County Council has 14 staff assigned to waste and litter management and enforcement, which puts us mid-table.  There are 15 local authorities with more staff and 15 with the same or fewer staff.  From the middle of last year, we put together a business plan and a commitment to put additional staffing in place.  That will come to fruition in quarter three of this year at which stage we will have 19 staff in place, which will make us the fifth most resourced council in the country in respect of waste and litter enforcement and regulation.</p> <p>  I had intended to draw attention to the waste enforcement regional lead authorities but Mr. O'Leary has done so but I reiterate that this has been a great step forward for local authorities.  It is early days and as time goes on, we will see the full value of them.  However, they must be complemented by activity by the local authorities at individual level and resourced accordingly.  </p> <p>  I do not agree with the metric that was used on RT&Eacute; 1 for Donegal's place in the rankings.  It is a mixture of rating and ranking and the number of permits in place per head of population was a factor.  It is a useful metric to look at but it does not capture the entirety of what we are dealing with on a day-in and day-out basis.  I believe the resources we had in place were sufficient at the time.  We took a particular decision in the middle of last year to augment those significantly having regard to recent experiences and I will keep that area of resource application under continuous review with a firm commitment to provide additional specific resources for at least a five-year period.  </p> <p>  I mentioned threats and risks to enforcement staff and collaboration with other agencies generally.  Regulation and enforcement of waste laws is a concern for Donegal County Council and local authorities in general.  It is recognised that waste is a commodity.  When it is traded illegally, it can generate considerable financial benefit for those involved.  In enforcing and managing that, councils and all other enforcement agencies come across people who are capable of doing things that are not always normal.  This has happened in Donegal.  There have been incidents where staff have been intimidated.  There have been particularly insidious events which are problematic in themselves.  My report largely speaks for itself regarding the three cases that were referred to in the television programme.  </p> <p>  I indicated in the report that I would give a brief update about works that were ongoing at the time of writing on the site in Moville.  Works have continued on that site in the interim.  When the programme was aired, the incidents at that site were brought to the attention of the council for the first time.  There was new information and they were immediately treated as complaints that required investigation.  An investigation of these complaints is ongoing and all aspects of what was shown and said on the programme will be thoroughly examined.  RT&Eacute; has been contacted to secure available evidence.  As part of the investigation, the council determined that it needed to excavate one particular area.  It was an area that was described in the programme as almost 200 mounds.  The excavations were carried out under council direction last week.  The owners of the site were not present at during the excavations but had an observer present.  Each mound, which was, typically, to a maximum height of 2 metres, was excavated and found to be made of shale, rock and soil.  Isolated items such as tyres, of which there were approximately ten in total across the entire excavation, were found within the mounds.  In the course of that excavation of the featured mounds, the mound featured more closely in the programme, which was different in appearance to the others, was also excavated.  It contained some waste, which included a section of carpet; a set of curtains; a number of glass bottles; agricultural material like bale, cord, netting and some straw; and a small plastic container that was used in agriculture.  No evidence of general municipal waste was found in any of the other mounds excavated.  A number of loads of material that seemed to be of a construction and demolition origin and materials from agriculture and the fishing industry, some of which are overgrown, still need to be addressed at the south eastern side of that site.  However, the area that was described as 200 mounds has been excavated and found to be largely made up of shale, rock and soil.  I will leave it at that.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Murray" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018071100002#E00500"><p>Like my colleagues, I will go through highlights of my submission to the committee.  The National Waste Collection Permit Office, NWCPO, was established since 1 February 2012.  Section 34 of the Waste Management Act requires that any person collecting waste for profit, reward or otherwise in the course of business to hold a waste collection permit.  They are obliged by law to do so.  A total of 2,010 waste collection permits are extant.  The primary role of my office is the processing of waste collection permit applications, the maintenance of the waste collection permit register and the ongoing administration of the permits.</p><p>The NWCPO is certified to ISO9001.  The permit process involves an applicant completing an application form in a prescribed format.  One of the major areas of relevance to the permit process and permit applications is that the person requiring a permit is a fit and proper person, as defined under section 34 D of the Waste Management Act.  A person is not a fit and proper person where any one of the following applies: they have been convicted of a prescribed offence under environmental legislation; they do not have the requisite technical knowledge or qualifications to carry out the activity in accordance with the waste collection permit; they are not likely to be in a position to carry out and meet any commitments or liabilities that will arise; they have previously had a waste collection permit revoked; or the applicant has had a court order made against him or her under section 57 or 58 of the Act.</p><p> The permit granted includes a standardised set of conditions including: only authorising the collector to collect specified waste types; use specified waste facilities; use specified waste vehicles; and collect in a specified local authority area.  Where breaches of waste collection permits occur the NWCPO does not enforce the conditions of the waste collection permits as this role rests with each individual local authority for their jurisdictional area.  The office, however, works in conjunction with local authorities where non-compliance has been identified and can review and revoke waste collection permits as deemed appropriate.</p><p> The office relies on the local investigations undertaken by local authorities in determining the review of a waste collection permit.  Local authorities can issue fixed payment notices for breaches of specified permit conditions and issue warnings or enforcement notices where other breaches are identified.  These are all based on the Act.</p><p> Where the NWCPO reviews a waste collection permit, this review can result in a direction to take corrective measures or the complete revocation of a waste collection permit.  A permit can be revoked where a permit holder is no longer deemed to be a fit and proper person, as defined in the Act, to hold a permit.</p></speech>

Perhaps he will take note of some of the questions that members may ask, either those directed at him or if he wants to comment on a particular question.  We will start with Deputies Dooley and Stanley, and Senator Terry Leyden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018071100002#F00300"><p>I welcome all the participants and I thank them for the information they have provided.  Mr. O'Leary said that he welcomed the "RT&Eacute; Investigates: Ireland's Wild Waste" programme and that he accepted problems exist.  He spoke about the resources and about the change the EPA has had to go through.  Does he believe that the EPA has adequate resources to make that change?  He took the committee through the steps and said that the agency was responding to the difficulties in the sector.  He also said that a large chunk of the agency's work relates to waste management and that this has been a drag on its resources.  Is the agency adequately resourced to address the situation it now finds itself in?</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Neely for his presentation in which he seems to take a slightly different tack on the programme and he questions if Donegal County Council was treated fairly, which is a valid question from his perspective.  To the uneducated observer watching the programme it painted Donegal in an exceptionally bad light.  This is why I find it difficult to understand him when he said that he felt the council had adequate resources at the time.  Perhaps it did but in light of the programme does he believe that the council had adequate resources?  With the benefit of hindsight, or with the benefit of the programme, does he accept that the council needs a considerably increased level of resource deployed in that area?</p> <p>  Mr. Neely also said that some of his council staff encounter intimidation, which is a serious issue.  How many incidents of this type of intimidation have been reported to the Garda?  How many prosecutions have taken place as a result of that or what follow-up activity has taken place by the Garda?  Have the incidents been treated in a manner that Mr. Neely is happy with?  Has this work been tracked?  This goes to the nub.  It does not matter if one has three times the staff working in this area, if there is insidious behaviour or threats and intimidation, then I can understand how a public servant is not going to put his or her life, or his or her family's lives, at risk.  One hopes the authorities would treat this seriously on another level.  It is not just because of the impact on the environment, which is huge, but also because if a person is involved in that behaviour and yet feels they are part of a legitimate business there is no place for those companies to have any role or to be given any licence.  It is important that this issue be addressed adequately by the justice system.</p></speech>

The "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme highlighted a number of things that are happening across the State.  It showed that not all cowboys wear big hats and ride horses.  Some questions were raised by the witnesses about the methods used by RT&Eacute; in Donegal.  Footage showed us what is happening on the ground in the county and regardless of what language or metrics one uses to dress it up, it did not paint a pretty picture.   There were mounds of waste described as being 2 m high on the Inishowen Peninsula but they looked more substantial than that on the camera.  I was in that area last year.  It is a lovely part of the country and what is going on there with regard to waste is criminal.</p> <p>  As Deputy Dooley asked, if members of staff are being threatened, which should not be happening, is there adequate follow up from the Garda?  If not, why not?</p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Leary tell the committee how many waste licences have been revoked?  Mr. Neely from Donegal County Council has said that it is moving from 14 to 19.  Clearly there is a problem.  I had heard of the programme but could not see it on the night it was broadcast so I watched a repeat.  One of the waste facilities is beside a large river.  There were problems with the licence but it was renewed again for that waste collector.  A substantial amount of the activity at that site, which is right at the edge of the river, is concerning.  Will Mr. Neely explain how Donegal County Council came to the conclusion that this location was okay for such a substantial waste facility, especially where the operator and owner may not have complied with all the regulations, or may not have engaged in best practice in waste handling?</p> <p>  I shall now turn to the EPA.  I recall the national permit office being set up under Offaly County Council.  With regard to Mr. Murray's brief, who goes to the county council for a permit and who goes to EPA for a licence?  It would help public representatives, and others, to know that.  Should the EPA administer the licensing system?  I am not saying that Offaly County Council is inefficient, as it deals with the permits regularly, but is the process more convoluted when individual local authorities must get their permits through a county council?  Would it be more efficient if it was handled through the EPA?</p> <p>  Will the witnesses also comment on whether the fines are high enough?</p><p> Offaly County Council has no role in the investigations.  That was my understanding and Mr. Murray has clarified the matter.  The council just hands out the permits.  However, Mr. Murray also mentioned in his presentation that fit persons with technical knowledge could obtain a licence.  Will he give us a definition of the requisite technical knowledge or qualifications required to carry out the activity?  That is obviously important.  It is also important to note, as Mr. Murray has clarified, that the problem has multiplied several times since the system was privatised.  Privatisation has brought us a lot of illegal dumping and bad environmental practice, which is obviously a challenge.</p><p> I have a further question for Offaly County Council.  There is talk of some county councils bringing forward by-laws to ensure each household will have a legal method of disposing of household waste.  I have a Bill that has passed First Stage in the D&aacute;il that would do this in the case of private rental accommodation.  I am not saying the problem is down solely to people who live in rental accommodation, whether it is private accommodation or social or local authority housing.  My question is this.  Could something similar be done throughout the country to ensure all households would have legal means of disposing of their waste and having their waste collected?</p></speech>

It is very good for the committee to provide an opportunity for the delegates to put forward their views on the programme which I did not see.  I understand from my councillor colleagues in Donegal County Council, of which Mr. Neely is chief executive, that the council is doing its utmost to solve the problem.  The members of the council are very concerned about the issues raised and the council has taken appropriate action to deal with what was raised at the time.  That is what I understand the position to be.  Donegal is a very large county and it is very hard to watch every cowboy who is likely to start dumping somewhere in it.  I do not know the extent of the problem.</p> <p>  Offaly County Council controls the situation.  Is the system fit for purpose or would it be better to delegate in order that councils would have more control in the granting of licences?  This arrangement was brought forward when I was a councillor.  It must be more than 15 years since it was brought forward, but perhaps not.  Perhaps it has happened since I was a councillor, but there was great debate at the time about licences and waste disposal.  RT&Eacute; has done the State some service.  When we pay the licence fee, it helps to know that it carries out these investigations.  It is a pity that the Environmental Protection Agency is not more active.  It could engage in more surveillance and not rely on RT&Eacute; to find out what is happening in the countryside.</p></speech>

That we are not strong on environmental regulations enforcement is something we can see at Government level.  There is another report out today, the latest from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.  We are doing well in meeting the social targets, but when it comes to environmental targets, we are ranked very poorly.  We are ranked particularly badly under the headings of responsible consumption and production, the waste target set within the sustainable development goals.  This is an independent finding in one of many reports.  We have a problem at Government level.  The programme highlighted a problem in the regulation of industry, in this case, the waste industry.  We also have a problem at local level.</p> <p>  I must say to the representative from County Donegal that I love the county.  I go there every year and it is most spectacular.  I will never forget a walk I took around Bloody Foreland a couple of years ago when the amount of fly-tip waste strewn around the place was just incredible.  It was heart-wrenching that such a beautiful place had been ruined.  That is just a personal experience, but it brings home the various levels at which we need to take environmental regulations enforcement seriously.  I am very interested in the issue of intimidation, about which it is critical that we hear more.  It is a real concern.  How can we regulate if people are being intimidated?  How can we have laws that will work?  </p> <p>  I have two or three further questions.  I wish to ask the local authorities, Offaly and Donegal County Councils, about the fly-tipping issue which I know is slightly different from the one highlighted in the programme.  Yesterday I talked to somebody about the issue of enforcement of litter and fly-tipping regulations.  The example about which we spoke was that when council proceeded with a prosecution, a &euro;100 fine was applied.  It costs the guts of &euro;800 to go through the process.  Does that hamper regulation, or are the councils happy with the regulations for fly-tipping and the ease with which they can prosecute?</p> <p>  I was very taken by what Mr. O'Leary said about the way the industry had changed.  Does he believe a change in legislation is needed?  Does he have any advice for the Legislature if, as he says, we have moved from a largely council-led public waste collection service to a privatised system?  Does the EPA have any view or are there particular suggestions as to how we might tighten the provisions in legislation to take account of the fundamental change that has occurred in recent years?</p></speech>

That is exactly what I am trying to convey.   We regulate 200 waste activities and there are another 600 on the industrial side of things.  Therefore, there are 800 regulated activities which are large.  We have an inspectorate of 40.  The phrase "in the light of the programme" was used.  For me, another piece of work emerges in the light of the programme.  We have a small staff who supervise the role of the local authorities.  For the most part, all of the legislation on illegal dumping concerns local authorities.  Whereas we do have a network with the local authorities, it is an area that could be strengthened.  As I said, the establishment of lead local authorities is a positive step.  I am not saying those involved in all of the 200 activities we regulate are non-compliant, but if we need to go through the court system to achieve compliance, it sucks up an awful lot of time.  I call for increased resources to support the local authorities.  We will need a multi-agency approach to achieve success in this area.  The local authorities may call for the involvement of the EPA, but there is also a role for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and, possibly, the Revenue Commissioners.  The multi-agency approach needs to be further resourced.</p></speech>

When it comes to co-ordinating a multiplicity of State agencies, it is often the case that the issue falls between the cracks or stakeholders.  Which should be the lead agency to co-ordinate the activities of all concerned?  Should it be the EPA?</p></speech>

Five years ago there were 10,000 pieces of paper going back and forth between the EPA and licensees.  The system is now electronic.  It is something the European Union has acknowledged and would like to see in place in other jurisdictions.  Therefore, I would like to think we would be asked to take a greater role in this area because of our track record.</p> <p>  Deputy Brian Stanley mentioned suspension and revocation.  I was not pleased with the illegal activity I saw shown in the programme, but several barristers or legal academics talked about the challenges in implementing the legislation.  There was a case in which we endeavoured to have a licence suspended.  Frankly, we had been through the District Court and felt there was a need to suspend the licence.  It is still within the courts system, but we believe we are going to have a resolution that will bring the concern involved back to compliance.  However, as Deputy Timmy Dooley said, it is a big drag on resources, but it is not something that came about voluntarily.  There is a cohort in the sector with whom we see similar tendencies.</p><p> On revocation, I would go as far as to say that we have gone to injunct facilities to close them down.  For me it was the most non-compliant licensed activity that the EPA has licensed, it took us two attempts in the High Court to eventually close down the facility.  I would like to think that the committee got a picture through the programme from the legal people who spoke on the challenges within the court system.</p><p> Deputy Stanley asked about the fines.  For the District Court it is &euro;5,000 or 12 months in prison or both.  If a file is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, which we have done, it is up to &euro;15 million or ten years in jail.  We have had one major success.  It was a huge file we sent to the DPP where a company was fined &euro;20 million but that would be the exception rather than the norm.</p><p> On the administrative system and the split between permits and licences, I will ask my colleague about the threshold but it is something that has not been thought of in Ireland.  It comes from the European directive that the larger activities would require a licence and that would attract things such as environmental impact statements and there would be greater rigour.  For the smaller activities the permits would be the issue.  It is amazing that on occasions I see that things just come in under the threshold on the activities because the permit was intended to be an easier route to get a licence.  I say anecdotally that there can be a thin line on that.</p></speech>

I am afraid that there is no simple answer.  All of the different types of waste activities have different thresholds for whether they need a certificate of registration, a permit or a licence and there is a complex decision tree available on our website which sets out all of the different categories.  It is SI 86 of 2008 that sets it but as a rule of thumb, 50,000 tonnes of waste per annum is the threshold for a municipal, commercial, industrial waste type facility is the threshold per annum.  Recovery requires a facility permit and the threshold is higher than that for more disposal or in the case of incinerators or landfills, EPA licensing is required.  The threshold is roughly 50,000 tonnes therefore.</p></speech>

From the point of view of clarification, it is important to note that Offaly County Council has responsibility as the national waste collection permit office.  That is the waste collection part of the issue.  The issue the EPA was adverting to is the facility permit.  The larger facilities cannot be permitted.  They must be licensed by the EPA.  The smaller facilities are permitted by each local authority.  The figure of 2,010 refers to the collective, it is not the individual permits.  They would include locally permitted facilities where a collection permit company would be bringing the waste to those facilities.  I want to draw a distinction between the collection permit and the facility permit.  We do not have a role on facility permits for any local authority other than ourselves.</p></speech>

They were displayed during the programme as amounting to &euro;5,000 on average.  One of the things that we find with District Court cases, where the maximum fine is &euro;5,000, is that infrastructural commitments will be given through the courts.  We have often found that the fine may only be a few thousand euro but the infrastructure that will be put in place during the court proceedings can be quite significant.  The unfortunate thing is that the infrastructure is normally what is in the licence in the first instance so it is something that is required, which brings me back to my original point which is that we have to go through a courts system at times to put infrastructure in place that the companies were required to put in in the first instance.</p></speech>

They are extensive files and they should be because the maximum fine is &euro;15 million, but we have gone from a &euro;20 million fine, which was two charges of &euro;10 million to the other extreme of &euro;25,000.  I am not saying that both cases were identical but I would say that the gap between the two was not as big.  If it was within the committee's gift there I would say that there should be clarity that if this offence is committed or the licences are breached then this is what the likely penalty is.</p></speech>

The first thing I would say on the RT&Eacute; programme is that I would welcome the concept.  It has been very useful, we are having a conversation here today and we are able to share some of our experiences with the committee and we would not otherwise be doing that had the programme not been broadcast.  I fully endorse the principle of highlighting that and the value of same.<br/><br/>What I did say is that I am not satisfied that the metric that they used to describe the performance of Donegal County Council was appropriate and I still stand over that.  I look at the league table and I see a comparator county that has 25% less resources that is many places further up the league table and I cannot quite understand that.  Of the three cases featured, one of those cases has been a very complex case where the council has prosecuted the individual and concerned parties on numerous occasions.  There have been 13 successful prosecutions that have resulted in nine findings.  That was not fully represented in the programme and it would have been useful had it been.  Part of the difficulty we have in taking that as an example is that many of the fines that were imposed along the way were relatively small and not a sufficient deterrent.<br/><br/>On the resources, a decision was taken in 2017 to increase our resources significantly.  At that point in time we considered that we needed more.  That was as a consequence of being aware of particularly complex cases that were ongoing and being aware of how the new resource of the<b></b>waste enforcement regional lead authority, WERLA, of which Donegal County Council is a lead partner, could be further enhanced by having more resources at local level.  I am satisfied that the resource allocation we have now is much more appropriate to what we are facing.<br/><br/>There have been several incidents of an insidious and nasty nature as I referred to.  Over a three-year period I recall approximately ten in number, that would have included individuals being approached, private property being damaged - including private homes and individuals being approached at social and community events.  All of those were reported to the Garda.  Unfortunately, sufficient evidence could not be gleaned to bring those through to a successful outcome but having spoken to the Garda and the people involved, I can understand that.  Consequently, I am satisfied that sufficient attention was given to it by the authorities but nonetheless a successful outcome was not achieved.  That is a significant issue but I am pleased to say that the individuals who were impacted by that were not deterred from their work.  They continued and perhaps it even tightened their resolve to ensure that what needed to be done was done.<br/><br/>One of the values of the programme for us was that we set up a help desk afterwards back at base and a number for people to call.  We have had 35 calls to that number and those calls have come as a consequence of the programme.  They relate to approximately 20 cases.  The majority of those are cases that were already known to us or cases that were on the fly-tipping side of things.  Nevertheless, there were a number within that which must be looked at more closely and might warrant further significant attention.  There has been considerable value in that for us.<br/><br/>Deputy Eamon Ryan talked about the fly-tipping and one initiative that Donegal County Council does on an annual basis is to involve about 5,000 people across the county in 300 to 500 community clean ups.</p><p>The engagement process there is very strong and there is a real understanding of and commitment not only to cleaning up but also to ensuring it does not happen again.  Reference was made to the challenges faced and the cost of prosecuting littering fines.  That is a challenge.  Sometimes they are difficult cases on which to get a successful prosecution and the cost to public authorities is often multiples of the fine involved.  If we are often unsuccessful in a prosecution, it sends a bad message also.  That is one of the reasons we have moved to such an extent to the community side and working with them to have many thousands of enforcement officers across the county who can watch this on a daily basis.</p><p> One of the barometers I have watched on the performance of the organisation over the past period, apart from the publications of the EPA and others, is where we sit in relation to the number of complaints received.  The rate of complaints received for Donegal in 2017 from the public was about 50% of the national average.  While it is still too many complaints, it is a barometer of the performance.  I appreciate that the more resources we can put into it, the better.  I am satisfied that where we are now brings a good balance and that we will achieve good outcomes.</p><p> Deputy Stanley asked about the renewal of a facility permit.  That facility permit was issued in 2013 and predated any of the prosecutions to which I have just referred.  In fact, the facility is now completely closed and the subject of a court process.  The facility operator is no longer allowed to operate and that includes the collection permits as well.  In terms of what would make things better, the barrier at the moment for the public and enforcement authorities is that one has to meet a very strong burden to prove that an operator should not continue to have a licence.  It should be the other way around and there should be an easier mechanism for enforcement authorities to say that, having taken a lot of things into consideration, an operator's licence will be revoked within two months unless the operator proves otherwise.  The person should have the opportunity to go to court and protect it on the other side.  The balance needs to be shifted in that respect.  I appreciate that on occasion, the balance should be in favour of the citizen or operator but in this instance, it would work well the other way around for a period.</p></speech>

On the establishment of WERLAs, there is a problem.  It is being addressed and this year is a very useful framework to work within.  However, we work and report to the national waste enforcement steering committee.  Deputy Dooley asked who actually led on that because sometimes one can fall between stools.  It is co-ordinated and led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We meet on a quarterly basis.  We have established national priorities including a multi-agency approach.  At our last meeting, which took place in March this year, it was agreed with the other agencies here to seek feedback from the regions as to how we might tighten and streamline the legislation.  The multi-agency approach has been a very successful tool.  We accept totally that there are problems but we believe it is the way forward.  I refer back to when we had problems with road safety and how we talked about compliance.  That is the point we will reach.  It will not just be a question of enforcement, rather we will have compliance.  I am convinced the multi-agency approach is the way forward in that regard.</p></speech>

I was appalled like others when watching the programme.  I was not surprised when I saw a couple of the sites mentioned because I was aware of them.  However, I was not aware of those mounds.  It was a very strong signal to me that there was something terribly wrong on that site.  Those mounds have all been levelled and excavated under the direction of the local authority in the last week or ten days.  They were all under 2 m in height and all of them, bar one, contained little or no material other than shale, rock and soil.  The one that had materials in it was the one featured on the programme.</p></speech>

Senator Leyden asked if Offaly was fit for purpose as the national waste collection office.  The simple answer is that our view is that it is.  We have ISO 9001 supporting that.  Historically, collection permits were issued on a regional basis.  That was in the first ten years of their existence.  Offaly was the regional authority for the midlands region at the time.  Those regional licences were in fact supra-regional anyway because they were semi-national licences.  From 2001 to 2012, Offaly was the waste collection permit office for the midlands region.  We became the national waste collection permit office, NWCPO, after that and we believe we are fit for purpose.  As the NWCPO, we are clearly aware of the extent of our authority, the limit of our authority and our area of competence as they are all clearly prescribed and defined by law and regulation, which we apply.  I can adduce for the attention of the committee at any stage the area on which we base our competent decisions.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked how we assessed technical knowledge.  We have a complex way to assess technical knowledge, but in simple terms an applicant has to demonstrate possession of a BSc in environmental science, a masters degree in environmental science, a certificate from a waste collection training programme and so on.  We have a very rigorous examination of the technical qualifications of anyone who comes to us as a permit applicant.</p> <p>  I refer to the next question in general terms as this is going through the process in all local authorities, not just Offaly.  By-laws for the separate waste collection processes are going through local authorities across the State at the moment.  I am sure Mr. Neely will confirm that in the case of Donegal.  We have initiated the by-law process, which is a legal process to be taken step by step.  Among other things, it will include a requirement to provide evidence of how waste will be disposed of.  That has been dealt with adequately.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan talked about fly-tipping and whether prosecutions in that regard were cost effective.  The simple answer is that they are not.  Prosecutions cost us money.  Notwithstanding that, I confirm that Offaly County Council prosecutes without exception in all cases of breaches of waste legislation where we can produce and adduce proof to the appropriate authority.</p> <p>  Finally, I make a general comment on the following without going into any detail due to the fact that a case is before the High Court.  I will make no reference to it except to note that it is not very complex.  I support what Mr. O'Leary said on behalf of the EPA and what Mr. Neely said on behalf of Donegal.  We have already had three full days of hearing in the High Court but we are not finished.  That is what is required when we get into court.  It is a complex arena and prosecutions are difficult to effect.</p></speech>

The WERLA office has been mentioned quite a bit.  We produced a 2017 annual report, which outlines our activities and we can circulate it to the committee if necessary.  While our role is to co-ordinate a consistent approach to enforcement, local authorities remain the boots on the ground in that regard.  We support that.  Where local authorities have asked us for assistance, we have provided it.  There is clear evidence of that across the country.  As my colleague, Mr. McGarvey says, our work is co-ordinated through the national waste enforcement steering committee.  We have great support in the Connacht-Ulster region from Donegal and Leitrim county councils as the consortium leading the WERLA locally.</p> <p>  The RT&Eacute; programme mentioned the number of permits.  However, local authorities nationally deal with 60,000 waste and litter complaints, 1,000 permits, approximately 2,000 waste collection permits and producer-responsibility initiatives.</p><p>Deputy Ryan mentioned dumping.  We recognise this as an issue and we sought funding from the Department in 2017, which resulted in &euro;1.8 million being allocated for anti-dumping initiatives.  There are 190 projects nationally and there have been good outcomes with a good buy-in from communities.  We encourage local authorities to look at innovations such as mobile workforce applications.

I thank the Deputy.  We are agreed on the course of action to taken on the petition.</p> <p>  The next petition is No. P00002/18.  It is proposed that the committee decide that the petition is inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(h) and forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The final petition is worthy of further discussion.  It is No. P00016/18 and was received from Ms Sarah Joyce.  It concerns orchestral provision in Ireland.  The petitioner believes orchestras are an intrinsic part of our culture and is seeking to call a halt to the report by RT&Eacute; on the review of its orchestral provision and the establishment of a national strategy on the matter by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  She believes it is not a matter for RT&Eacute; alone.  We had a discussion on it in the previous session.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, will establish an oversight group, to be chaired by her Department, to begin the discussion on the implementation of RT&Eacute;'s independent report and ensure the successful transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, NCH.  In addition, a working group from RT&Eacute; and the NCH will undertake consultation with the staff concerned.  The issue is worthy of further discussion.</p></speech>

This is one of the most important petitions we have had before us on the provision of orchestras in Ireland.  The nation has been very well served by the National Symphony Orchestra and the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra.  Those of us who sit in the bowels of RT&Eacute; on a Tuesday or Wednesday night while waiting to appear on "The Late Debate" can hear the orchestras practice and sense that the musicians are skilled men and women, professionals, who require our support.  Notwithstanding the conclusions reached in the report which states that, in the national interest, neither of the two orchestras should be closed and understanding the Minister's decision to establish an oversight committee or steering group, it would be timely for the committee to invite the director general of RT&Eacute; to discuss RT&Eacute;'s future plans for orchestral provision.  We should also be looking at the issue of investment in the arts.  Even though there is a commitment by the Government to provide for capital investment in the National Concert Hall, what is a national concert hall if one does not have musicians to perform in it or the ambassadorial representation provided by the two orchestras in travelling around the State and the world? I, therefore, propose that the committee invite the director general to come before it to have that discussion.</p></speech>

It would be a good idea to have the director general of RT&Eacute; come to the joint committee for a further discussion on the matter.  The two orchestras have been part of our culture and heritage for 60 or 70 years.  Like Senator Jerry Buttimer, I have often appeared on "The Late Debate" and heard the orchestras practising while waiting.  I believe it calmed us down.  As the orchestras are very much part of the culture of Ireland, the issue warrants a debate.  We should, therefore, invite the director general of RT&Eacute; to come to the committee for a further discussion on it.  Personally, I would not like to see the demise of the orchestras.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018071100002#B00900"><p>For the purposes of clarification, in some respects the petition has been superseded by the fact that RT&Eacute; has replied to the joint committee with a copy of the independent report published on 23 April.  It is worth going into its content.  It is entitled, RT&Eacute; Orchestras: Ensuring a Sustainable Future, and was produced by the former director of BBC Radio and BBC News, Ms Helen Boaden, with the support of the strategy consulting firm Mediatique.  The review looked at the best way to provide high quality and sustainable orchestral services for the Irish public and covered the National Symphony Orchestra and the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra.  It is important to distinguish between the two.  The report's core conclusion is that it is not in the national interest for either of the two orchestras to be closed and that they should be brought up to full strength.  However, the report also concludes that it is hard to see how RT&Eacute; can fund even the current level of provision, let alone cover the increase in budgets that would be required to enable the orchestras to return to full strength and undertake touring and educational programmes.  It recommends that the National Symphony Orchestra be established as a national cultural institution in its own right, or as part of the National Concert Hall, and be funded by the Government.  I believe committee members are agreeing to a further discussion on the matter.  Many people are confused about what is going on.  Many of us absolutely agree that the output of both orchestras is absolutely vital to Ireland's cultural life, but it is also pertinent for the committee to agree to the suggestion that we invite the director general of RT&Eacute; to come to give us its perspective on the issue.  I propose that we do not close the petition at this point in order that we can have that further discussion.  We can then see what action the committee might take arising from that discussion.</p></speech>

I have made my proposal, not in an adversarial way but, as the Chairman said, to seek clarity on the issue as there is confusion.  We have both met people from Cork who are directly affected by it.  They have a genuine passion and interest in orchestral provision in RT&Eacute; and Ireland.  I am aware that Deputy Eugene Murphy feels the same way.  The proposal has been made to bring clarity and certainty to the matter to try to enhance the debate on it.</p></speech>

I hope the witnesses will forgive the low attendance.  I promise they will be watched.  This is our last week so, as the witnesses can imagine, people will be coming and going.  We are very interested in what they have to say.  Everything will be recorded.  People will be watching and we are delighted that the witnesses are here this morning.  I welcome them all to this meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs to continue our hearings on the topic of tackling childhood obesity.  We will now have presentations from representatives of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland and Food Drink Ireland.  I welcome from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, Mr. Michael O'Keeffe, chief executive, and Mr. Declan McLoughlin, senior manager; from Food Drink Ireland, Mr. Kevin McPartlan, director of prepared consumer foods, and Ms Ailbhe Byrne, executive; and from the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, Ms Orla Twomey, chief executive, and Mr. Michael Lee, assistant chief executive.  I also welcome Members and viewers who may be watching proceedings on Oireachtas TV .</p><p>Before we commence, and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones.  They should at least place them in aeroplane mode because they can cause serious havoc.  I also advise our witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  After the witnesses' presentations there will be questions from the members of the committee.  I invite Mr. O'Keeffe to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, the independent regulator for broadcasting in Ireland, was established under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  We have responsibility for a wide range of activities, including the licensing, regulation and support of independent and public service broadcast media in Ireland.  We have a strategy statement which outlines our mission and vision and a series of strategic themes.  It is in the context of one of those themes, that of empowering audiences, that we develop and review broadcasting codes and rules, assess compliance against these codes and rules, and facilitate complaints from members of the public about broadcasting content.  The codes that are relevant to the debate on childhood obesity are the children&rsquo;s commercial communications code and the general commercial communications code.  I will briefly talk about those codes.  There is more detail in the submission.<br/><br/>The children&rsquo;s commercial communications code deals specifically with advertising, sponsorship, product placement and other forms of commercial promotion aimed at children, including the promotion of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.  We define a child as a person under 18 years of age, although the code recognises that certain communications are aimed at younger age groups.  It also recognises that younger children may need stronger and different types of protections from older children.  There is a range of objectives which support the protection of children and cover a wide range of advertising practices.  In particular, the rules in the code apply to any commercial communication that promotes products, services or activities that are deemed to be of particular interest to children or that are broadcast during and between children&rsquo;s programmes, or both.  The code also applies to communications for products, services, etc., that are of particular interest to children which are broadcast during adult viewing times.<br/><br/>On the rules applying to food advertising, which are the most relevant rules for today's debate, section 11 of the code contains 11 rules that deal specifically with diet and nutrition.  These are outlined in the submission and I can talk about them during the questions and answers session.  It is also important to note that the code contains a range of general rules which apply to all commercial communications.  This means that any advertisement for food products would also have to comply with these general rules as well as the food-specific rules.  In concert, these obligations are intended to ensure a rigorous and proportionate scheme for the protection of children that empowers parents, guardians and members of the public to hold broadcasters to account, while recognising the shared responsibility of broadcasters, parents and guardians to protect the interests of children.  In technical terms, foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt, which we refer to as HSFF foods, are identified by use of a nutrient profiling model.  This model was developed for use by the UK broadcast regulator, OFCOM.  Before being adopted for Irish audiences, it was reviewed and endorsed by an expert working group put together by the BAI, which consisted of representatives from the Department of Health, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Health Service Executive and <i>safe</i>food.<br/><br/>The general commercial communications code, which is the broader code aimed at all programming, complements the children's code.  It sets a range of rules for commercial communications which are broadcast outside of children's programming.  Section 16 of the code includes requirements in respect of food, nutrition and health which are intended to provide additional protection for children.  Irish-based broadcasters are required to comply with both codes.  The BAI also monitors UK opt-out channels.  To explain that, UK opt-out channels are the UK channels which take out the UK advertising and insert Irish advertising.  Sky would be a good example of such a service.  Almost 40 such channels are being carried on the Sky and Virgin platforms in Ireland.  Furthermore, any member of the public is entitled to make a complaint to the BAI.  In practice, the BAI has received a low number of complaints in respect of the food rules and the monitoring the BAI has undertaken has not highlighted any significant issues with their implementation.<br/><br/>In respect of future action, our submission also makes reference to the European audiovisual media services directive, a revised text of which includes the extension of HFSS rules to on-demand and video sharing platform services.</p><p>The revised directive, which has just been agreed at European level is anticipated to be transposed into Irish law before the end of 2020.  There is usually a two-year period from the final publication of the new directive and that should bring us close to the end of 2020.  Later this year, the BAI will undertake a full review of the current rules dealing with food advertising to children.  Any revisions arising from the review will take into account any new requirements resulting from the new European law.  Obviously the BAI will only regulate the broadcast services, but the code will take into account any changes that may occur.  The BAI will also continue to co-operate with State agencies as it has done in the past, including most recently in the development of the codes of practice for the regulation of food marketing in non-broadcast media under the aegis of the Department of Health.</p><p> The BAI appreciates that the audiovisual content and advertisements the public consume can influence culture, attitudes and behaviours that may lead to obesity.  The BAI recognises the Irish public&rsquo;s expectation that broadcasters should conduct themselves in a responsible manner and reflects this sentiment in the codes and standards we implement.  I have gone into much more detail in the submission but have kept my opening statement to the key points.  I will be happy to answer any questions from members.</p></speech>

As an industry, we recognise our responsibility to play a part in meeting the challenge and are determined to do so.  We recognise the same determination in other stakeholders and in this committee and, given the obvious need for legislators, regulators, stakeholders and industry to work together, we are grateful for the invitation to speak to members today. <br/><br/>Our determination to do something about childhood obesity must not, however dilute our commitment to do the right things.  We must ensure we follow evidence rather than emotion.  In A Healthy Weight for Ireland, the Department of Health&rsquo;s obesity policy and action plan, we have a roadmap to reduce obesity across the Irish population.  Step 3 is for Government to &ldquo;secure appropriate support from the commercial sector to play its part in obesity prevention&rdquo; and we are ready, willing and able collaborators. <br/><br/>To inform an evidence-based discussion, I refer the committee to the McKinsey Global Institute, MGI, paper &ldquo;Overcoming obesity: an initial economic analysis&rdquo;.  MGI studied 74 interventions to address obesity in 18 areas that are being discussed or piloted around the world.  It conducted a meta-analysis of research available.  Of the 74 interventions, MGI were able to gather sufficient evidence to estimate what might be the potential cost and impact of 44 interventions.  On the basis of this analysis, MGI has developed a perspective on what it might take to start to reverse rising obesity prevalence in a developed market.  It found the interventions that had the highest level of impact across total population - I know children is the particular interest of this committee - were portion control and reformulation. <br/><br/>Food Drink Ireland recognises the importance of portion size and the key role it plays in achieving a balanced diet.  Portion size is not just a matter of personal responsibility for people deciding how much food to put on their dinner plates.  It is also for industry to be aware of the quantities of product in packages designed to be consumed as one portion.<br/><br/>Food and drink companies have been amending package size to positively impact on dietary intake.  This is particularly the case with products which are commonly consumed &ldquo;on-the-go&rdquo; such as snacks, confectionery, ice-cream and beverages.  FDI is currently in the process of capturing industry&rsquo;s efforts for the first time.  This report on the impact of this on the national diet will be published at the end of 2018.<br/><br/>In relation to reformulation, or to put it simply, the changing of recipes, in 2016 the Irish food industry became the first in the world to publish exact details of the impact of reformulation on the dietary intake of a nation.  The FDI-Creme global reformulation project report was launched by then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and proved conclusively the positive impact industry efforts have had on consumption.  I have provided copies of the full report to all members.  It showed that during the seven years from 2005 to 2012 covered by the research: salt content of the products analysed reduced by 37%; sugar content fell by 14%; the amount of energy as measured in calories sold over the seven years to 2012 reduced by 12%; and both total fat and saturated fat intake reduced by approximately 10%.<br/><br/>Beverage companies alone took 10 billion calories out of the annual Irish diet between 2005 and 2012.  Some 10% of all sugar contributed to the Irish diet by soft drinks was also reduced in these seven years.  This was achieved through voluntary action years ahead of the Department of Health&rsquo;s call to work with industry on a roadmap for reformulation targets.  Industry has dynamically reduced fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar content through voluntary innovation alone such as, for example, a salt reduction programme that was run over ten years in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and which slowly but surely lead to dramatically reduced salt levels across a wide range of product categories.  Phase 2 of the FDI reformulation project is under way and results of the further positive work undertaken by FDI members will be published in late 2018.<br/><br/>PCF also recognises the importance of responsible marketing practices.  In October 2015, and per action 3.2 of A Healthy Weight for Ireland, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, announced the appointment of Professor Alan Reilly to chair a working group to develop a code of practice for food marketing, promotion and sponsorship.  The working group included representatives from the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Food Drink Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, <i>safe</i>food - the Food Safety Promotion Board, Healthy Food For All, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the HSE.  On 14 February 2018, the Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, Deputy Catherine Byrne, launched the voluntary codes.  The purpose of the codes, which have been agreed with the food industry, is to ensure that foods high in fat, salt and sugar are marketed in a responsible way.  In particular the codes seek to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate marketing, advertising or sponsorship associated with these kinds of food and drink products, and that healthier food choices are actively promoted.<br/><br/>FDI welcomed the publication by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  Food and drink companies are committed to responsible marketing.  The focus now must be on effective implementation.  Food Drink Ireland, FDI has called on the Minister of State to quickly bring together the key participants to develop the promised technical guidance document which advertisers, rights owners, media outlets and advertising practitioners now need to bring the voluntary codes of practice to life. <br/><br/>It is also important to note that these codes sit alongside and complement existing voluntary and statutory measures with which industry complies, to ensure the responsible marketing of food to the public.  These include the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI's general children&rsquo;s commercial communications code, the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland's code of standards for advertising and marketing communications in Ireland, the World Federation of Advertisers&rsquo; EU pledge and companies&rsquo; own internal codes of conduct.<br/><br/>Any single intervention is likely to have only a small overall impact on its own.  FDI welcomes the Government&rsquo;s whole-of-school approach in A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025<i>.</i>However, the Government could be investing in measures such as home economics classes, school sports clubs, access to green spaces and better infrastructure to allow for cycling and walking to and from school. <br/><br/>We applaud the committee's determination to tackle childhood obesity and share its commitment.  We believe that broad collaboration between all stakeholders is necessary to effectively address the issue.  The food and drink industry will remain fully dedicated to identifying and pursuing initiatives which will positively contribute to the health and well-being of all people in Ireland.  We will continue to seek credible evidence to identify effective interventions and will be unstinting in their application.  We recognise the important role we can play in addressing the issue and will not be found wanting in our dedication to play it.</p></speech>

I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to present on the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, ASAI.  I am accompanied this morning by my colleague, Mr. Michael Lee.</p> <p>  The ASAI, established in 1981 by the advertising industry, sets, enforces and regulates the highest standards of advertising in Ireland in the interests of consumers, society and of the advertising industry.  The ASAI structure comprises a board of 15 directors, an independent complaints committee comprising 14 members and an executive for strategic and operational undertakings.  The basic premise of the ASAI code is that of the International Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s marketing code, namely, all advertising should be legal, decent, honest and truthful.  The ASAI code, in its seventh edition, was the subject of wide consultation with Departments, including the Departments for Health and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, non-governmental organisations, interest groups and the advertising industry, as well as a public consultation process.  The code takes account of national and European legislation affecting advertising.  Reviewing the advertising codes in other jurisdictions ensures that we are informed by global best practice.</p> <p>  In its 37 years, ASAI has examined over 30,000 advertising complaints, resulting in 7,500 adjudications.  Advertising that is in breach of the code has to be amended or withdrawn and, crucially, our media members enforce our decisions in order that advertisements in breach are no longer published.</p> <p>  Moreover, we publish the complaints committee&rsquo;s adjudications which is a "name and shame" sanction.</p><p>Adverse publicity is unwelcome to advertisers and generally has a remedial effect on future advertising, as negative publicity can result in penalties through reputational impact and reduced return on advertising spend.  Ultimately, we experience a compliance rate of 98%.</p><p> The code has general and truthfulness rules, as well as a range of specific issue and sectoral rules.  The code provides particular care for advertising that depicts, is addressed to and likely to be of interest to children.  For instance, there are restrictions on advertisement content for food products targeted directly at preschool and primary school children.  For children under 16 years, advertisements, except those for fresh fruit or fresh vegetables should not seem to encourage children to eat or drink a product only to take advantage of a promotional offer and should not encourage children to eat more than they otherwise would.  Advertisements for alcohol products should not be directed at children or in any way encourage them to start drinking and should not use or refer to identifiable heroes or heroines of the young.  It is evident from complaints received, and our compliance monitoring, that food and alcohol advertisers have demonstrated a high level of compliance with the ASAI code.</p><p> Notwithstanding the level of child obesity issues, the ASAI receives very few related complaints.  In the past five years as few as 9% of total complaints received related to food advertising, with complaints primarily made on grounds of being misleading or containing offensive content.</p><p> The Advertising Standards Authority in the UK carried out a consultation on food advertising to children in 2016.  It stated, following the consultation, the evidence indicated that advertisements promoting foods containing high amount of fat, salt and sugar have a modest effect on children's immediate food preferences.  The evidence also indicated that parental and peer influence, schools policy and sedentary lifestyles were the main factors that drive obesity.</p><p> The ASAI's approach is to collaborate broadly.  For example, we were a key stakeholder in the development of the Department of Health's voluntary codes of practice for non-broadcast media advertising and marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages that were introduced earlier this year.  The ASAI's code is child-centric.  Our systems are robust and compliance is high.  We actively consider developments in the market and introduce new code rules, when appropriate.  The ASAI's approach is to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the code is as relevant as possible.</p><p> I thank the members for their time and for the opportunity to present to the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018071100002#E00500"><p>I might ask a few questions and then come back in as just four members are present.  I do not know how much time is allowed but I shall be guided by the Vice Chairman.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. O'Keeffe and the rest of the witnesses.  I cannot speak for others but I do not think that childhood obesity is solely caused by sugar or advertisements.  All of us here have heard a lot of information about what potentially leads to obesity.  On the face of it, the solution seems simple in the sense that one will not gain weight if one does not eat too much and make time to exercise.  However, obesity can be due to emotional reasons.  The causes of obesity are complex and it is hard to address, especially for policymakers.  </p> <p>  In the context of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, recently I did a bit of work on online advertising.  I do not mean to be disrespectful of the work done by the BAI by stating we need to address the fact that children are digital natives and so see online advertisements.  It is no wonder there are so few complaints because, to my understanding, children do not watch as much television as used to be the case when many of us were younger.  There are no tangible statistics but it naturally follows that marketing companies actively target children online which must have an impact, in terms of the clever ways marketing companies associate certain products with sports stars etc. online.  I seek Mr. O'Keeffe's comments on that point, although it is relevant to all the witnesses.    </p></speech>

That situation will change due to the AVMS directive and the revised directive contains a specific reference in this regard.  The AVMS directive has been endorsed by the trilogue, that is, the Commission, the European Parliament and Council of Ministers.  I expect the directive will be finalised by the end of the year at the latest, if not sooner.  Responsibility will then lie with members, as legislators, because the directive must be implemented.  As things currently stand, the Broadcasting Act covers traditional broadcasting.</p></speech>

The likes of Facebook and YouTube will come under some form of regulation but legislation is required, which will take between 18 months to two years to pass through the Oireachtas.  That is how one will address the matter, from a legislative point of view.  That does not take away from the fact that the matter is currently addressed in the ASAI through its mechanisms.</p></speech>

Members only have a certain amount of time to ask questions and, therefore, I aim to cover as much as I can.</p> <p>  I have met Mr. McPartlan before and know about his work.  I congratulate the industry on the reformulation.  I was an advocate for a sugar tax.  I am not necessarily interested in the tax but in the fact that the industry, even in advance of the introduction of a sugar tax, had responded very positively to reformulating their products.  There is an argument on whether sweeteners are good but the initiative sought to reduce the amount of calories in people's diets in order to tackle obesity.  </p> <p>  Mr. McPartlan stated his organisation shares our commitment to tackling childhood obesity.  It is with the greatest respect that I say many of the companies he represents report to their shareholders, whose aim is to make money.  I would like to know the percentage of money that his members spend on online marketing.  Does he have information or interesting statistics in that regard?  I have a particular interest in the online area because I feel that it is the only show in town.</p></speech>

Let us be frank.  The vast bulk of soft drinks, which are covered by the sugar tax, are not produced in Ireland.  The market in Ireland is so small that Irish legislation will not make a fundamental difference to the formulation of products.  Reformulation has been happening for more than 30 years and we are capturing the data.  It would be false to portray that as a response to the introduction of a sugar tax.</p></speech>

I do not have such information.  Equally, expenditure varies.  We represent 150 companies.  Some companies spend nothing on online yet others will spent the bulk of their budget on it.  I do not wish to mislead her by making an ill-informed guess.</p></speech>

The matter will be covered in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  I am of the view that we should have a public health (obesity) Bill when it comes to advertising, especially online.  I do not think that we have done enough in this space to tackle the obesity epidemic, notwithstanding the lifestyle choices, sedentary lifestyles etc. that have been mentioned.  All of that is hugely relevant and I do not take from that.</p> <p>  Ms Twomey mentioned there has been a high level of compliance in broadcast media.</p><p>In the context of what I asked Mr. O'Keeffe, will Ms Twomey comment on how she thinks online issues might be addressed in the short term while we await legislation to regulate?</p></speech>

This is because the ASAI code goes across all media, including broadcast media.  We have a very broad online remit.  We cover paid-for advertising online and posts on companies' own pages.  The challenge regarding online advertising is that our viewing experiences tend to be individual to ourselves.  Approximately 40% of complainants mention that they have seen material online as well on television or in print, so they complain about multiple media.  We are very conscious that parents might not see what children are seeing.  How we address this is a challenge, and I am not sure if there is an easy answer.  People know that the ASAI is here to complain to and we are very easy to find, so if parents have concerns about advertising their children are seeing, they can complain to us, we can approach the advertisers and we can get copies of the advertising.</p></speech>

There is a nexus between children and parents that is not clear.  Who would complain and would they complain if they saw it?  The act of complaining takes some effort and I am not sure if it happens as much as it might in those circumstances.</p></speech>

Senator Noone is absolutely right.  The fact that people complain is not central to her argument.</p> <p>  Ms Twomey said that only 9% of complaints in the past five years relate to food advertising.  Following on from what Senator Noone said, is that because of the ignorance regarding food, sugar, etc.?  Ms Twomey referred to only 7,000 adjudications in respect of 30,000 complaints.  Without naming a brand, company or product, will Ms Twomey give an example of the type of complaint involved?</p> <p>  Mr. McPartlan represents many companies that probably make a good few bob.  Does his company or any of the others contribute to research in childhood obesity or help organisation that try to deal with this, such as charities?  That would make sense.</p></speech>

We received over 30,000 complaints but not all were within the remit of the code.  Sometimes we receive complaints on packaging or non-commercial advertising but these do not fall within our remit.  Sometimes there is no basis to a complaint or we work with the advertisers to amend the advertising, which means there is no need to have a formal adjudication.  We see our role as one of ensuring that advertising is either amended or withdrawn.  We achieve that either through negotiation with the advertiser if there is something that can be easily done to make the advertisement compliant or by means of a formal adjudication of our complaints committee in cases where there may be a precedent involved.  The process we go through for investigation is quite robust.</p> <p>  The percentage I provided in respect of complaints in respect of food advertising relates to all such advertising.  We do not have a mechanism in the system to easily extract which foods might be considered to be high in fat, salt and sugar.  That is a challenge.  However, I looked at the figures and made a somewhat informed and educated guesstimate.  Where food is the product complained about, the basis of the complaint might relate to a misleading price or to content that a parent might find offensive for a child to see.  As a result, it might not relate specifically to the fact that the product is food - it could be any product.  I estimate that 40% of the complaints involved related to products that could be considered high in fat, salt and sugar.  The other 60% related to products which would not be considered high in fat, salt and sugar.  Of those complaints which related to children - whether it was that children were referred to in the advertisement or the complaint - I estimate that 19 were in respect of children and products that were high in fat, salt and sugar.  The number is very small.</p></speech>

We were coming to the end of a two-year process and needed to finalise the code.  We introduced rules that would reduce the impact of advertising on pre-primary and primary school children.  Advertisements that are targeted through the content - that is, those which are targeted at pre-primary and primary school children through the use of colours, music or engagement - cannot involve a promotional element and cannot use licensed characters.  We said at the time that we would revisit the introduction of rules that would specifically reference products that are high in fat, salt and sugar.  Shortly after we launched the code, however, the Department of Health announced its process to look at non-broadcast codes.  We became part of that process and worked with the working group.  Those rules have been launched.  We are aware that the Department of Health is currently preparing a tender document on the compliance and monitoring of those rules.  We are keeping a watching brief.  We will need to examine how our rules align to those rules and do not need to wait for another full code review to do so.  We can amend rules once we are certain how it is progressing but we do not want to have a conflict between the two codes.  We are aware that we will need to look at them again.</p></speech>

It can write to us and we will include it in one of our discussions.  To be honest, there could be a very bland, boring advertisement about a food product that could have a high fat and sugar content.  It is not enough to just look at what the advertisement looks like.  The measuring of the fat, sugar and so on is far more important.  The ASAI would be brilliant at doing the latter so it should take it on board.  I ask that the ASAI write to us in respect of this matter and we will have a further discussion.</p> <p>  Will Mr. McPartlan respond to the question I put to him.</p></speech>

The three organisations here were part of that working group.  We spent two years on it and it was very tough to get agreement.  Our members came a long way and it is frustrating for everyone involved that is stalled.  I share the Vice Chairman's frustration.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman asked about industry's investment in other interventions.  We are in a difficult position.</p><p>Food Drink Ireland does not do so because we are a representative body that speaks on behalf of its members.  Individual members do all sorts of things and are involved in a great deal of corporate social responsibility at local, regional and national level.  It is difficult to say whether they would get involved in research projects relating to obesity.  If a row of academics were lined up here to speak to the committee and one was entirely funded by the food industry, I am sure members would feel that his or her evidence was not terribly credible.  I disagree about that, because scientific rigour should be applied and research should stand on its own two feet, regardless of who is picking up the tab, but that does not seem to be a commonly held view.  Companies tend not to do that because it can make the resultant reports seem less credible.  Food Drink Ireland paid for the reformulation report which I have given to the committee today.  It cost many hundreds of thousands of euro to produce as there is a savage amount of data involved.  We are collecting the data for a second iteration and we are nine months into that.  It needs to go into a black box and be analysed against the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, IUNA, data.  It is ultimately paid for by members of the Food Drink Ireland health initiative.</p><p> The spend tends not to be on academic research but there is a lot of community activity.  For example, many summer camps are supported by food and drink companies, something in respect of which there is often criticism.  As Senator Noone stated, it is complex but it is a question of energy in versus energy out.  We are part of energy in and we are encouraging people to get the energy out.</p></speech>

It would set a very good example if it were to support a child obesity clinic.  The saddest child in the world is one who is obese.  Does Mr. McPartlan realise how few people read reports?  He should consider that in the future.</p></speech>

Really detailed research has been undertaken into the most effective interventions for obesity and number one is portion size, which is a combination of deciding how much one puts on one's plate and if one buys an ice cream for dessert, what is on the end of the stick.  Reformulation is the most significant impact the industry can have and we have total control over that with huge investment going into it.  The cost of a new line for a product, or to produce a variant of an existing product such as one with reduced fat, salt or sugar, is huge in terms of time and money, involving millions of euro per product.</p></speech>

In addition to analysing the impact of reformulation it will look at two other things, namely, the impact of package size changes and fortification.  Reformulation is not just about what is taken out.  There may be an increased need for particular nutrients and we are also capturing data from food companies fortifying their products.  Putting on the green jersey seems to have been quite unpopular in recent weeks but Ireland is the only country in the world which has a report along these lines and that is because of the IUNA data.  They allow us to look not just at the quantities of nutrients sold but at those consumed.  We presented the document at the OECD.  It is a very significant piece of work in an area in which Ireland is leading the world.</p></speech>

Senator Noone referred to the online world but my hobbyhorse is "The Big Big Movie".  The latter is broadcast at 6.30 p.m. on a Saturday, which is family viewing time, is sponsored by a particular fast food outlet that also has intermittent advertisements throughout the broadcast.  I have a huge problem with that and I wonder where the codes and standards of the broadcasting industry sit within that.  Adults watch the movie but most who watch it are aged under 18 and it is geared specifically at children.  The fast food outlet targets children and influences their behaviour.  I take on board the notion of food in and food out, as well as parent responsibility, but what is the responsibility of the industry which allows this to happen?  I direct my questions and Mr. O'Keeffe and Ms Twomey.  I would like the answer to this question before I move on.</p></speech>

The way it works is that the 50% is almost a technical measure so when broadcasters are planning future programming they can look at trends in children's viewing and identify which programmes will have more than 50%.  In practice they tend to be children's programming in the traditional sense, what one sees in the morning or during children's programming streams.  That is where that works.  It means if one were to get significant numbers of children watching, which is a slightly separate issue, one would be coming much lower on the percentage.  There is the issue of how many children are watching versus how much of the audience is made up of children.  There might be a small number of children watching but they would make up more than 50% of the audience because it is a children's programme and that is the only audience.  One finds that if there is a programme that is very popular with children, such as during the family viewing time or the World Cup, there might be significantly higher numbers of individual children watching but they would not make up half of the audience.  One of the issues to examine in the review is whether we should be regulating family viewing time as a result of that.</p> <p>  The children's code is focused on children.  It considers children who may be unaccompanied or where there are particular products such as toys that are targeted at them directly-----</p></speech>

There is that mixture of where children may be watching on their own and, therefore, need particular protection or where they are watching with family, where the view of the code is that there is a shared responsibility between broadcasters, parents and guardians.  That complaint raises an issue that we will have to examine in the review of the code.</p></speech>

I was struck by Mr. McPartlan comment to the effect that we must follow evidence rather than emotion.  I will put forward some evidence and ask him for his opinion on it.  The total lifetime cost of childhood obesity to the State is estimated at &euro;4.6 billion.  There is a further estimated annual healthcare cost of &euro;1.7 million.  Another alarming figure from <i>safe</i>food research is that an estimated  55,056 children currently living in the State are overweight.  My colleagues and I consider this figure to be very alarming.  The World Obesity Federation predicts that by 2025 some 241,000 schoolchildren in Ireland will be overweight or obese.  That is not emotion, it is evidence.  Does Mr. McPartlan think the consequences for the future health of children in Ireland look quite dire?</p></speech>

When I say we need to look at evidence rather than emotion I am referring to evidence for what will be an effective intervention.  Nobody is denying the scale of the problem or that we need to address it.  I am suggesting that sometimes the debate gets lost in the emotion rather than looking at what will work.  We know what will work because there has been decent research on it.</p></speech>

He commented on a whole-school approach and said that the Government should be investing in measures such as home economics classes, school sports clubs, access to green space, better infrastructure and so forth.  However, throughout his submission he ignored the school environment.  He ignored vending machines in schools, tuck shops, soft drinks machines in schools and sponsorship of school teams by food companies, all under the veil of advertising.  In addition, when children are not in the school environment but outside the school there are advertisements on bus shelters and McDonalds branches in the proximity of schools.  Mr. McPartlan spoke about making home economics mandatory in schools.  Does he not think it is disjointed to talk about teaching children in the classroom yet it is not followed in the school environment?  Can he address that in the context of the joined-up approach he mentioned?</p></speech>

In the three-page document in which we presented our opening statement, one paragraph refers to schools.  The reason it is one paragraph is that I cannot control what happens in a school, nor can the food industry.  We are talking about our responsibility and the role we can play, are playing and will continue to play.  We mentioned the schools issue as part of the support for the A Healthy Weight for Ireland route map, which refers to a whole-of-school approach.  It is not that I am unaware of the importance of schools in this, but the reason we did not focus heavily on it in our document is that to do so would be for us to abdicate responsibility.  We want to play our role and do what we can.  We can talk reformulation, packaging and marketing codes.</p> <p>  I will deal with each of the Deputy's points.</p><p> Vending machines in schools were mentioned.  No member of Food Drink Ireland and no food company of which I am aware in Ireland operates vending machines in schools.</p></speech>

How people put them into markets is not something we control.  Members of Food Drink Ireland do own and operate vending machines, but none of them, categorically, does so in schools.  Flat-out 0% of vending machines in schools are operated by food and drink companies in Ireland.</p></speech>

Let us be real.  If we are to talk about a school approach, we need to be serious.  The companies Mr. McPartlan's organisation represents are supplying the products in the machines.</p></speech>

Retailers then come to the wholesalers, take the products off the shelves and sell them in whatever way they sell them.  We are not in the business of having end user licences for food products.  We sell into the supply chain and do not have control over who buys or how they retail them.</p> <p>  One point I forgot to address made by Senator Catherine Noone was about expenditure on advertising compared with the spend on other things.  The reputational damage is significant if food companies are attacked for having products in schools.  The reason none of the food companies puts its stuff into schools is that it does not think it is an appropriate place and it knows that there is reputational damage involved.  I do not think any member of Food Drink Ireland would be unhappy not to have products in vending machines in schools.  It is not something over which we have any control.  If I gave the committee some reassurance, it would be disingenuous because I do not have any control over it.</p></speech>

Does she think it really is a deterrent?  I do not think it is, if someone breaches something and his or her name goes up online.  Surely there should be some fine or sanction.  Would that not be more appropriate?  It is a case of seeking forgiveness rather than permission.</p></speech>

It is easy to underestimate how strongly companies feel about their brand reputation.  To be associated with a finding that they have either misled or offended their audience is not something about which most companies would be happy.  We do know from discussions with companies that an adjudication before the complaints committee for decision is reported at the very highest levels.  Obviously, sometimes we will have companies that like to court publicity, but that happens very rarely.  The naming and shaming sanction is very powerful.  It is being used by many regulatory organisations, whether they are statutory or self-regulatory.</p> <p>  The other thing about our sanction is that advertising that is in breach of the regulations has to be amended or withdrawn.  Small companies have very small marketing budgets and if they have to withdraw an advertisement, it is investment they can no longer leverage.  It is the same with large companies.  Television advertisements are very expensive to produce creatively; therefore, they are left with a piece of collateral that they cannot use.  The advertisements are not made to be used as a once-off.  Companies will invest in their marketing strategy over six to 12 months or perhaps even longer and will want to reuse advertisements over that time.  It is not just about the reputational damage.

It is a self-regulatory body set up by the advertising industry 37 years ago.  I do not believe there is a conflict because ultimately we have a complaints committee with an independent chairperson and a majority of members not associated with the industry.  The complaints committee sees the formal decisions we bring to it.  We also bring a sample of cases to it on a regular basis in order that it can be happy that when we are deciding to deal with something informally, we are doing so in line with the expected standards.  The adjudications we have published on our website show that we act in a manner that is consistent across all advertisers.  It is a matter of whether the content of the ad breaches the code.  Actually who the advertiser is is not particularly relevant to us.  What is relevant is the content and what the code states.</p></speech>

As I stated, we looked at that when we did our last code review on high fat high sugar rules.  After a two-year consultation, we were at the stage where we needed to launch the new code but we undertook at the time that we would come back on this.  The Department of Health and the working group process started at that point, however, and we became involved in that.  We were not trying to shy away from this area.  Rather than having parallel approaches, we felt it was better to see where the Department of Health approach went and to work with that.</p></speech>

We touched on this already when sporting programmes and matches were mentioned.  In the hurling championship matches leading up to the all-Ireland final, including many of the matches shown on media, there is major input from a certain fast food company based in a county that is likely to win the all-Ireland.  We all know which company I am talking about.  This seems to be a cloudy issue.  I have so many points I want to make, I am getting a little muddled.  Will the witnesses comment on the fact that the broadcasting code seems to allow fast food companies and a particular massive fast food company to advertise heavily during programmes?  Sponsorship is a different issue and I understand that.  What do the witnesses have to say about that?</p></speech>

I spoke about that earlier.  Not more than 25% of total advertising or ad breaks can be for that type of material.  There cannot be a massive splurge of advertising but such companies are permitted to advertise in programmes that are not children's programmes.</p></speech>

Drink was mentioned as well and this is similar.  There is a restriction on the amount of alcohol advertising permitted and the same applies to high fat high sugar food advertising.  When we say the maximum is 25%, it would rarely be anywhere approaching that.</p></speech>

I am flabbergasted by the rationale applied.  It brings me back to the point that Mr. McLoughlin made.  Why are we tracking the percentage of children online and watching particular programmes?  How can we possibly know the number of children watching?  The ratings system was explained but it seems nebulous at best.  Are there detailed statistics as to how these figures are arrived at?  Not many adults I know are watching the big movie on a Saturday afternoon, which is clearly geared towards children.  How the witnesses can tell me with straight faces they believe less than 50% of the people watching those programmes are children is beyond me.  I am flabbergasted.</p></speech>

The BAI uses the TAM media data, which is the industry standard.  I do not know the full details because we have no responsibility over it but a panel of individuals and households tracks viewing by individual members of a household.  That is fed into a database and then used by television broadcasters and advertisers to plan advertising campaigns based on demographics, gender, age and all the usual factors.  That approach is internationally recognised and accepted as the standard by television broadcasters and audiences.  How it works brings us back to the point that a different way of looking at it may be necessary because as the audience gets bigger the percentage of children gets lower.  For example, while "The Late Late Toy Show" has a high number of children watching, the percentage of children watching is nowhere near 50% of the audience.  The audience profile looks at children's programming, rather family viewing and other programming.</p> <p>  Advertising for high fat high sugar food during those programmes is not unregulated.  It is prohibited for children's programming and a series of content rules apply in respect of promotional offers, licensed characters-----</p></speech>

The Chair referred to conflict and I see a conflict here.  Broadcasters are trying to determine who is watching television to plan their programming and they have to sell advertising.

Is he telling me that these tests are not in some way facilitative for broadcasters to allow certain advertising to be shown during those programmes that is not ideal?</p></speech>

Broadcasters and advertisers are allowed to advertise to children and to target children with their advertising.  These companies are legal.

For example, with the new code, high fat high sugar foods cannot be advertised to children during children's programming.  That is a significant change.  When our predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, introduced its rules in 2006, we were ahead of any European country.</p></speech>

Virtually all of the company's cereals are laden with sugar.  While there is good work being done in the c&uacute;l camps, should Kellogg's sponsorship of these camps be avoided?</p></speech>

It is one category of food and drink products which is being unfairly criticised.  The common view of the formulation of those products is at odds with the facts.  That would be worth looking at.</p></speech>

There is no question that breakfast cereals are full of sugar and it does not take a scientist to come to that conclusion.  Porridge is the only cereal that does not have an amount of sugar in it, apart from natural sugars.  Even the products that are sold as being healthy have a disproportionate amount of sugar.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Twomey to answer that question.

More work could be done on that but from an online behavioural advertising point of view, there are restrictions about targeting advertisements at those aged under 13.  I can provide more information on that.</p></speech>

One of this committee's key recommendations is to seek an increase in the percentage budget allocation for mental health services.  Substantial improvement in funding have been made, as can be seen from an allocation of &euro;737 million in 2013 compared with an allocation of &euro;912 million in 2018, which represents a 28% increase in funding over the course of those six years.  Notwithstanding that, the spend on mental health services is only 6% of the overall health budget.  We have heard that from the various organisations that have made presentations before this committee.  The lack of funding for services is a significant barrier to people accessing services.  What does the Minister intend to do to increase funding for mental health services?  Representatives of Mental Health Reform, who appeared before the committee a few weeks ago, strongly advocated for an increase in the mental health budget.  I strongly believe we need to do that.  Will the Minister outline the efforts he is making to increase the mental health budget in the upcoming budget and over the course of the next few years?</p> <p>  One barrier to the rolling out of an efficient mental health service is the lack of a proper, efficient information technology, IT, infrastructure within the Department of Health with a director of services and managers to monitor the spend on services, manage referrals and chase up issues.  Will the Minister outline the ongoing work to deliver a proper IT system?  Until we have that we will not get to grips with where money is being spent and not being spent in terms of dealing with the various issues.</p> <p>  I was particularly taken with a presentation by Dr. Harry Barry to the committee a few weeks ago on talk therapy and people's access to it.  He put forward a model on improving access to psychological therapy that has been rolled out in England that he proposed could be used as a template in Ireland.  It emanated from that engagement that we have a total reliance on psychiatric services to get access to services.  A person needs to be able to engage with such services at the very outset, as well as the end of the process.  It would benefit people if they had better access to talk therapy and to cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, in particular.  I know people who are attending day hospitals in my constituency in County Clare and they were not referred for CBT.  Eventually they got access to that therapy by another means and, as a result, they have transformed their lives.  There is a shortcoming in that respect.  The Minister needs to home in on the lack of speedy access to talk therapy and I ask him to indicate what he intends to do about it.</p> <p>  I was also quite taken with a presentation made to the committee a few weeks ago on the issue of the recruitment and retention of staff.  We were told there were 24 different stages to recruiting an individual to a particular post.  That process is very unwieldy.  It just does not work.  It means that when a post becomes available, it may not be filled for many years.  What does the Minister intend to reduce the period within which posts can be filled?  He referred in his opening statement to new and innovative approaches to recruiting staff.  Will he expand on what he is doing in that regard?</p></speech>

I thank members for asking me to appear before the committee.  I am pleased to be here with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I thank Deputy Carey for his questions.  He is right that the budget for mental health services has significantly increased year on year.  In fairness, there is a recognition across the political divide that this needs to happen in good economic times and in bad.  We have all been committed to increasing the budget and, therefore, the budget this year stands at a non-capital figure of &euro;910.6 million compared with &euro;853.1 million in 2017, &euro;826 million a year earlier and &euro;791 million the year before that, right back to &euro;711 million in 2012.  Even during difficult years we continued to increase the budget, but the Deputy is right in saying it needs to increase further.  That is why I have already co-signed a letter with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, which was sent to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I believe a copy was shared with members of this committee and, if not, I can make sure it is, as well as with Mental Health Reform, whose representatives I know are following these proceedings.  The letter commits to increasing the budget by at least &euro;55 million net next year to fulfil commitments we have given in the programme for Government and in the confidence and supply agreement; commitments which everybody here would like to see fulfilled.  I agree the budget will have to continue to increase.</p> <p> The Deputy is right in what he said about the IT infrastructure.  That issue is not specific to mental health services but I can see how it is a challenge.  In the capital plan, the Government has funded the roll-out of our full e-health strategy.  I admit this is one of the areas in which we are really lagging behind and we will develop infrastructures similar to those being recommended by the Oireachtas committee.  The provision of basic desktop technology is now under way as part of the IT improvement plan for mental health services.  E-rostering will be in place within this year.  However, the implementation of the integrated mental health information system will have to be part of the e-health record roll-out, on which work is under way.</p> <p>  Regarding Dr. Barry's contribution to the committee on the issue of talk therapy, I agree with the Deputy and I am sure we would all agree it is very important that we direct the appropriate level of support based on the acuity.  Therefore, we do not need to have  a model - the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is passionate about this -  that is purely centred on the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, we also need to examine other interventions.  That is why, in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and others, we have seen the roll-out of the assistant psychologist post - 114 of them - last week and the announcement of ten advanced nurse practitioners, along with the 22 additional psychologists, basically to try to make sure that less complex cases can be dealt with through that setting, thus trying to create additional capacity in CAMHS for more acute issues.</p> <p>  Deputy Carey raised the important issue of recruitment.  Whether I am here today or before the Joint Committee on Health, which Deputy Harty chairs, we know there are ongoing recruitment and particularly retention challenges regarding the health service.  I was disappointed that some of the exchanges today at the Joint Committee on Health seemed to prejudge the outcome of the Public Service Pay Commission process.  In terms of nurses' pay, doctors' pay or other people's pay in the public sector, we should allow the Public Service Pay Commission do its work rather than predetermining the outcome on a political basis.  We asked the Public Service Pay Commission to set that up because we recognise there is both a recruitment and a retention difficulty in our health service and I thought that was recognised across the political divide.  As part of that process we will be led by the Public Service Pay Commission in terms of its suggestions regarding how we can improve recruitment and retention.  I tried to cover those question within the set time.</p></speech>

Mental health is a massive issue and more funding needs to be allocated to mental health services.  I note the Minister has committed to increasing the mental health budget by &euro;55 million in 2019, which will be additional to the &euro;910 million budget for this year.  There are nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, all of which are allocated differing levels of funding.  Many CHOs are not getting the level of funding they should get.  CHO 5 covers my area and I have dealt with two cases recently.  There is a 44-bed psychiatric unit in Kilkenny and during the Christmas period, more than 50 people used the services and they had to be accommodated on mattresses in the unit.  A few weeks ago, the same thing happened.  There are not enough beds in the psychiatric unit in Kilkenny and it is unacceptable.  I raised this issue with CHO 5.</p><p>I asked whether we could get funding for additional beds in CHO 5 and was told, "No".  We need extra beds because there are people on couches and mattresses.  That has happened twice this year, which is unacceptable.  </p><p> CAMHS users aged between 17 and 18 years in Carlow are being sent to south east Galway because we do not have the service in Carlow.  Last year, 87 children were placed in adult beds in psychiatric units, which is unacceptable. </p><p> Recently the self-harm intervention programme, SHIP, was tried out in the south east.  I do not know if it was implemented in other areas.  People still waiting to use the service.  Parents have told me they are waiting and that is unacceptable.  It worries me that we hear more money will be put in.  Where is it going?  What is it spent on?  There are many people in my area waiting to get into CAMHS to see psychiatrists and doctors.  There is a massive waiting list.  There is one doctor in Carlow, and we need more.  I can only focus on my area, although this discussion will deal with all areas.  There are massive problems.  I want to know about the funding, the services and the ages.  Children aged between 16 and 18 years are falling between stools.  The service is not there for them.  One client from Carlow has to go to Galway for services.  His mother and father have to travel there to visit him.  It is unacceptable that we have nowhere for him to go in Carlow. </p><p> There are many questions I would like to ask.  I know there is a problem in recruitment but we need more nurses and psychiatrists.  Nurses are put to the pin of the collar.  We need to work on recruitment.  It is sad that 'A Vision for Change' did not work.  We need to make sure that this new vision will work. </p></speech>

The members will talk about their own constituencies and I do not blame Senator Murnane O'Connor for that because they are getting it in the neck day and night about the problems with this service.  Would the Minister like to answer the Senator's questions?</p></speech>

It is right and proper that people bring them up because they are the tangible, real examples of what this means to people on the ground.</p> <p>  On the issue of funding I have committed to the need to increase the budget next year and we have committed to adding &euro;55 million.  The Senator asked about equitable distribution and how to make sure each region or area is getting a fair share.  I am due to visit Kilkenny this month and will meet the CHO officials.  I will make it my business to put mental health on the agenda for that discussion.  There is a recognition that we need approximately 20 additional beds in the Senator's area for CHO 5.  I understand the HSE is working on a plan to deliver that.  I will certainly get a more detailed answer for her.  We recognise that there is a shortage of approximately 20 beds in CHO 5.  I will work directly with the Senator to update her on that.  The opening of the new central mental hospital will provide not just additional beds but forensic beds under CAMHS as well.  The reorientation of the service to different levels of intervention is an important way to go.  I will update the Senator after I meet CHO 5, which I expect to be in the next ten days or so.</p></speech>

I do not think money alone will improve patient care, particularly in psychiatry but also in the health service in general.  When will reform of the HSE and the Department of Health to streamline delivery of care start?  There has been no reform since this Government took power.  More money in an inefficient system will not deliver better care.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has proposed that we engage in telepsychiatry to address our recruitment and retention issues because we have difficulty recruiting all grades of staff.  When, where and how will that happen? </p> <p>  Does the Minister recognise the false economy of rationing health spending by limiting access for patients?  Rather than try to reform the entire service, particularly the mental health services, I propose that the Minister adequately fund a certain area and pilot schemes so that he could see the return he would get for fully recruited and manned community psychiatry teams.  CHO 3 in the mid-west would be an ideal area to pilot this because it is the only area in the country where the hospital group and the CHO area coincide.  We need pilot schemes to prove that this works.  </p> <p>  Does he think he will be remembered as a reforming Minister for Health when his tenure finishes because he has so many plans and has been given so many expert opinions but there has been no implementation of health reform?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018071100002#D00600"><p>How long do I have?  First, I am not intending to go anywhere and we have a confidence and supply agreement in place for three budgets and then we want to talk about a renewal, so who knows when anyone's tenure will come to an end.  I would be happy to come back when I have more time talk about the plans we are working on in health and some of the progress we are making in some challenging areas.  Around the world, healthcare is becoming more demanding and we have to challenge ourselves to come up with new and innovative ways to deliver it.  We are making progress in several areas in the healthcare system.  I do not wish to go into them all because that would go beyond the committee's remit and that would be unfair to members.</p> <p>  In respect of reform I have brought forward legislation for a HSE board to increase accountability.  We have carried out the consultation on geoalignment and how to achieve in other parts of the country what exists in Deputy Harty's part of the country, a CHO and hospital group that work well.  That is a key Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation.</p> <p>  The roll-out of assistant psychologists has taken place under the leadership of the Minister of State and those working in the mental health sector have welcomed that reform.  Advanced nurse practitioners have been installed in mental health services, which is another reform.  This committee is well aware of the review of 'A Vision for Change', which I am sure we will talk about in a moment.  Rather than talk about him when he is sitting beside me I will ask the Minister of State to answer the question about telepsychology directly.  I will consider the Deputy's suggestion for CHO 3. </p></speech>

They are a matter of fact, they exist, so what do we do?  They are experienced worldwide and the same acute shortages exist in the Americas and Australia in all health areas but particularly in mental health.  Telepsychology could be therapies delivered online.  Mental health is unique in that many of the solutions to it can be delivered online whereas it is not possible to take out somebody's appendix online.  There are opportunities to be considered.  Other countries are embracing and using these opportunities where there is a shortage of manpower.  For clinical governance purposes does a psychiatrist have to be in the room with the CAMHS team?  They can speak to each other, which is peer-to-peer telepsychiatry.</p><p>We envisage it being done in supported atmospheres, such as primary care centres where nursing and medical staff would be available, as opposed to someone picking up an iPad at home and accessing a telepsychiatry service.  We have not yet reached that stage.  We are hoping to provide all levels of intervention - primary, secondary and tertiary - in a supported environment.  Telepsychiatry, which is at the upper level of service, is provided in many countries.  To progress plans for a service here, we will have a conference in September for clinicians, service users, that is, patients or clients, and people with an interest in the area of mental health such as members of this committee.  This will elaborate on the plans in this area, seek to secure buy-in from those who will deliver the service and get their feedback and views.  While I do not have a monopoly of wisdom in this area, telepsychiatry has the potential to radically revolutionise the service and address the old chestnut of the lack of availability of specialists by making much more efficient use of the services we have.</p></speech>

Given that the HSE has not got basic computers and programme software right, I do not understand how telepsychiatry services can be promised.</p> <p>  I keep referring to scripts being provided to the Department by the HSE.  We heard about money but where is it being spent?  It is not reaching the front line.  We need to be told where it is going before we produce the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.584" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018071100002#E00300"><p>I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.   Perhaps the committee could have a brainstorming session on telepsychiatry with an expert working in the field.  This would allow members to educate themselves on the issue, which I do not know enough about to be able to comment.  If a new initiative is proposed, we should try to explore it and make an objective judgment on it.</p> <p>  The Chairman referred to IT systems.  These are front-end rather than back-end IT systems and from what I have seen, it may be possible to provide telepsychiatry services on a front-end IT system.  I am simply making that suggestion.</p> <p>  The problem with back-end IT systems was highlighted.  In November 2017, I asked for some simple figures on the &euro;35 million spent in 2016 on mental health services.  How much of this was used to improve existing services and how much was spent on the development of new services?  I do not believe the committee has received those figures.  Is that correct?  </p></speech>

We do not have them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018071100002#E00500"><p>The HSE told me it would provide me with these figures but it was unable to give me them immediately because of the way the systems are built and bolted together.  That is a financial back end system.  When a business or, as in this case, the Government is administering money to an organisation, it wants to know where this money is spent.  I asked for top-line figures, not nitty-gritty detail.  Representatives of all the community health organisations, CHOs, were present at the November meeting and they provided the committee with a breakdown of their figures to show what they were doing.  I asked how much money was spent on new services and how much was spent on existing services.  I would like those figures.</p> <p>  On the recruitment process, I accept there are worldwide shortages of medical staff.  Let us park the issue of salary and look at the process.  The specific process for medical recruitment is cumbersome and there is no contingency planning being done.  When staff are approaching retirement or when they hand in their notice, this information should be quickly put into the system and become part of the process.  We have asked for an end-to-end process for recruitment and for the dotted lines of stakeholders to be joined up.  The process needs to be streamlined, particularly if we are competing globally.  We need to make the process lean, from A to Z.</p> <p>  I welcome some of the initiatives.  Multi-annual budgeting is a good development.  The budget for 2019 will increase by &euro;55 million against a benchmark of &euro;35 million.  The &euro;55 million increase is welcome, as is the recruitment of 114 assistant psychologists and the additional hours in the school system.  I would like to see more cross-departmental initiatives, particularly around early intervention and building organically into early intervention and prevention strategies for mental health services.  </p> <p>  I know there is a proposal to move to a seven-day service and we want to build into that a 24-hour service as quickly as possible.  I have been speaking to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on that issue as well.  I thank the Minister for the establishment of this committee which will shine a light on the future of mental health care.</p></speech>

A couple of months ago, we did not have enough capital funding allocated to eHealth but the section now has a budget of more than &euro;1 billion in the lifetime of the next ten-year capital plan.  What exactly it will do, how it will make a difference to mental health services and how we can ensure it is tailor-made and secures the committee's approval are questions on which I would welcome the committee's input.</p> <p>  The point Deputy Neville makes about the different systems talking to each other or otherwise is fair.  A significant amount of the investment will be spent on building one financial system and providing for every patient an individual eHealth record that will allow us to track the patient through the system and empower patients to look after and follow up on their own health to some degree.</p> <p>  Let me bring some clarity to the points raised on budget 2018.  An additional &euro;57.5 million was allocated for mental health services.  This included pay related costs of &euro;22.5 million and &euro;20 million to further progress new initiatives that were commenced in 2017 as well as an additional &euro;15 million for further new developments in 2018.  It was arising from the clarification of the &euro;35 million and the useful engagement we had with Dr. Shari McDaid - I should acknowledge our engagement with Deputy James Browne on this topic - that we gave a commitment in writing that the figure would be &euro;55 million in budget 2019.</p> <p>  On the issue of recruitment and retention, I have made a number of points already.  This is not only an issue of recruitment because the bigger challenge in all aspects of the health service is the issue of retention.  People are taking up posts for a relatively short period for a variety of reasons.  The Public Sector Pay Commission is specifically charged with reviewing pay and recruitment and retention strategies in general.  The commission is due to report this month and the Government will be guided by its report.  I will be happy to further engage with the committee once we have this guidance.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Neville that multi-annual funding is the way to go, not only in this area of the health service but also in other areas.  I note the Deputy's support for some of the reforms we have introduced.</p></speech>

I understand where the Minister is coming from as the Department administers a budget based on top-line projections.  However, information on the specific spend at the end of the year was not provided.  Services are allocated a budget based on a forecast.  I want to know what the budget was spent on in respect of the budget for 2016.</p></speech>

I am very interested in being educated on telepsychiatry.  We need to factor in body language, non-verbal communication and the demeanour of the individual.  These are much more important than verbal communications in making an assessment.</p> <p>  The spend on agency staff for the months of January, February and March of 2018 was &euro;13 million and the figure is projected to rise to &euro;100 million.  This spending is eating into the budget for the year.</p> <p>  I flag again the closure on Friday of the Linn Dara unit, which I raised this morning with the Minister of State.  I ask him not to repeat the statement provided by the HSE.</p> <p>  The mental health services are chaotic and in crisis.  The committee has been dealing with this issue since its inception.  There should be 15 day programmes in place nationwide but we only have two such programmes and 50% of the community teams are not fully resourced.  I will not use the HSE's non-transparent figures.  I have improved upon those figures and I know the service is in demand.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to focus on Traveller health.  Interviews were held in February for grade 7 mental health service co-ordinators.  When will the successful candidates be appointed?  Why were Traveller organisations not given the resources to undertake this work, considering that 83% of Travellers receive all their health information from Traveller organisations?</p><p>Given the level of evidence of health inequalities, in particular the Traveller mental health crisis, which is astounding, why has Traveller health not received any money since 2008?</p></speech>

On the 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists who have recently been appointed, will the Minister outline how was that achieved and the recruitment process from advertisement to appointment?  It seems it was a success.  Last month, Professor Frank Murray, director of the national doctors training and planning division of the HSE, presented to the committee a table of 16 mental health consultant posts advertised in 2016 for which no applications were received.  Unfortunately, ten of the posts were for paediatric consultants.  To see that in black and white was frightening for all of us.  What has been learned from this that enabled the Department to hire 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists in a year?  How was that done?  How can that success story be transferred to other Departments in similar need?</p> <p>  What consultation has taken place between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills?  Deputy O'Loughlin is the Chair of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, of which I am a member, as was the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, when we drew up our report on positive mental health in schools.  Has the Minister seen the report's key recommendations?  I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has seen them.  I read with interest during the week about a new initiative on extra suicide prevention training planned for teachers under which two relevant members of school staff will be trained in suicide prevention.  In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, will provide training for crisis scenarios.  Representatives of NEPS appeared before the committee a few weeks ago, and the organisation is on its knees.  We have fewer than 200 NEPS psychologists to serve all of our primary and post-primary schools.  I do not know where the time will be found to train teachers.  It is my understanding that if a NEPS psychologist goes out on maternity leave, no cover is provided.  That needs to be addressed.  It is a shame the approach being pursued by the Department of Education and Skills - I wonder again about the consultation - does not reflect the report's key recommendations.  One wonders why that report and research were done.  There are some fantastic recommendations, including on the provision of psychotherapy training and other professional development for the counsellors who are already in our schools.  It is worth reading and a shame it was not followed through.</p> <p>  Representatives of Pavee Point appeared before the committee in February.  It is regrettable the organisation was not invited to participate in the national task force on mental health, even though it requested to be included.  I do not understand why it was not included, especially in light of its request.  I do not know if it even received a reply.  It was an appalling lack of consultation.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure engagement with the Traveller community is not only with focus groups but is real, meaningful consultation.  It was left out of the discussion, which is wrong.  Why was it left out?</p></speech>

They are both correct.  We need to up our game in how we interact with the Traveller community about mental health and also general health issues.  I visited Pavee Point a number of months ago and had a good engagement.  The key question the Traveller community, through Pavee Point and its leaders, asked was if we would re-establish the structures in the Department of Health to enable it to engage with government and the State.  We have given a commitment to do that.  We had to alter those structures somewhat because the HSE has since come into being.  There has already been engagement in recent days with the Traveller community about this.  For example, some of my officials did a site visit and met members of the Traveller community.  There was also a workshop to try to identify the needs of Travellers attended by both the chief nursing officer, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Halloran, who is here, and officials from the Department's social inclusion office.  I do not speak for Pavee Point but there is a real effort here to recalibrate and renew that relationship.  It is key after the efforts the Oireachtas made, quite rightly, to recognise ethnicity, and we are building on that now with the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  I can give assurance the structure is now back in place in my Department.  There is ongoing engagement and never again should a key stakeholder group be left out.  I am satisfied with the engagement I have with the Traveller community, and I hope it is satisfied with it too.</p> <p>  I need to provide a note about the recruitment process for the assistant psychologists and psychologists.  Given that a number of them were already in the system doing training, it may have been easier to identify and find them.  I will convey a note to the committee and Chair.  The Deputy is right about the recruitment process going well.  One hears about 114 assistant psychologists, a global figure, but it is lovely to meet people in person.  I opened the Tuam primary care centre on Monday, 2 July in the company of Deputy Rabbitte.  I met two assistant psychologists, the psychologist and members of the CAMHS team at the event.  The difference those two assistant psychologists are already making in Tuam through going into schools, working their way through waiting lists and so on is encouraging, but we need to build on this further.  There seems to be significant excitement or enthusiasm in our mental health services about the potential this can have.</p> <p>  I take Senator Devine's comment about telepsychiatry and I welcome the interest shown by the committee in the issue.  The Minister of State will deal with the matter of Linn Dara in a moment.  </p> <p>  On agency spend - and I do not mean this in a confrontational way - members of this committee, including perhaps the Senator, would be among the first to criticise me if a service was not being delivered.  As long as there are vacancies that are not being filled, we will not make apologies for doing everything we can to fill them.  Of course, I would like to see agency spend reduced and people in full-time permanent posts in the health service, which we see in many areas.  As long as vacancies exist, however, while working out the strategies to tackle them in a world where there is a global shortage, and while the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, does its work, we will continue to fill those vacancies through agency spend where we cannot fill them through permanent posts.  I do not believe the Senator and I disagree on that, but it is an important point.  When expenditure on agency staff increases, the political attack is often to ask why we are increasing it.  We do so because there are sick people who need services today, whether they are physical or mental health services.  I take the point about recruitment and retention, and I refer to my original answer that the PSPC was tasked by Government with specifically looking at recruitment and retention challenges for the health service.  It will report this month and I will be guided by its findings.</p> <p>  I would be delighted to take a look at the committee report to which Deputy Martin referred.  As I have not seen it directly, I will read it and revert to Deputies Martin and O'Loughlin.  We work with the Department of Education and Skills through the pathfinder project, which is the interdepartmental work on mental health.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, made an announcement yesterday on that and I note the Deputy's comments on it.  It is still important that mental health and suicide prevention are not viewed as only health issues, and I know the Deputy shares that view.

I thank the Minister for his comments on the education committee's report on mental health and look forward to engaging with him further on it.</p><p>I have a few questions I wish to put to both Ministers.</p><p> A colleague commented earlier that A Vision for Change did not work but to be clear, had it been implemented in the correct manner, it certainly would have worked.  In 2017, 44 children were admitted into adult mental health services due to a bed shortage.  The current plan shows there are 69 CAMHS teams but only 75 CAMHS beds.  What future plans are there to increase beds for children given that need is absolutely crucial?  Can the Minister give the committee the number of persons who are currently waiting for a CAMHS appointment?</p><p> The introduction of the 20 psychologists and the 114 assistant psychologists to deal with waiting lists is important but I seek a little more information on who will be training the assistant psychologists.  What will be their level of qualification?  Given the introduction of this vast number, how will we address the problem regarding the lack of spaces allocated to training clinical psychologists?  I checked with UCD this morning and there are only ten students in second year at this point in time, 16 in third year, and 14 in first year.  I am aware that other universities provide training but they have a similarly small availability of places.  If we are talking about bringing 114 assistant psychologists, I do not know where we are going to find them.  We also will need to deal with the level of capacity in respect of university places.  </p><p> On telepsychiatry - I appreciate the clarification given -  what sort of engagement or consultation has there been with professionals in the field?  I refer to the advances in telemedicine in respect of GP services - I am thinking here of a very effective service in Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare - whereby a lot of medication and prescriptions can be given online.  Is that what we will be considering with regard to telepsychiatry too because this is a different type of health intervention that is absolutely needed?</p><p> As there is too much of a focus on medication and anti-depressants, as opposed to talk therapy, when looking at the costs and the expense of either therapy, we should be focusing on talk therapy.  On a related note, who will be training the volunteers who will be providing the 24-hour text line?  Given the lengthy waiting times, will consultants have the time to train these volunteers?  Will they be sourced by the HSE?  Will they have a background in the mental health area?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018071100002#G00500"><p>I have four quick questions. The first relates to the appointment of 21 non-specialist consultants to psychiatric posts.  The President of the High Court has referred to this practice and has been extremely critical of it.  He has described this practice of permitting non-specialist doctors to be appointed as consultants in hospitals in mental health services as scandalous.  He said the HSE appears to be law unto itself.  He wrote, after his judgment, to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, to the State Claims Agency and to HIQA.  What is the Minister's official response to the comments of the President of the High Court, as these comments refer to the safety of patients and exposure of the State to liability for any actions of these non-specialists acting as consultants?</p> <p>  My next question is to ask when will the full legislation or even heads of Bill be available with regard to implementation of the 168 recommendations of the expert review group on mental health legislation.  We have had three Ministers of State since its publication and to date, only one of those 168 recommendations has been implemented.  There have been numerous promises of heads of Bill for this legislation but none have appeared.</p> <p>The Minister's opening statement referred to 18,800 referrals expected for HSE CAMHS this year, with about 14,300 expected to be seen.  In the public service performance report of 2017, however, published in April 2018, it stated that only 10,300 referrals were seen by mental health services, a decrease of 2,082.  It would appear that the expectation next year is a 40% increase of CAMHS referrals over last year's figure with an extra 4,000 referrals.  We have psychiatrists resigning to beat the band because of the poor service they must give with the lack of support they receive.  I am amazed there will be a 40% increase of referrals seen by psychiatrists.  </p> <p>  As to the &euro;55 million that is in this year's budget, is that already accounted for in the expenditure side of the budget or is that expected to come out of the fiscal space?</p></speech>

If the Ministers could answer both of those sets of questions, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018071100002#G00700"><p>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will take most of them.  I nevertheless wish to comment on a number of them if that is okay with the Chairman.</p> <p>  On the issue the fiscal space and the discussions we have, that is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to determine how that comes out of his allocation.  What I am very confident of is that we have a letter from him, which I believe we have already shared with the committee, assuring us that this spending will be there.  I can ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to confer with the committee's spokesperson on that but the main point is that commitment is certainly there.</p> <p>  I look forward to engaging with Deputy O'Loughlin on the education committee.  I believe that committee is doing good work on this and we need to dovetail even more on it and I give that commitment.</p> <p>  I also appreciate what the Deputy says about A Vision for Change, which is an important comment.  We should not confuse implementation with strategy or plans.  The strategy and vision is something we all accept was very good.  It is about making sure that we implement it.</p> <p>  On the issue of bed capacity, my colleague, the Minister of State will comment on this but a number of developments already are under way to try to increase bed capacity.  Crucially, we now have significant additional funding for more beds right across the spectrum of our health services and shortly, I will ask the hospital groups and community healthcare organisations to identify how many beds are needed in each region across the varied spectrum of healthcare.  Rather than being a top-down exercise in which the HSE centrally makes allocations, we will ask people from CHOs and from acute hospitals to identify the number of beds needed.</p> <p>  On the issue of assistant psychologists, again I have given a commitment to the committee to get more information and we will come back on that.  This is an area on which I would appreciate the committee's view because if it is an area we believe has benefits, we can try to do more.  My understanding from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is that a lot of these personnel already are working in the system, as opposed to people taking up additional university places.  On telepsychiatry, we have dealt with that and the committee will do some more work in that regard.  </p> <p>  Regarding the Mental Health Commission, I agree with Deputy O'Loughlin instinctively, that we should consider increasing its powers and I will give that some further thought.  The committee may have noticed that in the patient safety Bill I brought to Cabinet last week, not only will it not be enough to openly disclose - Senator Devine and I discussed this in the Seanad last week -  to the patient an issue but there will be an automatic requirement to refer to the Mental Health Commission.  Consequently, this commission should have an ability to gather new data that are not gathered today on how many incidents are openly discussed with the patient.  It also will enable the commission to see trends and information from right across the mental health service.  We are doing something similar for HIQA for our non-mental health services.  That will be a new function or ability given to the Mental Health Commission.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Browne's question, my colleague, the Minister of State has been working on and leading the Government's response to the comments made by the President of the High Court.  He will respond to that question as well.</p> <p>  As for the HSE service plan, I have a simple view as Minister for Health in this regard.  We provide the HSE with a level of funding for the year and it provides back a service plan which it signs off on and states it will deliver.  It has given that commitment that it will deliver that number of CAMHS referrals and interventions this year and I expect them to do that.</p></speech>

We believe - I need to be careful as I do not have the details to hand and do not want to misspeak - they are not all working within the public health service, which is an issue worth pointing out.  The global figure that has been put out there does not pertain entirely to HSE facilities and I have made that point before.</p> <p>  I also make the point that initial indications from the HSE to me suggest that many of these consultants could be on the specialist register but for whatever reason, have not registered with it or joined it.</p><p>That is a simply unacceptable situation which is being addressed by the national director of HR.  Much work is being done in that regard.  The number is declining but it must decline significantly more.  The comments of the President of the High Court in that regard are very fair and we take them extremely seriously.</p></speech>

They are paid by the Department of Health through the HSE and report to the HSE on inadequacies in its services.  Does that make the Minister worry about the openness and transparency of the process?  I agree with Deputy O'Loughlin that its members are powerless.  They criticise services but that is the end of the matter and it goes nowhere.  I ask the Minister to address that conflict of interest, after which Deputy Rabbitte may ask her questions.</p></speech>

We fund nearly all the agencies which have such a responsibility.  HIQA is funded through my Department and, rightly and appropriately, is regularly highly critical of aspects of our health service.  A similar situation pertains in respect of ombudsmen.  I take the point made by the Chair but I would probably come in for greater criticism if the State were not funding the Mental Health Commission.  I am confident that it is robust and independent in the discharge of its functions.  I am open to a discussion on its powers and welcome any views or guidance in that regard from the committee.</p></speech>

I will ask all my questions together but I understand the Minister will be answering first and that the Minister of State may come back to me later.</p> <p>  Over several weeks, the committee dealt with the significant issue of adolescents or younger persons accessing mental health beds in adult wards.  I seek a commitment from the Minister that a way will be found to address and eradicate that problem.  It was very distressing to hear testimony in that regard over a number of weeks.  The Minister indicated that there are 69 CAMHS teams.  How many of those teams are fully functioning and fully staffed?  There is much unease among adolescent service users who are in a CAMHS and, particularly, their parents about what will happen when the adolescent reaches 17 years of age.  Is there a transition strategy such that an adolescent and his or her parents do not feel as though he or she is being turfed out?  How can we can move adolescents into adult care facilities with more ease?  Will a step-down facility or similar be put in place?  The Minister referred to an initiative to increase the number of CAMHS referrals to be seen this year by 27% compared to 2017.  I did not understand the reference and ask him to explain it.</p> <p>  One of the first Topical Issue matters I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, after his appointment last year related to the counselling services provided by Youth Work Ireland Galway .  Its representatives are in the Gallery and I welcome them.  As a politician, I am focused on solutions, as are the Minister of State and all present.  Organisations such as Youth Work Ireland Galway are focused on solutions and early intervention.  Youth Work Ireland Galway provides support to approximately 200 young people between the ages of 12 and 18.  Some 33% of referrals to it are made by Tusla and the HSE, 31% by parents and the remainder by schools.  When I tabled that Topical Issue on 27 July last year, the service was in danger of closure.  The situation has not changed.  It still cannot take on new referrals even though 55 young people are waiting to access its supports.  The service costs &euro;63 a week for each child.  A child receives six weeks of treatment, which may be accessed on a week-on, week-off basis such that the total period is extended to 12 weeks.  A child may experience anxiety relating to the transition from national school to secondary school.  The Minister of State has heard me raise that issue on several occasions.  This is an area in respect of which we, as politicians, focus on solutions.  Earlier, the committee discussed the lack of proper staff recruitment or retention.  Youth Work Ireland Galway has the right staff and provides appropriate services and can expand into the community and support more areas.  It is a pilot scheme which could be rolled out nationwide.  It has data and research to support that.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to review the situation in respect of Youth Work Ireland Galway.  In response to its request for increased funding, the HSE replied that it should be noted that the CHO 2 mental health service did not receive an increased budget allocation in respect of section 39 funding in 2018 and consequently the funding of Youth Work Ireland Galway could not be increased.  That goes back to a question posed by Deputy Neville.  We have not been told how the extra allocation of funding awarded in budget 2017 is being spent.  I understood that it was to go to new projects.  Youth Work Ireland Galway is such a new project but has sought and been refused funding.  Deputy Neville's question is valid because neither I nor any other member present knows where that money is being spent.</p></speech>

The development of mental health services in the country is evidenced by the fact that we have a Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  Those are very forward-thinking measures which bring mental health into the open and encourage people to talk about it, which was a goal for many members.</p> <p>  Money is a common theme in the discussion of mental health services.  Several matters in that regard have struck me since the committee was formed.  One constantly hears of the need for more money in mental health services.  However, almost &euro;1 billion has been invested in mental health services in the past year and the HSE could not tell the committee where that money was spent.  Some &euro;9 million was allocated to CHO 8, in which I live, but the representatives of the HSE could not tell me where that money went.  Deputy Neville mentioned that the HSE's IT system could not allow the representatives to join the dots and give us those figures.  That is absolutely outrageous.</p> <p>  I also inquired about funding but did not receive an answer.  Funding is allocated to many different organisations and there are different services all over the country.  Some counties have great services and others do not.  We must consider re-organising the services and how different organisations are funded.  Do similar organisations in the same county duplicate services while another county may have no organisation providing such services?  How much of the funding which organisations receive goes down to the service user and how much is lost in administration, advertising, rebranding and so on?  What is the HSE doing in terms of reorganising the services?  I am not criticising the services because some of them do amazing work.</p> <p>  The recruitment and retention of staff has been discussed.  On recruitment, I have mentioned to the Minister that the committee was told that 20 stages must be gone through to recruit a member of staff.  That is madness.  A private company would be shut down if it indulged in that sort of carry-on.  The recruitment of mental healthcare staff is a challenge worldwide but the red tape in the HSE makes it particularly difficult.  I raised with the Minister the case of a principal clinical psychologist who has worked in this country for 19 years and wishes to take up a job in an organisation.  He had to go to the valuation unit and a solicitor and obtain transcripts from Tasmania relating to a degree he completed 25 years ago.  He is still not in the position.  That situation illustrates the red tape which must be dealt with.  In that case, much of it was caused by administrative staff having an opinion on clinical staff.  It is not good enough.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to accept the level of salaries paid to new consultants.</p><p>When I asked a particular question, I was completely ignored.  I was told that the salary for a new consultant can range between &euro;145,000 and &euro;185,000.  I was not given an answer when I asked how the salary compares with that attaching to the equivalent post in the UK's National Health Service, NHS.  There are no front-line staff - nurses, therapists or principal clinical psychologists - who earn that type of money.  We need more front-line staff and they must be paid a proper salary.  We should not try to recruit people and pay them &euro;185,000 because I do not know how anybody could deserve such a salary.  People have high expectations if they think they deserve to paid that amount of money.</p><p> In terms of the assistant clinical psychology posts, I would love if the Departments of Health and Education and Skills adopted a joined-up approach to recruitment.  I know from personal experience that students who have graduated from UCD and similar places with a master's degree cannot secure assistant psychology posts because they do not have experience.  Ironically, they cannot gain experience because they cannot secure posts in which they might do so.  That aspect should be explored.  Many of the students want to pursue careers in clinical psychology but the level of intake there very low.  Perhaps the two Departments might consider this matter together in order that we might eventually appoint more assistant psychologists who could be supervised by principal or senior clinical psychologists and who could help in reducing waiting lists.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has taken note of the questions relating to his portfolio.  I will answer some of the others.</p> <p>  In terms of adolescents being admitted to adult facilities, as the Taoiseach did in the D&aacute;il earlier, I acknowledge the Chairman's work on this matter.  In fact, the Chairman may have discussed the matter with the Taoiseach.  At least, that is what he told the D&aacute;il earlier.  I assure the Chairman that we are committed to working with her on the legislation she has brought forward to try to address this matter.  I appreciate the constructive way in which we have engaged on this matter.</p> <p>  I am informed that 87% of adolescents are admitted to CAMHS facilities, which leaves a cohort who are not admitted.  Without getting into too many illustrative examples, I think we all accept that there are sometimes very challenging emergency situations relating to children who are near adulthood but who are not yet adults.  Children need to be cared for in a compassionate and sensitive way.  We need to be careful, and I think this is the Chairman's ultimate concern, that these adolescents or children are not put in adult facilities and then left there on the basis that the box has been ticked and a place provided.  Equally, we must be cognisant of the fact that the welfare of all of the others in a CAMHS facility must also be looked after.  It is a very fragile balance.</p> <p>  I am informed that there is generally a ratio of two nurses to one adolescent in cases where adolescents are admitted to adult facilities.  However, we need to do better.  We need to find a way to develop a law, along the lines of the legislation brought forward by the Chairman, that makes the position clear in respect of those emergency cases and gives the system the ability to respond to them.</p> <p>  As the number of vacancies relating to CAMHS teams is an operational matter, I will ask the HSE to respond directly to the committee.  I do not have that information at my fingertips.</p> <p>  Senator McFadden referred, quite bluntly, to a lack of accountability.  A number of other members also referred to this matter.  I was not around when the health boards were in place but I am sure some of the members of the committee were.  It is clear that the health boards were imperfect.  There is a need for a national health service and there is also a need to do things at a national level in order to drive improvements.  The benefit of the health board model seems to have been that people met and asked trick questions of those who were responsible for delivering front-line services.  For example, one would approach the Eastern Health Board and ask how the delivery of mental health services was going, what was the budget for the year, what projects had been delivered and why particular projects were delayed.  What has happened now is that the structures have become so bureaucratic.</p></speech>

The way that the HSE developed is not the way in which, I imagine, any of us would envisage a national health organisation developing.  What we are going to do is pare back the HSE in terms of its size and devolve more powers to the regions.  Let me make it clear that the health boards will not be returning.  Before I became a Deputy, I was once involved with a regional health forum.  I am sure I will upset people who serve on those forums when I say that they are not adequate in the context of holding people to account.</p></speech>

I am committed to working with Members of the Houses on all sides in order to devise the legislation relating to the HSE board.  That is the first point.  The second point is that we need to consider putting in place a structure that will not facilitate the return of the health boards but that will allow front-line healthcare professionals and those who represent the public to ask key questions of the people in charge.  Day in and day out, people in the Oireachtas and stakeholders who represent patient groups, etc., inform me that they do not believe there is a structure in place.  Quite frankly, neither do I.  It is a priority of mine, after the HSE board legislation is passed, to consider what other accountability mechanisms can be put in place through legislation.  In the event that my words might be misinterpreted, I want to make it clear that I see us moving - as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report - towards regional structures with boards that will hold people to account.</p></speech>

The current entity is too big and too bureaucratic.  I am of the view that more functions should be devolved to the regions.  Whether I am considered a reforming Minister is a matter for historians to assess many years from now, but the benefit of this plan is that we all agree that this is the structure which must be put in place.  This will enable me, as a Minister in a minority Government, and my successors to plough on with that objective.  I will endeavour to get the HSE board legislation passed this year.  I am of the opinion that we will be successful in getting that done.  Let us also try to move forward, on a cross-party basis, with providing a regional accountability structure as well.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has done a lot of work on duplication and I am sure he will comment on that when he returns.  The answer has to be what he has championed and what the Members will regularly raise at meetings of this committee, namely, signposting, mapping out the services and directing resources to the appropriate destinations.  In addition, we must ensure that members of the public know where to go.  On far too many occasions, people with mental health challenges have approached me at my constituency office.  I am not suggesting that everything to do with the services was wonderful.  However, there were services available that these individuals did not even know how to access.  This underlines the need for signposting.</p> <p>  I have commented on the recruitment process a number of times.  I take the point that was made.</p> <p>  The programme relating to assistant psychologists is new.  This is the first full year of the programme.  I very much take on board the suggestion made by Senator McFadden in that regard.  The Minister of State will respond to the remainder of the questions.</p></speech>

Let us consider the example of Linn Dara, where service users and their families were given five days prior notice of the cessation of day care.  Surely that constitutes bad management?  It feels like Groundhog Day because 11 beds were closed at Linn Dara last year and day-care services have been have been brought to an end this year.  The Linn Dara management team knew last year that a situation would arise this year and they were able to forward plan as a result.</p> <p>  I have heaps of paper with me relating to complaints about CAMHS.  I know people are getting frustrated.  This comes down to management.  Some &euro;27 million has been pumped into Cashel hospital and it costs perhaps &euro;8 million a year to keep it going.  Units in the hospital are lying idle at a time when services are needed.</p> <p>  Cork County Council has tabled a motion requesting that five psychologists be appointed to keep the service going in Mahon.  As stated, we have already seen what happened with Linn Dara.  We have mentioned Waterford and Wexford.  It all comes back to accountability and responsibility.  The committee has heard witnesses state that their managers have threatened them and told them not to come before the committee.  Surely those managers should be held accountable for their actions.  Witnesses will not feel like appearing before a committee if they have been threatened.</p></speech>

It is front-line staff more than management who should be beatified.  </p> <p>  Dr. Harty mentioned pilot schemes.  That is an idea.  We could target areas where adolescent suicide rates are high, etc.  </p> <p>  On worldwide recruitment, ten years ago the HSE knew that there was going to be a problem in recruitment, but it could not plan for it.  Again, it is bad planning.</p> <p>  We probably have one of the best education services in the country.  Why can we not plan for it and give incremental contracts where there can be improvement?  We have lost the plot.  In the next four years we are facing a decrease in the number of staff within the mental health service, possibly of 1,700 because of retirements.  There is already a shortage of 500 staff, even on top of the additional 500 being sought.  The HSE cannot plan for this reduction because it is going to wait until each individual retires.  The process of recruitment takes 12 months.  As most of the questions have been asked, I am flagging this issue and appealing to the Minister to do something about it.   </p> <p>  Surely the Minister and the Minister of State have the power to bring in senior management in the HSE to ask what is the five year plan for recruitment and retention within all services, as well as the five year plan for budgetary spending, and then come up with some common-sense approaches?  We were made aware that around &euro;50 million was spend on taxis by the HSE last year.  That is why I am appealing to the Minister and the Minister of State.  They are being misinformed, as we are when it comes to replies to parliamentary questions.  As I have said this to the Minister on one specific occasion, he knows that we are being misinformed.  If he and the Minister of State are being misinformed, they cannot do their job and if we are being misinformed, we cannot assist them to do the job for everybody else in the country.</p></speech>

This is our 27th meeting since the joint committee was formed and there have been many recurring themes.  </p> <p>  On the recruitment procedure within the HSE, Dr. Harty asked if the Minister would like to be reforming.  That is where I will start.  Senator Gabrielle McFadden mentioned that there were about 20 steps in recruiting a psychiatric nurse.  There are actually 27.  It is that crazy.  We were sitting here with our mouths open listening to how difficult it was to recruit one psychiatric nurse.  The process could be led from the top, through the implementation office of Sl&aacute;intecare, the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department of Health or the new board of management.  On every issue we have dealt with, the lack of recruitment has been mentioned.  There is, possibly, a worldwide shortage of trained personnel in psychiatry, as well as of doctors and GPs.  We have to change our approach to deal with the crisis.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to telepsychiatry.  It is a novel approach and one way of dealing with the lack of trained staff and getting better value for money.  I also ask him to look at making better use of pharmacists in the community.  There are 2,000 pharmacies with well trained personnel.  They have been much under-utilised.  Perhaps we might also look at how many homemakers would like to come back as part-time workers.  We could set them up as individual consultants to try to assist in maximising the expertise available.  A broad approach is needed.  It is no longer acceptable to say 16 posts were advertised and that nobody applied.  That will not solve anything.  We have to change our approach-----</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State introduce mental health and well-being as part of the primary school curriculum and start now?  In ten or 15 years we would have dealt with many problems if we were to address them from an early stage.  We should look at the Australian model which works very well.  </p> <p>  My last point is that this committee has been set up and giving the issue of mental healthcare the attention it needs.  It should continue full time.  The required spending level of the  health budget should be between 10% and 12%, but we are currently at a figure of 7%.  When can we reach the required level?  That is where we need to be.</p></speech>

We are advertising to fill a number of new senior posts in it.  I do not, however, have confidence in the structures, which is why I am trying to change them to enable staff, including some very good individuals, to do the job they want to do.  It is often a better job.  The structures have become overly complicated and bureaucratic.  I will follow up directly on the issues raised in respect of Cashel Hospital and the Mahon health centre.</p> <p>  On recruitment, without going into it too much as the question has been asked a few times, 2,000 new posts have been approved since 2012 in the mental health service.  According to my note, we have filled about 1,352 of them.  Therefore, posts are being funded and filled.  However, many are not being filled and that poses a number of questions for us.  There are a number of elements, which brings me to Deputy John Brassil's questions.  We have an issue with the process used.  I have heard the committee very clearly in that regard.  </p> <p>  We are advertising for a new chair of the HSE board.  It will be a chairperson designate until we pass the legislation, but he or she will be appointed shortly.  One of the first things I will ask him or her to do is to review and report back to me directly on the recruitment processes within the HSE and how we can streamline them.  Members are giving me constructive suggestions and I want to respond in kind.  </p> <p>  I take Deputy John Brassil's point about pharmacies.  I will be sitting down with the representatives of the pharmacy sector and pharmacists in the not too distant future to discuss a range of contractual matters.  I will welcome their suggestions.  It is always an interesting point - I say this respectfully - that everyone in the health service is extremely busy, which I do not doubt.  I refer to trying to take work from one section and giving it to another.  We saw this recently in the discussion about contraception.  I thought it became ridiculous when one group said they were too busy and could not take on any more work.  Another said they would take on the work, but then the first group said they could not do so because they had to do it.  We need to break down that silo mentality and have the appropriate healthcare professionals providing the appropriate service at the right time.  </p> <p>  Recruitment of people at home is key.  As a Government, we have been discussing this issue for a period of time.  As we reach full employment as we, thankfully, almost have statistically, there is no doubt that there are people who for a variety of reasons cannot work full time.  Often they have worked in a professional field in the past, or they would like to train up and work, but they will never be able or wish to work full time, which is fine.  Providing them with opportunities to do so brings us back to the telepsychiatry space because there would be no need for long commutes, etc.  It also points out to us, as a Government, that their activation will be about more than just pay.  It will also be about childcare and other supports.  </p> <p>  Whether this committee should continue is a matter for the Oireachtas, but I think it should.  The Joint Committee on Health is extraordinarily busy.  Sometimes it is useful to have a committee that can look a little further down the road.  The clue is in the title.</p></speech>

We had Dr. Harry Barry in here last week and there has been a lot of discussion around social media and gaming addiction, which is now recognised as a condition by the World Health Organization.  He made an interesting proposal that there should be a national protocol on the use of social media, both for youths and for adults.  I know the Minister had some very strong concerns around the use of mobile phones, and that is an area that the Minister is continuing to explore, because it strikes me that we are now in 2018 and if we roll back eight years to 2010, the use of social media has exploded in the last number of years.  It is having an enormous impact on the mental health of both young and old alike in this country, and I believe globally.  Is that an area on which the Minister is now focusing because of his own particular interest?</p> <p>  The other question relates to the use or lack of use of the psychotherapists in our system.  We had the psychotherapists' representative organisation in here and they said 1,500 people were available who they felt were not utilised enough.  I was curious about the fact that the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, was saying that they did not have psychotherapists and that they only had psychiatrists and psychologists in NEPS; and did not see a need for psychotherapists.  Once it passed through the psychiatrists it went to the health service.  I wondered if there was a break between education and health and whether there should there be a closer relationship there: does the Minister think that this is something we should be focusing on?</p> <p>  Another matter is more local, and is similar to CAMHS in Cherrywood, in relation to the criteria that CHO 8 used to justify the withdrawal of services to the young adult mental health service there, which is solely focusing on the 16 to18 year olds.  I happened to call in, as we are calling in to our various CAMHS, and learned they had recently received word that they were going to be withdrawing the positions of the psychotherapist, two nurses, an administrator, and also an art therapist.  The reason for this is that they were nearly too successful.  I thought the model that they had, which was focusing on 16 to 18 year olds, is something that should be replicated across the country because they have no waiting lists.</p> <p>  In my view they are being penalised by the HSE for being successful.  I am very concerned.  They were able to deal with the emergencies that would arise because they did not have the waiting lists.  They were able to manage all of this.  Can I ask what the Minister's view is on this and the fact that they are also citing A Vision for Change figures?  Those figures are way out of date, so I cannot accept that they are using A Vision for Change recommendations to justify making this decision.</p></speech>

If one looks at the map they do not dovetail.  It is clearly one of the problems.</p> <p>  Another area is the amount of funding that is divided out is based on an old system when it should be going to the areas of greatest need.  We all agree with that.  The practical measures do not cost anything to implement.</p> <p>  There are other matters I wish to talk to the Minster about, such as speech and language; it is unacceptable that children with profound need have to wait up to three years to be seen.</p> <p>  Respite care is another area which I have raised before.  It is the big issue that people talk to us about, where one has mothers and fathers and, in some cases mothers alone looking after children and the issue of access to services.  </p> <p>  I will give one example, and everybody will nod their head that this should not happen.  A mother rearing kids on her own has never had access to respite care for her two children at the same time, it is always at different times.  Everyone agreed, including the officials who came in, that that should be a simple thing to fix and it would not cost anything.  It has never been done and that woman is looking after those children - one is 17, the other is younger.  That is a long time to go without respite care.  It would be a simple thing for those children to go into respite at the same time.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials could take a note of this, please.</p></speech>

Deputy Harty pointed out that it nearly happens in the UL hospital group, but for the rest of the areas we have CHOs that straddle a number of hospital groups or vice versa.  We have launched a consultation on geo-alignment, I believe the details are still on my Department's website.  We have received over 2,500 submissions so far, in terms of how people - including people working in the health service - feel how best to align those groups.  There are a lot of issues.  I would like to see, as is envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, a regional entity which has the whole spectrum of care within one structure, and not a situation where one has the left hand doing acute hospital care, and everything else on the right hand.</p> <p>  On the issue of respite care, if the Deputy would not mind providing us with the details of that case offline, I will get my officials to look at it, not just as an example of an individual case but also as to how the system needs to show a bit of common sense as well.</p></speech>

Due to staffing challenges it will start in the summer time.  There is a maximum of three people impacted by this.  I have looked into the three cases.  They are all being provided with alternative supports and services under CAMHS, not just under that particular model of day services.  The have been referred to the community teams.  I do not want to go into details where the numbers are so small it can be very easy to identify people, but I have assured myself of what is going on there.  Other than that I cannot go into any more details on that.  I do not have any further questions from Senator Devine.</p> <p>  Deputy James Browne is not here so I can come back to him on some of his questions.</p> <p>  The question of teenagers in adult units is a debate we have had before and the Chair herself has shone a light on this.  The issues there are not black and white for legislation, but they are to be dealt with and the senior Minister referred to it as well.  </p> <p>  The two representatives of Youth Work Ireland Galway services are welcome to the meeting here today.  I went to visit them last year, on the invitation of Deputy Rabbitte and her colleagues.  I am disappointed to see that things have not moved on since that time but I will ask to have that file reviewed by the HSE and sent down to my office and I will go through it and come back to the Deputy and her colleagues directly on the issues affecting them there.</p> <p>  Senator McFadden asked where the money is being spent.  A 6% debate is something I would like to address; I believe it is 6% but I never know what figure people put on it.  I believe it is a bogus argument to be talking about the percentage of moneys spent on mental health.  In the first instance if I was measuring the amount of money I was spending on mental health I would never use the yardstick of physical health as a comparison, which is dysfunctional in itself, is bogus and is not real.</p> <p>  Furthermore, we spend significant amounts of money in the whole area of mental health, for example on primary care.  All of the mental health services are delivered through primary care, are budgeted under primary care, not under mental health, so they do not come out of my &euro;910 million budget, it comes out of the budget for primary care, even though it is delivered to mental health.  NEPS services come out of the Department of Education and Skills budget, and those are mental health services.</p><p>There are many health services in the justice system.  I am not defending the amount of money we spend on the area but that particular argument, and comparing Ireland with other countries when our budget is only 6%, is so flawed it is unhelpful and does not represent anything.</p><p> I will make a few points on the range of services.  The signposting, the phone line, has been my ambition since taking office.  It is referred to as a help line and various other things.  Essentially, it is a single access point for all mental health services.  That will address Senator McFadden's concerns about the range of services available.  We have finally completed a directory of all the services and if there is one number that people can call, they can be appropriately referred.  A member asked if the people at the other end of the phone line will be qualified.  They will be qualified.  They will not diagnose but will refer callers to the appropriate services.  That is lacking in the system.  As the senior Minister stated, we often come across cases where people are not aware of the services.</p><p> There is a tendency for all young people to be referred to the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, but there is no need for all young people who have mental health challenges to be referred to a psychiatric service.  That national front door element will go a long way to streamlining many of the services, which in itself will be constructive in dealing with the CAMHS waiting lists because many of those who are left on the waiting list require lower level intervention.  They are left on those waiting lists because a psychiatrist has stated that they do not need to see a consultant psychiatrist but he or she is not aware of where they can be referred.  If we can streamline that, that will be the best way to address the queues.  If we introduce a waiting list initiative, however, we are just addressing the symptom and not the root cause of the issue.</p><p> Deputy Buckley commented on a five year plan from the Health Service Executive, HSE.</p><p> There was a question on inpatient beds.  We will have increased capacity in Portrane.  We have already acknowledged that community healthcare organisation, CHO, 5 has a shortfall.  We hope to examine that.</p><p> Talk therapies will be part of telepsychology, telepsychiatry and teletherapies.  It is just a way of delivering those services in a more efficient way rather than having people make an hour or three hour return journey for a 20 minute therapy session.  There is a good deal of help in that regard.</p><p> The senior Minister has addressed many of the other questions.  Deputy Brassil-----</p></speech>

She might be aware that the Government launched a policy this morning to deal with that.  That has been very much the focus of Government.  It not a health issue or a mental health issue.  I have deliberately stood back in that regard.  I am involved and very interested in it but it was never for me to take the lead on it because that would suggest it is a mental health issue that should be dealt with under mental health only.</p> <p>  The most interesting development I have seen in Government and Civil Service circles since I became a national politician in 2011 is the Pathfinder project, which is four Departments, the Departments of Justice, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills and Health, working together for the first time in the history of the State.  They meet at section level and the very first topic they have chosen to pursue under Pathfinder is mental health.  The Departments will work side by side and meet on a weekly basis with people at principal officer, PO, assistant principal officer, APO, level or whatever.  A substantial number of staff are being resourced and aligned to this particular project to ensure all of them are working together on it.</p> <p>  Somebody asked what is happening in the area of schools.  That is where the future of mental health lies.  We have to support resilience and stop the escalation in the need for CAMHS.  If we keep chasing the system with hundreds of millions of euro and continue to put more inpatient beds into it, we will miss out on the need to build an infrastructure at that level and put a focus on it.  We spend much of our time talking about the waiting lists because they are easy to manage and repeat but we need to examine the supports we are putting in at the basic level, and particularly in education.  There is a superb programme, DBT STEPS-A programme, which has come here from America.  I do not know if any of the members are familiar with it but, essentially, it equips students how to recognise their feelings.  We had a presentation on it by Kinsale Community School at the launch of the youth mental health task force.  Essentially, the programme gives students the skills necessary to identify their feelings and articulate - that is the key word - their anxieties, fear or whatever.  We need to build on that but it is about getting the balance right.  I cannot neglect what the tertiary level is trying to do but we are trying to reorientate the system towards primary level interventions, support that and build on that support.  It is similar to what we are trying to do in physical health in terms of primary care, community care, prevention being better than the cure and so on.  That is a difficult balance to achieve.</p></speech>

That is social media.  I agree with the Deputy that the psychotherapists are under-used.  That is very much the narrative I have been using, which is that we need to talk about the primary care level I have just mentioned.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me about the national educational psychological service, NEPS.  The objective is that Pathfinder will allow us realise, with education, the utilisation of these psychotherapists and make sure they are all actively engaged in the system and that it is done through primary care levels.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me about young adolescent mental health services, YAMHS.  I will ask for that file and have that review for the Deputy.  She raised it with me previously.  I have asked the HSE to report to me on it so that I can see what is going on in that respect because it appears to be flying against what I am trying to do.  We want to have a register of services down to community level.  We want to have a single access point that people can ring to find out who is in their area because nobody might have heard of YAMHS.  Two per cent of the population may know about it but the other 80% needs to be made aware of it.  Once we get that registry, which is complete, and the phone line, the single access point, established, all of these services will have to be put on a sustainable footing.  They will have to be recognised but they will also have to come to the party with governance of a clinical and financial nature, corporate governance structures and all of that. There are some services that nobody knows how they originated or what they are doing.  Does they involve talking to students in schools?  I would have concerns about that.  We have to make sure that these services have a proper level of governance but that single access point will force that and address the funding issue also over time.  That is the plan.</p></speech>

The fundamental causes of the overcrowding and delays in providing care to patients are the capacity deficits in terms of acute infrastructure, hospitals consultant numbers and other resources.</p><p>Demographic factors, including our increasing and ageing population, have led to significant increases in demand for health care, including acute hospital and mental health services.  However, decades of underinvestment, combined with one of the lowest number of consultants on a population basis in the OECD, have led to significant and growing capacity deficits.  The national development plan, NDP, commitment to provide &euro;10.9 billion in capital funding for health services in the next decade is an important first step in addressing the overwhelming acute hospital capacity deficits that the association has highlighted.  The capacity deficits are one of the main causes of delays in providing acute hospital care to patients.  This has been acknowledged in the capacity review published earlier this year.  The NDP commitment to fund the expansion of our acute public hospital capacity is long overdue, as our acute hospital and mental health services are at breaking point, with unacceptable delays being endured by patients in obtaining emergency and scheduled care.  The current shortage of acute, ICU and rehabilitation hospital beds, mental health beds, essential equipment and hospital consultants is preventing the provision of essential hospital care that the population needs and deserves.  The NDP&rsquo;s proposal to put in place an additional 2,600 acute hospital beds must be assessed by reference to the current hospital and emergency department crisis.  It is important to take account of the fact that acute hospital inpatient beds were cut by 1,400 in the past decade, at a time they should have been increased, at least in tandem with the country&rsquo;s increasing and ageing population.</p><p> The deficit in acute public hospital beds will not be remedied in full by the proposed expansion of 2,600.  The ESRI project a 37% increase in patient demand for hospital services by 2030.  This confirms that a greater increase in hospital bed capacity than currently proposed will be required in future.  It is now vitally important, however, that an annual commissioning plan is agreed to put the additional 2,600 acute beds in place much earlier than the ten-year period proposed in the NDP.  This is of paramount importance in order that our hospitals can deliver safe, high-quality hospital care to patients without the unacceptable current reliance on trolleys and increasing waiting lists.</p><p> The association has highlighted that the cost of implementing the proposals in the Sl&aacute;intecare report has been understated, and will cost the taxpayer &euro;20 billion if implemented over ten years, compared with &euro;2.8 billion stated in the report.  In its submission to the independent review group in February, the association also outlined that the removal of private health insurance income from public hospitals will have a devastating effect on hospital operating budgets, crippling their ability to treat an ever-increasing number of patients, unless central funding fully provides the resources to address the growing capacity and operating deficits, while also replacing the insurance income foregone.</p><p> It is astonishing that the Sl&aacute;intecare report contains an underestimation of this magnitude.  The proposal to remove private care income from public hospitals by itself will cost the public hospitals &euro;6.5 billion over a ten-year period.  When adjusted for inflation, the estimated cost will be in the region of &euro;8 billion per decade, which is &euro;800 million in lost hospital income per year.  Based on our collective experience, the IHCA and its hospital consultant members have no confidence that the loss in private health insurance income will be replaced by the Exchequer.  This is especially a concern as the State has for decades struggled to adequately fund the public acute hospital system.  In the context of the ESRI projected increase in demand for hospital care by 2030,</p><p>removing the private revenue stream defies logic and will further cripple the public health service.</p><p> Considering the resultant under-resourcing of public hospitals, it would only serve to exacerbate the existing consultant recruitment and retention crisis.  This proposal will cause an exodus of experienced consultants from the public hospitals, thereby reducing the availability of highly specialised clinical services to patients in public hospitals.  The difficulties and challenges faced by the public hospital system are a consequence of years of under-funding and under-resourcing, which have severely restricted and reduced the capacity of public hospitals to meet increasing demand.</p><p> The association&rsquo;s survey of 317 recently appointed consultant members, which was conducted in the past week, confirms that acute hospital and mental health services face an escalating and unprecedented consultant recruitment and retention crisis because of the ongoing blatant discrimination by the State and health service employers against new hospital consultants.  Almost all respondents to the survey agree that the lower salary terms imposed on new consultants are having an adverse impact on the delivery of patient care due to the large number of consultant posts that cannot be filled, are filled on a temporary basis or left unfilled.  More than 70% of new consultants have confirmed that they will seriously consider resigning from their public hospital posts unless the discriminatory salary terms are corrected.  Furthermore, the vast majority of respondents - 95% - strongly agreed that the lower salary terms do not reflect the importance of the work, and level of responsibility that they hold.</p><p> This survey has provided categorical evidence that our highly-trained specialist consultants will not continue to work in our health services if the persistent and blatant discrimination against them continues.  Recently appointed consultants are on salaries significantly below those of their pre-October 2012 colleagues, some of whom are currently being paid up to 57% more.  It is not surprising that 72% of new consultants ranked equal pay for equal work as the most important aspect of their working terms and conditions.</p><p> In addition, 92% of the respondents confirmed that they were aware of colleagues working abroad who will not return to work in the Irish public health system as a direct result of the lower salary terms.  The results of the survey should set alarm bells ringing at Government level, as it is now abundantly clear that consultant delivery of services to patients is on a cliff edge, because it is being fundamentally and critically undermined by the State&rsquo;s persistent discrimination against these internationally sought-after specialist hospital consultants.</p><p> The pursuit of this discrimination has resulted in approximately 450 approved consultant posts, a full 15% of the total, which cannot be filled on a permanent basis.  About half of these posts are vacant and some are filled on an agency basis, at costs which are up to three times the discriminatory salaries being paid to the recently appointed consultants.  The age profile of the consultant workforce suggests this problem will increase dramatically, as 25% are over 55 years of age.  The current two-tier pay system for consultants is the major obstacle to recruitment of new consultants.  The new entrant salary is not competitive in the global market for consultants, and is discriminatory in the extreme towards new hospital consultants.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss these capacity issues in infrastructure and consultant staffing and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

As we said in our letter in June when we requested this meeting, we have concerns regarding the count, which we have been conducting for decades, and the point that it reached in June of this year.  That is why we sought this meeting.  It is clear from our statistics, which are accepted as a measure of overcrowding in the public health service, that we will exceed the high number that we reached last year for those admitted for acute hospital care and for whom there were no beds.  It was just under 100,000 patients last year.</p><p>In the time available, I will concentrate on three main issues we believe the Oireachtas can influence.  We have provided a comprehensive background note on where we think the issue has come from.  The reasons are not going to be any different to those suggested by my colleagues from the IMO and the IHCA.  I am not, therefore, going to read them but will be happy to take questions.  At paragraph 1.7 of our submission, we advise that the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the Tallaght investigation by HIQA in 2012, the ESRI report of October 2017, the capacity report of 2018 and the Nevin Economic Research Institute's working paper on equality in Irish health care produced in May 2018 all inform our submission.  They are all referenced.  The overwhelming issue for us is capacity and staffing, followed by the issue of pay.  Fundamentally, we believe the public hospitals system is in crisis and that bed capacity is not sufficient to meet demand.  We confirm the daily effect of this on patients and the nursing staff and medical staff generally who work in these departments.  It leads to early decisions to leave places of work and it has, unfortunately, subjected our members, in particular, to a high incidence of violence and aggression in the workplace which is completely unacceptable.</p><p> I will read the submission starting from page 4.  Targeted protected additional funding is required that is linked with significant reform that supports the provision of services at the front line rather than the bureaucratic processes that exist within health.  The problems that need to be addressed include the reconfiguration of divisions within the HSE so that all services are managed in an integrated service delivery model.  The current mode of divisional budgeting and management of services works against efficiencies and cost savings across the service.  There is a need to significantly increase bed capacity in the acute and step-down care areas, expand the number of community intervention teams and expand nursing services in long-stay facilities to relieve pressure on acute hospitals.  The annual stand off between the HSE and Department of Health has commenced this year.  We have all heard the projections of budget overruns.  What that means for those who depend on public health services is that their services have been cut.  In many instances, home care packages are no longer available in certain areas while services which are funding-dependent and demand-driven are no longer available to citizens, which is simply unacceptable.  Patients have no alternative then but to attend emergency departments for services.  Independent oversight of appropriate allocation is not available and must be introduced.  This will require a managed accountability for subsequent spending.  The model adopted for capital allocation protections should be mirrored to protect funding for specific services.  Funding for front-line services must include funding for staffing plans and service developments.  The INMO has publicly supported the Sl&aacute;intecare report and now calls on the committee to recommend that Government must prioritise the required funding to execute and implement the transitional plan and ongoing annual budget increases.  These must be protected and considered central to all Government policy to deliver the much-required reform.</p><p> The INMO has engaged with the HSE on staffing over the past two years.  We have had disputes on staffing and an inability to staff new beds that have come on stream in care of the elderly and acute services.  There is an acute shortage of nurses and midwives.  I concentrate on nurses for this part of the submission because the maternity strategy is a different matter and does not affect emergency department posts.  We identified nursing grade vacancies in 2016 which were very close to 350 in emergency departments alone.  We reached an agreement with the HSE that to provide the best care to patients who were boarded in emergency departments and for whom ward capacity was not available 183 new nursing posts were required.  Neither of those targets has been met and the posts remain unfilled.  With the assistance of the WRC following a dispute, we agreed a funded workforce plan for 2017.  The target for 2017 was to expand the nursing and midwifery workforce by 1,224 and that target was not reached.  The number reached by December was just under 800 of the 1,224.  That is not because recruitment is not taking place, it is because retention has become a bigger problem than recruitment.  Currently, the average time to recruit a nurse is six months.  We do not have agreement on a funded workforce plan for 2018 and we are in dispute with the HSE on the delay.  We were supposed to have an agreement in November 2017 and as late as yesterday the HSE advised us that it will not have its final draft until later this week or possibly next week.  It is now July.  That means no matter how many nursing posts the HSE funds this year, they will not be standing beside patient beds before 2019.  That reduces completely the ability to increase capacity.</p><p> The combination of generally low pay for nurses and poor working conditions within understaffed services, including emergency departments, is a significant issue in the recruitment and retention of nurses in the Irish health service.  It is clear to the INMO that the issue of nurses' pay needs to be urgently addressed to assist in solving the problem of staffing within emergency departments.  A review of nurses pay is allowed within the provisions of the public service stability agreement.  A report from the Public Service Pay Commission is imminent.  The commission was tasked with examining the influence of pay on recruitment and retention issues which it identified as existing within the professions of nursing and midwifery and the medical profession in its first report.  The commission is due to report at the end of July following its consideration of submissions and its own research.  If low pay for nurses is not corrected, we will be unable to recruit and retain the nurses required to care for our citizens inside and outside the hospital system.  That is a simple matter of fact.  We will also be unable maintain present bed capacity, never mind the increased capacity we all agree is required to grow services for our ageing population.  We have reached a pivotal tipping point in recruitment and retention of nursing staff and it will have detrimental effects if not addressed by Government.  These effects will include the closure of beds and lengthening waiting lists.  The framework on nurse staffing was published by the Department of Health and accepted by it as the determinant of nursing posts required to look after patients based on a scientific determinant, taking patient dependency and outcomes and skills mix into account.  It must be fully funded and implemented to determine how many nurses are needed.  Unfortunately, the initial draft of the funded workforce plan for 2018 contains no allocation of funding to implement the framework despite the commitment in the 2018 HSE service plan.</p><p> What are the effects of all of this on the front line and what happens to patients when they attend our emergency departments having absolutely no alternative?  What happens to our nursing, medical and other staff who are trying to provide the best care they can?  Our members have advised that the constant pressure of overcrowding, inadequate staffing levels, delayed care to patients and negative patient outcomes are leading them to personally suffer burn out and stress at an early stage in their careers.  Nurses are also reporting to the INMO that they find themselves answering and apologising to the public before internal and external enquiries which they regularly must attend to explain inadequate services.  They clearly outline their belief that the HSE does not support them appropriately when matters outside of their control cause patients to have poorer outcomes and where inadequate care is provided in unsuitable environments.  Nursing staff feel a duty to raise concerns about patient care, as do their medical colleagues, as it is a fundamental professional responsibility of a registered nurse.  It is unacceptable for professional nursing staff to feel that they are unsupported by their employers in dealing with the consequences of systematic failure in the health service.</p><p> A recent HSE report on assaults against staff in acute statutory hospitals indicates that 9,901 reported assaults were recorded between 2008 and 2018.  To be clear, that report does not cover any of our voluntary hospitals, which represent a large portion of the employment census for nurses and midwives.  More than 70% of those reported assaults were against nursing staff.</p><p>There is clear evidence that the numbers of verbal and physical assaults increase when long waiting times and inadequate and inappropriate staffing are features of healthcare provision.  Unfortunately, we are finding that many of the assaults are career-ending for the people we represent.  We believe this is a manifestation of poor planning and a lack of commitment to fund and implement agreed reform and national agreements.  It cannot be ignored and simply frowned upon without the Oireachtas making an unambiguous commitment to front-line nursing staff that it will provide adequate and protected funding and for reform to correct the unacceptable experiences of one third of the entire workforce of the health service.</p><p> The reality of the emergency department nurses' daily and nightly experience is described as deep frustration and anger at the fact that they feel unable to care for their patients' fundamental needs in a way that they would wish to and that they are trained to do.  The physical environment in which patients are crammed together within touching distance of each other and with little or no privacy and poor hygiene facilities is completely inadequate to maintain a patient's dignity and privacy.  It is dehumanising and degrading and an experience we should not allow to continue for citizens.  We already know from our figures from June this year that this problem is going to get worse before the end of the year and that it is going to be much worse than it was last year.</p><p> We believe the time for reviewing and analysing the emergency department overcrowding problem is over.  Our members require immediate action as they cannot continue to tolerate this situation for themselves or their patients.  We are heading into winter which is very likely to be worse than in 2017, unless appropriate action is taken, including proper planning and the provision of focused funding.  Those in HSE management often rush to defend the work they are doing to solve the problem.  The reality is it is getting worse and we need decisive action at the Cabinet table to implement and fund the measures that will actually work.  The alternative is simply not tenable for citizens and certainly not for our members.</p><p> We again repeat our request which we set out at the start of the submission that a commitment be made to ensure protected, targeted and sustained investment to allow real reform; to ensure the bed capacity report will be implemented; primary and long-term care services will be developed, as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report; and bed capacity in the acute hospital sector will be expanded.  Workforce planning for nursing based on patient needs must be funded to ensure adequate front-line nursing staff.  The recruitment and retention of nurses are dependent on the correction of the low pay rates for those in the nursing and midwifery grades who are the lowest paid professionals in the public health service.  Globally, they fare very badly with those in the countries' that are also short of nurses but which are recruiting our graduates and, increasingly, our practised and experienced nursing workforce.  </p><p> I thank members for their time.  I will be happy to take questions on the issue.</p></speech>

For more than a decade the IMO has been highlighting the capacity issues across the health system.</p> <p>  Ireland has a growing and ageing population.  For many decades the proportion of the population over the age of 65 years remained static, but it has now begun to change and the pace of that change will accelerate rapidly in the years ahead.  In simple terms, an additional 20,000 people each year will reach the age of 65 years and, as life expectancy increases, the number aged over 80 will double.  In the last ten years the total population has grown by 300,000, or 7%, while the population aged over 65 years has increased by 166,000, or 34%.  That gives an idea of the scale of the problem.  At the same time, the healthcare system has undergone significant budget cuts.  Between 2007 and 2014, both staffing levels and the number of inpatient beds fell by 13%.  Public health expenditure only began to increase from 2015 and even at that, it failed to keep pace with demand.  The pressure exerted by demographic changes and financial cuts is manifesting in unprecedented overcrowding in emergency departments and waiting lists for outpatient appointments and elective procedures.</p> <p>  Bed occupancy rates in hospitals have risen to an average of 97%.  In model 4 hospitals that figure increases to 104%.  These rates are well above internationally recognised safe occupancy rates of 85% for inpatient care and 80% for critical care.  The HSE's full capacity protocol which is designed to act as a safety valve when emergency department functioning is compromised has become the norm.  The protocol was implemented on hundreds of occasions in 2017.  International evidence shows that high bed occupancy rates are associated with a number of adverse factors, including increased risk of healthcare associated infections such as MRSA, increased mortality, an increased probability of an adverse event and risks to staff welfare.</p> <p>  A significant contributor to long waiting lists is inadequate medical staffing levels.  Public health services are facing an unprecedented crisis in recruitment and retention in the medical and other health professions, as clearly evidenced by the fact that we have at any given time more than 450 vacant consultant posts.  That is in the context of a total consultant workforce of approximately 3,000; therefore, it is significant.  Almost 90% of consultants who trained in Ireland but who are currently working abroad have indicated they will not return owing to the discrimination on pay scales.  One third of existing consultants are considering taking up a post abroad in the foreseeable future.  In 2017 the Public Appointments Service, PAS, produced figures which confirmed that the public health service was unable to attract applicants.  For one in ten consultant posts no applications were received and the PAS could not identify a suitable applicant for 22 of the 84 posts.  That is a real change in what would have been a highly competitive market ten years ago in which consultants, nurses and other healthcare professionals were vying for jobs in Ireland.  Almost 700 GPs are due to retire in the next few years, while, at the same time, 30% of GP trainees are intending to emigrate.  Almost 20% of recent GP graduates have emigrated and a further 70% believe they may do so in the near future.  That means that a growing number of GMS lists are attracting few or no applicants.  Again, they were highly sought after lists, for which there was a lot of competition, but now we see nobody even applying for the posts.</p> <p>  Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, or doctors in training, are leaving the system in large numbers across all specialties and, alarmingly, it is happening after the intern year, the first year of training.  That cannot be explained by the notion that doctors normally go abroad for training.  They are doing so very early.  There is huge apathy and they believe they will get through the first year and then go abroad to a system that values them and they have no intention of returning.  Two thirds of NCHDs perceive pay to be the primary reason for emigration, while 83% believe the pay disparity at consultant level will impact on their decision on whether they should apply for consultant posts in Ireland.  Irish trained doctors at NCHD level are three times more likely to emigrate than their UK counterparts.  We hear a lot about the struggles of the NHS, yet in Ireland NCHDs are three times more likely to emigrate.  We cannot hope to reform or reconfigure health services unless and until they are capable of attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to deliver care to patients.  That is not the case.</p> <p>  This is a patient care issue.  We should not continue to spend money on short-term measures without significant and sustained investment at the same time in the public health service.  The annual budgetary allocations do not even keep pace with current service levels and demand.  We are not investing in health services.  We have had numerous reports, including Sl&aacute;intecare, the health service capacity review and A Future Together - Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service, all of which show that we need to invest in increasing capacity across the health system, in tandem with a significant budgetary allocation to allow for service development.  The main point the IMO makes is that sometimes we tend to focus on one issue in the health service and think that if we provide funding, it will solve everything.  The reports all show that it needs to be funded across the board and that everything must happen at the same time because otherwise we are playing a zero sum game and the problems are only going to manifest somewhere else in the service.</p> <p>  There are five key areas the IMO asks the committee to consider for urgent action.  The first is increasing capacity in the acute hospital system.  The health service capacity review shows that we immediately require approximately 1, 200 additional inpatient beds and 50 adult critical care beds in order to meet safe bed occupancy levels.  It is not to meet demand but just to treat patients in hospital safely.</p><p>Given that the majority of inpatient admissions now come through the emergency department and there is a considerable backlog for outpatient appointments and elective procedures, the number required is likely to be even higher.  We have 1,531 fewer inpatient beds in the hospital system compared to 2007 and this is at a time when the population is growing and, as a result of demographic changes, the elderly population, in particular, is increasing.  An immediate assessment of the number of acute beds available is required with the financial and manpower resources made available to upgrade and reinstate beds along with a detailed plan for investment in bed numbers into the future.<br/><br/>As is the case for our colleagues in the INMO, it takes a long time to recruit doctors, as it does nurses.  Six months would be a fast turnaround to recruit a doctor into the system.  Unless we start identifying, planning and resourcing now, we have no hope in 2019 of making any significant changes.  We need to increase the number of consultants across the hospital system.  We currently have just 1.43 specialists per 1,000 population compared to a western European average of 2.4 per 1,000.<br/><br/>The Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing 2003, often referred to as the Hanly report, set out ratios of consultant to population that would need to be met to provide a consultant-delivered service, which we will all agree is the type of service we should have.  That would improve quality of care and patient safety, as important clinical decisions would be made faster and at a higher level.  However, non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, continue to outnumber consultants at a ratio of 2:1.  We are short approximately 1,400 consultant posts based on current population figures.  Given our current difficulties in recruiting and retaining consultants, urgent action is required, or we will continue to struggle to appoint the number and calibre of consultants we need to provide safe patient care.  In view of the growing disparity in consultant pay, this has now become a more urgent problem.  There were 450 vacant posts at consultant level when the disparity was at a  lower level.  Now the disparity has increased to, on average, &euro;50,000 per post and it is almost impossible to see how we will get consultants to come into the system.  Equal work for equal pay is a basic principle.<br/><br/>Another issue we would ask the committee to consider is to adequately resource the national clinical programmes.  Those programmes and models of care such as the emergency medicine programme, the acute medicine programme and the model of care for elective surgery should be fully implemented and resourced.  These programmes represent the most effective and efficient use of resources.  As a service and as a State, we spent a long time writing reports, which we all agree is the right thing to do, but we then find there is no funding available, they are left on the shelf, nothing happens and the problem worsens.  The acute medicine programme was originally set up to provide an alternative pathway to the acute system to allow general practitioners, GPs, to directly refer patients to acute medical units, AMUs.  However, due to lack of capacity and under-resourcing of both the emergency medicine programme and the acute medicine programme, AMUs are no longer satisfying the original criteria and with the current overcrowding in emergency departments, they now simply serve as an extension of those departments around the country.<br/><br/>Waiting lists for inpatient procedures primarily affect patients awaiting elective procedures.  The model of care for elective surgery, if fully implemented and resourced, will improve access, quality and cost by reducing waiting times, abolishing cancellations, optimising day surgery and average length of stay, standardising care, and optimising the use of theatre resources.  It makes no sense for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to purchase care from the private sector while simultaneously having a policy decision that imposes budgetary constraints and rolling theatre closures and cancellations in the public sector. <br/><br/>We need to address delayed discharges with increased resources for long-term and rehabilitative care for patients.<b></b>No patient should be in hospital longer than is necessary and everyone should be discharged to an appropriate setting.  Failure to transition patients to the most appropriate setting increases costs and reduces efficiency as patients are in the wrong place for the type of care they need.  While community intervention teams have helped to support early discharges for some patients, we need to invest significantly in long-term and short-term beds for elderly patients as well as in<b></b>intensive home care packages.  That needs to be seen as a priority, given the known demographic changes, not what might happen or whether we will have a bad winter.<br/><br/>We need to invest in general practice and chronic disease management.  With an ageing population and growing rates of chronic disease, all the evidence points to the need to shift the model of care towards general practice and a GP-led primary care system.  An extensive body of international research shows that continuity of care and a patient-centred approach that is specific to general practice is associated with reduced mortality rates, particularly in the elderly, greater patient satisfaction, improved health promotion, increased adherence to medication, and reduced hospital use.<font color="#2F2F2F"></font><br/><br/>Chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and diabetes account for approximately 40% of hospital admissions and 75% of hospital bed days.  Acute services currently undertake an enormous volume of chronic care, at significant expense to the taxpayer, that could, if properly resourced, be managed in general practice.  General practice will not immediately resolve hospital overcrowding, but, in the long-term, if we invest now in GP-led chronic disease management programmes, for which GPs are trained, along with capacity measures to build up medical and nursing levels in general practice, we can reduce future growth in demand on the hospital system and patients can be seen and cared for in the most appropriate setting.  However, following years of austerity and extensive cuts to the resources available to general practice, the current system is under-funded and working to capacity.  Financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts reduced resources per general medical services, GMS, patient by 38%.  The immediate reversal of the FEMPI cuts is required to restore stability to general practice before any new workload can be taken on.<br/><br/>We appeal to all members of the committee to urge the Government, in the context of the forthcoming budget, to seriously address the problems in our health system and recognise the damage caused by delays for patients in accessing much needed healthcare.  We also ask the committee to recognise the potential for Ireland and those who work in the health services to deliver a first-class health system if sufficient resources were allocated to allow this to happen.</p></speech>

They all spoke about the recruitment and retention of medical staff.  Bright people are entering the medical field in all specialties and many of them are emigrating.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said that many of our more experienced medics are travelling abroad, which is probably a new phenomenon.  The newly qualified people tended to go abroad but it is quite worrying that we losing experienced people.  They are being treated better abroad and they also receive continuous training there.  The recruitment of people is straightforward but will the witnesses comment on what they believe can be done to retain people?</p> <p>  I would also like their opinion on the funding of local general hospitals.  We have a good hospital in west Cork, Bantry General Hospital.  If it was allocated more funding, it could assist the larger hospitals in Cork city.  We are currently trying to enhance its rehabilitation and endoscopy units.  If it was given a small allocation, it would certainly ease the pressure on the bigger hospitals and it would also assist the local people in that they would not have to travel quite a long journey to Cork city.  I would welcome the witnesses comments on that point.</p> <p>  Are there any plans to broaden the Voluntary Health Insurance, VHI, incentive to home-fund step-down services, or are there any other community initiatives that would free up beds?  Do the witnesses believe that the Minister for Health is acting in good faith in the formulation of a new GP contract, which he promised to deliver before the end of this year?  As we are now more than half way through 2018, do they believe he is acting in good faith?  </p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe that incidence of people not showing up for appointments is slowing the system down?  How can that be addressed?</p> <p>  Who makes the decisions in emergency departments at night on whether patients need to be kept in or sent home?  Should this system be different or could it be different?  Do the witnesses believe their members hands are often tied due to worries about legal issues or implications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.729" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018071100002#H00400"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their frankness.</p><p>We might agree with some of it but we have to ask questions as well.  Pay parity is not something we can renegotiate in public.  It is a matter between the relevant bodies, the HSE and the Minister.  It would be inappropriate to suggest what should be done.  With whom are we competing for places in the international sphere to attract people?  Are we competing with the UK, France, Germany or the Netherlands, or are we competing with the Middle East?  The idea that we can compete with the Middle East is a myth.  It is not possible and we need to be careful about going down that road.</p><p> We need also to address the capacity deficiencies.  This committee has discussed them many times over the past year or two.  There is an urgent necessity to address them and that is being done in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am not so certain it will be possible to accelerate the programme.  Dr. O'Hanlon referred to the under-costing by the committee on Sl&aacute;intecare.  I do not want to be a dampener on this subject but we have to bear in mind that the country still has a &euro;210 billion debt following the recovery.  The theory is that we recovered from the financial and economic crash; we have.  We have almost got to current budgetary levels such that we can pay our way on an annual basis but we would not want to fall asleep on it.  Rather than create the impression that there is endless money available, we need to recognise what we are competing with in all the other Departments.</p><p> We are among the top three or four OECD countries in health expenditure.  I would like all of our witnesses to comment on why we are so close to the top in terms of expenditure yet so close to the bottom in terms of delivery.  We are not doing well in that pecking order.  It is having a debilitating effect on health services in general at every level.  If it becomes known nationally and internationally that we have a serious deficiency, we cannot deliver, and we are way down the ladder in delivering to patients, then nobody will want to work in that service.  I agree on the filling of general practitioner posts but those posts have been done down over the past few years, although not necessarily by anything the general practitioners have done or failed to do.  It has become the norm to say that they are underfunded and do not have the capacity to deal with the volume of patients in their areas.  The volume of patients is increasing and the ageing population is against us.  Incidentally, that is not all true.  We have more young people in this country now than we have ever had.  It has now been recognised, reluctantly, within the service that particularly in the greater Dublin area and the east, there is a huge number of young people in the system relative to older people.  It is different in other parts of the country but we need to recognise this.</p><p> Which of the countries with which we are competing for staff and facilities has a system that is working the way we want ours to work?  It is as simple as that.  I am not a great believer in the HSE as a structure for delivering services at all.  It is not possible to have a dual system such as we have with the Department of Health, on the one hand, dealing directly with people and the HSE, on the other.  </p><p> We were all informed that the purpose of primary care centres was to intercept the patient at an early stage and deal with those issues that could be dealt with at that level.  I am not sure I have evidence yet that it is happening.  I would like to see the evidence and hear more about it.  We have systems within systems and we all seem to be competing with each other.  The result is that the patient appears to wait longest.  When a patient is told they must wait for a year, a year and a half or two years, he or she is dismayed.  The patient's confidence in the system to deliver is gone straight away.  There is no use waiting around for it.  It just does not work.  There is something wrong with the way we deliver the services and while there is a money element to it, there is also something else.  Our systems are not interlinking and the various systems are not complementary to each other.  They are working independently.  Consultants will tell us that if they were looking for access to theatre, theatre staff or back-up services, they may not be available at the time they want them.  As a result, the patient has to wait.  It is not good enough.</p><p> We need to monitor pay parity.  We need to compare our delivery of services with those who have better deliver of services while spending less money.  Our own credibility, and my credibility as a public representative, are on the record when it comes to telling the public what they are supposed to do in those circumstances.</p></speech>

In the past three years, since January 2015, we have taken on more than 11,000 additional staff in the HSE.  I understand that the numbers have gone from 99,000 to more than 110,000.  However, that increase in staffing levels does not seem to have delivered any additional capacity.  What are the witnesses' views?  Was there a plan within the HSE as regards prioritising where people should be employed?  Is it prioritising the areas that can deliver a better service?</p> <p>  I wish to ask the IMO representatives about the contract negotiations.  We are talking about a contract that is more than 40 years old.  Agreeing a new contract will take time.  Could any element of the negotiations be expedited or fast-tracked to support GPs to deliver the service they want?  If we can assist them, they can provide a better service which, in turn, will take the strain off other services within the health system.</p> <p>  Returning to the INMO presentation, Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha referred to the reconfiguration of the health service.  What aspect of reconfiguration are they talking about?  If that proposal has been given to the HSE, is it the case that the HSE is not responding or does not want to listen to outside bodies?  For instance, I did a report back in 2012 on university graduates and final year medical students.  More than 60% of those graduating that year confirmed that they intended to leave the country within 12 months.</p><p>That was six years ago and we seem to have done very little to encourage people to stay.  From the IHCA and IMO point of view, there seems to be a significant drain on doctors across all categories, including existing consultants who have been <i>in situ </i>for some time.  Apart from the pay issue, there seems to be a serious morale issue in hospitals.  Is this because of the structure of management?  I was recently contacted by a consultant who had to take a decision on the management of a patient on a Sunday night.  Three administration people were more or less telling the consultant how to manage the patient.  I become concerned when I hear this is happening.  Is there a problem with the managerial structure in the HSE and insufficient effort being made in training managers?  Nursing staff, medical staff and care assistants go through a whole spectrum of training.  Is the HSE providing enough training for managers to achieve the best possible outcomes in delivering services in the health system and ensure people work as a team rather than working against one another, which seems to be one of the problems?<br/><br/>With regard to pay comparisons, all the organisations referred to pay, which is only one reason for the difficulties we have in the health service.  It would be useful to have comparisons showing the pay of nursing staff, staff nurses, junior doctors and consultants in other countries.  It is important to have such comparisons.  Very good presentations were made here this morning, many of which touched on pay but we have not seen comparisons with other countries.  It would be useful to see what we are competing with.<br/><br/>The other issue is the ratio of doctors to nurses in the hospital system.  I have not seen any comparisons of that ratio with other countries.  A number of years ago, I had to attend a hospital outside Ireland for medical treatment that was not available here.  It struck me was that the ratio of nursing staff and doctors was much lower than in Ireland, whereas there were far more care assistants.  Have we done comparisons with other countries?  I am not saying we should reduce the number of nursing staff or doctors but we could get a better delivery of service using other people in other areas.  Can we have some comparisons on that issue?</p></speech>

I will start with the issue Deputy Murphy O'Mahony raised in respect of retention.  We are on record and have been very vocal on the issue of retention being as big an issue as the issue of recruitment.  There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that pay is the determining factor.  We are not competing.  We are not at the races.  We have comparative figures which are compiled by our international colleagues in the International Council of Nurses.  These compare, on the basis of purchasing power parity, the value of the earnings of an Irish nurse across Asian and European countries.  When we compare with Canada, the United States, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Sweden and New Zealand, which are the main countries that recruit our members and nurses, we fare very badly.</p></speech>

Are the hours comparable?  I just wonder about the hourly rate.</p></speech>

Nurses in Ireland work a 39-hour week.  In all of the countries with which we compared nurses work 37 hours apart from the UK where they work 37.5 hours.  Deputy O'Reilly is correct that the hourly rate is less if one is looking at purchasing power parity.  In other words, we have to work longer to get the income.</p></speech>

The biggest problem we have is that when our members go to work there are not enough of them to provide the service.  This makes their conditions very difficult to work in and increases the incidence of burnout.  This has been studied internationally and in Ireland as part of the RN4CAST.  There is absolutely no doubt that staffing levels are inadequate to meet demand.</p> <p>  If I could combine that answer with my answer to Senator Burke's question on the issue of prioritising areas, it is fairly simple in our view.  The comparison and staffing determinant for nursing is not based on the number of doctors but on patient outcomes.  That is the model the Department of Health has accepted and agreed to implement.  The problem is that the Department is not funding the implementation.  We know from the study conducted over the past four years in four of our large acute hospitals, including Beaumont, Our Lady of Lourdes and Loughlinstown hospitals, that the outcomes for patients are significantly improved when a staffing ratio of 80 nurses to 20 healthcare assistants is put in place.  The difference it makes to the mortality rate of patients is incredible.  The agency spend and value for money are improved significantly because retention is improved.  All of this is known to the HSE and Department of Health.  The only barrier is that it is not being funded for implementation, which is a big problem.</p> <p>  When the number of consultant posts is increased and hospitals get busier, more nurses are needed to staff the additional workloads.  In the funded workforce plan the HSE does not determine the staffing increase that will be needed for increasing services.</p> <p>  We have major problems in community care.  We have already reached an agreement with the HSE, which is two years old, on expanding the role of the nurse in long-term care, step-down units and primary care.  There is absolutely no reason in this day and age that patients should be transported from care for the elderly facilities to acute emergency departments to get services such as hydration or antibiotic therapy, which can be provided by nursing staff in those facilities.  They are trained and qualified to do it.   The problem is the process and procedure have not been built to allow them to do it.</p> <p>  In respect of other services, the community intervention team, CIT, model has proven to be extraordinarily successful in keeping patients out of hospital.  It needs to be funded and expanded.  The management of chronic disease is something nurses do in every jurisdiction.  In Ireland, there is a long-held view that the management of chronic disease can be delivered outside of acute hospitals.  We believe nurses are very well placed to provide that service.  They are qualified to do it.  They are expert in many of the diseases and chronic conditions that cause patients to be admitted to hospital, particularly respiratory conditions, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The role and function of the nurse is an area we are happy to talk about and examine.  We have reached agreements already which confirm that we will expand our practice.  However, we are baffled as to the reason that is not being taken on and utilised as a cost saving and value for money initiative but it requires additional numbers, and that is the problem.  We cannot get the numbers until we get the pay right.</p><p> On the VHI step-down initiatives, I would answer that question by saying community intervention teams are the way to go.</p><p> On Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's questions on funding local hospitals, she is absolutely correct that there are services that should not be centred in facilities such as Cork University Hospital.  St. Finbarr's Hospital, which is one of the main facilities that takes patients from Cork University Hospital, advised us recently that it was cutting nursing staff numbers.  We had to refer the matter to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and go into dispute with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Those are nursing led services.  They are extremely important to keep patients out of the acute hospital and allow discharge to the acute hospital.  They also allow general practitioners to admit directly to community hospitals such as Bantry hospital and other locations.  Cutting staff in those areas is a short-term funding measure that makes no sense.</p><p> Regarding endoscopy, it is on the record that there is cross-party support for the Sl&aacute;intecare report in respect of the availability of diagnostics outside the acute hospitals sector, which again is a matter that needs to be speeded up.</p><p> I think I have answered Deputy Durkan's questions on pay parity and who we are competing with.  We have two problems with the recruitment and retention of nurses.  One is that we are heavily dependent now on recruitment from non-European Union countries and have been for some time.  Nursing was one of the grades subjected to the moratorium, while other medical grades were excluded.  We are, therefore, still catching up from the posts that were not filled from 2007, which was when the moratorium was implemented in health.  We are down 2,000 posts from that point, even though our hospital activity, as my colleagues in the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have pointed out, is way over 100 in most hospitals in terms of bed occupancy, etc.</p><p> We are recruiting from non-EU countries, from which other countries are also recruiting.  When nurses acquire experience in a western environment like ours, the American and the Canadian markets come here to recruit them from us.</p></speech>

We spend a lot of money travelling to India and the Philippines to recruit and we are very thankful that nurses from those countries come here and staff our wards because without them we would have very real deficits.  However, what we are now finding is that health services in America, Canada and other countries are coming here to recruit and are succeeding because the packages they offer are very attractive.</p></speech>

In Ireland, we do not train enough to meet our needs.  We train more than other countries when we compare but we still do not train enough.  When we train nurses and midwives here, we do not do anything to retain them.  The Minister announced last year that every graduating nurse will have a permanent contract but, unfortunately, the bureaucracy surrounding that means that England has recruited them before we have even interviewed them.  It is a crisis.  It is not something we believe is fully taken on board.  We attended recently the national economic dialogue.  We are very disappointed that health did not feature as one of the discussion points.  Health should not be viewed as an area on which money is being spent without any return.  Health is under-funded and reform is required but that reform has to be targeted in value for money areas such as those that nursing can bring to a service.</p> <p>  Advanced nurse practitioners have been the real benefit in emergency departments, EDs.  Where advanced nurse practitioners are working we see numbers decrease.  We are supposed to have a 7% ratio of our total nursing workforce at advanced practice level.  That would require 700 advanced nurse practitioners.  Currently, we have fewer than 300.  This year, the HSE is saying it will try to fund 30.  It is simply not enough.</p></speech>

Most of our emigration is to English speaking countries, particularly Canada, Australia, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, the USA.  The salary differential is at least 40% - it is 60% in Canada and the USA - over the newly appointed consultant salary.  We are uncompetitive with those English speaking countries that take by far the bulk of our consultant emigration.  I have experience of trying to retain people we have trained and lost to Canada where they are paid twice as much.</p></speech>

I graduated in Ireland and did my intern senior house officer, SHO, registrar training here.  I did two fellowship training courses in the United States.  In terms of the contracts I was offered at the end of my fellowship training in the US, ultimately, I took my job in Ireland but I was offered twice as much money in the United States.  That was for academic, four days a week posts and the salary would have been considered less money than I would have got had I gone into private practice in the United States, which was not something that interested me.<br/><br/>One of the centres I worked in was the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which is the number one centre in America.  There are vast numbers of Irish graduates in the US, including friends of mine.  When I went to Baltimore it was a big community of about 20 attending physicians or consultant equivalents and of those, I am the only person who has uprooted to come home.  The general consensus among them would be that I was mad to consider leaving.  These are people who are publishing in the <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>and developing medicine in an amazing way.  They are incredibly clever and engaged and we have lost them; they are gone.  Unless the position improves here they will not come back, and they would be an amazing asset to our health service.  It makes me sad that they will not come back here unless the terms and conditions we work in improve.</p></speech>

We have fallen so far behind in the past ten years we are not competitive.  In addition to that, there is a gulf between the salary paid to newly appointed consultants here and those paid to newly appointed consultants anywhere else in the English speaking world.</p></speech>

However, it was a political decision to subject appointments to a consultant position from October 2012 onwards to a 30% cut.</p><p>That was only partly ameliorated by the efforts of the IMO regarding new consultants, with a slight uplift from 2015.  That agreement has resulted in a doubling of the time it takes to reach the top point of the salary scale.  Now, with the recent settlement that was an acknowledgement of breach of contract, we have a situation where that disparity has been increased again, as Ms Clyne has pointed out.  Until that is addressed, we are not going to be able to recruit people to consultant positions in the numbers we need.  We are going to have situations where we advertise for the most senior positions in our hospitals but attract no applicants.  We are going to have a situation regarding the morale of newly-appointed doctors.  Instead of being at their most productive in their first five years as consultants, they will be feeling utterly demoralised by the fact they are not being paid at the same level as someone else doing the same job.  It was a political decision.  It is a political imperative that the decision be reversed and that we treat all consultants the same way, because only when we do that will be able to address the recruitment and retention issue.</p></speech>

Consultants faced a 30% cut.  What happened was vindictive, and that vindictiveness has resulted in a situation whereby patients throughout the country are being left without consultants.  That has to be addressed.</p></speech>

We talk about the fact that the spend on healthcare is increasing without ever discussing the population, healthcare needs and what is being delivered.  The spend will increase, but our spend is not even keeping pace with demand.  In respect of the elderly, I accept the point with regard to the number of young people and people along the east coast.  However, the point we are trying to make is that percentage of the population aged over 65 is increasing rapidly.  This is not in any way to blame the elderly for using resources, it is to recognise the current needs and the future demographic needs of that population in the context of our health service.</p></speech>

The population has increased.  That is correct and it means we have to increase our spend.  The fact is, however, that, in comparison with other OECD countries, our level of expenditure is already fairly sizeable.  It is not at the bottom of the scale by a long shot.  My question was whether the witnesses can give us some indication as to why our delivery of services to patients is behind that in other countries that spend less.  That information would be helpful to us in the course of what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

One is that we are coming from ten years of underspend.  That takes time to get it right.  There is also the model by means of which we deliver our health service, which is costly.  Some of these issues are addressed in Sl&aacute;intecare and also in the health capacity review.  Healthcare costs money and we do have to accept this.  More complex healthcare costs more money.  As technologies change and drugs and new treatments become available, they will cost money.  We should not be driving for our healthcare costs to be reduced.  We should spend money appropriately but the model of care must change.  We must also recognise that we have had ten years of no service development, a growing population and more complex care.  Those who work in the health service have delivered incredibly good work in very difficult conditions during this time.  This needs to be acknowledged, and it is not acknowledged very often.</p></speech>

We have to be aware of what is happening in the marketplace.  There are a number of indicators on this and they have been commented on by Dr. Durcan.  If we look at what we pay for agency doctors to fill consultant posts it is in the region of &euro;250,000 to &euro;350,000.  It is a false economy to perpetuate what I describe as the discrimination.  We are far better off investing in permanent young consultants.  It will provide a better service and continuity of care.  It is a misnomer to describe new consultants as new entrants to the health service.  In general, they have ten years or more experience.  They are highly trained and they should not be subjected to a new entrant salary reduction of any description.  As has already been stated, the reduction was extreme at 30%.</p> <p>  If we subject a group to a 30% reduction and do not reverse it when the economy improves, it is not surprising that there will be serious problems with recruiting and retaining.  Today, for example, there is a pay differential of approximately 57% between a newly-appointed consultant and somebody appointed prior to October 2012.  People do not realise the extent and extreme nature of this.  This gap will widen and increase, possibly to 70%, in the coming years.  If we do not arrest the problem quite soon we will lose a generation of highly trained specialists.  That is our primary concern.  I do not think we can afford to be in that position.  The health service will suffer significantly as a result.  Dare I say, medicine in Ireland could become a backwater if we do not keep up with the pace of change in medicine and surgery.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan referred to numbers and expenditure.  On the basis of the OECD figures across the board in health, Ireland seems to be one of the highest spenders.  We discussed this at a previous meeting of the committee.  When we look at acute hospital spend, we are somewhere in the middle of the OECD pack.  We are not at the high end because we have not been investing in acute hospitals.  The number of beds is lower and the occupancy is very high.  We have a lower number of consultants on a population basis.  We have almost the lowest number in the OECD in that regard.</p> <p>  It is important that we segment out the spend and look at what is happening in this regard.  The Deputy rightly asked the question that if the total pot of spend is big how come we do not get the benefit of it and where are we going wrong.  A geo-alignment review is being undertaken and we suggest that it may provide some of the keys to ensuring improved effectiveness.  It defies logic to have, on the one hand, hospital groups with separate management and separate budgets and, on the other, community health organisations with separate management and separate budgets.  Not only should they be geo-aligned they should be merged.  If we were looking at this in the private sector we would merge them, and have one set of management and one budget and a fully co-ordinated linkup between hospitals and the community.  We would have some hope of getting synergy and improved efficiency in this regard.  We highly recommend this.  It is hugely important.</p> <p>  Let us not lose sight of the fact that in our acute hospitals, despite the fact we have approximately 1,400 fewer inpatient beds, we treat approximately 250,000 more patients than we did in 2009.  That is a difference of approximately 20%.  A lot has been achieved in very difficult circumstances.  If, however, we do not recruit and fill our permanent posts, we will be in a very difficult position.</p></speech>

Having listened to the exchanges for the past two hours, I have to confess that I am thoroughly depressed on behalf of the good people of Ireland because, as has been laid out, the witnesses have dedicated their lives to healthcare but patients are suffering.  Much of the time, patients and staff are going through completely unacceptable situations in many emergency departments.  Regularly, patients and staff in acute settings are in completely unacceptable situations.  When patients are trying to be discharged from the hospital they cannot necessarily get an appropriate step-down facility.  If we want to move them back into their homes they cannot necessarily get the home care package or the home care hours they need.  We have a crisis.</p> <p>  The IMO represents GPs, but we have not really been speaking about the latter today.  They say they are in crisis.  Our GP and primary care sector is in crisis, our acute sector is in crisis, our emergency departments are in crisis and patients are suffering, as we all know, every day.</p><p>The reason I am depressed is that obviously there is very little money.  I heard solutions from the INMO that do not involve more pay.  Obviously, its representatives focused on pay as well but they have laid out solutions that do not involve more money, just running the system properly and making the HSE a desirable entity for which people will want to work, regardless of pay and regardless of their colleagues in Johns Hopkins Hospital.  Perhaps they will get a pay cut coming home.  However, they will be excited about returning because there is a wonderful academic centre of excellence they can come to where they can invent wonderful new treatments.<br/><br/>I took a look at pay and examined data from the OECD and various data sources around the world.  What is happening is perplexing.  Starting with doctors, numerous sources say our doctors are still some of the best paid in the world.  They are not the best paid and we are no longer in the top three countries.  However, we are in the top ten.  The problem is that the other English-speaking countries they can go to, such as Australia, Canada and America, pay more.  That does not necessarily mean that we should pay our doctors more than any other country in the world.  We cannot compete with American pay scales.  We never could and we never will.  That is not the value proposition when it comes to the Americans.  Australia is trickier.  It is paying a great deal of money and the nurses and doctors I have spoken to say it is a great place to work.  It is also warm more often than it is warm here.  It is a tricky place with which to compete.  The same is true of Canada.  It gets snow and sun.  However, the reality is that our doctors are not badly paid, but well paid.  Yes, they have taken an unmerciful hit.  They were extremely well paid and now they are just well paid.  I reiterate that we are still in the top seven in the world.<br/><br/>Matters are also tricky when it comes to nurses.  As the INMO correctly pointed out, the nurses are badly paid relative to other healthcare professionals of similar education.  Relative to private sector new entrants, however, they are very well paid as new entrants.  When it comes to a nurse versus an engineer, the private sector pays engineers, architects, lawyers and other professions that require a degree significantly less than the public sector.  I also took a look at nursing salaries around the world.  In 2013, nurses in this country were the third highest paid.  We were still in the top five countries in 2016.  I have looked at multiple data sources and all of them say that Irish nurses are among the best paid in the world.  I have looked at the various career sites and, in each case, Ireland is in the top ten.  There is something that has to be figured out there because, looking at it without having knowledge of what Irish nurses are dealing with, it appears that our nurses are pretty well paid.  Our doctors also appear to be well paid.  However, there is a strong feeling among the nurses and doctors that they should be paid far more, and that the reason they are leaving the country is that they are not paid more.  That is something we will have to figure out.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan asked the question I also wish to ask.  I fundamentally disagree with the earlier statements about chronic underinvestment in healthcare in Ireland.  The data simply do not show that.  In fact, they show the opposite.  This country invests more in healthcare than practically any other country on earth.  Again, the Americans are out on their own, but that is because of utterly dysfunctional system issues relating to private health insurance.  It is not the type of healthcare system I would like.  It is a great healthcare system if one can afford it, but America is not a good country in which to get sick if one is poor.  It is not true that we do not invest in healthcare.  The data are unambiguous.  We invest shedloads of money in healthcare whether one assesses it by percentage of GNP, purchasing power parity or investment per person.  In addition, our people are much younger than those in most other countries, so if one does an age adjustment, we spend more on healthcare in this country than anywhere else on earth except America.  We invest a vast amount of money in healthcare.  Perhaps we should pay even more but relative to other countries we pay our clinicians quite well.  In every data source I can find, we are listed in the top ten around the world.  That is not bad.  Clearly, it is not enough for the doctors and nurses, but it is not a small amount of money.<br/><br/>I wish to push further on this.  If we are spending more money on healthcare than virtually anybody else and we have a GP sector that is falling apart, emergency departments that in many cases on a Friday or Saturday night are simply not okay for either patients or staff and we have 95% occupancy of beds and so forth, where are we wasting money?  Clearly, we are wasting vast amounts of money somewhere if we are spending so much and our clinicians are so annoyed that they are leaving the country to work in other places.  We must be wasting billions of euro every year which we should be investing in drugs, doctors, nurses, beds, GPs and primary care but which we clearly are not doing.  The witnesses all work in the system so they can help us find the money.  Where are the billions that we should be pulling out of some parts of the system and reinvesting in the people the witnesses represent?  That is my first question.<br/><br/>Second, can the representatives of the three groups give us the top two cost neutral things they would do immediately, be it for capacity, their members or whatever?  I will briefly give the framework for this.  The fiscal space is &euro;800 million.  Different political parties have different interpretations of it, but that is the one that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il accept.  There is &euro;800 million available.  The confidence and supply agreement provides for a 2:1 ratio on tax and spend.  I believe that is wrong because I would not reduce taxes at present, but that is not my call.  However, if one does what is in the agreement there is approximately &euro;550 million left for investment.  If one pulls one quarter of that for health, which is the <i>pro rata</i>amount spent on health as a percentage of the total spend in the country, there is about &euro;150 million.  That does not include healthcare inflation so we can knock off another &euro;80 million for that.  Before we start there is approximately &euro;70 million available in the budget for new things.  To put that in context, Sl&aacute;intecare in year one requires approximately &euro;1 billion.  What are the cost neutral measures?<br/><br/>Third, what are the investment priorities?  Do they include pay?  The witnesses have laid them out but what is the first priority?  Is it 10%, 15%, 20% or 25% more pay?  Is it hiring the extra doctors and nurses that are needed?  Which of those would come first or is there something else?  Is it implementing the eHealth agenda or fixing the numerous HR issues which doctors and nurses face every day and which drive them crazy?  Given that there is very little money available if we comply with the European guidelines on budgets, where is the first place the witnesses would spend the money in terms of wages, more staff or elsewhere?<br/><br/>My final question is a technical one for Mr. Varley.  He spoke about the 57% to 70% gap between new specialists - they are not new entrants - and old specialists.  Can he give the euro figures for that?  What is the starting salary for new specialists and what salary he is comparing that to, which is 57% to 70% higher?  Mr. Varley said that while our total healthcare spend is very high by international standards the spend in the acute sector is mid-level.  I am not denying that is the case but, if so, we must be spending vast amounts of money somewhere.  Obviously the acute sector sucks up a great deal of the money so if we are at medium level in that sector we must be at the top in other places.  Does he know what they are?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.770" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018071100002#N00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations and all the work they do representing their members.  I wish to clarify one point.  It is fair to say that GPs are represented here, although that is not necessarily the subject we are discussing.</p><p>Their representatives are in the room.  Perhaps representatives from the IMO might like to say something about GPs.</p><p> The HSE appeared before us last week.  I am sure the witnesses will have looked back on it but in case they did not, it had a wonderful idea for increasing the number of staff.  It is just going to change how it counts them so student nurses that were previously counted as 0.5 WTEs at one minute to midnight on 31 December turned into full WTEs on the stroke of midnight.  If it was able to do that with all of its staff, it could indeed double the number overnight.  I do not think that is a very productive thing to do.  It did not have any explanation as to why it had done it - merely that it was on the recommendation of some person who did not happen to be in the room.</p><p> On the Public Service Pay Commission, pay for front-line healthcare workers is an issue I have raised virtually all of my working life but certainly since I be came a Deputy.  The latest reason for not answering our question is that the Public Service Pay Commission will deal with that.  The commission's report is due at the end of this month.  I think it is pretty much irrelevant where someone's profession is positioned on a table, particularly as we are haemorrhaging staff to countries that pay more.  However, let us imagine that the Public Service Pay Commission does not adequately address the pay issues outlined by the witnesses.  Could they provide a picture of what our service will look like come winter?  My contention would be that we are not well prepared for winter.  Indeed, we managed to be surprised by the flu last winter.  In the event that the pay issue is not addressed, are we looking at hiring more agency staff or closing more beds?  What will be the implications of this?  My estimation is that the Government is putting a lot of emphasis on the Public Service Pay Commission.  If the latter does not deliver, we will find ourselves in a very difficult position.  I would welcome the witnesses' views on that matter.</p><p> When representatives from the HSE appeared before us last week, they also put it to us that people do not want permanent jobs.  They referred to nurses in particular.  Dr. Durcan is smiling.  I also smiled because it struck me that people did want permanent jobs.  It cannot just be my mother who raised me to want a permanent job.  I am sure everybody's mother wants him or her to have a permanent job.  People themselves want the stability of a permanent job.  Senior people in the HSE told us that new and prospective entrants to the health service are actually running away from the notion of a permanent job so could the witnesses comment on that?</p><p> In the context of the funded workforce plan, which I know relates specifically to nursing, could Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha bring us up to speed?  When is the plan likely to be published?  What would be the likely implications if it was, for example, published in the morning?  If there is a six-month lead-in time for the recruitment of staff, where does that leave our graduates now?  Are they actively involved in a recruitment process?  I know it is warmer in Australia and other countries and that some places have sun and snow, but they had that ten years ago and temperatures have not changed dramatically.  That is not me denying climate change.  I just do not think it has changed dramatically.  Yet we did not have those sort of problems ten years ago.  My understanding is that young people with portable qualifications went abroad, worked for a year or two and came back.  Why would they not do so?  They are not coming back, however.</p><p> Those are some of the issues on which I would like the witnesses to comment.  Retention is a bit of a chicken-and-egg thing.  We are losing staff because it is an unattractive place to work, which means we are not recruiting staff, which makes it a more unattractive place to work, which means we are losing staff.  In terms of initiatives to retain staff, is there anything at the moment that might be working in one hospital?  Let us say there is a particular hospital that is managing to keep its staff.  Is there anything that one hospital is doing that could be modelled across the health service?  I am not convinced that there is but if there is, we would welcome that information because it strikes me that this is a double-edged sword.  The failure to recruit is leading to pressure on retention.  There is a lot of talk about new entrant pay and how poorly new entrants' pay compares with that of other jurisdictions but, equally, we have an issue with retention.  Is that purely pay-based?  I know it has to do with the conditions.  One feeds the other.  Are there initiatives that could be taken which would improve retention?</p><p> I would also like to hear the witnesses' view on the actual number of beds.  If we clicked our fingers or used the magic formula the HSE used and doubled our staff overnight, are there sufficient beds in the system?  My estimation is that there is anything from 500 to 1,000 beds that could be opened relatively quickly if we had the staff.  I would welcome the witnesses' views on that.</p><p> Regarding the conversion from agency staff, I am sure the witnesses are aware, through the media, that Sinn F&eacute;in recently published figures in respect of the spend on agency staff and the manner in which it is increasing.  When I raise this, the Minister then tells me that a whole raft of wonderful initiatives is in play.  There is a heavy focus on converting from agency staff to directly employed staff.  Can the witnesses give us some estimation of what, if anything, is happening with that and what could be happening?  Clearly, these people are available to the system but they are choosing to either remain registered and work with agencies, work on a half-and-half basis or work full-time for the HSE and then part-time for an agency in order to supplement their wages.  it could also be the case that there is not much effort, from a managerial perspective, regarding how the process of conversion is going.</p><p> Obviously, the people who are here represent a large cohort of the workforce within the health service, although not the full cohort and not every worker.  It is proposed that at later date, and I say this for the benefit of anyone who might be looking in and thinking "Hang on a second, I am not one of those grades.  Why am I not represented there?", we will come back to this issue and there will be an opportunity for all of the grades to make a presentation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Clyne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018071100002#O00300"><p>I will set off and then Dr. Gilligan will come in.  Regarding the numbers quoted by Deputy Donnelly in the context of where doctors are well paid, nobody suggested doctors are not well paid.  What they are suggesting is that we are not competitive with the market so what a consultant is paid in France, Germany or the Netherlands is irrelevant.  Irish doctors are not going to these places.  In the main, Irish doctors are going to Australia and Canada and, in some cases, the US.  There is a global shortage of doctors and nurses and we just have to face up to that fact.  We are competing in a market.  In respect of the data sources shown by Deputy Donnelly, maybe they are earning more but it involves different systems.  It is not like comparing apples and oranges.  There is a significant issue - not just pay, which is a huge differential.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Reilly's question, there are other reasons why people are driven abroad.  It is not just because of the weather.  They are driven abroad because they can work.  If a person is a trained surgeon, he or she has theatre time.  He or she can see patients and refer them for diagnostics.  he or she can do his or her training.  In almost all these other countries, including Canada and Australia, it is a four-day week that involves seeing patients and being able to refer them on for appropriate testing.  It is about getting results back quickly.  It is not about seeing a patient and telling him or her that one will see him or her again in a year or two.  It is also about huge support for doctors' continuing professional development.  For example, Australia has a grant that allows doctors to do their training and continuing professional development.  They are supported to do that within the working week.  So there are a lot of things happening in terms of recruitment and retention.</p><p> Regarding the population, the point we are trying to make concerns investment in healthcare.  It is not that we do not spend a lot of money on healthcare; it is that we do not invest a huge amount in new service development or in the things we need for the future.  We do not plan and invest for plans to be implemented.  We are talking about a fiscal space of &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million.  If Sl&aacute;intecare is not going to be funded, it behoves politicians to stop using it as the plan that will help the health service.  If we need &euro;1 billion to fund it in our first year, the public should not be told Sl&aacute;intecare will happen if that &euro;1 billion is not there, and that is a real difficulty.  There are huge patient expectations and people in the health service work really hard every day to deliver on those expectations.  Pay is a big issue.  There are other issues such as investment.  People want to be able to work in theatres.  This requires resources.  Almost everything costs money but one way in which we spend money inappropriately in our view is through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which is a short-term measure, and through agency staffing.  If the numbers were looked at in the long term, it would probably be discovered that the conversion of agency staff is cost-neutral.</p><p> In response to Deputy O'Reilly, there is no big shift or move to convert staff from agency to permanency, and the staff have no real desire to do so because the people who come in on agency work earn more than the permanent staff, choose their hours and do not all reside in the jurisdiction.  I therefore do not believe there is any big move happening in that regard.</p><p> The Public Service Pay Commission was part of the public service stability agreement last year.  Many organisations and unions, including us and the nurses' union, signed up to the agreement on the basis that it would deal with the recruitment and retention issue, which - there is no point in pretending otherwise - will cost money.  One thing we are a little anxious about is the idea of picking the top thing and investing in that top thing.  We have learned over many years and all the reports show us that if we do that, that is, if we start focusing on one thing in health, something else will break down.  We must invest the money across the board and then see where we are.  If the plan is going to be Sl&aacute;intecare, the money should be invested in it.  We have objections to some of the areas of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I have just a quick point.  Waiting lists are not a new phenomenon in this country.  There were waiting lists ten, 15 and 20 years ago.  What I am a little concerned about is this: we do not seem to have come up with a model that allows for a free, rapid flow of people through the system.  I was one of those who called for the reintroduction of outsourcing because the waiting lists had become intolerable.  Scoliosis is a classic example, whereby people are urgently waiting for treatment.  What do we do?  It is a little like the housing lists.  The people on the front line of dealing with the housing lists tell us we must house the people who have been on the lists for ten years or more.  What, then, do we do with the people who are out on the road now?  It is the same with the health services.  The people who are acutely in need of services and responses now cannot wait for two, five or ten years, depending on the particular requirements.  They cannot wait at all.</p></speech>

First and foremost, regarding our spend and how it compares internationally, the Deputy is correct.  We spent approximately &euro;4.5 billion out of the &euro;15 billion or so on acute hospitals and mental health services, so let us say approximately one third.  Our analysis shows that we are in or around the middle.  We are not overspending; in fact, we are probably underspending.  The indicators are there: the beds, the occupancy and the low number of consultants.  Where is the slack, then, for want of a better term?  Part of this goes back to our infrastructure and organisational structure.  The whole service has evolved through a series of reconfigurations and reorganisations.  This exercise has not been carried out in a fashion that is reflective of what would happen in the real economy in terms of-----</p></speech>

The OECD figures and the figures for the Irish health service show that we have, relatively speaking, a lower number of doctors than in other health services and higher numbers in other grades.  This could be in administration, management or other areas.  There is scope to look at this and probably gains that can be achieved.  Is this dependent on restructuring the service?  Yes, and I refer to geo-alignment in this regard.  Geo-alignment on its own is not enough.  The CHOs and hospital groups need to be merged; otherwise, we will not take out the layers or deal with the lack of effective communication and co-ordination.  The Deputy talks about step-down care and home care services.  If there are two groups and two separate budgets and everyone is trying to stay within his or her budget, dysfunction creeps in.  We therefore need the one CEO, the one management structure.  Then there would be hope of streamlining and more effective co-ordination.  There is scope there.  Where else do we have a higher spend?  Our drugs bill is, relatively speaking, higher in international terms.  From memory, we are talking about a &euro;2 billion drugs bill in the service, so again, there is scope there.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's questions of comparing how well paid doctors and consultants are, we are in a transitional stage whereby the discriminatory salaries, to which we referred, being paid to the newer consultants do not reflect in that comparison because we are talking about 10% to 15% of the total.  The Deputy asked me what the differential is today.  The differential today for a new type A consultant is approximately &euro;76,000.</p></speech>

For type B consultants, the difference is approximately &euro;66,000, 52% currently.  This will increase to approximately 70% if the discriminatory salary scales are not corrected.</p><p>To put it very simply, the message we are sending out is that to be competitive, we need to start to pay the new entrants what was included in the contract agreed by the Minister for Health in 2008.  A decade later, as we are not even paying the new entrants anything approaching what was agreed in 2008, it is not surprising we are not competitive.  That is the first point.</p><p> The second point is if one has a differential of the order of between 50% and 60% and one is asking people with ten or 15 years' experience and fellowships from the US and wherever else to come back and work alongside a colleague where there is such a differential in salary, it is not surprising that they are not showing interest in the posts.  It is discrimination in the extreme.  We are not talking about the 10% differential that came in in 2011, this is of another order of magnitude and it is in a profession and in a grade whereby we have always suffered in trying to compete and fill posts.</p><p> The other thing to add is that, relatively speaking, we have a lower number of consultants on a population basis.  The job is somewhat more onerous.  One could be on a one-in-three or a one-in-four on-call roster.  If one was in another jurisdiction, one might be on call one in 15 or one in 20 weekends in a year compared with one in three or one in four or five.  All of those things come into play and as we said earlier, if there is a difficulty getting resources to treat patients, that is an added difficulty for consultants coming in.  New consultants are always competing trying to find a resource such as theatre operating slots, bed space for patients and whatever else.  There is a whole cocktail of issues coming into play but we would say we have to end the discrimination to be in a position to compete and get these highly trained specialists back.  That is what I have to say on the salary issues.</p><p> I cannot leave out the number of beds and the fact we do not have adequate capacity in the health service.  This is the perennial issue that keeps coming back to us over recent decades.  We have cut the beds when we should have been increasing them.  Now we are quite concerned.  We have a national development plan with funding for 2,600 beds but I do not see any serious intent in the system to put in place an annual commissioning plan.  We are in crisis mode and if one is in crisis mode with beds and trying to get patients off waiting lists and off trolleys, the first thing one should do is to have an annual commissioning plan.  I hear nobody in the health service management talking about that.</p></speech>

The national development plan built on that and provided the funding.  What we are asking for now is an action plan so that we will know we will have X number of additional beds each year in the future.  Based on historical performance, it takes up to seven years to commission and put in place a bed in the health service.  If we do not get the annual commissioning plans at this point we will all be retired before we see any real exercise of putting beds in place, at a time when we have 700,000 patients waiting for care.</p></speech>

On the number of beds, in the short term, with adequate staffing, are there beds currently in the system - without having to engage in the commissioning process?

He referenced that he finds this depressing.  Can he imagine how I feel as a consultant in emergency medicine who has been working in the system now for 14 years, and who from the start of my career has been trying to address the overcrowding of emergency departments and who still experiences that on an all-too-frequent basis?  What that means is that patients who need to access hospital care in this country are subjected in emergency departments around the country to an average of about 14 hours before they will get into a ward bed.  The reason for that is the lack of capital infrastructure, beds and staffing that we have.</p> <p>  To respond to one the Deputy's final points, which was what we can do on a cost neutral basis and what would our number one priority be, our number one priority has to be facilitating our doctors and nurses to provide patient care.  We do not have a system currently that is doing that.  The reason we do not have it is because we did not have enough beds in the system 14 years ago when I started.  We then took beds out of the system and we have not put enough back into the system.  As a matter of absolute urgency, we require 1,500 beds now and we need to move more towards the 7,000 end of the capacity assessment done on behalf of the Government with regard to the requirements over the next 15 years or so.</p></speech>

I want to test that a bit.  The one hospital group where the waiting lists are coming down - in some cases to zero - is the RCSI hospital group.</p></speech>

What it appears to be doing differently is its admission from emergency department to the ward is substantially lower than the national average.  That may be because it is case mix adjusted but it appears to have figured out in a focused manner the people who really do need to be admitted and those who can be sent home or back to community-based care and that puts less strain on the system.</p> <p>  One of the other things the group tells me it is doing is pushing the approach that when a patient is discharged, he or she is discharged to a care package in order that the patient does not arrive back with pneumonia again, for example, in the emergency department three weeks later and off we go again.  In doing that, it is taking the strain off the system.  It is interesting in that I have spoken to some of the clinicians working in some of the RCSI hospitals and some of them are telling a different story.  They are saying that things have got a lot better around here; things have got a lot calmer, that they have more capacity, and they are being facilitated in working as doctors and nurses because of these things that have happened.</p> <p>  I do not know what the answer is.  I am asking the question because obviously this is Dr. Gilligan's life, but there is an argument when one looks at the figures and when one looks at what the RCSI hospital group has done and how it has done it that says perhaps the solution is not 1,400 or 1,500 new beds, perhaps it is really good admittance practice from emergency departments and more beds in emergency departments.  There are obviously choke points such as resuscitation beds or intensive care unit, ICU, beds in terms of patient flow where that is a clear blockage.  More home care packages are also required.  What is Dr. Gilligan's sense on that?  Since I have come into this brief what I hear all the time is that we need more beds.  I am not talking about for population growth.  That is taken as a given that we do for the future but I have heard two different views from clinicians and managers.  Some say we need more beds and others say we may not need more beds, we may need to provide very targeted emergency department beds, ICU beds and resuscitation beds, admissions practices and step-down beds or home care packages.  What is Dr. Gilligan's sense on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peadar Gilligan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018071100002#Q01200"><p>First, I absolutely acknowledge that things have improved.  We have gone from an average over that 14 years from 21 hours waiting for a bed to 14 hours waiting for a bed.  It is a very significant improvement but it is not good enough.  My colleagues in the RCSI hospital group have worked incredibly hard to achieve that reduction in length of stay for patients requiring admission from the emergency department and to introduce some of the initiatives Deputy Donnelly mentioned.  We acknowledge that the ability to move patients from long-term care in the hospital to nursing home care has improved our access to bed availability.</p><p>It is fair to say we have gone from having 15% of our bed base occupied by long-stay patients at any given time to half that rate.  That has involved a huge amount of work.  We have a group in the hospital dedicated to ensuring patients are moved through the system and on to nursing home care, augmented home care packages or other such arrangements, as appropriate.</p><p> Considerable work was done on trying to reduce the length of stay of patients.  That has included trying to accelerate the investigations done for patients.  It has included trying to accelerate access to services such as MRI, CT and ultrasound scanning.  There has been a huge input by the clinicians on call, who are now rounding two or three times per day to try to ensure patients get through in a timely manner.  However, I have yet to meet a clinician in the RCSI group who tells me it is not a bed issue.  We all know we do not have the capacity we need.</p><p> In Beaumont, there was an assessment some years ago by auditors from the NHS who advised that, given our current workload, that hospital alone needed 250 additional beds.  That was just one hospital in the system.  Therefore, we absolutely need hospital beds.  I have patients for 14 hours.  The 14 hours are usually a good seven or eight hours after the decision to admit has been made.  The reason I have the patients for 14 hours is that there is no available bed at the time to put them into.  That is because Beaumont Hospital runs at about 104% occupancy.  Approximately 6% of that 104% is in the emergency department.  Yesterday evening when I left our emergency department, which has 24 clinical spaces, there were over 60 patients there.  Most of them were going to be going home, having undergone assessment, investigation and treatment.  For the 24% who required admission, there was going to be a wait for more hours before getting a hospital bed.  That is because we do not have enough beds in the system.</p><p> To be absolutely clear, the issue of crowding and overcrowding in Irish hospitals is significantly worse than in any other developed country in the world.  It is worse because of our capacity issues in the system.  Those are not just around the beds.  The beds are a considerable issue, however.  Until we get the beds right, we will really continue in the storm.</p><p> To answer Deputy O'Reilly's question on what this winter will be like, bearing in mind the fact that we need 1,500 beds now, unless there is a very significant increase in existing capacity by approximately 600 beds, it is likely that there will be considerable numbers of elderly patients in every emergency department in the country waiting for a significant period to gain access to a hospital bed.  We will have staff traumatised by the compromised care they are having to deliver because they do not have the space in which to deliver it.</p><p> We have heard about the fiscal space many times.  Space is something I would love to have in an emergency department to provide care, rather than having to wedge myself between trolleys when taking a history and trying to assess patients.  We will get that space only when we have the beds, the medical and nursing staff and allied health professionals to help to move the patients through the system as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I believe the Deputy had left the room when I addressed the matter.  Pay most certainly is priority number one for nurses, just in case the Deputy is in any doubt.</p> <p>  On the issue of fiscal space, I find it incredible that at the third economic dialogue, which was two weeks ago, health was not on the agenda.  When I questioned the Minister for Finance in respect of the fiscal space, I asked him why he was prioritising a rainy day fund and why that fund was coming out of the fiscal space when we know &mdash; without being smart &mdash; the health service is absolutely flooded and leaking.  We are still allocating &euro;500 million to a rainy day fund, supported, as I understand it, by the Deputy's party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  I ask the Deputy not to be depressed because he actually has decision-making power in the position he is in to argue it is now time to invest in health to ensure we do not face what we are all telling him we will be facing this winter.</p> <p>  There are other budgetary decisions that can be made.  The tax that was placed on sugary drinks is one example.  The Minister's prediction for income from that is approximately &euro;40 million.  That is not ring-fenced for health, yet the health service is dealing with the problems of diabetes, obesity and other matters that directly affect the health and well-being of our nation because we are not tackling the alcohol dependency issues and bad dietary habits.  If revenue from excise duties on cigarettes and alcohol and tax on sugary drinks amounts to nearly &euro;100 million, why are we not investing it in health to ensure the health service is adequately funded?  This is one point the members could certainly address.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of tax relief for private health insurance, it has been said already that if there is cross-party support for Sl&aacute;intecare, and if Sl&aacute;intecare is the answer we get each time we raise the difficulties, which it is, and we support it and believe it is the right model, then we have to consider how we fund it from a timed perspective.  We need to start showing citizens what occurs if we do it right.  No citizen of this country has ever said in any patient survey that when he or she actually gains access to the service, it is bad.  They say access is the problem.  We are supplementing private health insurance in this country through tax reliefs to a quite considerable degree.  The last figure I saw was &euro;353 million.  That is a lot of money.  If our public health service had enough capacity, one could unwind that taxation supplement and there would be money to invest in the transition fund for Sl&aacute;intecare.  That has to be the focus.</p> <p>  The people who work in the service are doing their best.  There are now looking to the Oireachtas.  We wrote to this health committee to give them some support.  It is not good enough to say one examined all the statistics and concluded nurses and doctors were well paid and that the service was adequately funded; that is not the case.  Nurses are, in fact, the lowest paid in all the countries that are very actively recruiting from us.  Brexit will exaggerate that in the United Kingdom.  We know the United Kingdom is under severe pressure.  It has approximately 20,000 nursing vacancies.  They love our nurses and graduates.  They love our nurses who are qualified for two or three years and they give them massive responsibility because they are able for it.</p></speech>

Those two things are not mutually exclusive.  According to all the data I have examined, Ireland is in the top five countries in the world where pay is concerned.  There are approximately 210 countries recognised by the United Nations.  If we are in the top five of approximately 210, it is fair to say that, by international comparisons, we do pay well.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha is making a different point, which is the point made by Ms Clyne.  Regardless of whether we pay well by international standards, there is a very small number of countries paying more.  Unfortunately for us, they happen to be English-speaking countries and therefore our nurses and doctors can go to those countries and earn more money.  If the pay rate in Ireland is among the top five in the world and there is a substantially higher starting salary than that of equivalently qualified people in the private sector, it is very hard to stack it up.  It does not mean they do not have other options, which they clearly do.  We know they do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.824" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018071100002#R00400"><p>I actually disagree with the Deputy's fundamental premise.  Irish nurses are not well paid by comparison.  We have international comparisons that are compiled not by us but by the International Council of Nurses, affiliated to the World Health Organization.  They clearly indicate that, out of the nine main countries that are English-speaking with western medical styles, Ireland's pay is the lowest.  I do not know what figures the Deputy is looking at but they are clearly not the figures that have been accepted by the World Health Organization and the International Council of Nurses.  A nurse's starting salary is &euro;28,700.  We do not even have to go outside Ireland.  Even when we compare with other grades working in the public sector, such as teachers and garda&iacute;, we note nurses' starting point is approximately &euro;4,000 to &euro;7,000 lower.  That continues throughout their career.</p><p> I would like to address the issue of the benchmark with the private sector because I heard Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly say this before.  When a nurse starts on a ward, on his or her first night on duty not long after qualifying, the responsibility he or she holds does not bear any comparison to what newly qualified accountants or engineers hold.  They will not be building bridges and will certainly not be doing the final accounts.  A nurse, however, will be looking after patients and will be in charge because that is how bad the system has become.  A newly qualified nurse will rapidly be in charge of a ward once he or she is employed in the public health service.  He or she will also be subjected to a fitness to practise inquiry if he or she makes any omission or mistake.  Engineers' starting salary is not much lower than &euro;28,700 and they quickly arrive at a salary that will get much higher during their career; therefore, they have aspirations.  They will stick it for six months to a year because they know that it will get much better.  Nurses are still on a low salary after 14 years.  The point the Deputy is making does not make any material sense when one makes a comparison with the private sector because one cannot compare.  In 2007, when the benchmarking body looked at this issue, it found that there was no relevant comparator with a nurse bearing the responsibility he or she carries in the private sector.</p><p> I have addressed the fiscal space and given some ideas that the committee has probably heard already.  They are about decisions governments face.  The fiscal space is a concept that is manipulated by decisions that must be made now.  The reason we are here advocating on behalf of the health service is the decisions must favour the health service above all else, immediately and in the budget.  To answer Deputy Louise O'Reilly's question about the consequences of the Public Service Pay Commission not dealing with the issue of pay, it will undoubtedly worsen a situation that is already a catastrophic crisis.  This year we asked the HSE to tell us how many of the acute and closed beds it would be able to fund and open.  It cannot tell us how many beds are closed and estimates that there are approximately 200 in the acute sector, which cannot be opened because of staffing issues or refurbishment.  Health Information and Quality Authority regulations state capacity and design have to change.  That will reduce the number of beds available.  The HSE estimates that at the end of 2018 its target will be to have fewer than 100 beds opened.  That is incredible.  They are modest targets and the HSE is hampered by the fact that recruitment and retention of staff to facilitate the opening of these beds are not possible.  Modular build is what it is under consideration at some sites.  It states there is capacity in South Tipperary General Hospital for a 30-bed modular build, but that argument has been on the go for nearly two years.  There are difficulties in recruitment and retention of staff in that respect.</p><p> The one thing that has been proved to help the conversion of the agency is the framework for nurse staffing.  When staffing levels are correct, the agency's spend will drop, as was shown and demonstrated in Beaumont Hospital, where it fell to below 0.1%.  It works, but the problem is that it is not funded for implementation.  </p><p> I was asked about the HSE's issues in people not wanting permanent posts.  That is simply not the case.  To pay a mortgage and meet childcare costs, our members tell us that they require permanent jobs, as well as flexibility in rostering and hours of work, which are not always available to them.  In a female-dominated profession, that can have serious consequences, to the extent that some women are forced out of the workforce and to accept agency posts to have flexibility.  It is true, however, that there are no conversion criteria.  The HSE states that last year it converted 712 agency nurses.  Its bill is still just over &euro;1.2 million a week in the statutory services alone, not including voluntary services.  The HSE does not, for example, make provision for the replacement of nurses on maternity leave who are still counted in its census.  There 37,200 nurses, of whom 2% on any given day are on maternity leave, but they are still funded and counted.  Therefore, the roster has to be supplemented.  We are not building or growing and are barely supplementing the roster.  In many instances, the shift post goes unfilled.</p></speech>

A point was made about pay, on which there has been a focus.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha comment briefly on the issue of the work-pay ratio?  I represented nurses, whom I never considered to be well paid.  I do not think that could be shown on a graph, but perhaps it could.</p> <p>  On comparators, we have heard about what people do in other countries.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha made a comparison with engineers who do not build bridges on their first day, which is fair enough.  With regard to a nurse, a consultant or a non-consultant hospital doctor at a similar level in another hospital, it is my contention that not only is the pay low but the workload is also high.  When we compare, we are not only comparing pay.  We also need to compare the type of work done and support provided and what we expect from the people who work in the health service for the money they receive.  Will the delegates comment briefly on this?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in all cases nurses come out the worst .  We have high responsibility, are on low pay and work long hours.  That is the daily grind.  When compared with teaching grades, garda&iacute; and other allied health professionals, we would be considered to be on a par, but we are on in the region of &euro;7,000 less and, in some cases, &euro;12,000.</p></speech>

There tends to be intense pressure on finding resources for patients.  We talk about patients on trolleys and trying to find beds for them.  The struggle to find an appropriate setting for patient care takes up a larger portion of one's working day.  The amount of clinical work one does is done in a shorter timeframe and more rapidly, while one tries to sort out administrative issues which I did not have had to go anywhere near in North America.</p></speech>

In general, consultants are not paid overtime for working beyond their contracted hours.  I do not even know of a situation where a consultant was paid overtime.  Consultants can regularly work 10% or 20% of their hours overtime without pay, while in the United Kingdom they are paid automatically.  Again, the workload factor washes through in several respects such as the size of clinics, ward rounds, hours worked and so on.</p></speech>

Even though we work in the health service, we are subject to illness and vagaries within the health service as well.  I welcome the debate.  I am somewhat perturbed by what appears to be the messengers being shot this morning in respect of the issues we are bringing to the committee's attention.  As we sit here, 37 patients are awaiting beds in University Hospital Limerick.  There were 63 waiting for beds yesterday.  There are 28 awaiting beds in University Hospital Galway today.  In total, 284 citizens of this country are languishing on trolleys and in inappropriate spaces in our emergency departments today.</p> <p>  While pay is a huge problem, another difficulty is the political mindset which views health as a leakage rather than as a priority.  Spending and making the correct investments will offset much of what I refer to as the revolving-door patients coming through our emergency departments.</p> <p>  The problems relating to pay, recruitment and retention apply across the board.  I am dismayed that as we are celebrating the centenary of women getting the vote, 92% of nursing profession are female and yet we seem to have the denial of pay for work that is vital work within this economy.  We are all professionals as my medical colleagues have said.  While I am not particularly looking at Deputy Donnelly, in the context of the work we do, I do not think, as Ms Clyne said, he can compare architects with nurses or medics.  The decisions we make are critical to the life of the individual.  There will always be stops and checks in place when a bridge is being built and before traffic is allowed to cross it.  That does not happen in the health service environment.  We make acute and critical decisions, and we are not always supported by our employer.</p> <p>  Everyone has pointed out that medical professionals are emigrating.  The weather is lovely at present and we are enjoying it.  However, the pay differentials are obvious.  There is a moral dilemma attached to what we are not currently able to do.  Nurses and medics go elsewhere because they are able to action the care they want to action in other jurisdictions.  They are given the capacity and the resources.  They are not made feel potentially bad about it.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke spoke about a survey he carried out.  We have conducted two surveys of our new graduates, one in 2017 and one in 2018.  Astonishingly in 2017, some 79% of them said they would emigrate.  The survey in April of this year indicated that 71% of them would emigrate.  The elephant in the room is, of course, the need to increase pay and, above all, staffing levels.  Some 76% of them said staffing levels are not adequate to support their learning in the clinical environment.  As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha pointed out, newly-qualified nurses make critical decisions with very little support.  There is not the support from senior qualified staff because we also have difficulty retaining them in the system.</p> <p>  We have heard much of the political, economic and socioeconomic factors and we have heard much about the demographics.  However, the demographics within nursing are that 65% of us are over the age of 40.  We have a conundrum with regard to those people even being in the system within the next 15 years.  Some 57% of the graduates we surveyed had been approached by overseas agencies and only 18% were offered permanent posts by the HSE.  There is a dilemma.  As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha pointed out, pay differentials are huge.  It is a sad indictment of the system that a staff nurse has to work 15 years to reach a salary of &euro;45,000.</p></speech>

The Committee on the Future of Healthcare sat for 11 months and produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  While the Sl&aacute;intecare report is viewed differently by different organisations, it was a cross-party report looking at the future of healthcare and offering a ten-year vision for the healthcare system.  The Government has yet to respond to many of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, 400 days after it was published.  Every month it claims its response is imminent.  I understand that the costings for Sl&aacute;intecare have been challenged and that it has gone to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for review.  Many of the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommendations would not prove very costly because it recommends a change in the model of care, in the system and within the HSE.</p> <p>  I would like Mr. Varley to comment on one of the recommendations in particular.  I refer to that relating to the separation of private care within the public hospital system.  The argument is that if that private money is taken out of the system, the system will collapse.  We are saying that we expect the public to take out private health insurance so that it can subsidise the public health system, which is not sustainable.</p> <p>  As Deputy Donnelly stated, it is not so much a question of how much we are spending on the health services, but how we are spending that money and where it is going.  Ireland is one of the largest spenders on healthcare within the OECD.  However, I am of the view that we are also one of the largest spenders on bureaucracy in our health service.  Representatives from the HSE appeared before the committee last week.  The HSE has developed a unit for scheduled care and unscheduled care and how it manages appointment waiting lists.  How can we reconcile the amount of money we are spending on managing the waiting lists when really we should be putting that money into front-line services?  The health service is a closed system.  If investment is reduced in one part of the system, the patients do not go away; they just go to the next part of the system.  That certainly is the case in primary care where if that is not properly resourced, people end up in casualty or on hospital waiting lists.  I would like to hear a comment on that.</p> <p>  We often speak in abstract terms about how these things happen.  I was recently contacted by a GP who had a patient who had pyelonephritis and a stone in her kidney.  He decided to send that patient to the medical assessment unit where she could have her X-ray and ultrasound, and avoid going to casualty.  However, the medical assessment unit said that was a surgical problem.  The surgical assessment unit said it does not deal with renal problems and directed the patient to casualty.  Here was a GP trying to avoid sending to casualty somebody who needs a diagnostic test.  However, the patient ended up in accident and emergency and was obliged to start from the bottom of the assessment system again.</p> <p>  This happens every day.  GPs are being sidelined and disenfranchised.  They want to participate in the health system and look after patients and deal with chronic care.  However, they are not given the resources or access to diagnostics.  That is a practical example of how the system is not working.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare provided a ten-year vision, but unfortunately we have a crisis intervention vision at the moment.  We are not looking at the ten-year vision for the health service.  As one of the witnesses mentioned, we are not capable of providing prevention measures in order to try to keep people out of hospital and avoid diabetes.  We need to try to reorientate the taxes we take we collect from health taxes into the system.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report also recommended that those taxes be ring-fenced.</p> <p>  Earlier, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked if the Department of Health is negotiating on a new GP contract in good faith.  Are negotiations on a new GP contract taking place or are we just adding bits and pieces to the old contract?</p><p>The contract negotiations have been going on for two years now but nothing has come from them.  GPs feel they have been sidelined.  They are anxious to participate in the health service and they are champing at the bit to get involved in looking after patients properly within the community.  However, they are not being valued, recognised or resourced.  I ask Mr. Varley to respond to my first question.</p></speech>

The key question is what would happen if we were to separate the private and public systems.  The report appears to me to be based on the premise that this would create capacity in the public hospitals because a proportion of the population with private health insurance use public hospitals.  Our analysis would suggest that they use the public hospitals out of necessity because the equivalent care is not available in the private settings.  There are specialist areas, for example, cancer care, ICU care, maternity care, paediatrics, organ transplantation, stroke care, trauma, neurology and complex surgery, which, by and large, only happen in the public hospitals.  This could be fragmented and replicated across the private hospitals but the country is not large enough to have two groups of specialists.  We have enough difficulty trying to recruit and fill public contract posts such that trying to replicate the system in two settings would be highly questionable.  The population of Ireland is not much bigger than that of the greater Manchester-Liverpool hub and duplication does not make sense.  Also, if we take &euro;650 million to &euro;700 million per annum out of the public hospital budget are we guaranteed that it would be replaced?  We do not believe there would be much of a reduction in the number of patients presenting.  The same patients will present albeit one would forego the private health insurance income that the public hospital would have received.  This whole basis of the report is open to question.  We do not believe it would lead to a stronger medical service in the country if we fragment it.  It would be better to develop centres of excellence, as we have done with the cancer centres.  Fragmentation is not the best approach and 45% of people continue to have health insurance and to pay for services when they use public hospitals.</p></speech>

In terms of current employment in our public hospitals, 6% of hospital consultants are type A contract holders.  The balance are type B or B*.  Obviously, this would continue.  In March 2011, the HSE took the view that all future hospital consultant posts would, save in exceptional circumstances, be type A.  The outcome of this was that recruitment stalled.  The HSE then reverted to a position whereby it would be, by and large, type B contracts in public hospitals.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare proposes an alternative model and, in some instances, a radical one.  There is universality within Sl&aacute;intecare, such that people will be treated on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.  We have a system which allows people to be treated on their ability to pay rather than based on need.  The aim of Sl&aacute;intecare is to change this system.</p></speech>

All patients presenting in public hospitals are listed for care based on clinical need.  There are bottlenecks in diagnostics, first and foremost, in admissions - owing to a lack of beds - and in terms of access to theatre.  The comparison to which the Chairman refers is a comparison of the private hospital system with the public hospital system.  It is not a differential of treatment within the public hospital.  I have yet to come across situations whereby there is differential treatment.  The capacity issues are causing the problems.  As an insured person, if I need to access diagnostics in the morning and I cannot access it on time in a public hospital, I will go to a private hospital.  If I have a serious ailment and I need to be treated in a public hospital and the public hospital is the only place which provides that care, I will then present at a public hospital and I will be treated on the basis of clinical need.  It is unfair to suggest that the public hospitals are in one way or the other prioritising.  It is because of capacity restrictions that people cannot be diagnosed on time and they cannot get in for treatment on time.</p></speech>

The costing takes into account the private health insurance deficit that would follow rather than the current cost of having private patients in public hospitals.  The issue that underpins the premise of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is equity, which we fully support.  There is no doubt that there is a fast track in the context of having private health insurance.  The unwinding of the tax relief for private health insurance will only happen when the services are provided by the State in public hospitals and there is confidence among citizens that they do not need private health insurance.  This confidence has to be brought about very quickly.  This undoubtedly is an issue of capacity but it is also an issue of adequate staffing to open more beds, including the people we represent.</p></speech>

Our anxiety is around the removal of &euro;600 million from the health service.  The point was made that private insurance subsidising public hospitals is not sustainable.  Without the income they receive from the insurance companies for the care they provide to patients privately, public hospitals would be very challenged in continuing to provide care.  The budgetary allocations to hospitals changes year on year.  There were many years when the certainty was that the budget would be less than it was the previous year, despite the fact that there had been an overspend in the preceding year.  Hospitals are reliant on the money they get from patients treated privately within the hospital system.  We would need to be very reassured that this is going to be fully replaced and that hospitals will have a reliable and appropriate budgetary allocation for the work they undertake.</p> <p>  The Chairman also asked if the ability to augment income is an incentive to people returning to consultant posts in Ireland.  It is most definitely an incentive.  Would addressing the issue of the discrimination visited upon consultants since 2012 help us to recruit?  It would definitely help.  Until we address it, we will not be able to recruit the numbers that we need.  On the case study which was brought to our attention regarding the patient with the clinical conundrum of pyelonephritis or renal stones, that is an issue that emergency departments around the country deal with on a daily basis and can deal with very effectively between history examination investigations and appropriate imaging.  We would generally refer the patient on to a urology colleague or a surgeon with a special interest in that area.</p><p>The reason alternate routes are being sought for managing that patient is that we as a nation have treated for too long our emergency departments as holding bays for patients who need to be in hospital wards.  That is the reason we are all here today.  We are here to try to address the overcrowding issue.  I can assure the committee emergency physicians can help make that diagnosis readily and help treat that patient readily.</p><p> As to whether GP colleagues are being frustrated around the country by an apparent lack of engagement, I would say that our GP colleagues provide a significant level of care.  There are 20 million patient interactions by our GP colleagues in Ireland annually.  They provide a significant level of service.  They deal with the vast majority of patients within their own surgeries or on home visits.  It is a small percentage of patients that they send on to the hospital system where they need our care and where they need the capacity within the system.  Of course, they work extremely well with community intervention teams and with public health nurses, and, indeed, with their own practice nurses as well, to provide a high level of care.</p><p> I will hand over to Ms Clyne to address the question of whether they are frustrated by the lack of progress on contract talks but I think "yes" is the answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.852" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Clyne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018071100002#V00200"><p>The short answer is "yes".  To clarify, GPs are, in fact, represented here today through the IMO which has been the negotiating partner on the GMS contract since its inception.</p> <p>  There are issues with the negotiations that are well known.  They have been going on for a very long time.  Since the time the contract negotiations started, emphasis shifted with the arrival of Sl&aacute;intecare, although it is unclear to GPs and the public in general as to whether Sl&aacute;intecare will be implemented despite it having cross-party support.</p> <p>  The IMO was in contract negotiations for all of 2017 and progressed very far around the areas of chronic disease and capacity, which were issues highlighted, both by Professor O'Dowd's report and the Sl&aacute;intecare, as priorities for general practice.  However, it was clear from the budgetary allocation last year of &euro;25 million that that would not be possible.  In truth, it is not a question of good faith or otherwise.  What is holding up negotiations is the lack of resources.</p> <p>  However, we must be clear, from the IMO's point of view and from all GP members' point of view, that as long as FEMPI is not restored there is no hope of getting new services from general practice because the existing services are not financially viable.  There must be a roadmap to restore FEMPI.  These are all the issues that drive people to retiring early, practices not getting any applicants and young trainees not working here.  The gap of 38% is considerable.  Every other public servant and politician has had his or her FEMPI reversed.  General practice is out on its own and has had nothing reversed for it.  That must happen.  It is not viable in any way to say that general practice can take on all this new work while the foundation and the underlying model is not funded properly.</p> <p>  The IMO's position is that there must be a roll-back of FEMPI and then there must be additional funding for any new services that are to be brought in.  It is not an either-or issue.  It is not that new services can be brought in on the back of FEMPI.  That would merely crucify the system.  General practitioners are frustrated.  Patients of GPs are frustrated.  Patients of GPs are now becoming a rare breed because in many counties around the country patients cannot find and enlist with a GP and are resorting to have to go to the out-of-hours service where there is no continuity of care.  According to research in the UK, continuity of care saves lives.  It is that simple.</p> <p>  We have been before this committee previously on the GP issues and we are happy to return on more GP issues.  This meeting today is specifically about general practice.  We brought general practice into our presentation in so far as over the long term with proper investment we can reduce hospital admissions and general practice can assist in reducing presentations on the waiting lists.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was in the Seanad dealing with a health issue.</p> <p>  On the 11,000 additional staff in the HSE, if there are to be improved levels of employment where we are already talking about over 450 consultants who are not in place and nurses not being in place, within the HSE we still do not appear to be prioritising the front-line employment.  For example, when I looked at the figures for the additional 11,000 staff employed in the HSE over a three-year time period, there was a 17% increase in administration staff and only a 3.5% increase in public health nurses.  That does not appear to have been a logical decision to take.  I wonder what influence all of the players present have in trying to get the HSE to take the logical decisions on this matter because what I do not want is a situation where such an increase in staff continues.</p> <p>  The second issue I want to touch on is security in accident and emergency departments.  I am aware the IMO referred to it.  What action can be taken immediately to assist staff in dealing with that issue?  All of the hospitals have security staff.  Is it a case that there is not enough security staff employed or that sometimes during the week we would be better off having garda&iacute; permanently posted in accident and emergency departments to ensure that there is security and safety for staff?  I wonder how we deal with that.  The number of assaults the IMO referred to is extremely serious and it is something cannot be ignored.  People are trying to provide care for a significant number of people and their own safety is at risk.  I am wondering what can be done on that.  That is something that can be done immediately.  I wonder whether we can deal with that even today.</p></speech>

I am trying to multitask today.  I am also a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, which launched a report earlier.</p> <p>  First, I am sorry Deputy Donnelly has left because I was switching documents after the previous meeting and I saw his contribution.  On nurses' pay and conditions, I am not sure what planet the Deputy is on.  As far as I am concerned, he was not comparing apples with apples or oranges with oranges.</p> <p>  There is a crisis in nursing in the country.  There is a crisis in the area of workforce planning in relation to doctors, GP contracts going nowhere and consultants.  It is the biggest issue, along with capital expenditure, in the country.</p> <p>  When it comes to nurses' pay and the conditions under which nurses must work, the process by which increments come in, the training required and the scaling up of their work at a fairly quick pace, Deputy Donnelly was not comparing any rate of pay that I could recognise as being a correlation.  That issue will have to be dealt with.</p> <p>  I have a real issue.  Members of my own family work as nurses in hospitals.  We need a health and safety trolley watch.  The public needs to know what is going on out there.  I hear it every week.  The public does not actually know.  It will come to a crescendo soon.  We need to be monitoring this and producing statistics on what is happening to staff, including doctors, particularly nurses, and, dare I say it, porters as well, in the HSE.  I would encourage some way in which that could be done through the unions.</p> <p>  On bed capacity, obviously there is the famous capital plan that is coming out and the modular builds.  Through everyone's evidence here today, do they believe that there is a pace afoot in order to deal with the bed capacity in the capital build and the modular build that is being brought about?  I represent Tipperary.  I have got the two worst accident and emergency departments in the country either side of me - Limerick, which is closer to me even though I am in Tipperary and South Tipperary General Hospital.  Both are looking for modular builds and need them fairly quickly.  If the witnesses have evidence on that, it would be helpful.</p> <p>  I have been talking about the issue of e-health for three years.  My background is in technology.  I have not seen much progress.  It is a significant part of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I fundamentally believe work practices will change if we can advance in certain areas here.</p><p>My evidence from talking to people, and I talk to many people in healthcare, is that this is going higgledy-piggledy and where there is progress it is not replicated.  I would like comments on that.  The real question I want to home in on is the issue of pathway of care.  This is my last question and I am being brief by my standards.  I come from the mid-west.  We had a number of reports down through the years, including the report of the national task force on medical staffing, the Hanly report, on change in Ennis hospital, Nenagh hospital and St. John's Hospital, as well as the situation in University Hospital Limerick.  </p><p> The manifestation of that is what we have now.  I am not saying all the parts of the Hanly report were wrong - some of it was right.  The issue is the process by which we got there flooded University Hospital Limerick.  There is an issue where GPs, in the circumstances, are referring a large amount into Limerick.  I refer to the pathway by which people can be serviced in the minor injury clinics in the other three hospitals.  St. John's Hospital is closed at the moment and it is ridiculous that more cannot be done in Nenagh and Ennis hospitals.  As the Chairman is well aware, both have excellent facilities, as does St. John's.  Nenagh has the best operating theatres in Ireland but patients are not being transferred into these hospitals for after care and minor surgery for many different reasons.  </p><p> There is a lack of a discharge protocol and in some cases it is something basic like not being able to get intermittent vehicles to transfer patients to after care.  I have experienced this with my own family.  On pathways for referrals into hospitals, we had an accident and emergency unit which ended up three and a half times the size of the original but the volume of patients increased by 24% because it was thought more could be accommodated.  We have to improve the pathways in and out of the network of hospitals.  An example of something done well recently is the centralisation of cataract surgery in Nenagh because it has the theatres and it is going to have extra beds as more blocks are being built etc.  It is in the centre of Ireland, surgeons like operating there and it has very good theatres.  The lists are off the Richter scale.  </p><p> That is a good example but the pathways for electives and how patients are cared for post surgery and after being in the main hospital have to be improved to ensure there are more beds.  The discharge policy and the policy under which patients are being serviced in the network is not working.  It can be helped easily without much funding or change.  Those are my comments because everything else has been covered.   </p></speech>

We know it is the result of successive Government policies.  I have two brief questions.  One is on the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF.  Ms Clyne briefly touched on it but I would like to get the views of the other witnesses.  I have heard it described as a sticking plaster and a short-term solution.  It might look good on paper but it is not going to impact long term.  I have my own view and it has been well ventilated but I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses.</p> <p>  My other question is on the mental health and well-being of staff.  The conditions as described are horrific.  The representative organisations will do the best work they can to look after the staff but who is looking after them?  Are any programmes in place?  Who minds the health and well-being of the people who are minding the health and well-being of the patients?  </p></speech>

We are trying to get a system that works seamlessly, flawlessly and smoothly from the patient's point of view.  What we deliver has to be from the patient's point of view.  If we do not deliver that, we are not successful.  Incidentally - it is not fundamental to this argument - politicians have not been recompensed following the cuts nor should they be.  It could be said in certain quarters that they were overpaid at certain levels.  I do not want to go down that road, it is not a good argument.  I will put it that way.  New politicians have been paid the same as always but older politicians with longer years of service, like civil servants, GPs and various other people, have had their increments abolished.  I am not making an argument about that.</p></speech>

I still do not know and no one seems to be able to tell me why the intervention of the primary centres has not shown a visible improvement in the delivery of services to the patient at local level.  Given the extensive nature of the facilities, I thought the intervention would have been of benefit to the patient who did not require major surgery for example and who required access to a consultant or a GP etc.  It is local, it is available, so why does it not happen?  Incidentally, in one particular case, I discovered the opening hours of the primary care centre were two hours earlier than was the case with the GP service previously.  I would like that question answered.</p> <p>  I feel we have a duty not to give a false impression to the general public as to what can be done.  The rainy day fund comes up.  It should be known and recognised that the rainy day fund is there for a purpose.  Revenue accruing to the Exchequer is removed from one particular area or a number of areas.  There is a debate about where it should go.  Should it go into the rainy day fund to prepare for pitfalls that are visible on the horizon right now, like Brexit and other things, or should it go into current expenditure?  It is as simple as this.  We know what happened before when current expenditure went out of hand as a percentage of our economic performance.    </p> <p>  I want to hear what the answers are.  I would, however, also like everybody to recognise that there are consequences in the event of current expenditure exceeding the recommended rate of gross domestic product, GDP, gross national product, GNP, or any other measurement.  If we have another recession like the one we have barely come out of now, that will be permanent because we will not find so many people ready to bail us out the next time.</p></speech>

On security issues, I will answer Senator Colm Burke and Deputy O'Reilly's questions at the same time.  All of the research tells us that when staffing levels are low then assaults go up.  We have to have the proper staffing levels to avoid the frustrations and the long wait times etc.  We had a dispute in 2016 and part of the settlement was that there would be a security analysis of accident and emergency departments.  We found that while the hospital might have security personnel, they may not necessarily be stationary in the accident and emergency department for the 24 hour cycle and that is still the case.  Many accident and emergency departments do have security personnel, many do not but the hospital might have for some of the 24 hour cycle.</p> <p>  We have already alluded to the drugs and alcohol issue, the presentations and the fact that is putting our members, and our colleagues working with us, in danger.  There is no doubt about that.  An education piece needs to follow this.  Is it the responsibility of the trade unions?  Everybody knows health and safety legislation requires the employer to ensure a safe place of work.  We have raised this as an issue and we have gone into dispute on it.  It remains an issue that may raise its head as dispute issues arise around the country in the next number of weeks because it is simply not acceptable.  </p> <p>  I will address the workforce plan.</p><p>The idea that we know all this and yet in the month of July we are still waiting for a plan to tell us how may nurses and midwives will be funded seems to contradict the requirements and obligations of employers under the safety, health and welfare at work legislation.  It is irresponsible, frankly, that we do not know. <br/><br/>Deputy Kelly referred to the modular build.  We have been involved in discussions in respect of South Tipperary General Hospital.  The issue there is space.  Over the past two years the authorities have been looking at the car park.  There has been an issue in respect of the admission criteria.  What type of patient can attend that modular build when we do not have access to the main hospital?  Can we put acutely ill people into a modular build like that?  We argue that one cannot.  There is an issue in respect of the modular builds in Cavan.  I was there two weeks ago.  One nurse was on her own at night looking after 17 patients away from the emergency department and the main thoroughfare.  These modular builds have to be staffed properly, and they have to be proximate and they have to be secure.  For the sake of patients, staff have to be able to run with a crash trolley if somebody experiences an adverse event.  Staffing is going to cause the delay.<br/><br/>The Deputy is correct in regard to Limerick that the reconfiguration in both the west and the north east put the cart before the horse.  The capacity was removed and it was not increased by the measure that was required.  That is why there were problems in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda and that is why there were problems transferring into Beaumont Hospital in those years.  In the mid-west the problems continue because capacity has not increased.  Efficiencies can be introduced, certainly in respect of the voluntary hospital, St. John's Hospital, Nenagh Hospital and Ennis Hospital.  There is no doubt about that. <br/><br/>I refer to information technology.  It makes no sense that we still spend hours writing patient histories and looking for files.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report calls for transitional funding earmarked for building IT infrastructure.  That makes sense and has to be addressed.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Durkan on the rainy day fund, it is fairly straightforward.  We are not looking for current expenditure.  What we are saying is that we have choices<b>. </b>The current crisis in health will not be fixed by saying that there could be another catastrophic crisis in eight months.  The transitional fund outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report is clearly tied to a time period and it is not ongoing.  We need to make sure that we transition to the right model.  That will cost money upfront, but it is will not be an ongoing cost.  In fact, it will reap significant savings on an ongoing basis.  <br/><br/>Primary care services are underfunded and understaffed.  We all have a different impression of what primary care means.  Clinicians working together out of the same building is a good idea.  It means that referrals can happen much more quickly.  However, we are on the record as saying that we believe the staff have to be employed by the same employer, which is a problem.  We also believe that there is major capacity in the community for the advancement of nursing services and public health nurses.  The Sl&aacute;intecare, capacity review and ESRI reports stated that there is an underinvestment in public health and in community nursing services.  That needs to be addressed, because many roles can be nurse-led in the community.  They provide good value for money and will develop, and they will prevent people from having to be admitted to hospital. </p></speech>

That comes back to the recruitment and the retention challenges and whether people feel valued within the system.  We have highlighted the fact that the disparity in pay at consultant level is one of the main blocks in this respect.  The failure to honour the contracts of NCHDs is certainly a block to recruitment at that level, and the failure to reverse the FEMPI provisions and engage properly on the GP contract is the challenge to recruitment and retention of general practitioners in our health system.</p> <p>  I refer to the issue of security in the emergency setting and in the hospital setting in general.  If we want our emergency departments to be safe, we should not overcrowd them.   We should not have them running at 200% and 300% of their available clinical space, occupied by people who should be on wards.  People coming to emergency departments are distressed by the conditions they are coming with.  They are often anxious and upset.  The last thing they want to experience is an even more stressful environment.  As a nation, we have to get that right.  If we can get that right, we will make the patients' journey safer and we will make it safer for the staff working in hospitals, because we will make the environment in which patients undergo their initial assessment, and in the majority of cases all of their management, less stressful.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the intent of what Deputy Kelly said was not to cause hurt, but I note that he described the two emergency departments in his constituency as the worst.  I think what he meant to say was that they are the most challenged with regard to overcrowding.</p></speech>

It is important that we make the people working in that challenging environment feel valued, and the way we speak about them is incredibly important.  The way we remunerate them is also incredibly important, as we have also referenced today.</p> <p>  Ehealth is an area of particular interest to me.  We have made a lot of progress with regard to telemedicine in stroke care and acute coronary care.  There is scope for further development.  However, many hospitals have IT systems that are falling over or do not have IT systems at all, because there has not been capital investment in the hardware, software or staffing required.  That is an area for investment, and could help us into the future.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly referred to the NTPF.  The fund advantaged certain patients who have been appropriate to receive care there.  Our problem with it is that we are taking money from an under-resourced system to pay the private sector to do what should be deliverable within the public sector.  That is what we have to get right.  It is a sticking plaster.  It will not be sustainable in the future, and not enough people will benefit if we continue with that model of care.  We need to invest adequately in the system in general.  </p> <p>   I refer to the issue of the mental health services staff and who looks after them.  The staff members are looking after each other.  The nursing and medical staff, the health care assistants. porters and security staff all talk to each other.  We try to support each other through the situation.  Many hospitals also provide counselling through their psychology services if they are in a position to do so.  However, if we want to care for our staff, we have to get the overcrowding issue right.  By doing that, we will enable them and facilitate them in caring for their patients.  That is what we are there for and that is what we want to deliver on.  </p> <p>  I would love a seamless, flawless delivery of care, but I would be happy with a safe delivery of care.  To achieve safe delivery of care, I need to have a bed available to the patients for whom I am providing care and who needs hospitalisation.  I need to have a trolley available for the patient I need to assess within the emergency department, and, to have that, I need capacity in the system which the political system needs to deliver for us.  That is why we are here.</p></speech>

However, again, resourcing is required in that regard.</p> <p>  When primary care teams function, they function extremely well.  The concept of the GP, practice nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, psychologist and podiatrist all working together for the patient is terrific, but they have not been resourced to the extent that they need to be throughout the country</p><p>That needs to happen because we do not have the sort of numbers we need.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan and I debated the <i>per capita</i>expenditure previously and the fact that we are spending a lot of money on health care.  We see 1.4 million patients each year in our emergency departments.  There are between 18 and 20 million patient attendances at GPs, hundreds of thousands of procedures are performed around the country and there are hundreds of thousands of outpatient visits each year.  That is a costly.  My concern, which I have expressed previously, is that when we talk about <i>per capita </i>expenditure, we are talking in terms of out of pocket expenditure, insurance premium expenditure and the Government expenditure component.  The Government expenditure component is not adequate and that is the only strategic spend we have within the health system.  We need to get that right.  We need to resource the system such that patients can have confidence that they will receive safe care.</p></speech>

The division between the community care organisations and the acute hospital sector, and the acute mental health sector, the fact that they report to different management structures, needs to be reconsidered.  It does not make sense to develop a system this way.  The term used these days is "geoalignment".  We have also been concerned at the lack of a governance structure.  We have an executive in the HSE, but very few governance structures nationally, or even in local community health organisations or hospital groups.  The integration of that governance function for the acute hospital service, community services and mental health services in a geographical area would be a great advance.  That would allow us consider some things that would be beneficial.  In any of those groups we need a coherent ehealth system where we can pool information on people, and not duplicate tests or go over the same information again and again at each patient contact.  Those systems need to be able to talk to each other between those different community organisations.  That also touches on the issue of staff burn out and the mental health of staff.  That cannot be minded by a large organisation of more than 100,000 employees.  It has to be a part of the management structure locally to try to sustain people in their work.</p> <p>  The NTPF is a short-term solution but it has some drawbacks in continuity of care and we would be much better off funding capacity that would stay with us over the years.  The pathways of care could be greatly helped by having a coherent integrated health service management structure on a large regional basis.</p></speech>

The issue is the lack of capacity and we were quite heartened by the fact that the NDP has provided funding for an additional 2,600 beds but we are concerned that we are not seeing the annual plans to commission those beds.  With a lead time of seven years to get a bed in place from beginning to end in the health service, I am concerned that we will not see the 2,600 within a reasonable timeframe.  My one big ask of the committee is to request the HSE and the Minister to put on paper the timeframe for the 2,600 beds.  They are funded.  We just need them put in place.  That would be a big start.  If we could get certainty on that number, people would be encouraged that we might be able to put a dent in the number of patients on trolleys and on waiting lists.  We hope progress can be made on that and we would welcome progress.</p></speech>

Are we going back to the health boards of the past?  Deputy Durkan would be delighted with that.  Does it need to be more localised?  Is that the structure Mr. Gilligan is talking about, or is it like the proposed board of the HSE or a sub-board?</p></speech>

At regional level, I do not know what population would be best.  Any hospital group and the community healthcare organisation should have the same geographical boundaries and the same type of management structures.  As well as having an executive role such as the HSE provides, there needs to be a board and governance structures.</p></speech>

With regard to the components of the electronic systems speaking to each other I have a concern about patient confidentiality.  My background is in a community pharmacy, and I am concerned especially about addiction services or people with HIV, or other health issues that are so personal that they do not want to deal with the doctor or community pharmacist in their own areas.  I am concerned about having a huge system that everybody has access to because there have been examples of people accessing other people's social welfare details out of nosiness.  How do we protect the patient?  Should community pharmacists and the doctor in the hospital be able to see everything?  There might just be the nosey neighbour wanting to find out about someone.  It is important that personal data are not available.  Firewalls must be put in place to prevent a breach.  Can Dr. O'Hanlon give us any advice on that?</p></speech>

There was an integrated healthcare system and we could access somebody's records from the different institutions where they had sought care in the state of Washington.  The psychiatry records were generally closed so I could not access those.  Similarly, there were different levels of access.  For example, a healthcare assistant would get to vital signs or medication, which would not be considered sensitive.  There was a different level according to the person's log-in on the computer.  Everyone was paranoid and a person had to swipe their card every time they accessed the system.  A big notice came up asking was the user providing care for this person before accessing that record.  That worked well.</p></speech>

With regard to the step-down facilities in place, in particular Mount Carmel Community Hospital, which is being operated by a private company, I hear anecdotal evidence that patients are resisting going to particular step-down units after the consultant has signed them off for discharge.

I also welcome their colleagues in the Public Gallery.</p> <p>  Before beginning, members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of our witnesses to the situation with privilege.  They should please note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I will once again raise the caution about mobile phones.

It provides non-EEA nationals with a number of options to invest in Ireland.  Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.  A successful applicant gains an immigration permission, but it must be stressed that such a permission contains no inherent right to citizenship outside the normal statutory procedures for citizenship and naturalisation that are applicable to any other non-EEA national with an immigration permission to reside in the State.</p> <p>  The immigrant investor must make an investment of &euro;1 million in projects for a minimum of three years.  On confirmation of receipt of the investment, he or she receives a stamp 4 residency permission for an initial period of two years.  This can be renewed thereafter for a further three years following a review.  Any investor who withdraws his or her investment from an approved investment or fails to comply with the terms and conditions is subject to the loss of any immigration permission granted under the programme.</p> <p>  As of this June, a total of 836 applications had been submitted since the launch of the programme in April 2012.  There was a major increase in applications in 2016.  This growth, albeit at a much slower pace, continued in 2017, with a 5% increase in applications, bringing the total to 334.  As of March 2018, 708 applicants had had their investments approved, providing for a total approved investment of &euro;507 million.  In the region of 1,750 persons, including spouses and minor children of investors, have received immigration permissions or been offered appointments to register their permissions following approval of their investments.  No immigration permission is granted or registered until documentary evidence has been received by INIS that the investment has been made to an Irish enterprise or fund.</p> <p>  The investor programme is not unique to Ireland.  Similar programmes operate in many EU member states as well as other developed economies.</p> <p>  All applications under the programme are evaluated by an independent expert evaluation committee, which is cross-departmental and cross-agency, with representatives from the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and INIS, which provides secretarial support to the committee.</p> <p>  Over the duration of the programme, its scope and focus have adjusted to take account of the experience gained from its operation and the changing economic environment.  The evaluation committee has considered and recommended a number of changes.  For example, the minimum investment amount was initially set at &euro;1 million, but this was reduced to &euro;500,000 when there was little uptake of the scheme.  It was readjusted back up to &euro;1 million when there was a major increase in applications in 2016.  The number of options under the scheme has been streamlined from six to four based on the experience of the operation of the scheme.  The targeting and prioritisation of the types of investment made have shifted towards specific benefits to the State, in particular social housing, primary healthcare centres and nursing homes.  Full details of the scheme are published on the INIS website and updated there as changes occur.</p><p>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has planned a detailed external review of the scheme in the second half of this year.  It will cover a number of factors, including the changing economic environment and the learning by all participant stakeholders to date and will also consult more broadly by way of public consultation and it is intended to publish the outcome of this review in due course.  </p><p> I now turn to processing times of applications in the International Protection Office, IPO.  In December 2016, we commenced the International Protection Act 2015, which received broad cross-party support during its passage through the Oireachtas.  The Act is the most significant reforming legislation to our international protection system in the past 20 years.  It introduced a single application procedure in the protection process with the key aim of identifying those eligible for protection at a much earlier stage and ensuring that those found not to have a protection need can be returned to their country of origin in a timely and humane manner.  This has replaced the sequential processing of applications, which involved multiple appeals and inherent processing delays both in timescales for processing and consequently the time spent by applicants in accommodation centres.  The old process was also significantly out of line with EU procedures. </p><p> The Act has addressed the structural causes of delays in the system.  Our challenge now is to clear the inherited caseload from the old system to allow the single procedure to function effectively and efficiently.  When the Act was commenced, the IPO was required under the transition provisions in the Act, to take responsibility for the processing of approximately 3,500 cases that had not been finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT. </p><p> In addition, establishing the new single procedure processes required considerable efforts by the International Protection Office in the first part of 2017, which resulted in a shorter processing year.  Notwithstanding this, the IPO has scheduled almost 4,300 single procedure interviews from the Act's commencement up to the end of June 2018.  A further 660 interviews have been scheduled to mid-September.  Based on current predictions, the IPO is in line to make some 3,500 recommendations and decisions this year. </p><p> In addition to the substantial number of cases carried over from the previous system, the number of applications for international protection during 2017 rose by 30%, placing an additional processing burden on the system, including the relocation of over 500 asylum seekers from Greece alone in that year.  More than 1,000 in total have come from Greece under the programme, which has added to the processing requirements for the office. </p><p> While the single procedure has resulted in a more streamlined system, caseworkers in the IPO are now required to investigate applications on the basis of three comprehensive elements, namely, determination of refugee status, subsidiary protection and whether there are grounds to grant a person humanitarian permission to remain in the State.  The level of investigation required is therefore more comprehensive and complex and consequently more time consuming.  The IPO is also conscious that it does not sacrifice quality of decision making for increasing outputs and must balance these in the best interest of fair decision making.  </p><p> It is important to outline how cases are dealt with in the IPO.  An approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR, whose staff are co-located in the IPO.  Priority is given to applicants from refugee generating countries like Syria, Eritrea and Iraq and vulnerable applicants such as unaccompanied minors.  Generally, other applications are processed based on oldest cases first.  </p><p> Interviews can only be scheduled when an applicant returns their international protection questionnaire.  Applicants who do not return their questionnaire are reminded to do so as part of their statutory duty to co-operate with the protection process.  When these cases that are not ready for interview are taken into account, prioritised applications being made today should be scheduled for interview within four months of application and non-prioritised cases should be scheduled within ten to 12 months of application.</p><p> Processing challenges are being addressed by deploying increased resources and a continual assessment of procedures to maximise quality outputs.  The IPO currently has 138 Civil Service staff members, an increase of nearly 30 since the commencement of the 2015 Act.  Further staff members will be appointed in the coming period.  There are also 55 contracted members of the IPO case processing panel with legal qualifications, most of whom work on a part-time basis.  Additional panel members are currently being recruited by way of open competition and are expected to be in place in the autumn.</p><p> In conjunction with the enhanced processing capacity in the IPO, the appeals authority has also been significantly reformed and I am happy to provide further information to the committee on this if required. </p><p> There has been a radical overhaul of our protection system in the past two years.  This has created challenges through the implementation and transition phases.  As outlined, these are being addressed and the IPO is now producing more decisions than new cases entering the system.  That is an important milestone for us because it means we are now eating into the cases in hand.</p><p> Both the Minister and Department have acknowledged that at present, many applicants for international protection are waiting too long to have their case decided.  Through the series of measures outlined, the aim is to continue to reduce the regular caseload on hands as quickly as possible to produce first instance decisions for those co-operating with the system within nine months.  Due to factors, such as the demand-led nature of applications and the volatile nature of migration in Europe, it is not possible to put a definitive timeline on this but all other things being equal, our target is to reach this position by the end of next year.  However, I emphasise to members that priority cases continued to be processed in a matter of months.  For instance, the relocation cases from Greece take about six to seven weeks to process.  Every effort is being made and will continue to be made to get to the position of processing cases within nine months as quickly as possible.</p><p>  I am happy to take any questions from members.</p></speech>

There are agents who operate and seek to represent their clients in obtaining investments.  As a committee, it was decided early on that we would not engage and did not want individual members of the committee to engage with agents on this but that it would be done through the secretariat and administrative function in INIS.  It was considered that by releasing the names of individual members of the committee, they would be put in a position of being contacted by agents who would invariably want to discuss individual cases that were of interest to them, which we thought was not appropriate.  I am happy to say that I chair the committee but beyond that I do not wish to create a situation where individual members of the committee would be contacted about individual cases.</p></speech>

Unemployment was at its highest level and the focus at the time was to gain inward investment for the purpose of employment.  The focus on the enterprise scheme at that stage was very much on employment generation.  As the economy improved over time and other pressures came upon the State, particularly with regard to social housing, healthcare, primary healthcare centres and nursing homes, the committee recommended to the Minister that we move the focus of the investor programme away from employment generation and towards addressing these needs because they were seen as more pressing and important in terms of the State's requirements at the time.  The focus switched from enterprise.  In the early stages quite a lot of investment was also made in hotel regeneration because at the time, the tourism industry was under serious pressure.  The investments are scattered throughout the country.  They are not concentrated in any particular area of the country.  There is also a sense of looking at investments in areas where there may not be other opportunities for investment.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the Central Bank to determine who it licenses and what funds it licenses.  We do not give any immigration permission unless the Central Bank has granted a licence for a fund.  Funds make up a small proportion of the overall investment.  They make up approximately 10% of the overall investment of the &euro;507 million we spoke about.</p></speech>

An interesting recommendation was that other recommendations could have been made about the scheme but they were outside the scope of the report.  It stated that it is clearly important that the integrity of the immigration system is maintained and that this should be a priority regardless of economic impact.  Is there anything that perhaps was not mentioned or included in the scope of the internal review?  Who wrote this interim assessment of the scheme?</p></speech>

It comprises people seconded from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Department to carry out economic evaluations.  Perhaps that is where the reference comes from.  It solely looks at economic perspectives rather than the wider picture of whether such a scheme should exist in the first place.</p></speech>

In terms of why we did not publish the report, which we have made available to the committee, as members will see, it is an interim report.  It recommends that a further report and evaluation be undertaken and all of its recommendations indicate that it is too early in the process to make any judgments.  For that reason, it was felt that it was premature to issue a report without having followed up and conducted the main review.</p></speech>

If there are funds available elsewhere without the need to give an immigration permission, we must ask whether we should continue such a scheme and give an immigration permission or whether there are other ways that infrastructure can be funded in the State.  Regardless of the outcome of the review, we will seek to maintain certain parts of the scheme, for example, the endowment option, which has grown significantly in the past year.  A total of &euro;27 million has been donated to charitable organisations in the State under that option, which we will seek to maintain, regardless of the outcome.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review.  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the Government to decide how it wants to continue.  Our job is to analyse and present options with the appropriate research.</p></speech>

The scheme was marketed heavily by our people and embassy in China.  In addition, people are attracted to an English speaking country.  This is linked with education because education for the children of investors is one of the big attractions.  According to the most recent figures, there are 1.5 million high net worth individuals in China.  We are talking about a tiny percentage of that figure.</p></speech>

He mentioned the number of applications and the delay in processing them.  I represent a constituency where many people have applied for various types of visas, citizenship and so on.  Have efforts been made to beef up the number of staff working in the unit?  I acknowledge Mr. Kirrane's comment that he is trying to increase staff numbers.  People applying for family reunification and citizenship are extremely frustrated.  I appreciate that due process applies.  Will Mr. Kirrane outline how he aims to improve timelines over the next 12 months and give greater certainty to applicants?  I appreciate the feedback he has given me and other public representatives, which is obviously limited to information supplied with applications.  It would be good if we could give certainty to people by providing a timeline by which the Department will improve response times.</p> <p>  I am aware from replies to parliamentary questions that there has been a spike in the number of applications made at embassies, for example, in New Delhi in India.  I ask Mr. Kirrane to comment on the difficulties being experienced.  I know of people who are genuinely working here who have made bona fide applications to bring their spouses here.  Obviously the unit will have received applications that might not be bona fide and I realise that the unit must try to strike a balance.  I ask him to outline a plan to improve response times and give certainty to applicants.  The same applicants keep contacting me to find out if there has been progress with applications.  This is very difficult for them and us, as public representatives.  It would be helpful to give them a timeline for the completion of the process.</p></speech>

We have seen an increase in volume across the board in the past year, particularly for visas and registration of immigration permissions.  That is probably a function of the economic upturn as much as anything else.</p> <p>  We are deploying additional staff in our offices in Beijing and New Delhi to deal with visas.  We are considering taking some of the applications from those locations to process them in Dublin where we believe centralising those functions will provide a more efficient and effective service.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Ward, will outline more broadly some of the measures we are taking as part of our reform programme with a view to improving service.  Our number of staff has increased significantly in the past two years.  We intend to recruit further staff in the coming months to deal with the increase in numbers and process cases faster.  Some cases take longer than others.  Visit visas are processed in a matter of days.</p><p>More complex cases can take time to process because there is a due process that has to be gone through, which often involves Garda checks and checks that we do with our UK colleagues, among others.  Our aim is to reduce the processing time as much as possible and we intend to use more technology in delivering those services.</p></speech>

The aim is to produce a coherent and complete response to all the challenges we face and to the range of Government and INIS policies that we are trying to pull together.  We have set that out based around five pillars.  I will not speak at great length on this.  The first pillar concerns reassessing our mission and purpose and having a fundamental examination of what our role is and how we should be set up.</p> <p>  The second is protecting the safety and security of the system.  That includes areas such as advance passenger information, an area in which developments are taking place; reviewing the mechanisms we use to verify identity; and improving our co-operation with other State bodies, including the Garda in areas such as Operation Vantage.</p> <p>  The third pillar is to try to ensure the system is as efficient and effective as it can be.  Much of that involves focusing on eliminating the backlogs we have, which will obviously improve the customer experience, and integrating ICT developments into how we handle our work.</p> <p>  The fourth pillar is to redesign our services based on customers' needs rather than our needs.  We have begun moving towards pre-clearance schemes that inform people of their residence permissions before they arrive in Ireland rather than afterwards.  We have online forms and payments coming on stream towards the end of this year and these will be rolled out for all of our schemes by the end of 2019.  We have moved towards plain language in all our communications.  That started with our annual review and it is now used on all of our application forms.  We are also trying to bring that through to our website.  In general, we are trying to find new ways of measuring our customers' experiences and improving the processes around that.</p> <p>  The last pillar is targeting our resources at the change management processes.  The director general referred to staffing increases.  In the past two years, staff numbers across the INIS increased from approximately 650 to approximately 800.  The expectation is that the figure will rise to approximately 880 by the end of this year and that will obviously have a significant impact.  We are targeting these new staff at some of the areas where we have pressures such as in the international protection office.</p></speech>

It is still early days in terms of when the review will take place but I am aware of one or two investments in a fund that did not take off and were allowed to move to another investment because the investor was not at fault.  For example, if a total of five investors were required to reach a particular limit for the amount of the investment and that did not materialise, we would allow the investors who had already submitted applications to move to another option.</p></speech>

There are plenty of cases where someone is not contacted and things work perfectly, but I do not think the general experience of a lot of people who are looking for a visa to come into Ireland for a short-stay holiday tallies with what the service is telling us.  I regularly hear of people who experience inordinate delays and difficulties in obtaining a visa to come here for an event, to join a family member or for a short stay.</p> <p>  Was it a policy to say insufficient documentation or evidence had been provided with an application?  Was this ever suggested as a way of giving a holding reply to applicants and delay applications owing to the overall volume of applications received?  I know of people who had been granted a visa to visit the country multiple times in the past but who received such a reply to a visa application in the past 12 months.  I do not understand how somebody could have applied in 2016 to come to Ireland and again, using the same process, in 2017 and who booked tickets with the expectation that the result could be told "No."  Have the process been changed?  I refer specifically to applications received from Thailand where people seem to be told, almost as a standard response, that they have provided insufficient documentation.  It strikes me that the system is overburdened and one is reaching for a handy reply.  I could cite specific cases in which people lost bookings and airline tickets and had to rebook at inordinate cost, but they were bona fide cases.  The State and the agency decided on previous occasions that there was no problem with the people in question coming here; therefore, I am at a loss to understand how decisions are being made.  There also seems to be a problem with applications from India which also seem to have been stalled.</p> <p>  I accept the principle that there is nothing inherently wrong with the State having a business evaluation scheme in place, like most western European countries.  However, there is always something about such a scheme that attracts a certain type of investment and it often involves aspects of European Union residency rules, with Ireland being very valuable in that context, but it needs to be ultra transparent.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has no defence for a lack of transparency.  If there is a risk element to an investment scheme of this type, given the motives there might be to invest in it, the agency providing the service should be completely transparent.</p> <p>  Mr. Kirrane spoke about investment in the hotel industry in the early days.  Before I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, my business was tangentially involved in the hospitality sector.  Anything that distorts a market and, for example, allows an influx of money to give one group a competitive advantage over another in buying up hotels around the country should be known about and transparent.  There is anecdotal evidence of an influx of Chinese money to buy into hotel projects in Ireland, preventing Irish indigenous operators from purchasing or competing.  Under a crazy tax scheme 15 years ago, hotels were being built in every second town that were never going to be economically sustainable.  I do not care about the fact that they went out of business because they were never economically viable, but they wiped out a generation of Irish hotel and hospitality people and thousands of jobs in good, strong, family-run hotels because they could not compete with new ones which were never going to be viable.  I would hate to think money came in under this scheme that might be involved in that type of investment, although there is some indication that it did.  I ask the delegates to consider that aspect.  As Senator Martin Conway said, no one is asking the service to publish a business scheme, but if money is coming in, we should know where it is going.  We should know who is on a committee that is making decisions and we should know who are investing.  If they do not like our terms and conditions, they should go and find another country.</p></speech>

By how much has the number of asylum applications gone up, excluding the Greek applications?  I think the figure given in the opening statement included the Greek applications.  Will the delegates outline the main countries from which asylum seekers arrive at Irish ports or airports?  Will they enlarge on the reforms and how we process applications?  Are we processing them more efficiently?  I accept the point about emergency applications and piling resources into the service, as necessary, but it seems strange that something can be done for one person in a couple of months, while another has to wait 18 months.  Is it just a question of resources?  Has something else changed?  How can somebody who is deemed to be in one category of applicant have to wait so much longer than an applicant in another?  That does not seem to be explicable in any other way than by reference to resources.</p> <p>  What is the position on access to the labour market under the new revised scheme and how does it compare with that in other EU countries?  What has changed for asylum seekers in the context of the opt-in to the directive on reception conditions?</p></speech>

That is not part of the system.  I will explain how visa regimes are organised worldwide.  A lot of the processing of more complex cases is carried out by the INIS in Dublin, but there are seven INIS-staffed offices located in various parts of the world which deal with bigger volumes of applications.</p><p>They are in New Delhi, Beijing, Moscow, Ankara, London, Abu Dhabi and Abuja, Nigeria.  They are controlled by the INIS.  Other visa applications are processed by local embassies under the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which sometimes experience pressure in so doing.  Visas applications from Thailand, to which Deputy Colm Brophy referred, are processed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The INIS is considering that system model as part of the reform package referred to by Mr. Ward.  We have established a group with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to fundamentally consider our method of processing visa applications, whether it should be more centralised and what resources would be needed to cater for the anticipated increased demand.  Such reforms would include streamlining processes, where possible, including increased automation of online applications and payments.  Although the initial application is made online, we wish for as much of the process as possible to be completed online.</p><p> It is very difficult to address individual cases which involve a perceived difference between one year and another.  It may sometimes happen for reasons outside our control.  We carry out a series of checks with the Garda and our colleagues in the United Kingdom and occasionally encounter negative immigration histories or a delay in the processing of the request.  Some stages of the process are not directly within our control and can cause delays or give the impression that there are different results for similar applications.  It is impossible to ascertain the reasons for certain decisions without knowing the details of the individual cases, but I am happy to discuss further such cases with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I reiterate that many people, some of whom have travelled regularly to the United Kingdom, contact public representatives having experienced untold grief in applying for an Irish visa.  The frequency of such complaints indicates a pattern of problematic processing of applications.  It is difficult to reconcile this with Mr. Kirrane&rsquo;s answer because many of the people concerned have no problem in going to the United Kingdom which I assume carries out the same terrorism, security and policing checks as in Ireland but do encounter a difficulty when applying for an Irish visa.  Many were granted permission to come here but encounter difficulty when applying for a second or subsequent visa.  I do not know what they did for the 12 months since their initial application for a visa, but as the subsequent application was made from their home country, it is obvious that they returned there.  I am not referring to a single case involving such problems.  If I were, I would raise it as such.</p></speech>

The vast majority of visa applications are processed very quickly with positive outcomes.  The overall recognition rate is over 90%.  We expect to deal with approximately 125,000 visa applications this year.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that there are difficulties in individual cases.  If such difficulties arise in a substantial number of cases, we will consider this, but it must be looked at in the context of the volume of cases we process within the recommended timeframe.  The vast majority of our customers fit into that category.  We are anxious to consider what could be done to further streamline our processes to ensure a quicker turnaround because it is not in our interests to delay processing.

It was viewed as a capital injection to allow such enterprises to survive.  Many were family businesses which were the focus at the time.  The scheme in the early days was about job creation.  We have not considered further investment in hotels, apart from one or two carried over from the very early days of the scheme.  I do not remember any new such scheme being considered in the past 12 months.</p></speech>

A balance must be struck.  I entirely accept what members have said about the need for transparency.  I have no desire to operate a scheme which creates a difficulty for the immigration system or which calls its integrity in question.  That is not our function.</p> <p>  Deputy Colm Brophy asked about asylum application numbers.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Costello, to provide more detail of increases in the numbers of asylum applications and the countries from which applicants come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1025" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Costello" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018071100002#L01000"><p>Thus far in 2018, the main home countries of asylum applicants are Syria, Georgia, Albania, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.  The largest number of applicants come from Syria.  That was also the case in 2017, when a significant number of applications were also received from people from Georgia, Albania, Zimbabwe and Nigeria.  Some 1,647 applications were made this year to the end of June, of which approximately 266 were under the relocation programme.  In the same period last year 1,278 were made, of which 226 were under the relocation programme.  The 30% increase in the number of applications received is accounted for partly by an increased number of applications under the relocation programme.</p> <p>  On some cases being processed more rapidly than others, Syrians and some Iraqis who are being relocated from Greece are our main priority.  Our staff travel to Greece with the co-operation of the European Asylum Support Office which is tasked with dealing with the relocation programme and the Greek asylum service to interview applicants before they come to Ireland.  The applicants and their details are transferred to Ireland.  Pre-screening, including a medical assessment, is carried out before applicants come to Ireland to ensure they will be able to access the support services they require when they arrive.</p><p>That is different from the other applicant who comes into my office from the street, for example, or who applies at a port of entry.  The first time we encounter those applicants is when they come to our office.  There is no pre-screening there.</p><p> In addition, we can process the relocated applicants more speedily because we do not carry out a full interview with them.  We have gathered information about them in Greece and we also have comprehensive country of origin information on Syria provided to us by the UNHCR so we can determine those cases effectively on the papers.  We can provide an expedited procedure based on the papers because the legislation provides for a well-founded application or claim.  That is the reason we can do those in six to seven weeks.</p><p> As to other applicants, we have another stream which is the non-prioritised cases.  We inherited a substantial backlog of those cases when the International Protection Act was commenced at the beginning of last year and we have had to concentrate on processing those cases before we can get to new cases.  They all have to be fully interviewed in a more complex process than previously.  That is the reason there are different timelines for the relocation and non-relocation cases.</p></speech>

However, some asylum seekers end up in the system for years.  Is he saying that is primarily due to the backlog in the old system and that when the new system is up and running fully and the backlog is cleared that will not happen?  When does he envisage having the processing time down to the target he would like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1028" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Costello" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018071100002#M00300"><p>Bearing everything in mind, such as resources and training, the plan is that by the end of next year we should be able to process nine months from the time somebody applies.  We are moving to schedule interviews more quickly now for new cases.  We can do a prioritised case in four months and a non-prioritised case in ten to 12 months for scheduling and thereafter produce the decision within approximately six weeks.  However, reaching a stage where everything is being done within nine months will not happen for at least a year.</p> <p>  One of the reasons there are asylum seekers in the system for a long time is that when the transition provisions for the International Protection Act came into effect a block of 2,000 cases that were with the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal came back to the International Protection Office to have certain protection elements of their cases heard by us.  Then they went back to the tribunal to have everything done there and finalised.  We had to process the backlog cases first and some of those had been in the old system for a long time.  They were brought into the new system and the legacy aspects of their claim had to be done by me, and then there was an opportunity for an appeal.  Similarly, there are blocks of cases that have been in the judicial review process for years and as those cases are finalised by the courts, they come back into the process to be dealt with again.</p> <p>  We are committed to having all the transition, carryover and backlog cases which we brought over from the old legislation finished by the end of this year.  Then we plan to get to a nine-month process by the end of next year.  However, it is a  complex and highly legally challenging process.  While we recognise that we must give people a speedy hearing, we do not want to compromise our quality either.  I have the UNHCR working with me as well and there is a strong emphasis on speed of process but that must be balanced with quality of process.  For example, the number of judicial reviews against my office is minuscule currently compared with what it was years ago.  There were three big challenges in the process years ago - the quality of the process, an issue with recognition rates and an issue with backlogs.  The big issue I deal with now is the backlogs.  The quality is sorted to the extent that the UNHCR tells me that we have improved our quality greatly.  I have permanently based UN staff working with me.  The recognition rates when one includes relocation cases are between 40% and 50%.  The backlog is the biggest challenge for us.  With the increased resources and more effective work processes, without compromising quality, our main aim is to get to a nine-month process by the end of next year.</p></speech>

The top five countries for this year, excluding Syria which is under the EU relocation programme, are Georgia, Albania, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Nigeria.  They account for more than 50% of the overall number of applications received in the first half of this year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1032" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Merriman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018071100002#M00700"><p>Since 30 June we have opted in on time to the recast reception conditions directive, which has brought about a fundamental change in where we provide supports directly to people in the protection process.  On the labour market side, we have open access to the labour market with minimum restrictions for anybody who has been waiting for a first instance decision for nine months or more.  With regard to the first instance decision, previously it was just a refugee decision but now it is a refugee and subsidiary protection decision.  If one has not had a determination on one's refugee or subsidiary protection application, one will have open and generous access to the labour market, including self-employment.  We are one of the few countries in the EU to allow that.  We have allowed for access to self-employment since 9 February last.</p> <p>  To make a comparison, there is a requirement in Sweden to prove one's identity.  Many applicants have difficulties with that due to the countries they come from or they will not have arrived in the country with their identity documents.  They cannot work in sectors that require certified skills so they can only work in low skill employment.  That is the case in Sweden.  In France, the person gets access to the labour market after nine months.  However, the applications are generally processed within seven months, which means nobody accesses the labour market there.  One must also have proof of a job offer.  In Germany, one gets access after three months but one must stay in a reception centre - we have no such requirement - and the possibility of a 24-month obligation has been provided for and was applied recently in Bavaria.  The applicants cannot access self-employment.  In Denmark, applicants are housed in asylum centres.  There is no such requirement here.  They can only work in those centres for the first six months and they have no access to self-employment.  In Britain, access is provided after 12 months but essentially they can only apply for vacancies in listed shortage occupations.  The Irish access to the labour force is much broader than in those mainstream countries.</p> <p>  We are getting applications for the permission, which will last for six months and is renewable.  It is renewable even if the applicant is under appeal.  The Deputy spoke about people being in the process for many years.  Most of those, if not all, will have failed at the first instance within the first three years.  The reason they are there longer than that is that they are using either the appeals process or they are caught up in judicial reviews or the like.  Anybody who does not get a first instance application decision within nine months, regardless of the time the appeals process or judicial review process takes, will still have that permission renewed every six months under our process.</p> <p>  Opting in to the recast reception conditions has fundamentally changed what we have known as direct provision in Ireland.  Direct provision is not just accommodation centres but a range of services.  We have a rights-based service so that when people apply for our protection they get a right to free education at primary and secondary level, for example, and the right to a medical card.  That is not the case in some other countries, but it is part of the direct provision system.  People went into the accommodation centres at the beginning of a process which could be quite lengthy, especially under the old system.</p><p>They will now have the means to get out of the centres if they get into employment and to provide for the kind of lifestyles that they want to provide for themselves.  It is most important to also state that in the very modest area of charging people who want to remain in the accommodation centres while they are at work, there will be no charges for children at all and the children's DP allowance will still be paid to them.  Our approach in not limited on the right to work.  The Supreme Court case found that in the absence of a temporal limit, we should give a right to work.  We could have set a temporal limit but we took the opportunity to opt in to the recast reception conditions directive, with the permission of the Oireachtas.  That places the accommodation centres on a statutory basis and they are subject now to inspection under the EU.  We have also brought in a further appeals system in order that people can appeal their reception conditions; if it is their view that their material reception conditions are being negatively affected, they can go to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  Compared to the old system where people landed here and waited for many years without means to change their lives or provide for themselves, coupled with all the reforms we brought in under the McMahon recommendations, opting into the directive has fundamentally changed direct provision and there are now many more opportunities for people awaiting a final determination to take control and be more independent in the way they live in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is argued that the processes are now in place to deal with the backlog and that it may be possible next year to bring it down to six months.  In my experience, current delays are still lengthy.  I understand from the Immigrant Council of Ireland that a response to a recent parliamentary question stated that in some instances there is a delay of 19 months until first correspondence.  There are still significant backlogs to first interview.  The question is whether the resourcing is adequate.</p> <p>  GRETA, the Council of Europe organisation, and the US State Department have identified issues whereby international protection processes sometimes mitigate against victims of trafficking being properly identified as such.  That criticism was made in respect of this State by GRETA.  I want to understand the rationale for that.  I appreciate that there has to be some level of evaluation when people are applying for international protection but it is important that we have a clear sense of the numbers of those who are being trafficked internationally.</p> <p>  I understand there was a significant recent decision by the European Court of Justice in the case of A and S, which concerned aged out minors and family reunification.  It was found that where the application had been made prior to the minor ageing out, it could still be considered valid.  Will INIS be considering an update or further guidance on re-evaluating international protection legislation off the back of that decision?</p></speech>

The prioritised cases are processed much more quickly, within six to seven weeks for relocation and a matter of a short number of months for others who are in priority countries.  I outlined at the outset the countries that are currently at the top of our list in terms of numbers.  Their recognition rates are low.  It takes time to process them and our aim is to quickly move away from that 19-month period.  The intention is shortly, as the chief international protection officer will confirm, to schedule interviews down to 12 months for those normal cases in the system.  The intention is to move as quickly as possible from 19 months down to nine months and our estimate is that it will be reached by the end of next year.</p> <p>  We have allocated significant resources to the International Protection Office.  It has a total of 138 staff and 55 panel members.  The intention is to recruit more staff into that office and to update the numbers of people on the panel.  That will be done in the autumn of this year.  The intention is to get down as quickly as possible to the processing of first instance decisions within nine months.</p> <p>  In respect of victims of human trafficking, we work closely with the Garda on any case that is identified as involving a potential victim of human trafficking.  That includes a period of reflection, and an immigration permission is automatically granted to people during that period.  It is not the intention for anybody claiming asylum that it would in some way cut across their case being considered under human trafficking.  That would not be the case under any circumstances and I am not aware of any incidents where that would be the case.  The two processes run in parallel.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Merriman, to update the Deputy a little more on that as well as on family reunification and minors.</p></speech>

This has been particularly challenging up to now but the framework provides us with the opportunity to bring it in.  It will be spearheaded through the HSE.  We have upscaled considerably our capacity to identify victims of human trafficking once they arrive.  There is always a difficulty with people who have gone through a bad experience in trusting the State when they first encounter it.  While part of the vulnerability testing will establish what we can identify, we will also seek to make sure it is an ongoing process during their time in the protection process, which is a welcome development.</p> <p>  On the particular case, we would honour the application made by an aged out minor while he or she was still a minor.  If he or she put in the application while he or she was under 18, we would honour that.  One of the-----</p></speech>

Under that Act there is now a provision whereby the social worker is obliged to take legal advice.  Our view is that minors should always proceed with their international protection applications while they are still minors.</p></speech>

Normally in a year we issue about 1,000 deportation orders.  From memory, about 40 or 50 are effected in a particular year.  When a deportation order is issued, the obligation is on the person to remove himself or herself from the State.  The number of people removed last year under deportation orders was 140.  The obligation is on people to remove themselves from the State and many people do.  It is not the case that every deportation order issued automatically comes to the point where it requires the removal of a person from the State.  Many people voluntarily remove themselves.  We cannot be precise about how many do because we do not have exit checks and we maintain the common travel area with our UK colleagues.</p></speech>

The difficulty occurs in getting co-operation from a country.  It is not a question of us having somebody on a plane and that plane landing and somebody refusing to accept the person on arrival.  We make every effort to resolve the issue before anybody leaves the State by engaging with the relevant embassy to get a travel document and an acceptance the country will take the person back.</p></speech>

It drafted a document on international protection and asylum.  One of the criticisms was on family reunification.  There was a view that the Refugee Act 1996 contained a stronger right to family reunification.  While it has been addressed to some extent, the 2015 Act contained a more stringent and difficult test.  There was also a feeling arising from the discussion that discretion, where it was used, was being exercised in a limited way.  Obviously INIS has certain rules and views on certain jurisdictions and so on.  One example was given of a decision where somebody who was well-established and had employment received a letter from INIS in 2015.  The person's application for a visa for his or her parents was refused despite the father being in the later stages of Alzheimer's.  INIS questioned the degree of destruction in Syria stating it was noted that central Damascus had been relatively unscathed by the war in Syria.  I found it incredible when I read it.  The witnesses will not necessarily be familiar with that case.  It is possible it was appealed further.  I was not dealing with it directly.  It was evidence that was given to the committee.  The report also found there was an almost adversarial approach to the people who make applications.  The chief executive of Nasc said the International Protection Act 2015 means many refugees will have to move from the refugee family reunification process to the immigration framework.  Under the framework, of every ten applications eight will be refused.  It is not a specific question but I would like the witnesses to respond to it.  There was a view that, procedure aside, the approach in the default position is more adversarial and more in favour of refusal than of approval.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1054" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kirrane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018071100002#O01600"><p>The changes that were made in the 2015 Act brought us into line with the rest of Europe and are more favourable than many other European countries because since the Act was introduced some countries have tightened their procedures even further.  We are no more than in line with the rest of Europe on family reunification.  Having said that, the Minister recognised there were particular circumstances in war-torn countries.  That is why in recent times he has introduced a new humanitarian family unification programme specifically aimed at those countries.  That scheme opened recently.  There will be a total of 530 approvals given under that scheme.  It will be done in a series of applications over the next year.  The first round of those applications has just closed now and we will be evaluating them.  There is a recognition by the Minister that there are a particular set of circumstances in war-torn countries where there is a need to respond in a humanitarian way as distinct from the standard process that exists under the International Protection Act.  That is how that has been responded to.  It is something we welcome and our approach is not a default position of saying no.  If it was, we would not have a scheme like this in operation.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Merriman want to add anything further to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1055" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Merriman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018071100002#O01700"><p>It is important to note there is the non-EEA policy document.  If one runs out of time to get one's family reunified, there are other means open.  Everybody confines the discussion to the family reunification provisions of the Act, which are, as the director general has said, much more generous and facilitative than those of many of our European counterparts.  One gets a year after the final decision to apply for family reunification.  Beyond that, applicants can use the non-EEA policy document which will allow people to come to visit them.</p><p>That is underused.  In respect of law, there has been a lot of discussion about prescribing things in law.  That limits the discretion the Minister may have.  We are all hearing of specific cases in respect of people coming from war-torn areas and areas of conflict that law would not address but which discretion would.  Ireland is pretty unique at this stage in coming forward with the Irish humanitarian admissions programme, IHAP, under which the Minister may exercise his discretion in respect of people who are beyond that 12-month limit or who are not covered by the International Protection Act 2015 such as, for example, grandparents who have been left in war-torn areas or orphaned nieces or nephews who are not qualified under the International Protection Act.  They are now qualified under IHAP and the Minister is in a position to use his discretion in that regard.  That is a unique and welcome development in our approach to these serious humanitarian issues that are brought to our attention.</p></speech>

I am aware of the scheme but this decision was obviously taken before it came into effect.  One would imagine that discretion would have been beneficial in the circumstances outlined, at that stage at least.  As I have said, it may have been appealed but at that stage it was felt that the application for family reunification was not well founded.  There is something that needs to be kept under review there.  The criticism has been made by some of the NGOs that an adversarial approach exists.  That is worth deliberating on and considering.</p> <p>  I have a final set of questions, which I will ask together.  There is crossover with the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, in these questions but I would like the witnesses to answer as well as they can.  Two specific points relating to direct provision were raised recently.  By and large I welcome the decision to opt into the recast reception conditions directive but there are still issues in respect of direct provision.  One relates to a reception centre - I believe it is in Newbridge but I am not totally sure - and the prohibition of the use of phones and electronic devices after a certain time.  That seems very restrictive.  This is not meant to be a location of detention or anything like that.  People should have liberty and flexibility to do things like that.  </p> <p>  There is a more serious issue.  I grant this is not properly corroborated so if this is not the case, this is an opportunity to put the record right.  There was some speculation that residents in direct provision centres may not have access to free drinking water at all times and they may have to purchase drinking water.  I accept that some of the reports on Twitter were withdrawn or something similar.  I am providing an opportunity to clarify the issue.  If that is not the case, the witnesses should take the opportunity to put it right because it is important that they do so.</p> <p>  My final two questions are on a different area.  I ask the witnesses to respond to them all together.  They relate to the North and issues in respect of applications for visas there.  I have two different examples.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Members of the Legislative Assembly in the North are becoming aware of cases of non-EU citizens who are resident in the North and are seeking naturalisation as Irish citizens and who have children who are Irish citizens.  Their children have Irish passports and were born on this island, but the parents were not.  They are non-EU citizens.  They are having significant difficulty in naturalising as Irish citizens despite the fact that their children are Irish citizens and are entitled to an Irish passport.  </p> <p>  The second issue relates to an Irish citizen who was seeking a visa for their partner to live in the North.  This person is an Irish citizen but I understand the person was asked to get a British passport in order to get a visa for their partner.  That second case may cross over with British jurisdiction and so on but what ties the cases together and what seems to be unclear is the issue of Irish citizenship.  People are entitled to it but how do they vindicate that right?  Aside from the passport, how does somebody who was born in the North vindicate his or her right to Irish citizenship?  That seems to be a theme tying the issues together.  I can clarify that further if the witnesses need me to.</p></speech>

The rules are not designed to be restrictive but to recognise that other residents exist in the centre and that they are entitled to their quietness and privacy after certain times of the day.  Any complaints of that nature can be dealt with under the new directive.  There is a basis for doing that.  The other thing is that the Ombudsman can now investigate any complaints in respect of the operation of a centre.  The Ombudsman for Children can also investigate any changes.  I am not directly responsible for the direct provision system or for the Reception and Integration Agency, but I know from talking to my colleagues that they are balancing the rights of other residents to quiet and so on with everybody else's rights.  That is what they are constantly trying to do.  It is not about trying to prevent people from carrying on their normal lives in a normal manner.  On the issue of access to water, I became aware of this some time last weekend.  As far as I am aware, everybody is absolutely astounded by this.  The idea that anybody does not have access to drinking water is a complete anathema to us.</p></speech>

They have to fulfil the residency requirements in the exact same way as people living here are asked to produce evidence that they have been resident in the State for particular time.  It is total of five years, the first four of which can be spread over an eight-year period and the final year of which has to be permanent residency.  The way in which we ask people to verify that is through their immigration permission.  In the North of Ireland that immigration permission comes from the UK immigration authorities.  We seek that information from the applicant.  In our case we would have that information from our own records but in the North we do not because applications for residency in Northern Ireland are dealt with by the UK Home Office.  That is where we sometimes find delays in getting that information back.  We do not treat anybody any differently regardless of whether they are in the South or in the North.  In respect of visas for non-nationals, I am not quite sure I understand the difficulty.  Any application for a visa from the North would normally be made through our London office and we do not have any backlogs of visa cases in that office.</p></speech>

I do not need a response on this but I do think further consideration is required.  Mr. Kirrane is saying that the approach is not different.

I have so many questions that I wish this meeting could continue for longer than proposed.  I accept that it is not the witnesses' fault, but this is the second high-powered delegation we have met from the Department of Justice and Equality that is all male.  As I said, it is not their fault.  However, it is clearly a reflection of the position of women in terms of the upper echelons of the organisation.  It is a matter that has to be raised and addressed.</p> <p>  My questions are a little bit eclectic but they relate to the areas we are discussing, many of which, I believe, are hugely problematic.  I accept that a number of answers have already been given.  However, some of my questions are new and others touch on points raised by previous speakers.  In terms of asylum and direct provision and the points made about backlogs and so on, one could be led to believe that we are dealing with gigantic numbers.  In reality, they are actually tiny.  Between 2008 and 2016, Ireland had the second lowest rating in terms of granting asylum across the EU, well below the average.  In a 12-year period, 87% of asylum applications were denied.  During that time, under 2,000 people were given asylum in the first instance, which is incredible.  We are talking about very low numbers.  Why do we refuse so many?  When I have previously asked that question the standard response has been that a lot of the applications received are from non-conflict areas such as Georgia.  This is not true.  Ireland rejected 69% of people from Somalia, 88% from the Congo, which has experienced two decades of war, 71% from Afghanistan, 63% from Palestine, 94% from Angola and 55% from Iraq.  Will the witnesses provide an explanation for this?  How confident are they in terms of the systems, attitudes and approaches of the Irish asylum system that we are safeguarding people's rights, or is there some cultural problem such that they feel they have to keep the numbers low?  Those figures do not add up.  </p> <p>  Linked to asylum is the single procedure to speed up the process.  This has been in place for a year and a half.  What proportion of people have been in direct provision for more than two years since the introduction of the single procedure?</p></speech>

A lot of our statistics related to first instance decisions purely in regard to the first aspect, which, because we did not have a single procedure, was not comparable with what was happening in the rest of Europe.  Earlier in the discussion, the chief international protection officer outlined the current recognition rates, which take into account the single procedure and the fact that we are looking at all three aspects at the same time.  I will ask Mr. Costello to elaborate further because those numbers are comparable with the rest of our European colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Costello" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018071100002#Q00800"><p>The Deputy is correct that in the past recognition rates have been very low but there has been considerable investment made in terms of quality and training.  The UNHCR has a section in my office.  The staff are there three or four days a week.  We also have all sorts of standard templates for making decisions and guidance notes, which take on board all UNHCR best practice.  The result of this has been a significant increase in recognition rates.  The recognition rates are a factor of the nature of cases as well in that an applicant must satisfy the criteria and the legislation to be either a refugee or to be entitled to subsidiarity protection.  The recognition rates for 2017, excluding relocation, was 21% and, excluding relocation, was 50%.  Thus far in 2018, the recognition rate, excluding relocation, is 27% .  Including relocation - these are the people coming from Greece - it is 43%.  We are seeing a lot of applicants from Syria.  There is a 100% recognition rate for Syria.  Everyone who has come in under the relocation programme has been granted international protection.  Approximately 1,000 plus grants have been given out in the last couple of years because the applicants satisfy the criteria.  Similarly, applicants from other countries such as Eritrea, which have large refugee generating backgrounds, are granted refugee status as well.</p> <p>  The UNHCR sits on a quality committee with us, which meets every six weeks and reviews a proportion of the decisions made in the previous six weeks with a view to identifying problems and what lessons need to be learned.  It also reviews the position regard decisions of ours overturned by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal from the point of view of whether we got it wrong and what we can do about feeding that back into the process; and what we can learn from court judgments.  In respect of my office, there are not many court judgments because as our quality has improved we do not have a lot of judicial reviews.  All of this work is fed to our case workers through training development.  I think I can give a guarantee that we have improved the system substantially.  The UNHCR works closely with us.  All of the staff training is done by UNHCR international experts.  We are doing our best to continue along the road to having a good system.  European Union countries are coming to us seeking examples of our guidance and templates as international best practice, which did not happen before.  Whereas years ago we used to go elsewhere to seek examples of how we could improve our system, countries are now coming to us.  There are still many challenges to overcome but we are doing our best to continue to improve the quality of the system.</p></speech>

I am happy to analyse Mr. Costello's answers as progress is made going forward.</p> <p>  The issue of delays in processing applications was raise by other members.  I accept that there are many reasons for the delays in different categories.  Citizenship applications can take six months to one year to process.  Will the witnesses talk us through the processing of an application for citizenship from a person who has lived in this country for years and is married to an Irish person?  Why do such applications take so long?  What causes such an application to take six to 12 months to process?  I will give an example of a specific case.  This person has lived in Ireland for 15 years and was informed in May 2016 that he was being granted citizenship and was invited to attend the ceremony.</p><p>A couple of days before the ceremony, he received a letter which stated that it had been withdrawn because people must be of good character and that inquiries were being made.  So, obviously, he was a bit shocked by that.  Some 18 months later, there is still nothing more on that.  This person has three children and has not seen his parents since 2003.  None of his children have met their grandparents.  Until he gets a decision, he has no travel document.  Why is this good character aspect not sorted out before somebody is invited to a citizenship ceremony?  When these cases are messed up - I assume that is what happened here - is there any accountability in respect of staff in that situation?  Mr. Kirrane will probably state that new information came to light because I have submitted some parliamentary questions on this matter.  I could accept that to a point.  How in God's name does it take 18 months to review the new information?  Is the applicant entitled to that information because, if so, he has not received it?  He does not know what it is.  There is no accountability, which seems hugely problematic, so I would like some information regarding that type of scenario.</p><p> A case that really annoyed me involved what I would describe as the efforts of the Department to prevent a young Syrian woman from being reunited with her sick mother and siblings.  The behaviour of the staff handling that application over 14 months resulted in the family having to remain in limbo in Greece for a period way beyond what was necessary.  The types of issues the person was refused on included the fact that the authorities in Greece, for whom English is not their first language, had put on the form that the woman was a recognised refugee.  She was legally resident in Ireland but on a different basis.  It was just a language thing that could have been corrected easily.  The application was delayed for months because of that.  In these scenarios, is there a culture of resistance to facilitating refugees?  How are staff trained to deal with cases of that nature?  The case in question concerned somebody being obtuse and ludicrous in the sense that the woman was legally resident here and it was a mistake that could have been easily corrected by a letter.  Was the staff member corrected?  What sort of training are staff being given?</p><p> I am curious about some of the language in Mr. Kirrane's opening statement.  He indicated that INIS works with people to produce decisions for those co-operating with the system.  "Co-operating" is an unusual word.  Sometimes people cannot furnish documents through no fault of their own.  What does co-operating mean in that sense?  To me, a term like "non-complex cases" is better phraseology.  When used in a particular way, the term "co-operating" has a certain connotation.  When Mr. Kirrane deals with that, could he also tell me how many of the 800 staff are located in offices outside Ireland or is that a different staff complement?</p><p> In respect of the eight-week short stay tourist, the website says someone has to wait eight weeks to get their documents, which, presumably, is somebody's passport.  Eight weeks is an incredibly long period for somebody to be without a passport.  I visited Africa this year.  It took seven days to turn around this stuff.  It takes eight weeks to do so here.  That seems crazy, particularly in the context of a tourist or holiday visa.  Could Mr. Kirrane deal with those questions together?</p></speech>

That is our target.  Obviously, we have resource constraints and I have to balance those resources across the entire immigration system.  It is not a matter of simply stating that I can put resources towards increasing the processing of one type of application over another.  I have to balance that across the entire system.</p> <p>  In respect of individual cases, I am aware of a small number of cases, to which the Deputy has alluded, where the answer to the parliamentary question was that additional information came to light on the individual case.  That can happen.  In those circumstances, it can take a long time to follow up and investigate those type of circumstances.  I cannot get into detail on individual cases and I am sure the Chairman will appreciate that.  Sometimes those checks are not dependent on this jurisdiction.  It may not be directly within our control in the context of what INIS does; it may be dependent on additional information from other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

We talked about discretion.  This is somebody who, up to that point, had lived in Ireland for 15 years, who had no problems here because he had been granted citizenship and who has no access to that new information.  For 18 months, this person has been told that INIS has some new information but that it will not tell him what it is, that it is off investigating the new information with somebody else and that it might get back to him in a couple of years when his children are graduating.  That does not make sense.  Should the person not have a right to access that information?</p></speech>

Mr. Kirrane does not have to provide lengthy answers.  </p> <p>  I am a little worried about the family reunification process and the after effects.  I will use one case to illustrate the point.  A person is given one year to get here.  He or she comes from a war-torn area.  In the case of an unaccompanied minor whose mother and junior sibling have been given permission to come to Ireland, everyone is delighted, but how will she get here?  Where will she live and where are the supports available?  I am aware of one case in which the clock is ticking.  The decision was made in January and the permission will soon run out, but no one has any idea where this woman is going to live.  The Red Cross or some other organisation is trying to organise her travel, but there is no accommodation available.  Does one just transplant a family from the Middle East and place them in County Donegal?  The woman in question has not seen her son for years, but we expect them to rejoin family life and that everything will be fine.  Who joins the dots?  If accommodation has not been found, should there not be something in place like the arrangements which have been made for Syrians?  I refer to the accommodation provided in Monasterevin where they get to know Ireland, learn English and meet people.  It is an integration centre, rather than direct provision accommodation.  Should we not make the same provision for family reunification?  It seems bizarre that we do not.  What happens when the 12-month period runs out, as it appears it might in this case?  The young teenager in question is waiting for his mother to come and the delay is not their fault.  What will happen in that case?</p></speech>

I am not quite sure I understand where the one year issue comes in.  Once an application has been decided on, there is no time limit as to when the transfer of the family takes place.  It is not a question of the permission being withdrawn or anything at the end of the year.  There is permission once the decision is made.</p></speech>

I will move on.  </p> <p>  There were huge concerns about the quality of IPO 2 forms released in January 2017.  A number of nationalities said someone had put them together using Google Translate and that they were completely wrong from a language point of view.  The Minister told me in reply to parliamentary questions that the company involved had not been paid at the time and that any payment would reflect the poor quality of service in a number of languages in which the form had been published.  Was the money withheld from the service provider by the IPO as a consequence of the problems with the forms it had translated?  What proportion of the money was withheld?  I presume the Department will not use the company again.</p> <p>  Immigration consultants have made an appearance in this area.  We are told that a number of former GNIB officers have set themselves up as immigration consultants to advise undocumented person on how to have their status regularised.  Some of them charge well above the odds and promote themselves as special insiders who can get someone in.  That is a matter of concern.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on it and the INIS has stated it is not its problem, that it is a private matter.  It does not seem right that former immigration officers, garda&iacute;, would make money in this way.  Would it be prudent for the INIS to place a restriction on staff who have left from working as immigration consultants, at least until there is some regulation in the area?  Is it something at which the INIS would look?  Is our source correct in saying the INIS is not accepting applications from so-called "consultants"?  Is the service aware of this general problem?</p></speech>

I am aware of a number of retired garda&iacute; who may have worked in the immigration area who are established in that field.  We operate a policy that we do not deal directly with immigration consultants.  We will take an application received but correspond directly with the applicant.  We do not engage with immigration consultants.  The vast majority of cases involve legal representatives and we deal with the solicitor assigned to a particular case, whether by the Legal Aid Board or privately by applicants.  We do not engage directly with immigration consultants and have no plans to do so.  Whether people working in this field should be regulated and who should regulate them are complex issues.  Certainly, we have not looked at the issue from an immigration perspective.  It is complex to consider whether one should deprive someone of his or her livelihood or how controls could be put around it.</p></speech>

The first involves statistics for immigration enforcement.  </p> <p>  In its concluding observations on the second periodic review of Ireland the UN Committee Against Torture requested the State to provide it with data in the next periodic review for the countries of origin of persons denied leave to land and the point of embarkation for the state party to which they were returned.  The Minister told us in February that Ireland would be in a position to respond well in advance of the next periodic review.  From work done by others, some of the information has been obtained.  We know that the number of non-EU citizens refused entry to Ireland doubled between 2013 and 2016, to 3,950.</p><p>Between January and September of 2017, 2,600 people were denied entry.  Between 2008 and 2016, 2,135 citizens from areas of conflict or humanitarian concern, for example, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Eritrea and Libya, were refused entry.  Perhaps some of the issues I raised in my first question have been corrected.  If so, confirmation will do.</p><p> When will the UN Convention against Torture, UNCAT, recommendation regarding data publication be implemented?  Are there plans to produce written guidance on refusing people entry at ports and airports, particularly people from conflict zones?  What assurance can Mr. Kirrane provide that such people are given every opportunity to try to assert whatever asylum claims they might have before being deported, for example, translators, liaison officers and so on?  Of those refused leave to land, how many are subsequently given the opportunity, if necessary, to claim asylum or a right to appeal?  I refer to a right to appeal in such a scenario.</p><p> Regarding immigrants' rights, section 60 of the Data Protection Act allows the Minister to devise regulations restricting the rights accruing to individuals under Article 12.  The British Government's proposal in this regard has caused major upheaval in the UK.  One MP has made the point that such a restriction would render it impossible for individuals involved in immigration disputes to get access to their personal information from the Home Office, making it difficult for them to resolve their problems.  In the Irish context, which of the rights under Articles 12 to 22 will be restricted for the purpose of ensuring the effective operation of the immigration system?  Presumably, INIS is being consulted on this matter.  If not, I will take that answer and address it with the Minister.  What is the thinking on the Data Protection Act in this regard and has INIS been consulted?</p><p> I am probably pronouncing it incorrectly but my final major question is on the Luximon judgment, which related to the rights of people who came to Ireland before 2011 on student visas and stayed after their visas had expired.  The Government changed the rules in 2011 in order that people who now come to Ireland on student visas can only stay for seven years.  Obviously, some people have been timed out.  The courts decided that the Minister should have considered the right to a private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights when considering applications for a change of status - for example, from student to stamp 4 - and leave to remain, and that people could not be booted out unceremoniously.  The State seemed to fight the case every step of the way.  The implications of the three court judgments is that we must introduce a new scheme.  These are hard-working people who have been in Ireland for ten years or longer but they have been kept in limbo.</p><p> We had been told that INIS was going to introduce a scheme to deal with applicants in this category until the Minister changed the scheme in late 2017 and that that work had since been put on hold.  Was that the case and, if so, why?  Why was the High Court's judgment in 2015 ignored?  By rights, INIS should have been processing the hundreds of cases affected but intransigence in this regard meant the appeals process was slowed down and complicated further.</p><p> Given that INIS lost in the High Court and the Court of Appeal, why was a scheme not ready to go in April when the Supreme Court judgment was handed down?  Surely it knew that it would lose?  Why was the decision even challenged at that stage?  Three years had passed since the High Court judgment and people were still waiting.  Is that acceptable?  Will Mr. Kirrane provide a solid date for when a scheme to process these applicants will be introduced, putting an end to their misery?  I am concerned that it reflects badly on an attitude that seems to exist, one that is not welcoming or facilitative of applicants.  It is blatantly obstructionist, putting people down rabbit holes and sending them around in circles.  The inordinate delays in every facet of this process may stem from this attitude rather than anything else.  I do not know.  I do not have an answer to it but I would be keen to hear Mr. Kirrane's thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

In terms of leave to land, the numbers have increased but so has the annual throughput of passengers into and out of the country.  The projections for Dublin Airport are for 32 million passenger movements this year.  It was only a few short years ago when that figure was 19 million.  When one maps the increased throughput of passengers with the increase in the number of refusals, they are pretty much in line.  It is not the case that there has suddenly been a change in policy in INIS or among immigration officers at airports to refuse more people.  Before staff get to the front line, they spend approximately six weeks training in how to determine precisely which cases do and do not qualify for leave to land.  There are a myriad of reasons for people being refused leave to land, for example, people not having visas or documentation but somehow managing to board aircraft at the other end or significant evidence that their purpose is not to come to Ireland but to use the common travel area to get to the UK etc.</p> <p>  If someone who is seeking international protection claims asylum, he or she is immediately sent to the accommodation centre in Balseskin, his or her preliminary details are taken and his or her application is processed.  That has always been the case; there is no change in how that system operates.</p></speech>

One is in regard to Article 8 rights. We are complying with the judgment and our intention is to consider Article 8 rights in those circumstances where there has been a change of status from one point to the other.  We are considering that in terms of refining our processes and how best we can do that.  Our argument to the court was that we always did an Article 8 rights consideration before a decision was taken on whether somebody was allowed to remain in the State or a deportation order was issued.  The courts found that we should do an Article 8 rights consideration in other circumstances where there is a change of status and we will be complying with that.</p> <p>  Regarding the individual cases, I cannot give a date as to when we will do this.  We are seeking legal advice regarding the judgment and how we will deal with these cases.  I do not want to pre-empt what that decision will be because it is up to the Minister and the Government to make that call.  I cannot give the Deputy a definitive deadline at this point in time but we are actively looking at it and it is something that is very much high on our agenda.</p></speech>

For Mr. Kirrane to say it is something he is looking at is no consolation to the people concerned.  We are not going to get agreement on this and I would simply make that point.  This is bizarre.  It seems some of the reasons there are problems in the area is that we are being obstructionist on issues.  Everybody else is looking on and saying INIS has to address this but rather than addressing it, it spent ages fighting the need to address it, which delayed its chances of implementing something that probably could have been implemented far easier if it had come up with what it will have to come up with in any event.  Now that it has come to practically the end of the line on that, I am shocked that Mr. Kirrane still is saying we are looking at that or it is not so straightforward but it actually is, in respect of what the courts have told INIS.  There needs to be a scheme to deal with this.</p></speech>

Our intention is that a new website will go live in the first quarter of next year.  In the meantime, we are taking some steps to address it.  We have considered our printed forms first.  Each division within INIS is going through those and has been given plain language guidance on how to restructure all the forms.  They are all being made to look the same in order that people who have applied previously under one scheme will be familiar with the forms when they reach them again.  That has almost being dealt with.  We have about four forms left to do and we will have those completed over the summer.  We will then turn to the content on the website.  We can redesign the website and that is fine but the content is the critical element.  We have put together a communications network within INIS that has representatives from every business area within INIS.  The National Adult Literacy Agency has been brought in to do plain language training with that whole cohort.  That training has gone very well.  I heard there is huge appetite among the staff for this.  They acknowledge we are getting more queries because our website is not clearer.  The intention is that from the autumn on, we will start getting new content ready and when the new website goes live in the first quarter, it will go live with up-to-date and accessible information for all our customers.</p><p>The last piece, which goes alongside that, is a shift from paper forms, which leads to other processing difficulties.  We are a very paper-heavy organisation so we are shifting our forms online.  We have a project live at present.  The first two forms will go online, we hope, in late September, possibly early October.  Then the intention is that between that point and the end of 2019, every single one of our forms will transition online and be accompanied by clear, accessible guidance as to how they should be completed.</p></speech>

I am conscious they have been here for three hours now and have answered many questions so I will not ask them questions which have already been asked.

In light of the current growth of the Irish economy, does Mr. Kirrane think the programme is still needed?</p></speech>

One of the reasons for our review, which will take place in the second half of this year, is to look at that precise question.  We have moved the focus of it away from enterprise and job creation in recent years to social housing, primary healthcare centres and nursing homes because there is a perceived shortage of those types of facilities in the State at present.  That is where the focus is now.  There is also an endowment part of the programme, which, regardless of the outcome of the review, I would see continuing because it is effectively a donation of money for charitable purposes to the State, and it would be hard to argue against the benefit of that directly to the State on that basis.</p></speech>

The scheme is not there for the benefit of the applicant; it is there to provide benefits to the State.  We have moved where we have targeted those benefits over the period, so if a point is reached at which those benefits do not outweigh the value of the immigration permission, one would have to question its continuance.</p></speech>

That problem seems to have been resolved, and the biggest threat facing the economy now, I would have thought, is gaining access to skilled labour for the construction, hospitality and services sectors.  I am conscious the witnesses are policy advisers, not policy-makers, but does Mr. Kirrane not think the State should concentrate its schemes more on trying to attract skilled labour than trying to attract capital?</p></speech>

The investor programme is always looked on as a bit of a niche offering to address particular areas where it is seen that there would be benefits to the State arising from them.  I am not sure how attracting skilled workers would dovetail with an immigrant investor scheme.  We would need to think about that.</p></speech>

The data was for 2016.  The current breakdown has increased significantly over the past year.  I can get those figures for the committee.  Grouping together nursing homes, primary care centres and social housing, of the total of 708 applications since the start of the scheme, 326 have amounted to &euro;244 million, and there has been &euro;507 million of investment.  In terms of investment and the number of applications, roughly half are now in those areas.  That is representative of the total since the scheme started.

Therefore, the vast majority of applications are only coming up for review at this stage because, looking at the profile, the numbers from 2012 to 2016 were very small.

I wish to raise a number of matters.  I will avoid repetition as best I can.</p> <p>  The citizenship section has recently decided that periods of absence from the State - and we are talking about periods in excess of six weeks per year - will be deducted from people's reckonable residence.  This means that if they have lived here for five years but have spent, say, seven weeks in one of those years visiting family or a dying relative or for some other purpose or reason - all verifiable, I am sure - INIS will nevertheless consider that they have lived here for four years and 45 weeks only.  I find it difficult to understand the purpose behind this decision.  It may reduce the number of naturalisation certificates granted at any given time but certainly slows up the process because they do not qualify in terms of the period for assessment and acceptance.</p><p>Could Mr. Kirrane offer a reason INIS has adopted this position on that relatively new ruling?</p></speech>

The Act is fairly clear in terms of what it sets out.  It looks for a permanent residency for all of the previous year and the exception is given on an administrative basis by the Minister that he will allow for a period of six weeks to be excluded from that in considering the decision.  That has always been the case.  That was to cater for people going back on holidays over the period of time.  It is not the case that the rule is that we are introducing a six weeks period that is excluded.  It is that we are allowing, beyond what is in the Act, a period of six weeks for people to cater for removal, if they want to go back on holidays, etc.</p> <p>  We do look at individual cases.  Where, for example, particularly with the mobility of the workforce in more recent times, people may have need to go abroad to do some work for a period of time in that last year, we take that into account.  Ultimately, we are not there to stop people from getting citizenship but, equally, we must apply the law.  That is part of what we do.  We try to be reasonable about that, and that is where the six week period came in.  That is not something new.  This has always been the case.</p></speech>

First, it is set down in EU law.  It is not determined under Irish law.  There are two different types of category.  There are what are known as qualifying family members and there are permitted family members.  Qualifying family members are immediate spouse and children and permitted family members are wider relations, whether they be nieces, cousins, uncles, grandparents, etc.  They are dealt with separately under EU treaty rights and the extent of rights under each of those categories is set down in EU law.</p></speech>

I emphasise I am talking about renewing applications for permission to remain as the spouse of an Irish national.  I know of one case where the applicant has been waiting nine months for a decision.

Earlier we were talking about increases in our staff levels.  That particular area is one that is being targeted for new staff and additional staff to be assigned for processing.</p> <p>  As I stated earlier, without the individual case it is difficult to know why it might take that long but our aim is to get that processing time down very quickly.  Indeed, we are reorganising our structure to dedicate processing headed by a separate principal officer to deal with national-type immigration schemes, which would include spouse of an Irish national and a whole lot of others, separate from EU treaty rights cases because of the volume of increase that has occurred across those two areas in the past while.</p></speech>

It is an actual case that I reference.  These are people just like all of us here and it is having a most deleterious impact on their lives.  In my view, it is without justification.  All of the assessment, analysis and examination has been done previously.  This is a renewal yet nine months later it cannot be approved, at least at this point.  It beggars belief.</p> <p>  Mr. Kirrane brought up the issue of staffing.  I note, from Mr. Kirrane's opening statement, he gives an outline of the staffing numbers.  He stated that there are 55 contracted members of the IPO case processing panel all of whom work on a part-time basis.  Why would that be the case?  Is that part of the difficulty?  I presume these contracted members are not part of INIS's full-time core staff.  What steps is Mr. Kirrane taking to address this?  I beg Mr. Kirrane's pardon; he stated, in that regard, that further staff will be appointed in the coming period.  As for the 55 contracted members of the IPO case processing panel, why is INIS outsourcing instead of recruiting directly when it has a particular problem?  Even as an interim measure, should these particular employees be taken on board on more than a part-time basis?</p></speech>

The panel members recruited are generally solicitors or barristers who have particular expertise in this area.  They do not particularly want to work full-time on this and they may continue their practice in other areas.  The model considered best to deal with this, therefore, was by engaging the panel on a case-by-case basis, and they are paid on a case-by-case basis.  That is considered to be the best way of dealing with it.  The individual cases are signed off by a permanent civil servant in accordance with the Act.  The intention is to recruit further members of the panel.  It is not a question of the panel members being constrained in terms of processing times, but Mr. Costello will outline further detail on that.</p></speech>

Most of the 130 people working in the office are civil servants.  Many people on the panel work in the Four Courts doing other work.  They could be involved in planning law or human rights law and the only way we could encourage people to apply for a panel was to offer them flexibility.  Some members of the panel work in the office all day, every day but the vast majority leave and come back.  However, they commit to doing at least three interviews a week, which is what we want them to do, and to provide the relevant follow-up reports.  It was just a matter of flexibility.</p> <p>  Similarly, we are running a competition to recruit more people.  There has been a fair amount of interest in that but if I was to say I wanted full-time people with legal qualifications to come in under this contract for service, I would not get them because some of them are doing other jobs and want to continue to do them and then come to work for us on a fee per case basis.  There are strict rules within the contract about conflicts of interest and so on.  They must declare them, but we felt this was the most flexible way to use people to ensure we met our scheduling and interviewing requirements.</p></speech>

The work is so complex it can take two to three months before someone is capable of being let loose on their own, although some people get to that point quicker than others.  It is about recruitment and quality training but also recognising that output will not increase overnight when we get new people because there is a lead-in time for them to become familiar with the job.</p></speech>

In 2015, it was 38 months; at the end of 2017, it was 23 months.  Our intention is to continue to reduce that.  A tiny percentage of applicants who are in direct provision more than three years have not had a first instance decision.  The intention is to reduce that number to ensure the same percentage applies for those who are two years in direct provision and, eventually, get to the point where, at the end of next year, a first instance decision is given within nine months.</p> <p>  The other indicator I would give the Chairman is that despite taking on board the 3,500 cases we mentioned during the transition arrangements under the Act, we have reached a point where we are processing more cases than there are new cases entering the system.  That, by definition, will reduce the time it takes for cases to be processed.</p></speech>

I continue to engage, with colleagues in my own office, with our local support group.  We have a direct provision centre in my home town and I am conscious of the circumstances they have to face each day.</p><p>In his preamble, referencing the Act, Mr. Kirrane stated: &quot;It introduced a single application procedure in the protection process with the key aim of identifying those eligible for protection at a much earlier stage and ensuring that those found not to have a protection need can be returned to their country of origin in a timely and humane manner.&quot;  I would have liked to have seen a sentence that referenced those who were not being returned in a timely and humane manner and that people were being looked after, processed and provided for in a timely and humane manner.  It would be remiss of me if I did not tell the officials that those involved in the voluntary community action and support for people in direct provision in my home town, which is a host community, find the slowness of the system unacceptable.  Some would use other language such as dilatory <i>et al</i>.  I have heard it all and engage with it regularly.  There is great vexation and frustration about that and we would fail in our duty if we did not properly reflect that to the officials.  We are talking about people here.</p><p>While there are some voices I strongly disagree with or totally disapprove of, the overwhelming majority in my community are supportive, welcoming and anxious to see people treated as they would wish for themselves or their families in any comparable situation globally.  That, sadly, is not the experience in the service.  This, as was said, is related to recruitment and everything else.  We need to reach a point where the targets set are met within the timeframe set.  There can be no drift on that.  This committee will certainly take a keen interest in it.</p><p> Let me finish before letting Deputy Chambers back in.  Deputy Daly referred to a case concerning cancellation after notification to present for a ceremony of naturalisation involving the presentation of certificates.  I do not know who present is aware of an individual I have been representing whose case I brought to the Minister's attention in writing only some time ago.  His ceremony was cancelled not only once but twice.  It is incredible that somebody could be invited to a ceremony in the full understanding that he would be gifted with naturalisation, only to have the invitation withdrawn and be told not to present.  Some time later, the individual received a new invitation to a second ceremony, but this was followed by yet another cancellation.  What does that say to the person and the community to which he belongs?  Those concerned are all part of little communities in which they fraternise, engage with one another and take strength from one another.  On behalf of the person in the case in question, I am so vexed.  It is deplorable to do to anybody what was done.</p><p> I engaged with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to whom the immigration service is responsible, and provided to him the full details, facts and evidence in this particular case.  He advised me &mdash; I am saying this on public record &mdash; that an apology will have to be issued in this instance.  I do even have an acknowledgment of that representation as I sit here facing the officials today.  I know the Minister has engaged with them or their staff, yet the gentleman I have represented and I, as an elected public representative and Chairman of this committee, have not even been extended the courtesy of an acknowledgement, never mind an explanation, despite the Minister saying an apology was required in this case.  When will this case be addressed substantively and resolved?  I hope that the gentleman in question will be lucky on the third occasion and that there will be no more messing about in this instance.</p></speech>

It is not that we are trying to put obstacles in the way of any individual applicant.  The figures speak for themselves.  It is not taken likely that somebody would issue a withdrawal of an offer for citizenship.  It is because some further investigation is needed.  I undertake to the Chairman that I will follow up on the case in question and revert to him directly.</p></speech>

I understand from the anomaly in the interpretations of the immigration service and the Central Bank that money might have been invested in a fund created for the visa but that the subsequent investment might not have occurred or have been progressed.

That would be a better way of ensuring transparency and protection for the people on the executive board rather than having question marks over who is on it or not, or over the personnel requirements.  The PAS and other public service bodies name people on individual boards and if people seek to influence them, they may be automatically excluded.  That would be a way to stop anyone from trying to exert inappropriate influence.  It would also address any questions that might arise over transparency.  That is just a suggestion.</p><p>There could be a strong protocol around that.  The public knows that Mr. Kirrane is a member but does not know who else is.

On COM (2018) 275, it is proposed that there are no subsidiarity concerns with this proposal and that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On COM (2018) 286, it was agreed that there are no subsidiarity concerns with this proposal.  It was also agreed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It was agreed to seek a detailed briefing from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority as to the implications of this proposal, that is, its impact on hauliers and other professional drivers; level of engagement with relevant stakeholders; cost implications for consumers.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On COM (2018) 315, it is proposed that there are no subsidiarity concerns with this proposal and that it does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On COM (2018) 397, it is proposed that there are no subsidiarity concerns with this proposal and that it does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next measure is COM (2018) 277.  This proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  It was agreed that the committee agree a report under D&aacute;il Standing Order 114 and Seanad Standing Order 116 containing a reasoned opinion in section 4 that outlines why the committee believes that the proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  It was agreed that the committee recommend a reasoned opinion contained in section 4 of the report for agreement by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In addition, it was agreed that this proposal be retained for further scrutiny.  It was agreed to request a detailed briefing from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the legislative, administrative and practical implications arising from this proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p> The next measure is COM (2018) 274.  It is proposed that there are no subsidiarity concerns.  It is proposed, however, that this proposal warrants further scrutiny and that the committee seeks a detailed note from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport addressing its implications, including the application of a fully standardised methodology for all roads.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next measure is COM (2018) 278.  It is proposed that there are no subsidiarity concerns and that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, it is proposed to request the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to keep the committee advised as to the compatibility of Ireland's national single window with any proposed European maritime single window, EMSW, environment.  Is that agreed?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018071100002#D01400"><p>I thank members for being present to discuss what everybody recognises is a vital piece of national infrastructure.  It is correctly being examined by this committee, because without it we would lack connectivity which we need so badly.  I have arranged a full briefing for members by my officials tomorrow if they want to get into the detail.  They have all been notified of that.</p> <p>  The second runway is an important national transport project, which of raises a range of complex issues about sustainable and balanced national development, the future needs of our economy and a booming population, global connectivity and environmental protection.  It involves difficult choices and decisions.  Delivering major infrastructure often means the need for compromise.  </p> <p>  If Dublin Airport, which is reaching capacity, is to service the needs of our island nation, it needs another runaway.  Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has started work on it, and as the committee recently heard from the new DAA chairman, Mr. Basil Geoghegan, all going to plan, it will be ready by late 2021, with construction to begin early next year.  </p> <p>  There are complicating issues, which were recently raised with the committee by the DAA chairman.  I have addressed these issues in D&aacute;il and I will discuss them further now.  I refer to the operating restrictions and the appointment of a noise regulator.  </p> <p>  In 2007 the DAA received planning permission to build the new runway at Dublin Airport.  Part of the conditions for granting that planning permission related to noise at the airport, and in particular, two conditions were introduced by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that will impose operating restrictions on Dublin Airport when the new runway is complete.  Specifically, as I understand it, the restrictions mean that the number of flights landing and taking off at the airport between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. will be halved once the new runway is completed.  This will have a knock-on effect on aircraft utilisation throughout the day and may lead to aircraft being based elsewhere.</p> <p>  Those conditions still apply with the planning permission extended to 2022, and the DAA is concerned about the impact on the viability of the runway project and on Dublin Airport more generally in the medium to long term.  </p> <p>  In the intervening period between the awarding of runway planning permission in 2007 and the DAA's announcement of the north runway project in April 2016 in light of the rapid recovery of passenger numbers, new EU regulations on airport noise management were introduced.  EU Regulation 598/2014 came into formal effect in 2016, setting out a structured approach to assessing and addressing noise at airports using the so-called "balanced approach" developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO.  The objective of the regulation is to facilitate airport development and expansion in a way that minimises the noise impact of that expansion as far as practicable.  Moreover, the regulation is crafted to support airport development and more and better global access.  It therefore provides that the introduction of operating restrictions should only be a last resort after all other alternatives have been considered or applied.  The Government last week approved a process that envisages enactment of a Bill to give effect to EU Regulation 598/2014 by the end of the year.  This will allow for a re-examination of noise mitigation at the second runway from the perspective of a custom-built legislative framework for noise impact and noise management.  This was not possible under the generic planning process as it applied in 2007.  This re-examination will be done in accordance with both the EU regulation and existing environmental and planning and development laws and procedures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1287" nospeaker="true" time="10:45:00" ><p>It will be evidence-based, transparent, and subject to public consultation and oral hearing.  There will also be an appeals process.  If this results in workable and acceptable noise mitigation alternatives to operating restrictions, that will be a best outcome for all parties, but there has to be due process.</p><p>Some people have complained of unnecessary delays and foot-dragging.  This ignores that this is a complex business and I must have regard to legal advice.  Throughout 2016 and 2017, based on legal advice, extensive work was undertaken in my Department with a view to implementing EU Regulation 598/2014 by way of secondary legislation and having the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, as the airport noise regulator.  The IAA seemed to make sense as the existing air navigation service provider, similar to the implementation of the regulation in other jurisdictions.  However, practical issues arose regarding the legal framework required to ensure the independence of the IAA as the competent authority, as required under the regulation.  Legal advice, late in that process, made that approach impractical.  This advice included the likelihood of successful legal challenge and the measures required to safeguard the independence of the IAA.</p><p>With this in mind and following intensive consideration of the available options, the Government agreed in January on a proposal to make Fingal County Council the airport noise regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la the appeal body, and to develop primary legislation giving effect to that.  The approach we are now taking will address the interrelationship between EU Regulation 598/2014, the planning system and the environmental considerations.  Primary legislation is being prepared as a priority.</p><p>The process for introducing or amending noise-related operating restrictions will be aligned and deeply embedded in the planning consent process.  It will address the environmental legislative requirements.  It will be transparent and will involve significant public consultation - it will have up to three months' consultation where operating restrictions are being considered.  It will have non-technical summaries to ensure it is accessible to the stakeholders and it will fully comply with EU Regulation 598/2014 and planning requirements.</p><p>I would like to outline briefly the envisaged process so that we are all clear on progress being made.  This will help to focus on the steps required to deliver the legislation in parallel with the delivery of the runway.  The DAA will prepare an application for consideration by Fingal County Council, the competent authority.  This application will contain all the information required by the council to enable it to assess and come to a regulatory decision.  Once made, the application will be publicly available and there will be an opportunity for all stakeholders to contribute their views before the decision is made.</p><p>This regulatory decision, which may or may not contain noise-related operating restrictions, will replace the existing conditions that Mr. Basil Geoghegan outlined during his appearance before the committee.  It is important to note that this will be the first decision made in Ireland under EU Regulation 598/2014.  This decision can, of course, be appealed and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be the appeals body.  This process will be enabled by primary legislation which I am hoping have enacted by the end of this year.  This aligns with the timeline for construction of the runway provided by the DAA.</p><p>I am confident that Fingal County Council is best placed as the competent authority and that will be demonstrated clearly in the course of the legislative process.  The council has responsibilities under the EU environmental noise directive relating to noise caused by major transport infrastructure, including roads, railways and airports.  In addition, in its planning functions it has considerable experience and expertise in the conduct of environmental impact assessments, appropriate assessments and in managing extensive public consultations.  Therefore, considerable synergies arise from the assignment of this additional role.</p><p>I am also aware of the concerns of some local residents.  I am sympathetic to their genuine concerns about this matter, particularly given the uncertainty over how the regulation was to be applied.  The fact that there will be primary legislation and that the process will be clearly laid out should give comfort that we will provide an open and transparent regulatory process.  I have every intention of introducing a Bill that will strike a balance between the rights of local residents, the DAA, as the regulated entity, and the broader national interest in recognition of the crucial importance of our primary national airport.</p><p>I want to outline some key milestones in the process.  I expect to have the airport noise regulation Bill in the Houses by November and enacted by the end of the year.  This will be followed by the initiation of the formal regulatory process and a regulatory decision by December 2020.  This will align with the DAA's estimation for the construction of the runway by March 2021.</p><p>I acknowledge that this has been a lengthy process, for the reasons I have outlined.  However, I hope members of the committee can see that significant progress has been made and that this effort will continue until the regulatory process is in place and in operation.  This process will continue beyond the construction of the runway.  It will be continually monitored and reviewed, and will provide the framework for consideration of future expansion of the airport.  It is important that we get this right and deliver an open and transparent regulatory process.</p><p>I appreciate the concerns of the members of this committee and now that we have a clear pathway I look forward to their co-operation in meeting the timeframe for this very important national project.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify that there is an extant planning permission dating from before EU Regulation 598/2014 came in, which, if and when it were implemented, without this EU regulation, would mean that there would be significant restrictions in the operation of aircraft before 7 a.m. or after midnight.  That was a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In summary the Minister is saying that has now been superseded by this regulation.  If the legislation passes, it will go through the planning process in Fingal County Council.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be the appeal party in that context.  Does that create a problem?</p></speech>

The restrictions are there but they do not kick in until it is finished.  If the legislation is passed by the Oireachtas those planning permissions will then lapse and there will be new conditions.  We do not know exactly what they will be at this stage.</p></speech>

However, it will now be considered in different circumstances because it will be considered under EU Regulation 598/2014.  It will be working to that template and those conditions.

When Mr. Geoghegan appeared before the committee, he pointed out that there could be a second runway but less throughput of passengers in Dublin Airport than at present, which would be disastrous given the growth the airport needs.  Everybody's rights need to be taken into account.  I understand the Minister's explanation of the process.  Is it possible that we could go through that entire process and reach the position Mr. Geoghegan described?  Is there any other game in town rather than taking this route?  Everybody wants the throughput of passengers to increase for this important hub.  Is there a plan B if this runs into the sand?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018071100002#F00100"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  It is long overdue that we are having this discussion.  We can all agree that the second runway is critical to our national infrastructure and the development of our country.  The Minister outlined a clear timeframe, but this is not the first time he has outlined a timeframe.  It is not the first time he has given an indication as to when he expects delivery of the competent authority.  For 18 months he told me repeatedly in the D&aacute;il it would be the IAA.  In fact, legislation was imminent on three separate occasions.  How can we have confidence today that what he is saying to us will be delivered and will be accurate?  How can Fingal County Council have confidence that what he is saying today will be delivered and accurate?  Did the Minister meet the CEO of Fingal County Council?  Did he hear the concerns of Fingal County Council about its ability to become the competent authority?</p> <p>  I mentioned the 18 months wasted with regard to the IAA.  Even in February of this year, the Minister facilitated a briefing with his officials at which we were advised we would have the legislation in weeks.  Earlier this year, the Minister indicated he would have a draft Bill before the D&aacute;il recess.  The recess is tomorrow and we know we will not have a draft Bill until October.  When was the Minister informed of the delays?  When did he know there would not be a Bill before the D&aacute;il recess?  What is the reason for the delay?  Is there a delay because of resource issues in the Department?  Is it because there is not the relevant expertise in the Department?  Is the Minister satisfied with the manner in which the Department has conducted the process?  Has Fingal County Council received independent legal advice on whether there is a need for primary legislation as opposed to a statutory instrument?  If so, has it shared that legal advice with the Minister?</p> <p>  This is an EU regulation, therefore, there is a requirement on all European countries to implement it.  How many of our European counterparts have implemented this regulation to date?  The Minister keeps saying we are taking a pot shot or cheap political shot at him.  How many of his counterparts have implemented this?  What are other countries doing regarding the establishment of an independent regulator?  My understanding is that a number of them have appointed their equivalent of the Irish Aviation Authority.  Did the legal advice recommend for 18 months that the IAA be appointed?  Has the legal advice changed or is it that the person who is giving the legal advice has changed?</p> <p>  Head 15 of the Bill refers to declassifying the development of Dublin Airport as strategic infrastructure development.  Will that have ramifications down the road in terms of any future application the airport would have to make?  The Minister stated the reason responsibility was taken from the IAA was the perception of a conflict of interest.  Does the Minister not feel that very same perception could be given, given that the DAA is by far the largest ratepayer to Fingal County Council?  He who pays the piper calls the tune.  Does he think it will have undue influence in terms of being the largest ratepayer?  What will he do to mitigate against that perceived conflict of interest?</p> <p>  Is the Minister aware the local residents' group, to which he referred in his statement, was satisfied with the IAA being appointed the competent authority.  It was satisfied the IAA would act in an independent fashion, but it is anxious and concerned about Fingal County Council.  Is the Minister aware of this?</p></speech>

I am curious as to why he thought that was a good idea when there were already serious questions about the independence of the authority.  There was to be a process to separate the two main functions of the authority and bring the safety regulations under the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  Will the Minister give us an update on this?</p> <p>  There was a lot of commentary on the separate independent authority that should be created for the purposes of noise regulation.  The Minister said he chose Fingal County Council and that he is confident Fingal County Council is best placed.  Why is this?  According to what he outlined, it already has responsibilities under the EU environmental noise directive relating to major traffic infrastructure and roads and with regard to its planning functions.  Every local authority has this.  Is there a particular expertise that Fingal County Council has above the others?  Is this why he chose it?  As Deputy Troy mentioned, 8% of the local authority's funding comes from airport traffic rates.  How does the Minister consider this to be independent?</p> <p>  After the time wasted on the Irish Aviation Authority, was it a chaotic last-minute decision to opt for Fingal County Council?  Was it done because it is so rushed?  It is very specialised work and I cannot see why it would have the expertise above others.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the regulation and the Bill.  Will he outline what specifics are in the regulation or in the Bill regarding the rights of residents?  He mentioned that the primary legislation will supersede planning permission.  Will he elaborate on this?</p><p>Could this not go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the critical infrastructure provisions?  That is a way for major decisions to be dealt with separately, and nationally.  Given the complexity of the decision and the expertise required, is this not possible?</p></speech>

Senator O'Mahony asked about the throughput.  According to the DAA, if everything went wrong and the planning restrictions were as they are now, it would halve the throughput of night-time traffic, that is, traffic between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  That is very serious and would not be acceptable.  We do not know if the new noise regulator will come up with a similar solution but the DAA is very concerned at the moment.</p></speech>

There has been a delay, and when we thought the IAA would be the competent authority we anticipated an earlier timetable for the legislation and everything else.  We were taken by surprise by our legal advice forcing us to look for another authority.  That is why we have such a tight timetable.  The Deputy is correct that we did not anticipate that happening.  One cannot second-guess the Attorney General but we have to accept the advice and respond to it.</p></speech>

It was probably based more on other judgments in Europe relating to the issue.  The alternative to what we did was to ignore the legal advice but the advice was that, if we appointed the IAA, we would be subject to legal challenge.  It would have been pretty irresponsible and reckless to appoint the IAA in the face of such advice.  With an issue as important as this, we have to take every step to appoint a regulator which we can defend in the courts.  That is why it took so long but I share the Deputy's frustration.  Delay is an irritant for a Minister in my position but I believe the timetable will still be met.  The issue is one of independence, which is a subjective judgment.  We were advised that the independence of the IAA was questionable and we decided to take the advice.  The Deputy would be the first person to criticise us if we had ignored it.  I regret that it took so long but we could not force them to produce advice.  If it is good advice in the end, that is fine.</p> <p>  I have not met the CEO of Fingal County Council and I have no plans to do so.  My departmental officials meet regularly with officials of Fingal and the county council has been deeply involved in developing the processes required to implement regulation 598/2014.  In June, the chief executive officer of Fingal County Council made a presentation to the cross-departmental team convened to support delivery of the north runway project and the council will be more involved as the legislation progresses.  If the CEO asks to meet me I will consider it, but I am not sure it is either necessary or appropriate at this stage.  Fingal has been appointed designate for the moment and will not actually be appointed until the legislation has been passed.  I do not have particularly strong feelings on the issue but at the moment I believe this should continue at official level.</p> <p>  I am absolutely satisfied that the Department has served me very well on this.  It has not been responsible for any delays and has responded to every event beyond its control in an extraordinarily efficient way.  The complexity of the legislation is stunning as there are deep legal, environmental and planning issues which are in the sphere of specialists.  It covers several Departments and there is a lot of exchange between Departments and the Attorney General and Fingal.  I do not think the Department is to be criticised for an unfortunate series of events which meant things had to be changed.  It responded perfectly adequately and things like that happen in a complicated system of this sort.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy also asked if the person who gave us the legal advice had changed.  I do not know who the individual in the Department is but it comes through the Attorney General.  There may be external people involved too but I am not certain whether there has been a change.  It is more the case that judgments elsewhere gave rise to the change.</p> <p>  I was also asked if Fingal County Council was conflicted in the way the IAA was.  The DAA rates represent 8% of the income of Fingal County Council.  This is a significant amount but 92% is not from that source.  This is a levy and not something for which they are competing with some other body.  I am not sure it gives the DAA any great leverage on Fingal County Council as it does not have the option of fighting it.  The council will be provided with the appropriate resources to undertake this additional role, ensuring it has the necessary tools to make evidence-based decisions in relation to noise mitigation measures and noise-related operating restrictions.  Local authorities have a wide range of statutory regulatory and enforcement functions.  These are related to the environment and planning and sit alongside their rate-collection and property tax-setting functions.  If somebody wants to point the figure at Fingal, they could equally do so at all county councils, who may be so conflicted in all sorts of ways.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy said local residents groups were satisfied with the IAA but so were we at the time.  I am not sure the same groups are dissatisfied with the current decision but, irrespective of their wishes, our wishes or those of the IAA itself, the Attorney General was not satisfied and that is the reason the decision was made.</p><p>As regards local resident groups, the DAA is still engaging with them and I am happy to engage with them from time to time.  I have already met a large number of them and I have heard what they have to say.  I do not think I have refused to meet any local resident group, but this does not mean I am opening the door for them all to come in.  Some of them are involved in legal actions and they too, I think, would possibly be dissatisfied if they felt that the IAA was conflicted and this is what the Attorney General has decided.  </p><p> The Deputy asked if other member states have made a decision on that basis and if they have appointed their aviation authority.  I have a table which I can give to the Deputy if he wants it.  Belgium, Romania, Spain and the UK have not yet designated their competent authority.  The aviation authority designate or in other words, the IAA equivalent, has been appointed in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Sweden.  A national regional authority, which is similar to Fingal County Council, has been appointed in most cases, including by Ireland, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hungary, Greece, France and Finland.  The majority of member states appear to have followed the same path as Ireland.  Others have appointed their designated authority but I presume that is because they have not had the same legal advice and do not have the same constitutional requirements. </p><p> Deputy Munster asked about the competency and independence of the IAA.  I have already addressed the issue of independence.  The Deputy also asked if Fingal County Council is best placed to take on this role.  It offered the best way forward following interdepartmental discussions.  We also considered the alternatives, of which we did not have a large number.  We looked at State agencies as well.  I am not sure if it is appropriate to name them but I am sure they are fairly obvious.  We felt that owing to its experience and responsibilities in the environment and regarding noise pollution, Fingal County Council was better placed than other agencies, some of which had no experience or experience in only one particular area.  This followed discussions between the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We also had to have regard to EU Regulation 598/2014.  As I said, Fingal County Council has responsibilities under the EU environmental noise directive, which include responsibilities relating to noise caused by urban conurbations and major transport infrastructures, including roads, railways and airports.  In addition, in regard to its planning functions, it has a great deal of experience and expertise in the conduct of environmental impact assessments, EIAs and in managing public consultations.  There are synergies arising from the assignment of this additional role to Fingal County Council.  </p><p> On the issue of conflicts and the 8%, I have already dealt with that in my responses to Deputy Troy.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is an independent appeals body, which means the issue of conflict is less powerful because the matter has to be appealed.  On the issue of whether the rights of residents are provided for in the Bill, probably not.  I presume the regulator will be tasked with ensuring balance in terms of the rights of the nation, the rights of the airport authority and the rights of residents but we do not propose to write those rights into legislation.  We do need to ensure there is balance and to make determinations around restrictions on flights or other ameliorating measures.</p><p> Whichever body is chosen will be authorised to immediately recruit expertise because there is no body in the country that has on hand the full expertise on noise regulation.  </p></speech>

Because of the delay we know the DAA will make an application to the new competent authority when it is established on these two planning conditions but we do not know what the outcome will be and because of the delay in appointing the competent authority, there is a knock-on delay in making that application and in knowing the outcome of that application and the potential of an appeal regarding it.  Because of the inexplicable delays at the Department's level, there have been knock-on consequences over which we have no control in terms of the timeline and it could lead to serious negative consequences for the airport, we simply do not know.</p> <p>  The Minister has pointed out that the 18 months was not his fault and that it was legal opinion that changed at the 11th hour.  I looked back, however, on a question I asked the Minister in the D&aacute;il last September and at that stage it was clear, because for the first time he did not reply saying that he would have legislation within weeks.  At that stage he was reviewing the process on the competent authority and he did not refer to the IAA.  Almost 12 months have elapsed from when the Minister was aware that the IAA was not going to be appointed and we still do not have draft legislation.  I ask again when the Minister was advised the IAA was no longer a runner.</p> <p>  Early this year, when we got the briefing from the Minister's officials, for which I thank them, the Minister indicated strongly at that stage that he would have this legislation debated in the D&aacute;il before the summer recess.  Is he satisfied there has been a further delay, even with the appointment of Fingal County Council?  I take the point that the Minister said that Fingal County Council can now start employing the necessary expertise and that is welcome.  Does the Minister think there is merit in him signing a statutory instrument appointing Fingal County Council to give it the certainty that there will be no further changes and that could be backed up by the legislation when it comes into place in the autumn?  He stated he has met the residents groups on a number of occasions and I acknowledge that but on the other side of the debate, how many of the bodies and CEOs has he met in trying to advance this process?  Does he believe it will be an independent unit within Fingal County Council or will it be based within the planning department?</p> <p>  The Minister keeps citing the complexities in this regard.  I am open to correction but my understanding is that as of November of last year, 13 of the other 27 member states had their competent authority appointed.  They received the same notification as we did.  Is the Minister satisfied that 13 countries could have it done last November and we could not?</p></speech>

It is now widely felt he then appointed Fingal County Council in haste, given the delay that ensued up and until he got the legal advice on the IAA.  It is clear from what the Minister has said that Fingal County Council does not have the expertise for this specialist area.  It has the same knowledge and information as every other local authority but that is all it has.  On the importance of an independent regulator, I note it is in receipt of 8% of its funding.  While the Minister has stated 8% is low compared with 92%, 8% of any local authority's funding is substantial and given the legal advice on what could have come from appointing the IAA, it is important that any body or competent authority that is appointed be completely independent and not in any way reliant on funding in such a way that its judgment could be swayed or it could be seen not to be entirely independent.  That is a real concern and the Minister has not really answered that in any specific detail.  I wonder if he can be clearer on that because it is a worry.</p></speech>

I assume it will do that.  It is an internal decision for it but when that sort of independence is required, I would have thought that Fingal County Council will decide to do that and I would be very surprised if, building on its experience in dealing with the airport's development in the past, including noise issues, we did not get a decision where there was a single separate unit.

I accept that there was a need for legal advice.  That is not a problem.  However, the Minister has confirmed that he was aware last September that he could not proceed with the IAA.  We were informed of this closer to Christmas and brought in for a briefing on Fingal County Council, I think in the first week of February, by departmental officials.  At that stage we were informed that the legislation would be brought before the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  What is the reason for the delay?  Why is it that, as of November last year, 13 of 27 EU member states had appointed a competent authority, but we still have not?</p></speech>

It was because the Attorney General was taking time with the advice.  In January the Government agreed to support the building of a new runway.  It acknowledged the serious commercial risks for the company as identified by the DAA, to which I communicated to confirmation of the Government's intention to implement Regulation No. 598.  I said I would publish the policy statement.  What has happened since the Government's decision in January is that there has been a great deal of communication between the various Departments involved.  My Department has been working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Climate Change and the Environment, Fingal County Council and the Office of the Attorney General to agree on the process to be followed to ensure compliance with Regulation 598, about which I have told the committee today.  More recently, a group of senior officials was convened, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, to co-ordinate and prioritise the delivery of the north runway project and prepare for the drafting of legislation as expediently as possible.</p></speech>

The group has been working through the details as quickly as it can.  We have a tight but constructive timetable.  It is very complex.  It is extremely difficult for all of the Departments to do, but we now have a timetable which I have laid out before the committee which will be kept to, give or take a week or two here or there.  It is perfectly viable and will deliver on time.  The Deputy is right about the delays while waiting for the Attorney General's advice.  It was extraordinarily inconvenient and has left us in a much more difficult position.  However, we are working at full speed and with a great sense of urgency.  The committee can see that the timetable I have set out is workable and provides sufficient time to deliver the runway on time and also to deliver the noise regulator in time to make new regulations for it.</p></speech>

My party and I want to work with the Minister and his officials to deliver this project because it is in the national interest.  This is not a cheap political shot, but we are here because of inaction and delays.  The Minister has not prioritised the issue.  He has prioritised work in other Departments which has taken his focus away from his own job.  It is remarkable that he has come here today and it appears that the Department of the Taoiseach is taking the lead.  Is that an indication that the Minister or his Department do not have the Taoiseach's confidence that they can deliver?  My understanding is it has to be done by September.  There is a deadline in September for the establishment of the competent authority.</p></speech>

In circumstances in which the local authority receives a certain percentage of its funding from airport traffic, it could be compromised as an independent regulator and decision-maker.  Surely, the body tasked with making decisions should not in receipt of any funding.</p></speech>

Planning permission was originally granted in 2007, but ten years later, we are still waiting for by-laws to be put in place.  From an operational point of view, throughput passenger capacity in Dublin Airport in June was over 3.1 million, a 7% increase on the number in the same period last year.  If we continue to have one runway while experiencing continuous growth, will the DAA have to tell airlines that want to come in or existing carriers that want to increase the number of routes that the airport has reached maximum capacity?  Can the Minister or his officials project the date on which that will arise?  Will it take four or five years?  If Dublin Airport does not have a second runway, when will maximum passenger numbers be reached in the growth period?</p><p>Some 14.7 million passengers passed through the airport in the first six months of the year, a phenomenal increase on the number in the same period in 2017.  The economy is booming and more people are travelling into and out of Ireland.  If the runway project is not progressed according to schedule, when will Dublin Airport reach maximum capacity such that the terminals will not be able to cope with more passengers?</p></speech>

Although that is very colourful language, there are real dangers if the runway is not built.  There is a build-up of traffic at Dublin Airport such that one or two delays may cause congestion, which emphasises the seriousness, urgency and importance of the runway project.  Capacity at Dublin Airport is a serious issue.  The Department and the DAA were somewhat taken by surprise by the sudden spike in passenger numbers.  In 2007-08 the DAA did not act on the extant planning permission because of falling passenger numbers.  It is very important that there be no reduction or dilution of our commitment to the project.  I thank Deputies Robert Troy and Kevin O'Keeffe for their commitment to it; it is a national imperative.  We must not tolerate unacceptable congestion at Dublin Airport because it is of such important to trade, tourism, prosperity, employment and other matters in the State.  The runway project is being pursued as an imperative and we do not see it falling behind schedule or not happening in any circumstance.</p></speech>

He does not see a need to meet the chief executive of Fingal County Council, in spite of the fact that he is to meet the affected residents associations.  He should meet everybody or nobody.

If a person refuses or fails to take an impairment test, the intention of the law is that garda&iacute; will have the option of conducting a preliminary oral fluid test for drugs and also the option of taking a specimen of blood for evidential tests for the presence of intoxicants.  <i>The Irish Times</i>, which the Chairman referred to, published an article on Monday, which said that due to a drafting error in the legislation, garda&iacute; could not take the oral fluid specimen or a specimen of blood in these cases.  This is true but it is not exactly news.  It has been in the ether for a long time.</p><p>Impairment tests were introduced in 2014 based on section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which was amended in 2014.  In 2016, section 11 was once again amended.  This had the effect of changing the subsection numbers within section 11.  As a result some cross-references to this section were no longer accurate and had to be changed, a fact which came to our attention in 2017.  One area where this impact was felt was in regulations relating to impairment tests.  I rectified this by revising the regulations in August 2017.  The other area of impact was that referred to in the article.  Cross-references in sections 13A and 13B of the Road Traffic Act 2010 now refer to the wrong subsections of section 11.  Rectifying this means amending those cross-references, which requires a legislative amendment by the Oireachtas.  I included amendments to make these corrections in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The passage of the Bill was excessively delayed but has now passed the D&aacute;il and I hope to see it pass the Seanad next week.</p><p>Prompted by the coverage of this issue, we will further examine the matter to see if all issues have now been addressed and if there is more that needs to be done, we will do it as soon as possible.  In the meantime, this error is not fatal.  People who refuse or fail to take an impairment test can be prosecuted for that.  The penalty is a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and-or up to six months in prison.  It is the same penalty as that for intoxicated driving.  There is, in other words, a flaw to be corrected but no one is getting away with anything as a result.  In other words, it is being addressed in legislation.  </p></speech>

I will not detain the Minister because my party spokesperson, Deputy Robert Troy, and Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe have detailed some of the issues we have.  As the Minister and his officials will know, for a long number of years I and my party have supported the development of the airport and the second parallel runway.  There is no issue there and we are not saying this should not happen.</p> <p>  I have come here to ask the Minister a couple of quick questions.  We had a briefing with officials a number of months ago on the legislation.  The Minister outlined a very tight timeframe, which concerns me.  First Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il will be taken on 7 November.  He is saying the Bill will pass the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and be signed by the President, whomever that may be, on 31 December 2018.  For very detailed legislation such as this, the timeframe from 7 November to 31 December is very tight.  Is the Minister confident he will meet it?  We have not met any of the timeframes up to now.</p> <p>  I am not a member of the committee and I thank the Chairman for his indulgence in allowing me to speak briefly.  I place on record our grave disappointment that the Irish Aviation Authority is not the competent authority.  I do not accept the advice the Minister has been given that he would not be able to create Chinese walls within the IAA to allow it to be the regulator.  It should be the competent authority because it has the competence and staff to do the job.  It has the salary structure to enable people to be hired to do the job.</p> <p>  I have great regard for Fingal County Council, a very progressive local authority which some of the Minister's officials will know very well.  I have major concerns the council will not be resourced properly and does not have the expertise to perform this very serious role.  I will live under the flight path of the new parallel runway and I accept that but we want to ensure residents' views and concerns are taken into account and the regulator is independent.  Fingal County Council collects 22% of its rates on the Dublin Airport campus.</p></speech>

Leaving that aside, while we may be able to accept that officials in Fingal County Council will adjudicate on the two planning conditions, it will be difficult for residents, including me, to accept it is an independent authority overseeing conditions imposed on it by the board which it did not impose itself.  People will not accept that.  We want buy-in from people and the Minister was good enough to meet and hear the concerns of a number of groups last year with me and other colleagues.  They did not say they did not want a second runway or development at the airport.  They said they wanted the airport to be a good neighbour.  We are being sold a pig in a poke.</p> <p>  Will Fingal County Council be the noise regulator for Shannon Airport and Cork Airport?  We will have a different regime with three different regulators on an island with the same population as Manchester.  That does not make any sense.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach has set up this cross-departmental group and I am still at a loss to see exactly how it will work.  Who will lead it?  Will it be the Taoiseach or the Minister?</p> <p>  There is no way the Minister will meet the timeframe of the end of December.  More than 17,000 people are directly employed at Dublin Airport and its campus and there are tens of thousands of indirect jobs.  Many local people recognise that the airport generates 4% of GNP.  We are very proud of our airport and the work that is done there.  The Minister's and Department's stewardship of the development of the second runway and securing buy-in from the local community leaves a lot to be desired.  We brought people along with this process, which I have been dealing with since 2004 when I was elected to the council.  They are now very concerned about the ham-fisted manner in which the issue is being dealt with.  This will put jobs in the airport and its future development at risk.  We will not get an independent regulator.</p> <p>  The Chairman has been here all morning.  I came in at the very end because I was at other meetings.  The Minister will not meet the timeframes outlined here and it is fantasy to say he will.  We are putting at risk the jobs in the airport and the potential of the airport.  We are putting at risk the communities adjacent to the airport who have bought into the need to develop the airport.  I do not understand why this cross-departmental group has been foisted on the Minister.  According to the timeframe, he will publish the Bill on 7 November and it will pass both Houses and be signed by the President by 31 December.  That is fantasy.</p></speech>

That is fair enough.  His views are very useful.  Bearing in mind the constituency he represents it is an honourable position for him to take, and that is what he should do.  I do not share the views but that is neither here nor there.  As he is aware, however, I have met many delegations of residents, taken their views into account and relayed them to the DAA and to other appropriate people and institutions.  I will continue to do that if he believes that is useful because this is about a balanced determination which has to take into account the overall national interest and the interests of his constituents.  That is what will be done and, contrary to what the Deputy said, it will be independent.  I have no doubt about that.  I know the Deputy has a high regard for Fingal County Council, as I do.

I am just laying it out for the other members.  Staff will have to be recruited at Fingal County Council because it does not have all the necessary expertise.  However, that would also have had to happen if the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, had been made the responsible authority because it did not have the staff either.  There was not a body in Ireland waiting for this particularly specialist call on noise regulation.  There is not such a body in existence anywhere.  People have to be recruited to do it, and they will be recruited for Fingal County Council, but they would have to be recruited also for the IAA.</p></speech>

These figures were provided to me by Fingal County Council.  If he doubts them, that is up to him.</p> <p>  Regarding Shannon and Cork airports, under this directive they do not have to be regulated by this noise operator because the requirement is 50,000 movements and Dublin is the only airport in Ireland which comes under that category.</p> <p>  I accept the Deputy's reservations about the timetable.  This timetable was accepted and approved by the Cabinet last week.  The Deputy is right that it is tight but we are determined to keep to it.  I hope we will have the support of the Opposition for getting the Bill through quickly.  It is extremely urgent and we expect the Opposition will recognise its importance and urgency. </p></speech>

This meeting has been convened for the consideration of a motion on approving the terms of air services agreements between Ireland and the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.  This was referred to committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 3 July.  The committee has been asked to send a message to the D&aacute;il not later than 12 July saying that it has completed its consideration of the motion.  The briefing prepared by the Department has been circulated to members.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross and his officials to this meeting and I invite him to make his opening statement please. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-11a.1430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018071100002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for facilitating the discussion of this item at short notice.</p> <p>  This D&aacute;il motion is to approve the terms of an air services agreement between Ireland and the Arab Republic of Egypt and an air services agreement between Ireland and the United Arab Emirates.  These two agreements were negotiated and agreed at official level some years ago.  However, as is normal for such international agreements, constitutional procedures need to be followed by both sides in order to allow the agreements to be formally signed and to enter into force.</p> <p>  In the case of Ireland these procedures involve both Government and D&aacute;il approval.  The Government approved both agreements at its meeting on 12 June last.  The passing of the D&aacute;il motion will allow both agreements to be signed at an opportune occasion in the future.  The United Nations General Assembly often provides such an opportunity and may be suitable for these agreements.  It is due to open in New York on 18 September 2018.  To avail of this opportunity the Government is seeking to have the D&aacute;il motion passed before the summer recess.</p> <p>  The majority of international trade in goods and services is now governed by international trade and investment agreements under the World Trade Organization, WTO, system.  However, international air transport remains outside of the WTO system and instead is governed by a multitude of bilateral air services agreements negotiated between states within the framework of the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. </p> <p>  International aviation agreements generally follow a prescribed format and both of these agreements are no different in that regard.  The main purpose of such agreements is to provide for the reciprocal granting of air traffic rights to airlines from both countries to operate scheduled air services.</p><p>The agreements also cover a list of other standard provisions to facilitate air services, such as those relating to aviation safety and security and the facilitation of passengers and cargo.<br/><br/>Ireland and the UAE have had close co-operative relations for many years.  The text of the Ireland-UAE air services agreement was agreed at official level in 1995.  This was updated by a new agreement at a meeting in Dublin in December 2011.  Both sides agreed to apply these agreements on an administrative basis, pending entry into force.  The formal procedures on the Irish side have been delayed until now.  However, both sides would now like the agreement to be signed and ratified as soon as possible.  The vast majority of air services in and out of Ireland are now governed either by the EU single aviation market or by EU aviation agreements with third countries, such as the EU-US open skies agreement.  A number of important new services still operate under national level agreements, however, such as this agreement with the UAE.  <br/><br/>In terms of the services operating, the agreement with the UAE is now one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important national level agreements. The two largest UAE airlines, Emirates and Etihad, operate successful double daily flights from Dublin to Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  Both airlines have gradually increased capacity on these routes since they were first established.  Etihad began services in 2007 and Emirates began services in 2012.  Aer Lingus also operated Dublin-Dubai for a short period between 2006 and 2007.<br/><br/>Ireland has good trade, tourism and cultural relations with the UAE.  The good direct air services between the two countries are a great facilitator of those relations, which will be further bolstered by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent announcement that Ireland will participate in Expo 2020 in Dubai and the fact that Ireland lifted its visa requirement for UAE citizens wishing to visit Ireland with effect from 31 January 2018.  In addition to direct connectivity to the UAE, these air services also provide good one-stop connectivity options to a range of destinations in Asia, Africa and Australasia. <br/><br/>The European Union is currently seeking to negotiate an EU air services agreement<b></b>with the UAE.  Ireland is supportive of these efforts, but in the meantime it is important that our national level agreement with the UAE is signed and comes into force.  The air services agreement with Egypt was negotiated at official level at a meeting in Dublin in October 2014.  Both sides would now like the agreement to be formally signed as soon as possible.  Egypt has made inquiries on the matter at various meetings between Ireland and Egypt in recent years.  The matter was discussed during a visit of an Oireachtas delegation to Egypt in January 2017, which included the Ceann Comhairle.  In January 2018, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney also travelled to Cairo as part of a wider trip to the Middle East.<br/><br/>There are no scheduled air services operating between Ireland and Egypt at present.  Tourist charter services operated in the past from Ireland to Egypt.  No airline has any immediate plans to operate direct scheduled services between the two countries.  This agreement, however, will facilitate future services with a view to enhancing connectivity between Ireland and Egypt. <br/><br/>I thank the committee again for its time.  I hope that after consideration by the committee it will be possible for the D&aacute;il motion to be referred back to the full House so that it can be passed before the summer recess.  This will allow both these important agreements to be signed in the coming months.</p></speech>
