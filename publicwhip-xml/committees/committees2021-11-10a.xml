Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending the meeting.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation in this.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or of those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, as the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Committee members are reminded once again of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or, in some cases, the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  </p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. Ella Kavanagh from the department of economics in University College Cork, UCC, and Professor Karl Whelan from the economics department in University College Dublin, UCD, and thank them for attending.  The purpose of today's meeting is to examine the very current concern and issue of inflation.  The committee would also like to discuss drivers of inflation, possible policy responses to the current levels of inflation and budget 2022.  I now invite Dr. Kavanagh to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ella Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to this meeting.  I will extract some key points from the brief that I submitted to the committee and will begin by giving some background to the current situation.</p> <p>  The current global inflation issue is the outcome of a perfect storm.  On the demand side, the pandemic resulted in a change in consumer expenditure patterns from services to goods.  The current easing of Covid restrictions and accumulated savings have unleashed pent-up demand.  At a macro level, unlike in previous recessions there has been a co-ordinated monetary and fiscal policy response to the pandemic.  On the supply side, disruptions to supply chains, difficulties in the labour market due to Covid, geopolitical factors and importantly, climate change consequences and responses, have affected the global commodities market, including the energy market and the supply and availability of raw materials, inputs and products.  We are seeing the effect of this and during this year we have entered into a period of rising prices and higher inflation rates.  </p> <p>  In July 2021, average prices of goods and services in Ireland measured by the consumer price index, CPI, were 2.2% higher than the average a year ago.  This rose to 2.8% in August and, more recently, 3.7% in September.  This followed a period of deflation during the height of the restrictions.  It is also important to note that over the last decade low inflation of less than 1% has been the norm.  The categories in the CPI that have experienced the most significant price increases between September 2020 and September 2021 were transport, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, alcohol, beverages and tobacco, restaurants and hotels, and communications.  With the exception of the latter, these categories all made the greatest contribution to the rise in inflation.  The figures I just quoted refer to headline inflation but core inflation, where we remove both unprocessed food and energy prices, has also risen although by less.  It increased by 1.4% in July, 2.1% in August and 2.7% in September.  Increases in price inflation across categories seem to suggest more broad-based inflation but I would suggest that we need more observations.  On building costs, the wholesale price index for buildings and construction has been consistently increasing year on year since last March.  Materials prices have increased from 2.3% in March 2021 to almost 13% in September.  </p> <p>  The general consensus is that the current increase in inflation is temporary and that inflation will fall back towards the European Central Bank, ECB, target of 2% or below over the medium term.  The Central Bank of Ireland is forecasting headline price inflation for Ireland of 2.1% in 2021 rising to 2.9% in 2022, which is above the ECB inflation target of 2%, but moving back to below that target at 1.9% in 2023.  Recently the US Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Bank of England all projected a temporary effect although there are differences between them.  The reasons for this temporary effect are various.  First, energy prices are expected to stabilise or fall next year.  Second, supply is expected to recover as supply disruptions ease and demand is expected to normalise.  Third, base effects will drop out of the inflation figures.  Underlying this is the view that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  </p> <p>  However, there are risks around these projections and the risk are mainly on the upside, that price inflation could be more persistent and therefore, higher than projected for next year and into the medium term.  These centre around the restoration of global supply chains, global energy and commodity prices and wages.  The recent supply chain disruptions are global in nature and have been directly or indirectly related to Covid.  Companies are attempting to offset the effect of increased costs on their margins by increasing prices and generating efficiencies.  The key uncertainty here is how long supply chains remain disrupted but even if they remain disrupted for longer, it is expected that impacts will still be transitory as companies and businesses move to re-establish reliable operations and cut costs in the chain, as they have done in the past.</p><p>The point is made that the pandemic has led to a series of regional supply and transportation disruptions, linked to the spread of Covid and the vaccination programmes, which may have had a more persistent impact than a single large shock.  Even if disruptions continue, another uncertainty is to what degree companies will be willing to continue to pass these higher costs on to their customers.</p><p> On global energy costs, the projections are that prices for crude oil, gas and solid fuels will reverse in 2022, reducing headline price inflation.  However, it is argued that uncertainty remains high and that imbalances could lead to spikes in prices.  Oil prices, although high relative to pre-pandemic levels, are still well below their all-time high of 2008 and the subsequent peak in 2013 so they could move higher.  Energy prices are also wrapped up in geopolitical issues.  In addition, climate change targets are increasing the global demand for the bridging fuel, namely, natural gas.  Turning to headline price inflation in Ireland, short-term increases arising from electricity price rises, effective from late October into November 2021, are still in the pipeline.</p><p> Another major uncertainty relates to wages and the level of slack in the labour market.  On the one hand, we might expect upward pressure on wages if consumers reorient their spending back towards services, if there is a reduction in the size of the labour force or, indeed, in particular sectors and if higher inflation features in wage negotiations or causes an upward revision of inflation expectations.  On the other hand, the ending of the pandemic supports could result in some loosening of the labour market which would put downward pressure on wages.  There is significant uncertainty around this.</p><p> There are also questions regarding demand in 2022.  It is expected demand pressures will subside as the pent-up demand unwinds but this will also depend on policy responses.</p><p> On policy responses, the appropriate response of a central bank to supply-side shocks is not as straightforward.  Supply-side shocks such as energy prices rises may be temporary or transitory.  Therefore, if the central bank increases interest rates today in response to this, by the time the impact of the policy change comes over the medium term energy prices may no longer be increasing or indeed may have reversed.  By leaving well alone and not stepping on the brake the central bank does not aggravate the problem.  Central banks will be concerned about whether these supply-side shocks will persist and will have persistent effects on the economy through second-round effects and then of course whether to act.  The situation today is very complex.  On the one hand, there has been a significant rebound in demand causing demand-pull inflation where demand has outstripped supply.  On the other hand, there are major supply-side shocks around which there is major uncertainty.  However, it is important to note that prior to the pandemic, price inflation has been persistently below its inflation target and that returning inflation to its target is the desired aim of central banks.</p><p> On fiscal policy, the situation, as stated earlier, is more complicated when supply-side shocks and as we are seeing today, supply chain and labour market disruptions, are the cause of costs and price increases.  What governments can do is ensure they are not adding to the disruption.  At the same time, governments may be able to reduce the impact of these supply shocks and increase efficiencies through infrastructure investment, for example.  They may also be able to reduce labour mismatch through the provision of education and training, reducing both frictional and structural unemployment; in other words, by focusing on supply-side policies.  The volatility introduced through dependence on fossil fuels also provides a further reason, in addition to climate change, for governments to focus on investment and incentives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p> As a final point, it would appear the current increase in inflation is temporary, although there are caveats around this.  This raises the question of whether inflation will revert to the inflation rates that existed prior to the pandemic, or to a higher rate of price inflation.  The change in the ECB's monetary policy strategy with the restatement of the ECB's target for inflation of 2% may increase expectations of price inflation which will in turn affect actual inflation.  Another possibility is the consequence of the recent price increases is price inflation may now re-enter people and workers' decision making processes.  Other factors which may also affect the trend inflation rate, that is, the dynamics of inflation and volatility, are of course demographic considerations, globalisation and climate change.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Let me start with some of the facts.  I am going to repeat quite a number of the things Dr. Kavanagh said and want to get on with it and not waste too much of the committee's time.</p> <p>  After many years out of the news, inflation has come to the fore again in recent months.  We have seen that with a spike in inflation all across Europe.  In Ireland, consumer price inflation as measured by year-over-year percentage change in prices in September was 3.7%.  That is the highest reading since the period before the global financial crisis.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has not yet published its figure for the October CPI, but EUROSTAT has a flash release for the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, which gives an estimate of what it thinks this number is going to be, or what inflation is going to do, in October.  That showed a further of 1.3% rise in inflation in Ireland in October so we appear to be on track for an inflation reading of about 5% for year-over-year inflation to be published by the CSO very soon.  This would be strikingly high relative to what we have seen in recent years.</p> <p>  The largest single contributor to the rise in inflation has been the jump in energy prices.  The story on this has been relatively simple.  The onset of the pandemic saw a collapse in energy prices.  Most notably, oil prices fell because lockdowns meant people were not travelling in their cars, on aeroplanes and so on.  As the global economy has recovered those initial price declines started to be reversed and with strong global demand for manufacturing we have seen those energy prices go back above the levels they were at prior to the pandemic.  Even excluding energy, CPI inflation in Ireland was running at 2.5% as of September.  That is very moderate.  We know the ECB's target rate of inflation is 2% so there is nothing too scary about 2.5% but that is much higher than we had seen in the years running up to the pandemic.</p> <p>  There are a number of forces contributing to the rise in non-energy inflation.  One element is we are seeing year-over-year price rises for services that were restricted in their activities for much of 2020.  With the September CPI inflation reading, of that 2.5% for non-energy inflation, about 0.5% of it was things like air fares, hotels and restaurants, which were barely open a year ago.  If they were open, they were offering cheap prices.  Beyond that, we are seeing rising prices for industrial goods also contributing to inflation.  This is basically a global phenomenon.  The pandemic produced some quite unusual combinations of supply and demand for various products.  On the supply side, we saw factory shutdowns in various parts of the world due to Covid outbreaks and we are still seeing elements of Covid outbreaks causing difficulties for manufacturing in various parts of the world.</p> <p>  The pandemic also produced unexpected changes in global spending patterns.  With many service providers closed and limited opportunities for in-person shopping during lockdowns, households in advanced economies switched to purchasing goods online, most notably gadgets of various sorts.  Much of that stuff is produced in Asia and especially China.  That surge in demand for those products took those manufacturers by surprise and took transportation firms by surprise.  If we take shipping for instance, prior to the pandemic there was the outbreak of a trade war between the US and China and that convinced many people global long-distance trade was actually going to decline during these years.  We saw the supply of container shipping capacity was not able to cope with this surge in demand.  Thus we have seen a big increase in shipping costs around the world and that has added to the cost of the goods we are buying.  We are also seeing shortages of parts.</p> <p>  The other element influencing global inflation is surprisingly strong global demand.</p><p>Some farms and households have been badly affected by losing income because of shutdowns but, on average, the aggressive response from governments has meant that the average household balance sheet is stronger than it was 20 months ago.  Consumers have spent less and active fiscal policies like wage subsidy schemes and the pandemic unemployment programme have meant that the direct impact on the average person's disposable income has largely been shielded.  In addition, we have seen house prices continue to rise around the world and global stock markets are at an all-time high so people's ability and capacity to spend money on goods is strong.<br/><br/>What will inflation do next?  One can provide an optimistic case and a pessimistic one.  I will give members both cases and then we can discuss the arguments over questions.  The positive case rests on observing that the recent high inflation rates are partly a function of what economists call &quot;base effects&quot;.  What do we mean by that?  We had this period after the pandemic started in which prices were falling fast.  Once it was clear that vaccines were going to come into place and that there would be an element of economic recovery, those price drops reversed.<br/><br/>The overall amount of inflation we have seen going back to the start of the pandemic is relatively modest.  Prices in Ireland in September were exactly what they would have been if they had grown at an annual rate of 2% from the start of the pandemic, which is the ECB's target.  On the path of how they have reached that level, we see there is an issue of sharp decline and now, when we are looking at figures for October 2020 versus October 2021, for which figures will be released next week, we will see that October 2020 was the bottom of the decline.  That is the base that goes into the calculation of the inflation rate for that period.  The idea is that as we proceed through the following months and into next year, we will not be comparing current prices with that particular artificial lull of the price level.  That is the underlying assumption.<br/><br/>That is not to say that October has to be the peak.  As Dr. Kavanagh pointed out, there is a process of the pass-through from wholesale to retail energy prices.  That will go on over the coming months and continue to add to CPI inflation.  It is unclear when the peak will be according to this scenario.  The optimistic scenario is that these are just temporary numbers and base effects and we will largely see them go away.  That is the scenario one can see in the economic projections accompanying the budget.  The Government expects all prices to fall back a bit from their current levels and total and core inflation to be equal to the magic number of 2% in 2022 and beyond.<br/><br/>What are the risks on the high side?  One obvious source of risk is that wholesale energy prices do not behave themselves.  There are a lot of stories about the natural gas market, in Europe in particular, showing that it is under a lot of strain.  What will happen with gas price developments in the coming months is likely to depend on factors such as the severity of the winter weather in Europe.  It may depend on Russia's willingness to supply more gas to Europe in the absence of the complex issue of the Nord Stream 2 tunnel and whether it will get approval for quick usage or not.  We also do not have a good handle on when the kind of global bottlenecks and mismatches between supply and demand that we are seeing will be resolved.  We hope they get resolved quickly.  To give one concrete example, we know it takes about three years from ordering a container ship to getting it delivered.  There is a shortage and tightness in the shipping market, which will be in place for some time to come.<br/><br/>The argument that it is just base effects and that everything will normalise in the coming months is undermined by the fact that the core CPI, as Dr. Kavanagh has pointed out, has grown at quite a fast pace in recent months.  Going beyond the coming months, we then start to get into the risk that in Ireland and beyond, these high inflation rates will start to fuel the public's expectations of what inflation will be.  We might start to see trade unions looking for higher wages.  Inflation could then get into the system in the way it did in the 1970s and 1980s and we would have a high inflationary wage-price spiral.  Neither professional economists nor people in financial markets who have real money at stake are anticipating this high inflation scenario but it is worth pointing out the risks.<br/><br/>Since this is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I will talk a little about the budget and possible policy reactions.  It is important to stress that Ireland imports a high fraction of the items that consumers purchase and in general Irish Governments have traditionally not had much control over inflation.  There were not many tools available to the Government in the most recent budget that could offset this kind of largely externally driven inflation that we are seeing.  What we saw in the budget were a number of measures such as adjustment of tax bands and increases in fuel allowances that at least partially offset the impact of the higher inflation on people.<br/><br/>The most obvious fiscal policy response is for the Government to consider temporary reductions in VAT rates on certain types of goods and services.  That is a way to reduce the headline inflation rate.  On balance, I would argue against that because it is politically difficult.  We have seen examples of temporary low tax rates being introduced and they generally remain in place beyond the supposedly temporary period for which they were intended.  It is a good thing that the budget did not proceed with various proposals that have been knocking around such as vouchers for the hospitality sector or other measures that would boost domestic demand and fan the flames of what is already an uncomfortably high level of inflation.  In the longer term, in managing the demand and supply mix in the economy the Government has an ambitious capital spending plan.  However, it will have to think about what the capacity of the economy is to deliver on that.  If inflation has already moved up because of various global factors, overheating the domestic economy could just end up making a bad situation considerably worse.<br/><br/>It is easy to think of the negatives of a period of higher inflation on the budgetary position.  It places upward pressure on Government spending on wage increases for the public sector and to adjust welfare rates upwards.  It also generally brings in extra revenue and the Government will see extra VAT and corporate tax revenue.  It will also see extra income tax revenue if people are getting wage increases to compensate them.  On balance, the overall effect on the budget and the deficit as a share of GDP depends on decisions the Government takes but is likely to wash out in a neutral way.<br/><br/>A greater risk stems from the potential responses of central banks.  A sustained increase in inflation, where it goes above 2% and stays there for a reasonable period of time, would likely see the end of the ECB's accommodative monetary policy and it would be likely to start to raise interest rates.  That would have a fiscal effect because it would increase the costs of Ireland's government debt, which is still high when measured in <i>per capita</i>terms.  That said, the public debt has largely been financed via long-term and fixed-rate bonds and loans.  The majority of the public debt does not mature until 2030 and has been locked down at low interest rates.  It would take quite a while for those higher interest rates to have a big fiscal effect.  More worrying is the possibility that the interest rate hikes that a sustained period of high inflation could produce from the ECB, the US Federal Reserve and possibly the Bank of England could lead to another global recession of the style we saw in the 1980s, 1990s and so on when central banks intervened and deliberately restrained the economy to bring inflation down.</p></speech>

Their experience and knowledge are most appreciated by all of us.</p><p> We can watch world markets and the global price of oil, as I do because I have been the holder of a high-carbon licence for 32 years.  In blunt terms, that means I sell and dispense oil, oil products, diesel and petrol, so I have been closely tuned into the price of a barrel of oil for my entire adult life.  I have not seen before what I have seen happen in the past 12 or 18 months.  It is unprecedented.  The witnesses stated they believed things will start to turn globally next year, but they will not.  We have not discussed the attack on "mom's purse" being undertaken by politicians in the Houses of the Oireachtas through the climate budget.  I am not a climate change denier.  I respect very much every person who has strongly held views on climate action or inaction, as I do personally.</p><p> I own land so I am the custodian of land.  When I say I own it, I am not carrying it anywhere.  When I die, I will not take it any place with me.  I have never seen any person taking a field into the ground.  People have to leave their land to somebody else.  I hope I will give the land I leave after me to other people in better shape than I got it and I hope they will do the same.  I am the same as every other farmer in Ireland.  Land is not a possession; it is something we use to try to make a couple of pounds of a living or part-time living.</p><p> My point is that mom's purse is my economic guide.  It is my financial indicator or barometer of how things are going in the country.  If mom's purse in Ballymullen or Ballybunion is all right, then it is all right around the rest of the world, in my humble opinion.  If it is not, then things are not good.  Mom's purse is under attack.  The reason is that it seems to be socially acceptable to tax the living daylights out of everything at the moment, all in the name of climate action and preventing people from emitting more carbon.</p><p> It is totally insane, crazy, bonkers and bananas for someone with a well maintained diesel car that runs well and which is paid for or on which payments are being made to dispose of that good diesel engine and buy an electric car.  First, the electric car is very expensive to buy.  To produce that electric car is expensive and harmful to the environment, as has been proven.  Then there is the energy to charge that electric car.  The Government is telling everyone to go electric and install electric heat pumps in their houses, yet at the same time it is shutting down power stations.  The Government is also talking about trying to bring in gas-powered generators and buying fuel next winter from France and England.  These countries are talking about conserving the energy they have because it is a finite resource.  If it does not suit them, they will not sell it to us and we will potentially have blackouts.</p><p> When we talk about budgetary oversight, one of the first things we should do is overseeing ourselves and checking on ourselves and the way we are voting inside in the D&aacute;il when it comes to imposing more taxes on the hard-pressed taxpayers of Ireland and on mom's purse.  Mom's purse is a seriously attacked personal possession.  We should be taking a more considered view on taxation.  I am not someone who will blindly continue to vote for and support increased taxes because someone has to pay for them at the end of the day.  What is happening is wrong.  We should be like France and Italy.  The Government should decide to reduce taxes on fuel because it is taking an awful lot of money away from people in taxes.  It should reduce the tax take it is getting from energy costs because people simply cannot afford it any more.</p><p> I will keep to my promise.  I just wanted to make those points.  It would be neglectful for us to have an engagement on budgetary oversight without talking about the elephant in the room, and that elephant is us.  Whether we are Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Independents or Sinn F&eacute;in, we are responsible to the people who elected.  There is an onus of responsibility on us.  At the moment, all we seem to be doing is attacking, hurting and crippling them with inflation that we are causing.  Globally, we can say there are other contributing factors but it is we, the politicians, who are one of the biggest things hitting people at the moment.  Every one of us has look in the mirror and ask what way we will vote tonight.  What did people say today when they stood up and made lovely speeches?  Will they support the motion brought forward by the Rural Independent Group or will they pay us lip service today and vote against us tonight?  It is a time for straight talking.</p></speech>

On the specific topic of inflation, it is worth emphasising that the carbon tax, which I think is largely what the Deputy is referring to, will be only a very modest contributor to energy price inflation.  The Department of Finance's calculations are that the change in the carbon tax introduced in this budget would add about &euro;1.50 to a 60 l fill at the pumps.  Everyone knows how much it costs to fill up but I know that the cost of filling my car has been going up an awful lot more than that in recent months.  The major contributor to higher energy prices has been global events.  The carbon tax is a relatively small contributor to the current rise in the cost of living.</p></speech>

They go up and down and there is great volatility in the market.  As the Deputy just mentioned, we see the impact that this has on people's lives and their disposable income.  Any attempt to reduce that impact, the importance of fossil fuels and those sorts of energy would be fantastic and would, hopefully, help to reduce some of the volatility we have observed over the years.  Maybe an opportunity to try to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels would help to reduce the impact they currently have on all our lives.</p></speech>

I also thank both speakers.  I was very interested in their opening statements.  It is refreshing to hear what they have to say.  They have taken quite a nuanced approach on the factors driving inflation.</p><p>Sometimes you would get a bit worried when you hear some of the media commentators as it seems that they are keeping to the old Friedmanite line that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.".  Both Dr. Kavanagh and Professor Whelan in their opening statements stated what the Central Bank has been saying, that it could be temporary and that there are obviously risks.  I would like to hear what their views would be if they had to give an opinion on it because they have hedged in their analysis.  It makes me think - I do not mean this is an bad way - of President Truman who asked for a one-handed economist because he was annoyed that his economic advisers would often say that on the one hand X could happen but on the other hand Y could happen.  We have all been there.  I would be interested if they did come down on the one side.  My question is, do they agree with the ECB and the recent comments of Professor Philip Lane that this is likely to be temporary or do they think it is an incorrect assessment?  That would be my first question.</p></speech>

It is a very difficult question to answer.  Financial markets have the view that inflation will be higher in the future.  They think the central bankers have got it wrong.  Let us be honest that there is much uncertainty out there at present about what could happen.</p> <p>  My worry would be that the way we view inflation now is quite different.  There is so much talk about inflation now whereas before, prior to the pandemic, it hardly entered any of our thinking.  That has definitely changed.  I wonder, therefore, if it will become much more a consideration for people in terms of, as Professor Whelan said as well, negotiating wages to ensure that they are able to cover this higher-price inflation they expect will be there in the future.  Unfortunately, the danger is that it will lead, as wages go up, to prices going up.  That would be a concern for me.  It is so much in the news at present and people are so aware of it that I suppose my worry for the future would be that it becomes embedded in people's thinking and, therefore, affects the decisions which they will be making in the future.  I am not sure if that covers it; it is still a bit hedgy but it gives the Deputy a sense of where my worries would be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#E00900"><p>I might follow up with a similarly two-handed approach, but try to give a bit more depth than I gave in my opening statement.<br/><br/>In terms of the position that it will go back to inflation being low and below 2%, it is interesting that the ECB's position, as expressed by Professor Philip Lane in the past couple of days, both in a speech and in an interview that he gave, was much stronger that, in Europe at least, the ECB is very confident that inflation is returning to 2%.  That statement is much stronger than those being made by central bankers in the UK or at the Federal Reserve.  Professor Lane's argument is basically that there is a set of circumstances that have been in place in Europe dating back to 2008-2009 which have together meant systematically low inflation and the ECB has put in place historically unprecedented levels of stimulus from the central bank and still not seen inflation rise that much.  They look at the pandemic and they say that after the pandemic, all the forces that were in place that were leading to there being not much pricing power for firms, and perhaps demographic factors that mean that lots of people in Europe are saving rather than spending, are still all in place.  The pandemic did not make any of those go away.  I think that is their ultimate argument for why it is that these forces will recede and we will end up sometime next year looking around and the economy will look much like it did before the pandemic, and in that era the economy was structurally almost incapable of delivering high inflation.  I think that is their argument.<br/><br/>I will give one argument as to why they are somewhat on shaky ground and give the inside baseball on this topic in the profession.  Neither the central banking community nor the academic economics community is currently feeling that it has a very good theory of the determinants of inflation.  The Federal Reserve for years relied on what we call the &quot;Phillips curve&quot;, which is, basically, if the unemployment rate gets low and the economy gets hot, you will see inflation.  The Federal Reserve, Fed, more or less walked away from the Phillips curve as a framework in the period prior to the pandemic.  Mr. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, oversaw a review of the monetary policy and their previous cycle where they had raised interest rates was not because they had seen high inflation but only because unemployment was low.  Within that framework, you have to come out and say &quot;We actively want to raise unemployment&quot;, which, if you think about, means there are people in jobs now when we actively want them to not be in jobs because we think their being in jobs is a threat to inflation.  When they went through that, the inflation never appeared.  Therefore, even prior to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve had been cutting inflation.  A prominent member of the Federal Reserve board, on quitting his seven-year position a couple of years go, Professor Daniel Tarullo, stated it was his assessment that the Federal Reserve did not have a working model of inflation that was useful.  There was a recent paper by a very senior Federal Reserve economist, who is an old friend of mine and somebody I wrote a number of academic papers with, Dr. Jerome Rudd, who has been a bit of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>in the central banking and macroeconomic world where he said that lots of these theories that we have, that everything is driven by inflation expectations and central banks are able to anchor inflation expectations by going out and giving speeches, are all nonsense and nobody listens to central banks.<br/><br/>Dr. Rudd's concern, I guess, is that when people - to follow up on the final point Dr. Kavanagh made - get concerned about inflation it starts to influence their decision-making, and then it really matters.  It does not matter until they wake up and it is 5% and then it does matter.  The concern is the ECB's confidence and the Government's confidence that when the tides roll out we are just back in the same economy that we were and there just may be a day we wake up and realise that is not the case.</p></speech>

That is interesting.  I used to have a job where I had to listen to everything that the Central Bank did - the Fed, the ECB and the one in Britain - and I used to have to update my team.  It is not technically correct that nobody listens because that is what used to be my job.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was not necessarily listening to them but we will not go into that.</p> <p>  Dr. Kavanagh and Professor Whelan noted the inflationary problems arising from the extended supply chains but we have also been seeing, even before the onset of Covid, businesses engage in the process of nearshoring and reshoring.  In 2019, a Eurofound study pre-Covid found that an upward trend was evident and that the number of reshorings or nearshorings was likely to increase in the short term.  It seems, with Covid, and, obviously, with all the growing environmental concerns, that this trend could further increase.  Would they agree that could act as a further mitigating factor in the present inflation that we are seeing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ella Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#F00100"><p>There has been the issue of companies, as the Deputy said, reshoring and bringing production of their component parts onto newer sites and away from being dispersed or spread out.  They bring them together in a particular centre.  That is important.  There is a question about security around component parts now because for the first time we have seen the impact of a disruption to the supply chain.  It has introduced an uncertainty, as Professor Whelan mentioned, into the supply chain, which we have not been familiar with.  Whether companies react to that by building more security and ensuring they have the component parts closer to them and more readily available is a major consideration.  That might affect their investment decisions as to where they locate, etc.  That would be important.</p> <p>  If costs increase for businesses, one would expect that competition means they would look at the supply chain again and try to minimise costs.  They have been doing that over recent decades and it partially explains the really low inflation we have been seeing.  It is about how businesses react.  If their natural inclination is to try to increase efficiencies as much as possible, we might expect them to return to old patterns of behaviour.  For example, we have seen that, since the financial crisis, banks now hold a larger buffer of capital.  We might see the same thing with companies wanting to hold a larger buffer of raw materials, semi-finished goods and so on.  Over time, we might wonder whether that situation might change and they revert to being more concerned about efficiencies and competition.</p></speech>

Having lots of the supply chain in China and far-flung parts is cheap but not necessarily secure.  There is a trade-off there.  Different businesses will settle on different ways of coping with that but it seems likely some businesses will decide to source parts in Ireland or Europe rather than China because the security of their supply to those they supply and sell to is foremost for them.  That means it will not be as cheap and those costs will ultimately get passed on.  There is a lot of evidence that supply chains were about as stretched as we could let them be in terms of operating safely.  That is another element that is likely to show up in increased costs and possibly higher inflation than we saw in the past.  One of the many stories about low inflation over the past decade was sourcing things really cheaply in China.  To the extent that firms start to think twice about doing that, that force starts to unwind itself.</p></speech>

I was interested in the conversation and learned a great deal from it.  Professor Whelan expressed the view that inflation is largely externally driven.  There was another conversation earlier about the carbon tax.  What proportion is external and what proportion is internal?  Would it be a 60:40 split or is the split closer to 80:20?  What level of influence do domestic factors such as the carbon tax, the stay and spend scheme and the capital programme have?  We are seeing an ambitious capital programme which will be far bigger than any carbon tax or stay and spend scheme.</p></speech>

It is external either in the sense of coming from abroad, as in the case of higher energy prices which are a global issue, or higher goods prices, which applies to almost all goods we export, or else it is external in the sense of being beyond the control of the Government, such as some of what we are seeing with the pandemic.  Part of this base effect was, for instance, that one could buy an airline ticket in August, September or October last year, but people did not feel it was safe to travel and the right conditions were not in place.  Airlines were flying half empty and practically giving tickets away.  Now there are more people flying so tickets are more expensive.  It is the same with restaurants and hotels.  That is a contributing factor.  It is completely outside the control of governments in that they have to do what they do with restrictions and do what is best for public health.  The inflation we are seeing is largely a result of external developments and the pandemic recovery.</p> <p>  Across the world, there are places which have generated their own internally and policy driven inflation.  The most recent number hot off the presses today is that the US consumer price index, CPI, for October is over 6.3% year on year.  In addition to the global factors we are talking about, that is clearly driven by a very aggressive fiscal response, which includes multiple rounds of stimulus cheques mailed to people that are burning a hole in their pockets.  We have not done anything like that here.</p> <p>  The capital spending programme is something I would flag for the next couple of years.  I am not referring to any individual item but if we add it all up, we seen that the Government wants to make public transport infrastructure investment, build roads and make lots of investment in public housing and climate-related energy areas.  When one starts adding it up, one wonders where all the builders for this will come from.  Once the economy starts to recover, we have to think about whether it could overheat.  We can see domestic overheating.  I refer to the first figure I provided in my briefing and the wording I used.  I indicated inflation was higher than we have seen since prior to 2008.  In Ireland, in the couple of years prior to 2008, inflation was running at 5%.  It was a bit funny to go back and look at it because I do not remember people talking about it.  The times were so good and everybody's wage increases were so far ahead of inflation that I do not remember much talk about it.  That was internally driven inflation.  It was driven by an overheated economy and, in particular, an overheated construction sector.  We can do it but it is not what is happening now.</p></speech>

I would watch what is happening there and whether wages are increasing.  At the moment, we have shortages in parts of the labour market.  There is a lot of what we would call frictional unemployment.  Whether it is due to that or not, there are many vacancies out there and wages are being driven up by that.</p><p>I would watch what was happening to wages.  We should also determine whether higher inflation is becoming a feature of wage negotiations.  In other words, have wage negotiations become more conscious of inflation?  That is probably what I would be watching.</p></speech>

What does "sustained high" mean?  Are we looking at some time next summer or the year after if we continue at this rate?  What sort of sustained high would drive up interest rates?</p> <p>  There have already been wage increases in some sectors, for example, the technology sector where people are working from home and can now compete for jobs in Dublin, Cork, New York or wherever, allowing them to increase their wages.  While this is only happening in some sectors, it is happening nonetheless.  There is no talking of inflation driving those wage increases.  Rather, it is down to the scarcity of labour.</p> <p>  Will one of the witnesses discuss the sustained high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#G00300"><p>It is about the timing of the ECB's actions.  The ECB will not move quickly.  Professor Lane's strongly worded interventions over the past few days can be taken as indicative of the stance of the ECB's president, Ms Christine Lagarde, and the majority of its governing council.  The ECB will not start raising interest rates immediately as the first policy reaction.  Currently, it is still pursuing its quantitative easing programmes, its purchasing of government and corporate bonds and other measures.  All of this is contributing to lower interest rates for government borrowing and so on.  The first step the ECB will take is winding those programmes down.  It will not shut them down immediately.  Rather, it will announce a schedule by which it will slow the pace of purchases and then stop them.  After that, it will think about raising interest rates.  I suggest that next summer would be the very earliest that we would see an actual interest rate increase in the wild.  If I knew, though, then I would run my own bond fund and collect lots of money.</p> <p>  Suffice it to say that for many people who are on variable rate mortgages or relying on the very cheap finance conditions of recent years, an interest rate increase could be a shock.  If it comes to pass, we will probably find that many financial institutions that have taken positions that are dependent on interest rates being very low for a long time will be caught on the hop.  Relative to what people have expected the ECB to do, it would be a fast turnaround if it was raising interest rates by next summer.  Perhaps it can do that and avoid engineering a recession.  There are plenty of historical examples of central banks raising interest rates to squeeze inflation out of the system and recession being a by-product.  When I was an economist in short pants, that was the stereotypical recession.  It was a boom-bust cycle.  There was inflation during the boom, a central bank stepped in to take away the punch bowl and then there was a recession.  As such, there would be a number of concerns.  Knowing that a relatively fast changing of pace in monetary policy could be damaging is one reason the ECB is so reluctant to talk now about doing that.</p></speech>

I am a little bit of a pessimist in this regard.  I raised this question numerous times in the run up to the financial collapse.  Our guests might not have read the Official Report, but I raised this question time and again.  We were cautioned not to raise it lest it cause a run on the currency, on investment or on confidence.  I felt that we were heading towards a disaster, so I asked whether the fundamentals of the economy were on a safe footing.  That was the only way I could get around the scares.  I got one good answer that told me "No", and then the whole thing fell down.  Everything was denied afterwards and we know what happened.</p> <p>  House prices are a major contributor to inflation and have been for some considerable time.  They will ultimately be a contributor to demands for higher wages, at which point the spiral will take off.  I am willing to be convinced that current inflation will only last for a short duration and we will see a reduction during the second quarter of 2022, but if it does not happen that way, we could be in for a shock.  Some means will have to be found to arrest the trend in inflation.</p> <p>  Professor J. K. Galbraith used to say that, if we stimulated the economy, we would inevitably need to introduce price controls in order not to contribute to inflation.  That is laughable to everyone nowadays, but we had price controls in the 1970s and 1980s because we needed to.  There was no other mechanism available and inflation took off along a serious tangent.  Our guests will remember how bank interest rates eventually increased to 17% or 18%.  I remember dealing with people who were charged 25% penalty rates and so forth.  At that stage, nothing could happen and the economy was in a downward spiral.  I hope that does not happen again.</p> <p>  I will pose a question, but never mind "on the one hand and on the other hand".  Let us take both hands out of this, put them up and say what we can do now to arrest this inflation before it gets too serious without permanently damaging the economy and causing a slump.  That is my first question.  I would be happy for anyone to take it.</p></speech>

I would not recommend price and wage controls.  I do not believe that system, in particular price controls, works because we would just be trying to keep a lid on prices.  Given the fact that prices are externally determined anyway, controls would be difficult to impose.  Since we are operating in a market economy, it would be difficult to do.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Professor Whelan and give the Deputy's question a little more thought, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#H00100"><p>Let us be honest.  Ours is a small, open economy and most of the goods we buy are coming in from the rest of the world.  We do not set those prices.  The Government has no magic formula for getting low gas or oil prices.  Being part of the euro means some of the tools we had in the past whereby we could have focused on domestic inflation are gone.  We do not set our own monetary policy, we cannot set interest rates high because inflation is high in Ireland and we do not have an exchange rate that we can adjust.  There are price and wage controls but, historically, they do not really work, and there is lots of evidence from the 1970s of price and wage controls being introduced and not working.   We have a micro-study of our own going on right now with regard to rent controls, which seem to be a bit of a leaky sieve in that rent inflation seems to be proceeding apace, even with the various controls that are in place.  That is relatively consistent with what has happened with price and wage controls in the past.</p> <p>  We are left with a sort of boring answer, which is prudent management of fiscal policy and to try to avoid using fiscal policy to have the economy get over-stimulated.  When we look back at the period of 2008-09 or prior to that, perhaps a lot of the public expenditure and capital expenditure that was done during that period - all of the motorways that were built and so on - could have been done at a slower pace and we might have had more money left later to smooth things out.  That is a major instrument that we have but we are a bit like a golfer with one club.</p> <p>  In terms of the housing market more generally, we have macroprudential policies in place to try to prevent a collapse.  Borrowers are not given 100% mortgages anymore and they have much more equity in their homes than they did, so we are less likely to get into a negative equity situation.  We are not quite on the verge.  I do not think the economy is as unbalanced or on the verge of collapse as it was back then, but, at the same time, if we do see this jump in inflation, I do not want to overstate how much control the Government really has of it.</p></speech>

There is one point I would like to make.  To go back to the fact that inflation was so low for so long prior to the pandemic, if we are talking about an inflation rate around 2%, which Professor Whelan referred to earlier, I want to reiterate the point that it would not be a major concern for us and, in fact, the ECB would like inflation to come back up to 2%.  That is one point to make.  We are probably thinking more in terms of the actual level of inflation but we do need some inflation in the system.  It is the number that we are probably most concerned about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#H00300"><p>I am not concerned about one element of inflation so much, having regard to the experiences of the past.  It is when there are a number of competing elements, all of which contribute to inflation, that I would get worried, and I mentioned house prices for starters, although there are other issues.  However, there are some areas where we could control our own destiny to some extent, for instance, in regard to energy.  We could have produced more energy, particularly wind energy, over the last number of years, and while there are those who would say that is linked to international energy prices, that is not necessarily the case.  If we are able to buy it from ourselves at a lower rate, it has to make some beneficial contribution in the context of inflation.  That is the kind of thing we need to be looking at now because energy is a critical issue.  If we do what has to be done in that area and produce energy at a competitive rate, at least it will be of benefit to our own market.  If the time comes when we can sell it to others, that will be of benefit to our economy as well.</p> <p>  I do not want to delay the meeting and I have to attend another meeting where I have to ask questions also.  I will finish by saying that I believe we need to watch it very carefully.  All possibilities need to be examined with the objective in mind of arresting the trend in inflation.  If the trend continues for too long, it will create problems and reversing it will be that much harder.  We could curtail credit and we could increase taxes, and all of these things have been done before, but all of them will also slow down the economy, of course, so that remains to be seen.  I would hope that, from the golf bag we are selecting the club from, we take something out of that bag as soon as possible with a view to achieving at least a target that we can manage in the future, that of inflation.</p></speech>

What Deputy Durkan said with regard to what we need to do is interesting.  One of the issues I would like to ask about is energy costs.  Would the witnesses say some of our energy costs are related to the fact we have not put in place bridging measures when trying to get rid of fossil fuels, turf burning and so on?  There has been a rush of blood to stop all of that bad stuff without actually having the transitional arrangements in place, so we have left ourselves with a gap and we are now at the mercy of Russia and other places to supply us with gas.  The Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo has been in decline for a number of years yet there has been a reluctance and we have frightened away gas and oil exploration, when I think we have time to run on that yet.  It seems that we have had a rush of blood to the head and we have got rid of stuff.  By the same token, if someone is buying a new car, whether electric or diesel, as was mentioned earlier, they will not sell their car until the new car is on the forecourt and they can go and collect it.  We have created a gap which has created a shortage of energy, and this is also the case internationally, I believe.  Now, we are relying on people who hold the strings and who may not be very adept at sharing what they have, or who see potential in it.  I would like to get the comments of both witnesses on this philosophy that I hold.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ella Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#H00500"><p>That is certainly true globally.  We have seen that in terms of the increasing demand for gas as it is considered to be the bridging fuel between the heavy fossil fuels and more renewable energy.  China&rsquo;s and India's move towards gas has certainly increased the demand for gas on global markets and has put pressure upwards on the price of gas.  That is on the one hand.  On the other, what it suggests is that, if prices are increasing like that and if that increases dependency on particular sources of gas, it is all the more important that one begins to move towards removing the dependence on these energy fuels.  The argument one could make is that it is really important to start reorienting away from those and to focus in on more renewable energies, and that is a matter of some importance and some urgency if the energy market continues to behave as it is currently.</p> <p>  That is a particular view.  I can understand why one would like to temper that move but it is almost giving us a reason or an incentive, to put it that way.  The prices are rising as there is increasing demand for gas and other fossil fuels, and that is acting as an incentive to move away from those sources.  Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a move back towards fossil fuels and the reopening of stations that use fossil fuels.  It suggests to me a greater impetus towards renewables and moving in that direction, and moving away from dependence on fossil fuels and carbon fuels, given these very volatile movements.</p></speech>

Whether it is oil or gas, we have always been externally dependent.  I am by no means an expert in energy markets, but I continually read about this great opportunity for us to have more energy security coming from offshore wind.  However, I also read that developments there seem to be disappointingly slow.  A large Norwegian company recently pulled out of being involved in offshore wind in Ireland, disappointed by the slow pace of progress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#J00200"><p>That is exactly my point.  We have the potential to be self-sufficient and an international net supplier.  We have the potential on the west coast of Ireland, but we are only now developing our national maritime planning legislation to work out a system by which we do it, which seems should have been done 20 years ago.  We did not do it and all of sudden, in a rush of blood to the head to get rid of stuff, two power stations have been closed down and probably rightly so.  However, our current shortage of energy does not give us the impetus to do something about it because we are punishing the people as we do that and turning them against the idea of climate action by penalising them.  I am not talking about carbon tax, but increasing costs.</p> <p>  The other area I have concern about with inflation is farming.  The cost of farmers' inputs is rising.  Fertiliser has gone up from &euro;425 per tonne, to more than &euro;800 per tonne.  The farming community is not a price giver.  It has to take whatever price is there and, therefore, it cannot add the price of fertiliser to the price of the bullock, sheep or pig going to the market.  It has to take whatever price the market will give it on the day.  That is a significant problem.  We will have a reduction in output because people will not buy as much fertiliser as they will not be able to afford it.  Consequently, there will be a reduction in food supply and more inflation when the consumer wants to buy over the counter.  The farmer will not be dictating the price.  It will be dictated in other areas.  I have an issue with that.</p> <p>  We have the cost of construction materials and labour, which is going up, but also the cost of our regulation in terms of the way we want our houses built now.  The cost of building passive homes, planning permission and connecting to utilities is driving up the costs further and further.  Regardless of what we do, people cannot afford a mortgage because of the rules on the mortgage one can have, affordability and one's ability to pay back.  We are creating a perfect storm in the construction industry.  With construction inflation, public works contracts have been signed as fixed-price contracts for the next three years, which will drive people out of business and drive good people to the UK to seek business, rather than try to do business here, where we have such a system at play.</p> <p>  When one increases wages in line with inflation, everything goes up in price, but so does Government tax take.  It comes back to the Government through VAT, PAYE, PRSI and USC.  We should not worry too much about inflation, except when it goes at a pace faster than which we can keep pace and we are running to stand still or end up further back in the chain a year later.  The idea of increasing interest rates is fine, but people who have mortgages and are meeting them fairly well will find themselves under pressure.  There is a positivity.  Businesses do not have the same debt levels as they did during the bust of 2007 to 2008.  Companies are stronger, but there are many unknowns.  Is there a silver bullet the witnesses would throw to the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to steady the ship from our perspective and that of the nation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#J00300"><p>I have given one golf club analogy and unfortunately, it is not a silver-bullet-shaped golf club.  I will echo some of what the Deputy has said.  Economists sometimes underplay inflation as a problem.  They say inflation is 4% to 5%, but if people are, on average, getting wage increases of 4% to 5%, then everybody comes out of it not really worse off and it is an annoyance prices are going up.  People get annoyed prices are going up, but think they deserve that 4% wage increase.  The problem is no individual or business is the average person or business.  As the Deputy pointed out with farming, when one sees inflationary pressures and increased costs, businesses that can pass those costs on will cope fine and those that cannot, will not cope fine.</p> <p>  However, there are analogies beyond business.  People on fixed incomes which will not go up with inflation will do badly.  Somebody who has an investment portfolio on the stock market will do better because the firms charging these higher prices will end up getting higher profits.  The higher levels of inflation we have seen over the past few years unleash a set of distributional questions.  Distributional and sectoral questions are not easily dealt with.  If the high inflation of the coming years is tough on the farming sector, there may be a European approach with the CAP, farming subsidies and so on.  This is another area in which the Government has left Brussels as the major player, as opposed to the Department of agriculture.</p></speech>

I did not hear their earlier contributions because I was at another committee next door.  It was a bit frustrating.  I apologise in advance if I repeat questions.  What do the witnesses think of what I would favour to deal with energy price rises, rent and house price increases and other forms of inflation which will adversely impact on our economy and society?  I favour controls.  Controls, in and of themselves, do not solve all the problems.  If there is a genuine lack of supply in an area, the controls do not solve the problem because of either genuine shortages or as I expect it is much of the time, bad planning, whether it is a failure to plan or allowing market cycles to determine the supply of certain things.</p><p>Having said all that, and if we take housing inflation as an example, while I do not think rent controls solve all the problems, as a stopgap until we get planning right on housing and we can deliver the supply that would at least deal with the shortage, it is a legitimate thing to do.  The other aspect is if we need to subsidise certain things because they are just too important to allow them get out of the reach of ordinary people then we must subsidise them.  We accept that logic in some areas but we often reject it in others.  I would argue we must subsidise certain things because we just have to have them.  Thus if public transport costs are getting too expensive, one cannot keep letting them get more expensive, especially if one wants to get people out of their cars.  One must say we are going to subsidise to make it cheap and affordable and that we are going to do the same with housing.  Of course, energy becomes more controversial because there is a climate imperative but also an imperative to ensure ordinary people can heat their homes.  I would be interested in the economists' views but I certainly think controlling energy prices at this point is a legitimate thing to do, however it is done.  That might be holding off on carbon taxes or just controlling the prices.  I would like to hear the economists' thoughts on using price controls, essentially, to deal with these problems.  They would not be a silver bullet but a mechanism, until we get the planning side right, to deliver things that can ensure shortages are not generating inflation or bottlenecks, for that matter, in particular areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ella Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#K00200"><p>One of the issues with controls is they can actually have the effect of reducing supply.  If one has a rent control in place, economists would argue this could have the effect of reducing the amount of accommodation actually supplied on to the market, even as is, even at this moment.  That would be one of the arguments against using rent controls.  At the same time, by having a lower rent one could have, dare I see it, a much greater demand.  I personally believe the issue really comes down to increasing the supply, focusing in on that and trying as much as possible to increase the supply of housing accommodation because it clearly is one of the major issues behind this and behind what we are seeing with rents.  To reiterate the point about rental costs, in the CPI information is given about rental increases.  What we have seen is although rental prices came down somewhat at the start of the pandemic, we now see them accelerating once again.  Even if there are controls in place or some measure controlling them, there might be ways of bypassing that.  We are definitely seeing rental rates increasing again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#K00300"><p>To that I add price controls are a natural response when one sees high inflation.  Inflation is prices going up so let us go straight for the target and stop the prices going up.  I am sure the Deputy and I could have a great debate about the role of prices in the market system and we could talk about Hayek versus Marx and so on, and all that good stuff.  Beyond the philosophical issues, the practical point is in general the evidence shows price controls do not work and that people get around them.  Businesses get around them and people are willing to pay more for things to get reasonable supplies.  Almost every place around the world where one has seen high rates of inflation, eventually they go and implement price controls of some sort and they never really seem to work.  I also point out that in this country, some of the background discussion that has been had on the current rent controls concerns the legal limits on the State's ability to intervene with people's businesses and their property rights in terms of what they can actually do, how they run their business and how they use their assets.  On widespread price controls, even if one did think there was a man in the Department of Finance who knew the right price for everything - and even the Department would not claim there is such a man or woman - then even if that is something we thought was desirable it is unlikely to be legal.</p> <p>  However, we have to take things like higher energy prices.  On energy prices, we cannot on the one hand send people off to COP26 and talk the talk about global climate and then say now is not the time to continue with the carbon tax and that it should now be suspended and so on.  Given how poor our performance has been on climate change targets it is the wrong policy approach to roll back carbon taxes at this point and for this reason.  That is not to say we do not look at the distributional implications or the effect on people and the cost of people heating their homes.  That is why we have fuel allowance.  We should keep a very close look at what happens with energy prices in the next couple of months.  If the fuel allowance that was provided for in the budget is not big enough then it should be changed and increased.  We should always accompany any analysis of carbon taxes or energy-related policies with a distributional analysis of how it affects the poorest and what we can do with the money that has been raised by these taxes to offset that.  There are other cases and clear cases where governments should set prices below market level and I fully endorse Deputy Boyd Barrett's call for subsidised public transport.  Of course if we want people to use public transport more then it should be an awful lot cheaper than it is.</p></speech>

I am glad I agree with Professor Whelan on something there, namely, the last point.  I respectfully disagree with the economists on the issue of rents, house prices and so on.  I will make the obvious point.  I made it to the Taoiseach and have made it several times in this debate as supply, supply, supply is always the answer.  Forget about the debate between Marx and Hayek, as interesting as that is.  I point to our own recent experience.  When we had the greatest supply of housing in the history of the State by a long chalk, that is, during the Celtic tiger period, when between 70,000 and 90,000 houses and apartments were being built every year, prices did not go down at any point.  They consistently rose.  That is because the market and the people who were providing had no interest whatsoever in prices falling.  None.  To my mind, they will not, of their own volition, increase supply to the point at which prices drop.  Why would they?  They would be mad to do that, from their point of view.  However, from society's point of view the control they have over something as absolutely critical as housing is just not acceptable.  I agree with the economists that controls, in and of themselves, are not the silver bullet.  However, where the market has clearly failed, as it has in housing, one must do something to get something as basic as housing to a level that is affordable.  At the moment it is simply is not and if one says wait for the supply to come on stream one will be waiting a very long time.  I would like to hear the economists' answer to how they riddle that one but it seems to me one has to intervene.  To an extent, I take Professor Whelan's point about the constitutional provisions around private property.  It is interesting how that defence suddenly collapsed when rent pressure zones, RPZs, were brought in and so on.</p><p> I would like to see all this legal advice from the Attorney General.  I am less than convinced about that excuse.  The Government has promised a referendum on housing.  Let us get on with it and have a referendum in which private property rights could be diluted in order to vindicate something as basic as the right to housing.</p><p> Regarding energy, it is not an opinion but a fact that the rich are the greatest producers of carbon emissions, so whether geographically or socially, the poor are being punished for the crimes of the rich in destroying our planet.  However, we are saying that we should keep loading a self-evidently regressive measure onto the shoulders of the poor.  The rich who cause the problems will not be particularly bothered by the carbon tax increases, so there is a real problem with regard to justice, which I believe is central.  The climate objectives cannot be delivered if justice is not at the heart of it.  It will turn most people off the climate agenda.  We cannot afford to do that.</p></speech>

We would expect today that in light of the sort of regulations that have been put in place by the Central Bank, there should be more control over the expansion of credit.  Even though supply would increase, it would not necessarily lead to an increase in house prices.  The situation is quite different today compared with before the crisis.</p> <p>  Professor Whelan highlighted fuel prices and their impact on people on fixed incomes, and the associated distribution issues.  They are key.  Consequently, the fuel allowance should be looked at again in light of the increase in energy prices if they continue to increase.  If they continue to be volatile, they might come back down again, and there would therefore not be a long-term effect on individuals.  However, if they continue to increase, that would suggest a review of those fuel allowances is necessary.</p></speech>

They contribute to inflation because expensive housing leads to people having to look for higher wages to be able to afford where they live.  That affects costs throughout the economy in many ways.  Regarding Government intervention, we clearly have a housing market that is dysfunctional in many ways and many different things could be done.  Regarding supply capacity, I note today's Daft.ie report on the number of rental properties available across the country.  It is extremely low.  There are very few places for people to rent.  I see this as an academic.  Our students struggle to find places to rent.  Colleagues coming from other countries to work with us struggle to find places to live.  Availability is not a heap of laughs for people looking to buy their own properties either.  We need to start by noting that there is clearly a scarcity of housing in the country relative to what we need.  We have not repealed the law of economics which states that when something is scarce, it will be more expensive.  One reason that rents are so high is because it is so difficult to get rental properties as a result of their being so scarce.  The same applies to house purchase costs.  There is a talking point that, although we built many houses in the 2000s and somehow the prices went up, that is somehow irrelevant and the scarcity that we see has nothing to do with the high prices.  I strongly disagree with that.  It would be great if we had more supply, with much affordable public housing.  The only issue that I have with that is that it is expensive.</p> <p>  One should look at the Government's capacity within the dreaded EU fiscal rules.  I suspect that in the past, the Deputy might have heard me complaining about the fiscal rules, but they exist.  The ESRI gives a figure of 33,000 housing units being needed a year.  That is probably an underestimate.  The reality is that we will need the private sector to produce units as well as public housing being built.  It is not a case of and-or, but rather, as with the girl from the meme emoji, "Why not both?"  That is what we need to do.</p></speech>

I apologise for having been in and out.  I was at another meeting.  I apologise in advance if I ask a question that somebody else has asked.  I have read Professor Whelan's views on helicopter money, in the form of vouchers, to stimulate certain sectors of the economy.  Is there any area of the economy where he feels it might work without affected inflation?  Is there any way to mitigate the effect on inflation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#L00500"><p>I am always happy to discuss helicopter money.  The ECB will never approve it as a policy.  I have thought about this.  One of my areas of expertise is trying to figure out what is or is not legal for the ECB to do.  If I ever got the chance to brief the governing council on this, I would try to explain that it is probably is legal and can be done.  Its considered opinion is that this is fiscal policy.  Everybody ends up being sent a cheque.  It looks much like a tax cut or tax refund, so the ECB feels that it is a fiscal policy, when it is supposed to be dealing with monetary policy.  I do not think that we will ever see it.  The ECB has created low financing conditions over the past decade.  It has made it not just free for Governments to borrow but instead Governments, including our own, have been able to borrow at negative interest rates.  The ECB has created those conditions.</p> <p>  Looking at the pandemic response, we did not need the helicopters because the Government could source money at will.  In a sense, the ECB has created almost helicopter money-like conditions by the back door, by making it cheap to borrow.  That will probably continue, even if we see an increase in inflation over the next couple of years or higher interest rates.  I expect sovereign debt borrowing costs to be low, which raises questions about whether we can borrow more.  The recent ESRI paper by Professor McQuinn focused on whether we can just borrow more to spend on public housing, which brings us back to the dreaded fiscal rules.  They have not gone away.</p></speech>

In the European context, what it has always meant is that when inflation is above 2%, the European Central Bank, ECB, has had its hair on fire, so to speak, to try to get inflation down and when it is below 2% it has not always been as worried.  The ECB has been more concerned in recent years following many years of being below target to at least be seen to be pursuing expansionary policy to meet its target.  That is one of the issues.  If people are thinking about what will happen to prices in the next number of years, if the inflation target is 2%, one would think prices will go up by 2% per year and in five years time, they will be up 10% effectively.  With the way the ECB has implemented inflation targeting, it has not worked like that.  Prices are up less than 10% and then it is hard to forecast how much of a shortfall there will be in that respect.</p> <p>  What we have seen recently with the Federal Reserve is that it has moved to what is called average inflation targeting, which is basically a commitment that if inflation is below its target of 2% for some period of time, it will then accept a period of inflation above 2% so that when it is averaged over, one gets 2%.  That is closer to what economists would call price level targeting, making the price level predictable over time.  I have always felt that is a better policy.  </p> <p>  I would note the ECB's monetary policy strategy review.  It spent 18 months reviewing its monetary policy strategy and announced with great fanfare the new strategy during the summer.  It explicitly said that it is not its policy.  It more or less has the Federal Reserve's old policy of targeting 2% inflation.  Perhaps there are more strategy reviews to come and it will get it right the next time.</p></speech>

I will allow members to come back in if they would raise their hands to indicate they would like to do so.  I would like to follow up with a question of my own.  One of the questions I had related to the fiscal rules, which have already been raised.  We discussed to some extent the expectation that inflation will be a relatively short-run thing, that it will not last for a long period.  I am mindful the European Commission has just relaunched its review of EU economic governance.  First, as a mini question, I am curious as to whether experts like our guests submit to those open call consultations.  I am interested to know what is the voice coming from Ireland.  Is it simply from Government or do experts like our guests get involved in the fiscal rules discussion at that level?   The other question I have is that if this level of inflation is not a short-run thing, if it is still with us when the fiscal rules may click back into place in 2023, what mechanisms would they expect to see, or could we see, within it to address issues of continuing inflation?  Dr. Kavanagh might respond to those questions.</p></speech>

Clearly, that is its objective, which is all about achieving price stability and, as Professor Whelan said, achieving a 2% inflation target.  One would expect monetary policy would be geared towards achieving the inflation target.  If do not know if Professor Whelan has anything further to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karl Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111000002#M00800"><p>Yes, a couple of things.  I am not aware of any Irish economist who has yet participated in making a submission to this review from the European Commission.  In general, we are all busy and it is difficult to find time or to know what impact an individual input from an academic would have.  I play a role with the European Parliament engaging with monetary policy in the ECB and making advice and recommendations there.  I do that on a more formal level.  That is to what I tend to largely restrict myself.</p> <p>  On the issues of what will happen with inflation and what will happen with the debate on the fiscal rules, they will not be totally separate.  The ECB sees price stability as its goal but the mood music around the discussion over the next year on the reintroduction of the fiscal rules will be affected by inflation.  Clearly, some countries would like to reintroduce the fiscal rules as they have existed previously and to have a quick and fast reintroduction versus quite a number of countries that would like to see a milder version of the rules.  If it looks as though inflation is possibly getting out of control European-wide, then, to use economic parlance, the hawks will have a better argument than the doves that fiscal policy needs to be playing its role in constraining the economy.  </p> <p>  The greater problem with the fiscal rules is that they are very badly designed.  They have those two numbers, the 60% debt-to-GDP ratio and the 3% deficit.  Somebody plucked them out of the air in the late 1980s or early 1990s.  They might have been appropriate then but they are not now and that is the problem.  Ideally, what we would need is some form of treaty change but a treaty change in any controversial area is extremely difficult to executive.  In practice, we are seeing proposals around, for example, while the 60% ratio is formally in the treaty the Commission would really only focus on encouraging countries whose debt ratios are above 100% debt-to-GDB ratio.  We may see things like that but this will be one of the big European bun fights over the next year or so.</p></speech>

I read both our guests' submissions with great interest.  In fairness, we have covered many of the issues they raised.  Could either of them outline in greater detail, as I am a layperson and not from an economics background, the relationship between Government capital spending and inflation?  Obviously, I understand as inflation rises, our capital commitments will bear the brunt of inflation just like anybody else&rsquo;s spending commitments.  Is there a possibility of the opposite effect whereby capital expenditure can increase the risk of further inflation.  Could they outline that for me?  Who would like to take that question?</p></speech>

They are a part of inflation.  Another way of looking at it is a more long-term perspective.  If there is an increase in capital expenditure on infrastructural developments, transportation or whatever, it can have more benefits longer term.  In other words, it improves efficiencies in the economy.  Therefore, it is an important supply side dimension to policy.  It improves the supply side, the productive potential of the economy.</p><p>The latter can help to ameliorate some of the inflationary forces that can be there.</p><p> At the same time, there could be a further increase in construction costs because of Government demand for more materials.  These capital expenditures can lead to a multiplier effect which, in turn, can lead to an increase in demand that can drive up prices and inflation.  There is not only the initial effect of inflation increasing construction costs but there can be a multiplier effect associated with that.  It can be quite strong in the domestic economy because if everything is being used domestically that multiplier effect is much stronger in the rest of the economy.  If people are spending and buying more that is driving up costs and prices more and that multiplier effect can be much stronger within the domestic economy when all the costs are within the country.</p></speech>

By 2007 we were building 100,000 residential units per year and people who remember that time will recall that kids were dropping out of school to become builders and that there was a song about the breakfast roll.  It was very visible throughout the country that the construction industry was dominating.  It went to the point where we were importing lots of builders from eastern Europe to help build these units, and then those guys had to live somewhere as well.  We ended up with costs and wages going up a lot and the economy was overstimulating.  We started to see manufacturing businesses leaving Ireland because costs were too high here as a result of the fact that we were spending loads of money building houses and selling them to each other.</p> <p>  We will not end up with 100,000 residential units being built per year again but we have relatively ambitious public housing plans, we will see a private sector response and we have plans for retrofitting, building wind farms and constructing further motorways, as well as plans for expanding public transport.  Builders have to do this work and we could end up with a more varied portfolio of capital spending than there was in the mid-2000s but we will still end up with the economy overheating and we will drive away some of the same types of businesses that were driven away before.  When that bubble popped the last time it was a sore point that so many of those businesses left and it was a slow process to win a lot of those jobs back.  The economy can get a bit unbalanced at times and setting public capital spending to meet priorities is important, but we have to think about our capacity to deliver those priorities without triggering inflation.</p></speech>

I lived through the 2008 and 2009 crash as an architect.  There was a hollowing out of the industry and firms collapsed.  It is the same kind of people who build all that stuff and do all that work so that is a concern.</p> <p>  This is our first of three sessions on inflation.  It has been fascinating.

I apologise to the committee for being a few moments late.  I had to move some financial resolutions and Supplementary Estimates in the House.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  From their outset in 2013, Ireland has constructively engaged with the global tax discussions and we have already significantly reformed our tax system to be in line with emerging international norms.  Last month, Ireland joined 135 other countries in reaching a global two pillar agreement on addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalisation of the global economy.</p> <p>  Ireland did not join the interim agreement in July, primarily because it did not provide sufficient certainty with regard to what any globally agreed rate would be.  My priority in recent months was to secure the necessary changes in the October agreement and to ensure our strategic interests would be protected.</p> <p>  There are two pillars to the agreement.  Pillar 1 will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer.  This means a proportion of corporate tax revenue streams that now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the exchequers of other countries when implemented.  Pillar 2 will see the adoption of a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinational companies with global revenues in excess of &euro;750 million.</p> <p>  It is important to set out why I believe Ireland should be in the agreement.  First, Ireland is one of the most highly globalised countries in the world.  We have clearly benefited from the investment and good jobs that have accompanied the decision of many multinationals to make Ireland their home.  It is vital we adapt and evolve in line with new international rules so that we can continue to be a world-class destination for inward investment.  Second, while the agreement introduces a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for companies that have a turnover greater than &euro;750 million, my intervention was instrumental in ensuring the rate is moderate and will continue to permit tax competition within guardrails, recognising that other countries advocated for higher rates.  In addition, removing a proposal for "at least" helps deliver the predictability that is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s offering.  Third, we will retain the 12.5% corporation tax rate for the 95% of companies in Ireland that are out of scope of the agreement.  Discussions with the European Commission confirmed a forthcoming directive on pillar 2 will be faithful to the agreement.  Further, we can continue to allow our tax system to support innovation and growth, including through the use of research and development tax credits.</p> <p>  I have long signalled there will be a cost to Ireland signing up to this agreement.  My Department and Revenue have estimated the cost in terms of tax receipts forgone could be up to &euro;2 billion in the medium term.  This costing will be kept under review as the critical technical discussions proceed.</p> <p>  It is important, however, to consider the very real risks associated with staying outside the process.  As a small, open economy within the EU, we have strong ties to the US and many of the other G20 countries.  This makes it essential we stay in line with key international accords.  Further, if Ireland was not in the agreement, we would lose influence in respect of the critical and ongoing technical discussions.  The design of the global minimum tax means that if Ireland were outside the agreement, other jurisdictions could apply a top-up tax to the subsidiary of a multinational if it were taxed below the global minimum effective rate.</p> <p>  I believe the upsides of being in such a historic international agreement far outweigh the downsides of staying out. This has been a difficult and complex decision but I believe it is the right one, and I am confident Ireland will remain competitive into the future and we will continue to be an attractive location when multinational companies look to invest overseas.</p> <p>  I am in the Chairman's hands here.  Would he like me to deal with questions on corporation tax now?  I can continue with my opening statement on SEAR afterwards and deal with the questions then.</p></speech>

I am conscious the last time the Minister was before the committee, there was agreement in July of a rate of at least 15%.  The Minister made the case he was still convinced that we could secure the 12.5% rate within the agreement.  It has not turned out that way.  However, I believe the 15% rate still allows us to be competitive and is still an area which makes us a very attractive place to invest, but we also need to look at some of the other competitiveness issues, not least housing, childcare, infrastructure and connectivity on which we are lagging way behind.</p> <p>  I want to ask about some of the detail.  How many companies will come under scope of this agreement?  Pillar 1 has a threshold of &euro;20 billion turnover.  How many companies that are tax resident here, either headquartered or subsidiaries, will come under the scope of pillar 1?</p> <p>  The threshold for pillar one 1 change within seven years of its operation and will decrease from &euro;20 billion turnover to &euro;10 billion.  How many companies are anticipated will fall under the scope of pillar 1 then?</p> <p>  On pillar 2, which has an annual turnover of &euro;750 million, how many companies that are tax resident here, either headquartered or subsidiaries, will come under its scope?</p></speech>

That will be kept under review, as he said, but we can all agree that number is well outdated at this stage.  That was an earlier number from even before the July agreement, which gave greater clarity.  Now we have the final agreement and more clarity.  Surely, given the fact that we now have an effective minimum tax rate of 15%, that number is going to change because there will be an increase in tax receipts to the State.  The July agreement stated that the proportion of profits above 10% that would be allocated would be between 20% and 25%.  It is now settled at 25%, which could take a hit on the other end.  Are there any updated estimates as to the impact now?  I am sure the Department of Finance was running the numbers during the negotiations, and afterwards, as to what a 15% effective tax rate would look like from a State revenue point of view.</p></speech>

We are currently engaged in 11 days of meetings on the technical nature of the agreement on the rate.  I anticipate that, at the end of this year and early next year, a huge amount of technical work will develop within the OECD on the reallocation of taxing rights.  The point at which I can offer a revision of the revenue impact will be when the detailed nature of this agreement is negotiated and made clearer.  At the moment, I anticipate that it will be the second quarter of next year before we are in a position to revise the forecast we have, if at all.  While some things are clearer in this agreement than they were in July, the Deputy will observe that it is still a very high-level agreement with a huge amount of fleshing out to be done.  At this point in time, my officials are advising me that they do not have enough further detail to revise the forecast.</p> <p>  I wish to deal with a point that is implicit in the Deputy's question.  He is correct that when we discussed this matter earlier in the year I was not acknowledging any revenue gain that might have come from the rate going up.  I want to acknowledge that if we are going into a discussion on that point.  Likewise, the area of revenue loss for us was in the pillar relating to the reallocation of taxing rights.  The technical work on that is going to begin, at the earliest, later this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#C00600"><p>I fully appreciate that.  Pillar 1 was always where the &euro;2 billion figure came from.  The Department of Finance estimates never envisaged what the rate would be, and rightly so because there were negotiations going on.  It was always factored in at 12.5%.  We now know that it will be a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, so it not just about the tax rate but the effective tax rate.  That is obviously going to boost the coffers of our Exchequer.  There is no doubt about that.  The only danger to the Exchequer revenues would be a future pipeline of investment or companies deciding to move jurisdictions, which is thankfully not on the cards.  While the technical assessment may not be done, and I appreciate that there is quite a bit of detail to be worked out, surely that &euro;2 billion figure is going to come down.  It could come down quite substantially given that the companies that will come under the scope of pillar 2 make up nearly 50% of our corporation tax rate in this State.  They are currently paying a headline rate of 12.5% and an effective rate of less than that and now they will have to pay a 15% effective tax rate.  Surely there is going to be a boost to the Exchequer coffers due to that.</p></speech>

If the rate goes up, assuming no change in our revenue base, that in isolation will lead to higher revenue.  That assumption is correct.  I have always said that where we will lose revenue will not be on the change in the rate; it will be due to the reallocation of taxing rights.  A key issue that I have always been focused on is whether we can we get a dynamic evaluation of where we are with any revenue loss, which I expect to happen, from the reallocation of taxing rights.  Those who are representing Ireland in these negotiations and the Revenue Commissioners are clear that we need to see significantly more detail.  We will play a role in trying to shape that before we can inform the Deputy of what the revenue loss due to the reallocation of taxing rights would be.  It is for those reasons that I believe the &euro;2 billion figure is the best guide we can give but I will be frank that it is a guide.  I have said ever since I brought that figure into the public arena that it is based on guidance and judgment and how the situation is at any one point in time.  I am not going to revise that until I am clearer on where we are in the OECD process.  My best judgment is that will be in the second quarter of next year.</p></speech>

That is fine but there is no guide on pillar 2 and there is going to be an increase in tax revenue if things remain the same.  There is no guarantee that they will but there is no guide provided as to what will happen as a result of the effective rate going up to 15%.  We are in the dark.  We have a guide of &euro;2 billion of a hit to the Exchequer because of pillar 1 but we do not know how much of that is going to be offset by pillar 2 increases in the taxation rate.  Is it half, all of it or a quarter of it?  Are we going to be in surplus?  There is no guide.  I know the officials in Revenue and the Department have a guesstimate and I appeal to the Minister to provide that type of information at the earliest stage because we now have a set rate.</p></speech>

For so long we have worked under the shadow of what global tax reform will look like and what impact it will have on our Exchequer.  As soon as I have figures that I am confident are robust and that I can share with the Exchequer, we will share them with the Deputy and this committee.  I would respectfully offer the committee two warnings.  First, what we have at the moment is a guide.  Second, we should never assume that we can take for certain the stock of foreign direct investment we have in Ireland continuing indefinitely into the future.  With those guides in place, as soon as I am in a position to give the committee and the Deputy a better evaluation of the revenue impact of course I will share it.</p></speech>

I understand that pillar 1 will be dealt with domestically but pillar 2 is going to be transposed through the use of a directive at EU level.  I support this agreement but I have serious concerns about how we transpose it.  For the first time, this would allow the EU the right to set the effective rate of tax by taking this agreement and transposing it in the form of a directive.  I do not think that should happen.  We should bring this agreement into international law in the same way many countries throughout the world will, which is in domestic legislation.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?  We have had so much discussion about vetoes and tax issues for so many years.</p><p>What security do we have if the Minister gives up Ireland's veto on this issue - he has a veto on this matter - to allow for the legislation to be passed?  He could argue what difference does it make if this is done by way of a European directive or domestic legislation as we will do the same thing in any event, but it is the principle of the matter.  For the first time, the European Union will bring forward a directive that directly impacts on our tax issues.  I am concerned we have not teased that out to any great extent.  What are the chances it could do that again?  That is a precedent that could be set.  I do not understand why we do not transpose pillar 2 ourselves, like other countries throughout the world.</p></speech>

The European Commission will be bringing forward a directive regarding this change.  The reason it will do that is that most of the changes that have been made through the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process have been implemented via a directive.  We will have to consider that directive carefully when it is published and I anticipate it will be published at the end of December.  I am well aware of the precedent and consequences of that approach, which is why the engagement I had on this agreement was not only with the OECD but with the European Commission regarding my confidence the directive would look to implement the OECD agreement, and that is it.</p> <p>  The Deputy was right to say that, as it moves forward, it will move forward in ECOFIN and operate on the basis of unanimity.  It is worth acknowledging a benefit of this agreement being implemented via directive is that it must be consistently implemented across all the European Union.  If we are in a situation where we want to have confidence that nobody is undercutting a rate we are faithfully implementing, then implementation via a directive has a benefit in managing that concern.  However, I will be scrutinising that directive very carefully when it comes forward and I expect it to be published at the end of December.</p></speech>

I remember talking to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Michael Noonan, about the BEPS process ten years ago and the reluctance the then Government had initially in regard to that.  Ireland has suffered significant damage historically from the international reputation that exists around the tax haven status Ireland has had in the past.  Bargain basement corporation taxes have a number of negative effects.  Obviously, they are one of the key tools of tax injustice, which funnels money from the many to the very few.  One of the biggest crisis in the world is the concentration of wealth in the hands of so few individuals in terms of the number of billionaires in the world, and tax injustice is one of those tools.</p> <p>  It is important we discuss the fact low corporation tax is considered in economic terms a strategy to allow for Third World countries, typically, to improve their economies in a short period of time.  It is very seldom that low corporation tax is seen as an end strategy.  Usually by the time foreign direct investment comes into a country and helps it develop, that country can develop more of an indigenous sector which is stronger.  That is not to say foreign direct investment is not important, attractive and needs to come to this country and we need tools to attract it, but foreign direct investment, like any investments, is also based on issues such as goods, value, inputs, access to markets, good skills, good communications technology and good transportation infrastructure.  Investment in those allow for Ireland to remain an attractive place to do business in future despite the increase in the corporation tax.  There will be a need for Government to focus on making sure those other competitive advantages are worked on significantly in the next while.</p> <p>  I do not know how the &euro;2 billion cost is quantified by the Department.  How does the Department come to the understanding of a &euro;2 billion cost?  Is it because of taxes that would be paid in jurisdictions in which the income is earned rather than in the states in which the company is located?  I know the Minister approached that question slightly in the last engagement.</p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker that it is a significant break with the policy this country has had that it would be 100% sovereign when it comes taxation issues.  Transposing a European directive on taxation is a significant break.  There is no doubt, like any of these breaks, it is the start of a new process in which the European Union is likely to have or at least demand more influence on our taxation policy.</p></speech>

From a national point of view, out of the 1,500 subsidiaries registered in Ireland, 56 have a headquartered presence here and they are the companies that would be in scope with regard to pillar 2.</p> <p>  To deal with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question on how we are developing the revenue laws, the summary he has offered of it is pretty correct.  What we are doing here is expecting the taxation incidence will change from where value is registered to some of it being generated where the consumption occurs.  We will see a shift in taxable rights because a share of those taxable rights will now be determined by where the consumption of a service or good happens.  As the Deputy said, I went over this with Deputy Doherty insofar as I can.  When we are in a position to update the guidance we have given on what will be the overall revenue impact, we will do that.</p> <p>  On Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point on sovereignty, I take a different view from him on that.  We are, through the European Union, sharing sovereignty generally.  I do not believe that is always the same as losing sovereignty.  Because this will be handled via a directive, it is being handled in an environment in which it will require the consent of all member states for this directive to move forward.  I expect we will see a directive published by the Commission that will be in line with the expectations of the OECD agreement.</p></speech>

Many other countries have felt Ireland has unfairly used low corporation taxes to attract inward investment.  Had Ireland been less focused on low corporation tax as its main competitive plank historically, we may not have come to this situation and we may not be talking about a &euro;2 billion loss in the level of corporation tax the country, as the Minister said, is likely to experience.</p></speech>

I do not believe it was due primarily to where we are with Ireland&rsquo;s rate.  The evidence for that belief is the fact the OECD process up to this point has not been focused on the rate.  It has been focused on other elements of international tax plans, international tax co-ordination and co-operation.  The entire BEPS process up to now has not been focused on the rate but has been making a set of other changes in tax policy across the world.</p><p>Some countries had a particular focus on Ireland and where we stood on a lower rate.  However, I am not sure that provides a retrospective argument for Ireland having a lower rate in the past because that lower rate worked for our country and played a valuable part in attracting in foreign direct investment.  I believe Ireland still having a low and certain rate will be very helpful and important for our competitiveness in the future.</p></speech>

Before I ask about the impact on Ireland arising from the OECD agreement, I want to ask about something that caught my eye.  I see that extractive industries and regulated financial services are excluded from the scope of the agreement.  Does the Minister understand why that is the case?  Should it be the case?  Does it not send a poor signal, particularly given we are in the middle of the COP26 negotiations at the moment, for extractive industries, in particular, to be excluded from this agreement?</p></speech>

It is the case because some of the larger economies within the G7, which are trying to provide the framework for this to move ahead across the world, had interests in the extractive sector and the regulated financial services sector.  Having been involved in this process for over four years, it is one of the catalysts of the process and one of the things it moves forward is countries stating their national positions and looking to have those national positions recognised in the agreement at the end.  It is there because some of the larger economies involved wanted to see recognition of sectors they believed to be important.</p></speech>

He might proffer his view as to whether those industries should have been excluded.  I will move on to my next question because I know time is pressing.  There is obviously uncertainty about the impact of decisions that will be made by US multinationals in light of the changes.  We saw in 2015 very significant flows of intellectual property, IP, assets being booked in this country.  I want to understand what risk assessment the Department of Finance has undertaken.  We saw the massive swing of assets into Ireland in 2015 but there is the potential of a major swing out in future years.  Much depends on US tax policy but some of it will also be coloured by the OECD agreement.  What forecasting or assessment has the Department undertaken with regard to that threat or risk?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#E00500"><p>That is captured in the figure of &euro;2 billion we have shared to date.  The Senator suggested there is a possibility or risk of those assets moving from Ireland.  I would not at this point consider that a large short-term risk but it is certainly a medium-term risk.  A number of different things could trigger it.  It depends on larger economies and their tax treatment of these issues.  It will depend on the detail of how the OECD agreement is confirmed across next year.  Movement of assets out of Ireland could also be driven by a loss of confidence among those who have registered IP in our regarding how it could be taxed in the future.  That would be a result of domestic decisions in Ireland.  The impact of IP on our national income is an issue.  I do not mean national income as defined by tax revenue but in the overall definition we use to measure the size and scale of our economy.  It is a risk of which we need to be aware.  When we move to the detail of how the reallocation of taxing rights will be managed, my officials and I will be very aware of that concern.</p></speech>

I have two more brief questions.  Is the digital services tax agenda now firmly off the table, particularly within the EU?  I know that is referred to in the text of the agreement.  The Minister spoke earlier about 100 companies.  We know there are four or five mega companies that are media platforms or involved in information technology services.  Is the digital services tax agenda firmly off the table?</p> <p>  What safeguards or provisions will be put in place in domestic legislation or may arise from the OECD agreement across countries to ensure that companies will not adapt to the rules?  I am thinking in particular of the manner in which some companies' structures are organised with regard to parent companies and subsidiaries while other companies will organise themselves in the form of branches and are, therefore, treated differently for tax purposes, as I understand it.  Are there plans to put in place safeguards so that the companies that are being targeted by this tax agreement will, ultimately, be the companies that will be taxed and will not be allowed to try to get under the thresholds that have been set out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#E00700"><p>Digital service taxes are off the table at the moment within the EU because of the EU's expectation that the OECD agreement will be faithfully implemented by all those who have signed up to it.  As long as there is evidence that is happening, I do not expect to see the issue of digital service taxes come back into credible consideration within the EU.</p> <p>  The second point the Senator raised is the reason we have done a lot of work in a number of Finance Bills on the whole issue of hybrids.  A hybrid is a single entity that is taxed in different ways because the appearance of that entity in national tax codes varies.  Because of one national tax code, a company could appear as a partnership but as something completely different in another tax jurisdiction because of how that country's tax code works.  That is one of the reasons the whole issue of taxation with regard to hybrids received a lot of attention, for example, in last year's Finance Bill, if not the one before.  These issues are best dealt with through the OECD because the best hope for consistency of treatment is through an organisation comprising as many countries as possible.  That is why the OECD was successful with the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  Issues of definition and what is being taxed are dealt with through those kinds of processes.  It is a risk that I still expect to be there in the future.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the corporate tax changes under the tax rules.  I would be interested to know whether in an instance where the headquarters of a company is located in a jurisdiction with a lower effective tax rate than the jurisdiction in which the branch or subsidiary is located, the branch or subsidiary could then impose additional limited taxation.  How will that work if a multinational has multiple branches and subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions?  I would be interested to know how that would work.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions.  Was any assessment done during the course of the discussions on this change to 15% minimum - I believe "at least" is gone from it - as to who might benefit most?  The Minister said it will take time to assess what will happen, but some discussion must have taken place about who might benefit most from the change.</p> <p>  The next question relates to the concept of tax justice, which we have heard a great deal about over the last few years.  How do the people promoting tax justice feel about the outcome?  Are they satisfied?  Also, are they likely to come back again to press for more?</p> <p>  Regarding the companies in this country with annual turnover of below &euro;750 million, is any of them likely to be affected by competition from some of the countries benefiting from the changed tax regime?</p> <p>  My last question relates to aid for trade.  Some of the countries pressing for the change have been noted to favour aid for trade and would see the changes as being a help to them in meeting their aid requirements and also in enhancing their trade against which their aid might be offset.</p></speech>

They are providing aid to developing countries, but only on the basis of an agreed level of trade or an enhanced level of trade.  How do the changes affect them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#F01100"><p>I will deal with each of the questions in turn.  What are the countries that will benefit from this?  It would tend to be economies that have a low number of companies headquartered in them, that have large markets in which a lot of consumption would occur and that would have a rate that is higher than 15%.  In those circumstances, they will benefit from the reallocation of taxing rights into their economies because one will see a movement of taxing rights into where the consumption happens as opposed to where the value is registered.  The other countries that will benefit from this are developing economies.  They will benefit from a combination of both the rate changing and the reallocation of taxing rights.  Developing economies have been among the largest champions of this process so far.</p> <p>  With regard to those who are associated with tax justice and making the case for that agenda, the reaction has split into two different camps.  One camp is willing to recognise that an agreement that covers so much of the world's economy and that gains agreement to a minimum effective tax rate is very significant.  Even if they are disappointed with some elements of the agreement, some of those who have been calling for progress in tax justice have recognised the fact that a global agreement has been reached.  There are others, however, and I will not name them, who have been disappointed by this outcome.  They believe that this process should have yielded a higher minimum effective tax rate for the world.</p> <p>  Regarding companies that are below &euro;750 million annual turnover, as long as they are below that threshold here in Ireland they will continue to pay the 12.5% and will not be subject to those parts of this agreement.  As to whether people will be pressing for more, I expect they will.  There will be those who, because they are disappointed with the outcome of this process, will be championing another process to take its place.  However, I expect that we will spend so long actually implementing the agreement we have and then allowing it to be consistently implemented across the world that I believe there is a low possibility of another global process on corporate tax happening at present.  We have a generation of work ahead of us to implement this agreement.  Efforts in respect of international tax co-operation are more likely to happen elsewhere, particularly with regard to climate.</p> <p>  As regards those who are pressing the case of aid for trade, I expect that many of them are reasonably satisfied with this agreement because they will expect that their countries will be able to benefit in revenue from it.</p></speech>

This Bill seeks to ensure greater levels of accountability, leading to better outcomes across the financial sector, and to provide financial institutions with the tools to address meaningful cultural change.  The Bill provides for four main aspects along with the necessary technical changes to the existing legal process.  All of these make up the individual accountability framework.</p> <p>  First, a key element of the legislation is the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR.  SEAR will place obligations on firms and senior individuals within them to set out clearly where responsibility in decision-making lies, prescribe mandatory responsibility for firms which must be allocated to individuals carrying out senior roles to ensure accountability for all key conduct and prudential risk, and impose a duty of responsibility on each person in a senior role to take reasonable steps to avoid the firm committing or continuing to commit a prescribed contravention in respect of the area of the business for which he or she is individually responsible.  Absolute clarity about who is responsible for what should foster a greater culture of personal responsibility.  The Bill will set three sets of conduct standards: common conduct standards to apply to all staff in controlled function roles, junior and senior; additional conduct standards to apply to those in senior roles; and standards for businesses to apply to all firms.</p><p>These standards will require those to whom they apply to act with honesty, integrity and due skill, co-operate with the Central Bank, and pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly.</p><p> The legislation will also provide enhancements to the fitness and probity regime to improve the processes by which individuals are assessed for their suitability for financial services roles and investigated where there are reasons to doubt their suitability.  The provisions in the Bill for breaking of the participation link will ensure an individual can be held accountable for his or her actions without the need to prove a contravention by a firm in which that individual participated.  The introduction of individual accountability does not mean firms will no longer be held accountable for their actions with all responsibility shifted onto individuals.  Instead, the responsibilities of firms and of individuals will operate side by side and complement each other.  This is to avoid the danger of scapegoating individuals and to ensure that responsibility and accountability are properly and fairly apportioned.</p><p> The conduct standards for business underline the expectation that firms operate honestly and ethically in the best interests of their customers.  However, participation in wrongdoing by a firm will continue to be a prescribed contravention.  For example, where a firm engages in wrongdoing, the firm will be held accountable and the individuals who participate in that wrongdoing by the firm will also be held accountable.  The duty of responsibility that will apply to senior executives under SEAR is a duty to ensure that in those areas of the business for which they are responsible, their firm complies with financial services legislation.  Failure to keep their firm honest will be something for which senior executives can be held accountable alongside any wrongdoing for which they are personally responsible.</p><p> The harm done by reckless and dishonest behaviour in the financial services industry earlier this century has been enormous.  Many people suffered terribly as a result and still live with the consequences.  I am mindful, in particular, of those who lost their homes in the tracker mortgage scandal.  Against that background, it is understandable that people would be angry and focused on the need to punish those responsible.  This legislation will ensure that should similar wrongdoing occur in the future, it can and will be punished appropriately.</p><p> The objective of this legislation, however, goes far beyond this.  This legislation is intended to underpin a thorough transformation of the culture in the financial services industry.  With individual accountability, those working in the financial sector are likely to consider the implications of taking actions for which they can be found personally responsible with all the consequences that this involves.  This should engender a shift to more responsible practices.  Clearly, if a matter such as the tracker mortgage scandal were to occur in the future, it would be essential to ensure that those responsible could be held accountable but it would be far better to ensure that it does not happen again.</p><p> In conclusion, this legislation seeks to engender individual accountability to improve practices and culture within financial institutions while at the same time extending the sanctioning process.</p></speech>

We are finally scrutinising legislation that we have been calling on the Government and its predecessor to bring forward for years.  In July 2018, the Central Bank asked for individual accountability for those in the financial sector and here we are at the end of 2021 with the heads of Bill.  It is not even the full legislation, and the Minister tells us that will not be operational until January 2023.  Those dates sum up the lack of urgency in the Government's response to the matter.  Why has it taken so long for it to act on this matter?  Why has it not been a priority for the Government?  I am sure the Minister will tell us it has been a priority but the dates do not lie.  It is not as if this has happened in a vacuum as the biggest ever swindle by a bank was uncovered in the past number of years.  Hundreds of millions of euro have been wrongfully taken from people's accounts in the tracker mortgage scandal.  It is more than the euro.  There are the houses and homes that were lost.  Young people were robbed of their opportunity to have a normal family life because people were put under serious financial restrictions.  In all that time, there has been a delay in bringing forward this legislation.</p> <p>  Today is a big day because for the first time an individual - a senior executive in Permanent TSB -  is under investigation with regard to the tracker mortgage scandal.  That is to be welcomed.  Nevertheless we need the proper legislation that the Central Bank has been seeking.  Why has this taken so long and why has it not been a priority for the Government?  If it has been a priority, why will it take from July 2018, when the Central Bank called for this, up to its proposed commencement in January 2023?  In reality, it is a mirror image of legislation that has been operational in Britain for many years.</p></speech>

In truth, the process of bringing this through the Oireachtas is only a small share of how long it has taken to develop this legislation overall.</p> <p>  The legislation has been a priority of mine and continues to be a priority but it required much engagement with the Attorney General and Central Bank to come up with a framework for dealing with the appropriate level of sanctions that the Attorney General is confident can be implemented and gets the balance right between the rights of an individual and the needs of us as a society to tackle this matter to put in place a more effective sanctions regime.  We have had extensive engagement inside the Government with the Central Bank and the Attorney General on this matter.  That has taken some time.</p></speech>

It is four and a half years since the Central Bank stated it needed these powers.  It has taken four and a half years for the Minister to produce not even the legislation but the heads of the Bill.  It has taken four and a half years of engagement with the Central Bank and legal counsel.  I simply do not believe that.  If it takes four and a half years to produce this legislation, there is something seriously wrong.  Banks were nationalised overnight.  If the Minister gave this Bill the priority he speaks of, it would not have taken four and a half years.</p></speech>

It continues to be a source of interest to me that the Deputy makes the briefest of points to me and when I deal with it, the only reaction he can have is to try to shout down my response.</p> <p>  The point I made, and continued to make it despite the Deputy shouting at me, is that I am unsure why he should offer the nationalisation of a bank overnight as being the right way to handle an important matter.  It is not the right way of handling it.  I accept it has taken time to get to this point.  The Deputy stated he does not believe the reason I offer for why it has taken this long but perhaps he can outline why he believes it has taken so long to do this if he does not accept my explanation.  All I can outline to the committee is the truth, which is that I have been very committed to bringing forward this legislation.  It has taken longer than I anticipated to try to resolve the different matters raised with me and my Department from a legal perspective.  It has taken time to do that.  I am nevertheless here with the legislation and I look forward to co-operating with the Deputy and this committee to try to make progress in bringing it forward.  I accept it has taken time to get to this point.</p></speech>

I was trying to offer him the rationale behind my point.  He said he did not understand why I mention the nationalisation of a bank overnight and I was trying to explain the reason.  I will take a minute to further explain why I used that example.</p> <p>  When it comes to trying to rescue banks or bail out bankers, it can happen overnight.  It has happened that way.  I am not saying it was right or wrong but that the system can do that.</p><p>However, consider those same individuals, namely, the bankers, people who stole family homes from people, people who took hundreds of millions of euro out of bank accounts and people in financial institutions that have been involved in rogue deals and insider trading.  When it comes to holding them to account, it is not done overnight, in a month, in a year or in two, three or four years.  It took the Minister four and a half years after the Central Bank publicly requested these powers to bring forward heads of a Bill.  He asked me to explain why I do not believe it is because of the legal difficulties.  What is the reason?  I believe it is that the Minister did not give this enough priority.  This was not top of his agenda.  Holding these individuals to account is not top of his agenda.  That is the problem.  If he, as Minister for Finance, said this must happen then it would not have taken four and a half years to get whatever legal clarity was required on this legislation which, in the main, is a mirror image of what is already in place in Britain.  That is the problem here.  That is my view.  That is my consideration in relation to it.</p><p> I welcome this.  We have been calling for years for this type of legislation.  I wish to make a point on holding individuals to account.  We see it in the inquiry under way by the Central Bank in relation to the former senior executive, I understand, in Permanent TSB.  The issue here is if a person is found to be in breach then the maximum penalty is a &euro;1 million.  That is the current legislation.  This Bill does not do anything to increase that sanction.  Under the heads of this Bill, it might be head 5, it deals with that issue again.  Does the Minister believe that is an appropriate monetary sanction for an individual?  Let me give him an example.  I mentioned insider trading and the finding made against Davy by the Central Bank.  A number of those who were found against in Davy were shareholders of the company itself; indeed the 16 owned 33%.  The sale of Davy benefited five individuals, a number of whom were involved in this transaction, to the tune of &euro;185 million.  What detriment is there if you are playing for those type of stakes and that type of reward?  How is a sanction of &euro;1 million sufficient?  The question my colleague asked last week was: what provisions are in this Bill to ensure this will be personally sanctioned against the individual, as opposed to the company paying the bill for the individual or individuals concerned?  We ask this because the individual who could be found against could be a senior shareholder or indeed the CEO.</p></speech>

It is relevant to this debate to acknowledge that under existing legislation action has been taken.  That is relevant.  It is also relevant to acknowledge, which the Deputy will not so I will make the case myself, that when, in part due to the work of this committee that I acknowledge, I was explicit in condemning the behaviour of the banks and the behaviour and the culture that led to the tracker mortgage scandal happening and how it was dealt with.  I reiterate that today but acknowledge legislation and powers which have been used in dealing with the tracker mortgage issue.</p> <p>  On whether &euro;1 million is of sufficient magnitude for sanctioning of individual behaviour, I believe that for the vast majority of people &euro;1 million is an exceptionally large fine.  However, as we take this legislation through the Houses I am willing to listen to and consider the views of Members on this.  It is also something the Central Bank could consider but for the vast majority of people &euro;1 million is a gigantic amount of money.  As to whether this legislation deals with whether that individual can have the fine paid for by his or her company, as far as I am aware at the moment it is not possible to legislate with regard to that issue.  However, again I am happy to hear the views of colleagues on that point too, as we take this Bill through the Houses.  My preference is to have an individual sanction regime paid for by an individual.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#H00900"><p>That is exactly what this needs to be.  Everybody knows there were fines levied against the banks for the tracker mortgages scandal.  That is not the point but it is a good diversion from the Minister.  The point is the Central Bank publicly told us all, but more importantly it told the Minister, and he is not a commentator but the Minister for Finance.  He is the only person who can bring forward this type of legislation.  He is the only person who can do it and the bank asked him for these powers to hold individuals to account and it has taken four and a half years.  The Minister must account for that and he will say there are legal issues and whatnot.  I just do not buy that.  That is the reality of it.  The Minister has form in stalling legislation, putting back legislation, nine months' delay in this and a year's delay in that, whether it is to do with insurance or other areas.  We have another piece of legislation, which is incorporated into this, about providing misinformation to the Central Bank and making that an offence.</p> <p>  To get into the bowels of this, the issue of a company actually paying this fine needs to be dealt with in this legislation because the Minister is 100% right that &euro;1 million is beyond the wildest dreams of most people.  However, in the case of the people who are, in the main, carrying out these types of activities or sanctions, &euro;1 million is what some of them got as bonuses in financial institutions.  Some of them own a large amount of the financial institutions because of shares and so on they get as part of their annual bonus or otherwise so it needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  Let us say a senior employee takes all reasonable steps to avoid his or her firm committing or continuing to commit a prescribed contravention and that contravention continues but he or she reports that issue further up the chain of command.  Would the framework hold those further up the reporting chain accountable and what defines "reasonable steps"?  I am referring to somebody more junior who, under the mapping structure, has responsibility for a certain area in the financial institution and reports it to the CEO.  If the person more junior has taken reasonable steps to stop it can the CEO be held accountable even though the former is the person responsible for it?</p></speech>

It is relevant to the deliberations of this committee that fines have been levied, the Central Bank has used the powers available to it and today there has been a development with regard to that investigation.  What the Deputy is looking to do, and I want to call it out, is to create the inference my motives here are about trying to protect some elite or trying to protect those who are already powerful or wealthy.  That is what the Deputy is doing and he is wrong.  The inference and the suggestion he created by the accusations he laid at my feet earlier on that little or nothing has happened since the tracker mortgage scandal first emerged is wrong and he knows it is wrong.  Companies have been fined.  The Central Bank has taken action.</p><p>There has been a development in that today and that has happened due to powers the Central Bank has.  That is a matter of fact.</p><p> The Deputy put a question to me about whether a senior executive would be accountable if he or she became aware of information.  The answer to that question is "Yes".  As to how that responsibility would then be defined, it would be done with regard to the competencies and responsibility that person is meant to hold and whether they have been infringed by him or her having information that informs him or her of practices that the company should not have been involved in and that he or she did not take action about.  The short answer to that question is "Yes".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#J00200"><p>I welcome that but I want to make the following point.  I was one of the first people to raise the issue of tracker mortgages in this committee many years ago and to call it out.  The reason I became aware of the issue is an extended family member of mine was one of the first people to take a case to the ombudsman against Permanent TSB, a bank in which the State owns the majority.  I sat in this person's kitchen and I know what that person went through.  Unfortunately 40,000 other people have gone through the same situation.  To call out my motivations about holding individual bankers or those in the financial sector to account is wrong of the Minister and it is beneath him.</p><p>The Minister answered a question that I never asked.  I have repeatedly made the point that four and a half years ago the Central Bank looked for these powers to hold individuals to account.  They cannot be used retrospectively for tracker mortgages.  We are not that stupid.  This is about diverting and making sure a second tracker mortgage scandal does not happen or that the Davy stockbroker sale of a bond to itself does not happen again.  In cases like the insurance companies lying to the Central Bank, as the former Governor of the Central Bank told the former Minister, Michael Noonan, many years ago or of many other scandals, this would not happen without recourse.</p><p>It has taken the Minister four and a half years to bring forward this legislation.  If that is the Minister giving priority to something, I would hate to see something he has not prioritised because that is ridiculous and scandalous.  When the Central Bank publicly calls for additional powers to hold individuals to account, the Minister should be moving heaven and earth to do that.  He has not done that; he has taken four and a half years to do it and that is my problem.  I welcome that the Minister has belatedly done it and I will engage with this on Committee Stage as we want to strengthen parts of the Bill.  When the Central Bank is looking for more powers to hold individuals to account those powers should be given.  The only conclusion I can draw from the Minister's <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude and the delay in bringing this forward is that it is about protecting the elites.  The Minister would have prioritised it if he genuinely wanted to hold them to account.  If I was in the Minister's position, I can guarantee that it would not take me four and a half years to mirror legislation that has been in operation in Britain for years and to bring it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the provisions contained within the heads of Bill.  The Minister will be aware that the additional conduct standards dealing with people occupying senior positions have been provided for in the legislation and that is appropriate.  Does the Minister believe the legislation is sufficiently robust to ensure that people who are not designated as occupying senior positions but who in fact are the controlling minds within the financial services firm, will also be covered by the legislation?</p></speech>

Maybe what is guiding the Deputy's question and thinking on this is our expectation that this will mainly be implemented through company policy, rather than through the sanctions that will form part of the additional conduct standards.  Overall, I believe it will have the effect we are looking for.</p></speech>

It is important and beneficial that this link will be broken underneath these heads of Bill.

If a sanction was to be imposed on an individual under this new legislation, it appears to me that there is nothing to prevent the employing company from paying that sanction.

I raise the question of the Central Bank's control under the Bill and the general role of the Central Bank, which licenses the activities of all financial entities in this country, in particular in respect of the investment companies that have bought many of the impaired loans.  All of the banks leaving this jurisdiction are either in the course of selling off or have sold off their loans already.  That brings me to the point I have made numerous times over the last ten years.</p><p>Some of the new lending institutions are dealing for the first time with the account holders that were impaired, for want of a better description.  Some are thoughtful, helpful and sympathetic, and try to help out in every way possible.  Some are not, however, and they go out of their way to attempt to dismiss third party representatives.  Many Deputies, as public representatives, have interposed ourselves into that position in order to protect, insofar as we can, people who became heavily indebted in recent years and whose problems have not yet been resolved.  Can we be assured that the lending institutions coming into the marketplace and their agents will have due regard for the personal circumstances of the individual account holders with whom they are dealing?</p></speech>

I believe we have done that.  I am aware that Deputy Durkan is frequently contacted by people in his constituency and beyond who are in difficulty.  The figures I have show that, in the majority of cases, the legal framework in place leads to a resolution of many of the difficult matters that bank customers may face.  I believe we have the balance right and that those involved in delivering financial services in Ireland are aware of their obligations.  We will always become aware of cases where this does not happen in the way we want.  That is the reason the Central Bank is important.  Deputy Durkan, as a public representative, also plays a vital role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#K00300"><p>I accept the Minister's point that it generally works out but there are exceptions to that.  I am not certain whether we can adequately deal with those exceptions.  There are numerous cases involving properties that were repossessed by the lending institution up to ten years ago and then left idle.  They have now been sold on to an investor which will move into top gear to dispose of the property regardless of what might be the consequences for the original borrower, who is considerably out of pocket, obviously, because the debt has accumulated over the period.  The borrower may not be well treated by the agents of the financial institution who are now dealing with him or her.  This applies to ordinary home borrowers and business people who find themselves in the position.</p> <p>  As elected public representatives, we are not shrinking violets and we will certainly take on the institutions.  However, there is a little whiff of arrogance developing in that the institutions believe they have the right to do what they have the right to do.  In other words, we should realise that they are in business and this is what they do for a living.  That is fair enough but I have concerns about how they do that particular part of their job.  Would it be possible to encourage them to have regard for the personal circumstances of the people concerned and the extent to which their lives have been affected by the failure of the banking system to look after their interests when this began ten or 12 years ago and the whole thing fell off the screen?  I am not blaming anybody for allowing that to happen.  However, it should not follow that somebody makes a killing from buying somebody else's difficulties.  It should not automatically follow that these institutions can make a major coup out of somebody's distress.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan and all the other members face these issues regularly on behalf of their constituents.  Given the legal framework we now have in place and the change that has happened in our banking sector, I believe that sensitive and vulnerable issues are dealt with in a fair way in many cases.  I acknowledge that there are also a number of cases where people in difficulty, on many occasions not due to anything they have done, are not happy with the way they are treated or the response to the situation. That is why the Central Bank, Ombudsman and Oireachtas can all play a role in those situations.</p> <p>  During Covid, we have seen many individuals and small businesses come under huge strain as a result of something that was wildly beyond their control and in which they played no part.  I believe that in the majority of cases our banks dealt with that in a fair and responsible way.  That was aided and abetted by changes made by the regulator during the Covid period and measures taken by the Government.  I believe the crisis was dealt with fairly and well in many case.</p></speech>

We are finishing at 3.15 p.m. and I want to ask the Minister a question or two.  I can bring the Deputy in first in the private session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#K00700"><p>In that case, I will ask my questions together.  I thank the Minister for the discussion thus far.  Head 4 of the general scheme states that the "legislation will not define the sectors to be included in SEAR, as this will be provided for by the Central Bank Regulations" and that other sectors "may be brought within the scope of SEAR in the future, after the legislation is enacted."  Will the Minister clarify what sectors are not envisaged to fall under SEAR in the medium term, once the legislation has been enacted?  Will these be, for example, the payment gateways such as Revolut, Stripe and the buy-now-pay-later company, Klarna, which is to enter the market in the South?</p> <p>  My next question relates to how the rules would apply to persons such as in-house lawyers.  I do not see a specific provision relating to such persons but I am aware that this matter was debated in Britain when its regime was being introduced.</p> <p>  At our meeting last week, I raised with the Central Bank the issue of directors holding multiple directorships simultaneously.  This practice, whereby individuals can hold multiple directorships of companies, continues.  The number of directorships individuals hold at the same time can run into the hundreds, which would cause concerns about their ability to perform their fiduciary duties and about wider accountability issues in relation to that.  I am aware there can be limitations on the number of directorships that can be held for public companies but not for private companies.  Should this matter be addressed in the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021111000002#K00800"><p>In the initial phase of the application of SEAR, it will be credit institutions; insurance undertakings; investment firms which underwrite on a firm commitment basis and-or deal on their own account and-or are authorised to hold client moneys and assets; and third country branches of the aforementioned entities.  On the entities that could be brought into SEAR in the future, the main ones are the types of companies that are currently excluded, namely, credit unions and parts of the payments sector, as referred to by the Deputy.  These will be excluded in the first and probably lengthy phase of the application of this legislation.  It will be open to the Central Bank to decide what sectors it wants to include in the future.</p><p> The Deputy's second question was about in-house lawyers and whether they will be subject to SEAR.  If an in-house lawyer holds a senior executive function, and we have given examples of what they could be - for example, an executive director - then he or she will be subject to this legislation.  If, however, such people are outside of the pre-approved control function roles, they will be subject to the conduct standards within the legislation.  Again, as we take this legislation through, I am happy to hear the views of colleagues in that regard, but I think the balance as we have it at the moment is right.</p><p> As for the issue of people holding multiple directorships, given the level of responsibility they have to hold as non-executive directors in financial institutions, I think the day when people held multiple directorships is now gone.  I would certainly be surprised to find somebody who is a non-executive director of multiple companies that could be subject to this legislation because the responsibilities on them now are so great.  The Deputy is right that there is a limit on the number of directorships of public companies one person can hold.  Would it be possible to put one in place for the private sector?  Probably not, I imagine, because of the balance that is there about recognising the rights of individuals.  Equally, however, I would be surprised if any director coming within the purview of this legislation were to hold multiple directorships.</p></speech>

Some time ago we held a hearing and listened to the case made by EBS, its tied agents and AIB.  The Gallery was full of those tied agents.  A number of them have passed away since then, but the issue trundles on.  Is there any way the likes of AIB and the issue relating to tied agents, if it were to arise again, including retrospectively in the case of EBS, could be dealt with within this legislation?  There is no doubt in my mind, having listened to them and having read the various papers on the issue, that the bank is just not willing to move one way or the other and has the matter tied up in court.</p></speech>

I am not bothering you with a mundane issue.  It is not a mundane issue.  It is a really serious one and a terrible reflection on AIB.</p> <p>  May I ask you your opinion on a banking forum, Minister?  I have mentioned this to you in the D&aacute;il.  In line with the legislation and what is going on generally in banks now and the change of landscape, do you see a banking forum as something worthwhile that could be established through your Department for a short period or a medium period and that would report back to you on how the stakeholders of all kinds see the landscape for the future?</p></speech>

As part of that process, I will invite submissions from different stakeholders to hear their views on the future of Irish banking.  To be explicit, will I create a forum to lead to the development of policy?  I am not planning to do that because I think the setting of policy should sit purely with the Government and the Minister for Finance.  However, I will announce a review and, as part of that review, I will invite submissions from stakeholders on the issues they have raised and consider them carefully.</p></speech>

I am not talking about a permanent banking forum that would continue to roll on; I am talking about a banking forum made up of all stakeholders that would make a contribution verbally and perhaps make a statement together afterwards relative to and feeding into the legislation.  You may say written submissions are just as good.  I just thought there are such changes going on right from the bottom up, from the moneylender right to the commercial banking sector, that it would be helpful, and I am just putting the proposal before you again.</p> <p>  My next question is about the report this week, which may have been framed differently from what is actually happening.  I refer to cuckoo funds and the funds generally and the Minister going on tour to attract them to the country.  What did you make of that?</p></speech>

In Housing for All there is an action step against that to look at what kind of engagement can happen that might lead to more homes being built in Ireland.  The reason funds can play a role in the delivery of more homes here in Ireland is that it is a way of channelling savings in other countries into more homes in Ireland, and that is it.  As part of Housing for All, it has been suggested that I engage with how that can happen.  I have no such engagements planned, but that is an action step in Housing for All.</p></speech>

Something like attracting them into Ireland has to be treated exceptionally carefully.</p></speech>

However, we heard recently from Tony Lawlor, who is an individual with a difficulty with Bank of Ireland.  He was before the committee, so the name is public and he made his case and so on.  There are cases like his that still linger on in the banks with little or no outcome, with the bank just taking a position to beat down the client and not to give him or her a fair hearing.  If a hearing is given, it is given within the bank itself so it is not a totally independent one.  I am talking about legitimate, proper problems that individuals are having.  I am not talking about people who are deliberately trying to avoid repayments.  Mr. Lawlor is not trying to avoid repayments and we have done everything here to highlight the case and other cases with AIB and Bank of Ireland with little or no traction, or maybe a little traction and no outcome.  In your meetings with the bank, do you ever tell them to prioritise those cases that are on the long finger and try to get them dealt with in the most humane manner possible?</p></speech>

He has been exercised by all of this.  I respect the fact that you do not deal with individual cases.  I am not asking you to do so.  I am just asking that you emphasise with the banks that it is high time those cases that are lingering on were dealt with.  What you get from the bank is an acknowledgement of the case being before it and it could be another five years before you get a letter from the bank saying, "I am sorry about the delay.  It is taking some time but we are still examining your query or your complaint."  It goes on and on and on.  The individual on the other end is not only getting older but is having to carry with them in their lives the stress and the trauma and everything that means.</p><p>There cannot be a significant number of cases.  Similar to the situation in respect of the Educational Building Society, EBS, it is time for these banks to draw a line under the cases and use their common sense and decency, if they have any decency left, to approach the cases and sort them out.  I ask the Minister to tell the banks to deal with these cases in a sympathetic manner.</p></speech>

Of course, I will see what the status of this issue is with the banks, but I have to recognise the fact that the Central Bank has been through this issue and the ombudsman has played a very active role in it and I cannot second-guess or undermine the judgment or views they have reached in respect of the matter.</p> <p>  As the Chairman was introducing his question, he referred to funds and the role they have played in Ireland in the acquisition of loan books and distressed loans in the recent past.  To frame this clearly, this is a different matter.  The issue referred to in Housing for All relates to how new homes can be built; it is not about the issue that is of great concern to the Chairman, as it is to me, in respect of how we can support and protect those whose loans have been purchased.  Those are two different matters.  I am aware of the concern that many people have with regard to the operation of funds and larger investors.  Any role they play must also be seen in the light of the Government commitment to housing that, for the budget this year, was &euro;6 billion.  That is to fund building homes directly, homes being built through approved housing bodies and many initiatives that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is implementing.</p></speech>

First, where a MAC holder has submitted a planning permission application for a different usage than specified in the MAC and, second, where a planning application has been refused.

These amendments are specifically about the MACs and making sure that we are keeping that information, that it is there to be used again rather than people starting from scratch again.  Some of the Minister of State's amendments deal with this slightly differently and I ask him to give his perspective before I press my amendments.</p></speech>

These proposals have been somewhat superseded by amendments Nos. 211 and 214.  I have to oppose both amendments on foot of this.  The provisions are required to provide a definitive endpoint to the process.  Refusal of planning permission application is the appropriate endpoint.  A new MAC application will have to be made to facilitate a new planning application.  MARA must have the opportunity to reassess circumstances as the refusal of planning permission may occur some years after the MAC grant and the world may have moved on significantly.  Failure to secure planning permission would be strong evidence that the MAC holder does not have the required technical capabilities to complete the project.</p> <p>  This provision is intended to disincentivise commercially driven risk taken of the kind we have seen on land where the developer may apply for significantly more than the receiving environment can bear.  It would also be necessary to avoid land-hoarding or "zombie" MACs.  We want serious applicants to make good quality applications, in good time, to deliver sustainable development and the Bill is designed to drive that behaviour.  In light of these explanations, I hope that Deputy Higgins may consider withdrawing her amendments.</p></speech>

If I understand correctly, the intention behind this amendment, as was the case with amendments Nos. 210 and 213, is to facilitate continuity of activities, for example the continued operation of a ferry port, while the financial considerations are ongoing.  I can appreciate why these measures appear practical.  However, we must oppose them.  The circumstances where companies enter into receivership and examinership do not generally arise overnight.  These automatic termination provisions will act as a statutory cliff edge to incentivise early action on the part of MAC holders, for example, securing additional financial partners or a joint application for assignment of the MAC to another entity.  Receivership and examinership can be complex and litigious.  This automatic termination provision places the State in a strong position in such circumstances.  The control of the property remains in the hands of the MARA and will be administered in the best interests of the State.  The MARA will act reasonably in such circumstances and as a practical matter would not trigger enforcement action or the rehabilitation schedule pending the outcome of the financial processes.  A new MAC application could be made.</p></speech>

That would be dealt with by the High Court.  Will the Minister of State explain, if an entity is trying to defend a decision to impose a major sanction and the holder of the authorisation is saying that there should not be a sanction, whether people such as non-governmental organisations, the public or stakeholders would have a right to give evidence on their view about whether the sanction was justified?  If the holder of the authorisation is saying that there is nothing to be seen, nothing has been done wrong and a sanction is not deserved, how would those proceedings operate?</p></speech>

The MARA would have to robustly defend the sanctions that it would have imposed should a holder take a case against it.  It is up to the holder to conclusively prove it to the court.  It is an independent process.  The judge would adjudicate on it.  It would be up to the holder to prove its case in court.  I cannot say whether a court would limit who can or cannot give evidence on each side.  That is not my role.</p></speech>

We raised concerns yesterday about the potential difficulties in access to justice for NGOs, for example, the costs and so on that they might incur.  In this particular instance, let us say that the reason that the MARA decided a sanction might be necessary is because it received reports from stakeholders, NGOs or members of the public that they felt the holder of the authorisation was breaking the rules of the authorisation and was not compliant in some way.  If people asked the MARA to look into and investigate cases and it then decided that there was something to investigate and was of the view that sanction would be required, would those people have the right to give evidence to the High Court if they wished?  Could they state why they brought the matter to the MARA's attention and outline their view that what the authorisation holder stated was not true?</p><p>It is being able to supplement the case that sanctions should be brought.  Does the Minister of State understand my point?</p></speech>

They would give evidence to the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, as part of its investigation in the first instance.  If it has a report or there is an issue where there has been a breach, MARA would have the capacity to investigate.  Obviously, it would play a key part in that investigation.</p> <p>  On the second part, if it goes before the court on foot of MARA making a determination, MARA will have the job of defending its decision.  I cannot assess what the court case will be at that point in time but it would have fed into the investigation part at the very start.</p></speech>

I am trying to thrash this around so that I am clear in my own head.  If it was the case that a stakeholder, an NGO or, for that matter, a concerned member of the public had brought matters to the attention of MARA that prompted it to investigate and impose sanctions, certainly MARA would have to defend its position in the court against an appeal by the authorisation holder that this was an unfair sanction.  However, it might well be the case - I could certainly imagine a case - where the stakeholder itself or the NGO would say that, as well as whatever MARA will say, it wants to give evidence in these proceedings as to the reason it thinks MARA's decision is entirely justifiable and to represent its own position as the group that potentially had prompted the entire investigation in the first place.  That is what I am asking.  One could imagine there could be quite controversial matters going on in a court between MARA and the authorisation holder where those stakeholders might state that they have a strong view on this and they want to give their evidence to the court as to why they think sanction is, indeed, justified and MARA has acted correctly in these circumstances.</p></speech>

In the first instance, MARA is the competent authority and it would have carried out the investigation.  It is the one that will be in the dock, so to speak, to defend its decision and it will have to mount a defence.  I cannot pre-empt in terms of a particular future court case who or who may not be required to give evidence as part of that process.  It is an impossible question for me to make a determination on.  What I can say is that as part of the investigations, MARA, being the competent authority, will have assessed complaints, interviews, etc., from any particular stakeholder if it has reported a sanction in a particular area.  It is up to MARA to exercise its professional judgment in making a decision of sanction, and everyone has a right to recourse through the courts.  That is the independent process that would take place afterwards.</p></speech>

In other words, not only what MARA thought was relevant evidence but what that stakeholder or NGO felt was relevant to the considerations of the court.</p></speech>

(1) Subject to subsection (2), this Chapter applies to development situated&mdash; <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	(a) wholly in the nearshore area of a coastal planning authority, or<br /><br />(b) partly in the nearshore area of a coastal planning authority and partly on land. </blockquote>(2) This Chapter does not apply to development&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) of a class specified in the Eighth Schedule (inserted by <i>section 167</i>of the <i>Maritime Area Planning Act 2021</i>),<br /><br />(b) in accordance with a permission (whether or not granted before the repeal of Part XV) that, immediately before the repeal of Part XV, was required in accordance with section 225, or<br /><br />(c) consisting of&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) the erection of a building, pier, wall or other structure in accordance with a map, plan or specification approved in accordance with section 10 of the Act of 1933, or<br /><br />(ii) the deposit of any material in accordance with a consent referred to in section 13 of the Act of 1933.&quot;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>There might be a few changes in terms of the groupings here as we were trying to work at pace.  I will alert the Chairman to them as best I can.</p><p>As referenced, I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 217 and 227 together as they do the same thing.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 217 is to disapply this chapter on applications made to coastal planning authorities in respect of two additional categories to those in the original text.  First, subsection 2(b) of the amendment refers to development in accordance with a permission granted in accordance with section 225 of the Planning and Development Act.  Section 225 provides for planning permission for development on the foreshore.  In effect, this amendment seeks to ensure that, where a person is already in possession of a permission under Part XV, he or she will not be required to apply again if that development has not yet commenced.  It is a technical amendment and the previous formulation would have applied this chapter to authorised developments that had not yet commenced.  It is related to an amendment previously agreed to section 12 of the Bill.</p><p> Second, subsection 2(c) of this amendment refers to developments authorised under the listed sections of the Foreshore Act 1933.  Post enactment, there will still be limited instances of developments being authorised under sections 10 and 13 of that Act by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This amendment seeks to ensure that there is no double authorisation for such development approvals.  It should be noted that this only applies to applications to coastal planning authorities in their own nearshore areas.</p><p> Amendment No. 227 is similar to amendment No. 217 as it relates to the application of chapter III.  It is there to ensure that there is not a requirement to obtain planning permission where a development consent already exists, either through the repealed Part XV of the Planning and Development Act or the referenced sections of the Foreshore Act.  The amendment is in two parts.  The first part is to disapply this chapter in respect of a development in accordance with a permission granted under Part XV of the Planning and Development Act and the second, at paragraph (b), does the same for sections 10 and 13 of the Foreshore Act.</p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 218 is to confirm that one of the ways a person is made eligible to apply for permission for development under this chapter is to be the holder of a lease under section 2 of Foreshore Act 1933 for "the proposed development concerned".  This provision has already been made in the initiated text, but this formulation more tightly links the eligibility criteria specifically to a lease for the proposed development.</p><p> Amendment No. 220 is a technical drafting amendment and related to amendment No. 218.  This amendment carries on the reference to a holder of a lease under section 2 of the Foreshore Act 1933 as a qualifying criterion that enables a planning authority to consider an application for permission under section 34 or to grant such a permission.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021111000002#D00300"><p>My apologies.  The purpose of amendment No. 219 is to remove the existing disapplication at section 281(4) for development to which Part XI applies, as an exemption for coastal planning authorities is already provided for in section 4 of the Planning and Development Act, as amended in this Bill.  The initiated text inadvertently doubled up on this exemption.  In order to avoid a deviation in approach from the existing system in the Planning and Development Act, I am deleting this text because it is unnecessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 221 provides that coastal planning authorities can apply a condition as per section 34(5) of the Planning and Development Act.  The subsection provides that a coastal planning authority can attach to a planning permission a condition that points of detail can be agreed between a coastal planning authority and the person carrying out a development.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide that, after the grant of planning permission, fine details of a development may be agreed with a coastal planning authority where, as is frequently the case, it is not possible to determine such details in an application for planning permission.  Its omission in the initiated text was an oversight and would have resulted in a situation whereby applications made on land could have a condition applied under section 34(5) but a maritime application could not.  This will ensure consistency for local authority planning decisions.</p><p>Amendment No. 222 inserts a new subsection (4), which provides that section 34(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Planning and Development Act shall not apply in respect of a maritime application.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove a limitation that would otherwise have an effect on what a coastal planning authority can consider in respect of a maritime application.  In effect, if the initiated text remained, it could have been inferred that a coastal planning authority was limited to considering the provisions of section 34(2)(<i>a</i>) and not the additional considerations provided for in the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 223 is a technical drafting amendment related to amendment No. 222.  The purpose of this amendment is to change the number of the subsection from (4) to (5) to provide for the new numbering at amendment No. 222.</p></speech>

There are various players and levels of consultation involved, for example, coastal planning authorities.  This amendment seeks to ensure that there is an opportunity to include conditions after the consent.  The Minister of State has probably given us a great deal of detail on this matter already.  Does he wish to give me a quick response before I decide whether to push the amendment?</p></speech>

A key problem in terrestrial planning and housing supply is the use of the planning system by people sometimes to speculate by obtaining planning permissions and increasing land values.  It does not always lead to the amount of housing output that is desirable, wanted and needed.  What safeguards are in place in this section of the Bill to give us confidence that the planning processes cannot be used to obtain permissions for, for example, renewable energy, which is necessary, only to then not deliver on it?  The processes could be used to obtain further permissions down the road for when returns can potentially improve as technology improves.  There is a concern that we will not get the delivery of renewable energy that we need because people obtain permissions but do not act on them because they are waiting for technology and returns to improve.</p></speech>

I discussed in detail the automatic termination, under which we have put the State in the best possible position to respond to any deviation or change in infrastructure that has received the maximum permission.  I am confident in that regard.</p><p> Second, An Bord Plean&aacute;la can attach conditions to the planning application.  As we have seen throughout this process, it is very clear that we want serious players in the market.  We want serious engagement that meets all environmental criteria that has the best possible sustainable outcome for our maritime area.  I believe through MARA, having control of the MAC process and with respect to planning permission through the board, that those tick that box well.</p></speech>

If a survey requires a licence and if it requires an environmental impact assessment, EIA, it would go straight to the planning process through the board; if it does not, it would be part of a licence under the separate structure we discussed in the planning Act.</p></speech>

Surveys require a licence.  There are triggers provided for in terms of whether it falls under MARA, in terms of the licensing process or whether it has go to the board if it constitutes development.  I cannot give the Deputy an example of each as there are different types of surveys.  It will depend on the type of survey and what environmental mechanisms it will trigger in terms of the decision-making body it ends up being dealt with, be it MARA or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

They would have to be screened first.  There are many different seismic surveys.  I cannot say exactly what is the process for each of them.  I cannot give the Deputy a <i>carte blanche</i>answer that would cover every single one.  I am outlining clearly the process through which the application would have to go.  The surveys would have to be screened.  If they require an EIA, the applications would have to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If they do not, the process would be licensing through MARA.  I cannot go into the micro detail of each individual application because I do not have that information.  I hope the Deputy appreciates that.</p></speech>

The initiated text had the same effect but in order to ensure there is no risk of misinterpreting the jurisdiction of the board in respect of applications that start in the maritime area and end up on the land, the wording has been explicit in the replacement of paragraph (a) of the initiated text at section 285.  In plain English, it does not change the intention, rather it spells out that if an application for development starts in the outer maritime area and finishes either on land or in the nearshore, the board will have jurisdiction.  </p><p>Amendment No. 226 is a technical drafting amendment.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove the comma after the word &quot;land&quot; to improve grammar.</p><p>Amendment No. 228 is the same as that is proposed under amendment No. 218 but relating to applications made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The form of words used ties the applicant to the development referred to in the lease.  Any deviation from this will trigger the MAC requirement.  Legacy leaseholders will not be eligible to apply for planning permission for different types of categories of development without a new MAC, thus ensuring that they will come under the new system as proposed in this Bill.</p><p>Ultimately, however, this is a new category of applicants which is required as a result of the remaining foreshore functions under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and it is for this reason that provision has been made.  In short, what is being put forward here is that once the regime is up and running there may be developments related to aquaculture that are not exempted development and the provision will allow those leaseholders to apply for planning permission, as is already the case.  As stated, this is not designed to remove or avoid the requirement of a MAC.</p></speech>

An applicant needs to await the granting of a MAC before engaging in any pre-planning discussions.  Is it the Minister of State&rsquo;s view it is timely to wait for the 90 days involved or would it be a positive for the process for an applicant to engage in pre-planning discussions while also going through the MAC application process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021111000002#E03600"><p>I can read the technical response.  It might assist the Deputy.  Amendment No. 229 provides that any applicant for a maritime area consent may enter into pre-application discussions with the board.  This would run contrary to the policy intention of the sequential MAC planning process whereby the MAC is the gateway to planning.  There are a number of possible negative outcomes that could occur as a result of this amendment.  First, where an applicant fails to be granted a MAC there is no resolution proposed for the outcome in the amendment.  In other words, are they no longer a prospective applicant?  There is the further possibility in such instances of the board&rsquo;s resources potentially being wasted.  The applicant cannot guarantee in respect of their access to any specific part of the maritime area without being granted a MAC.  The purpose of the MAC application process in the first instance, as has already been stated repeatedly, is to test the ability of the applicant to deliver on what has been proposed.  The net result of this is that at the pre-application process, the board would engage in a more likely result in an application for development and that speculative applications are actively discouraged.  The result of this amendment could, in theory, be a deluge of applications for MACs with a concurrently deluge of applications for pre-planning with the board, most of which would not get beyond application stage.  The resources of MARA and the board would potentially be wasted.</p> <p>  As I have said previously, I am seeking to move a more orderly and plan-led system than we have had heretofore and our fear is this potentially could undermine that objective.  I am sure this is not the intention and the Deputy would no doubt want to see proposals for much needed wind infrastructure processed as soon as possible but I also note the decision in time for a MAC is 90 days.  That is not excessive considering the design and development timeframes for such infrastructure.  The assessment criterion in the MAC process will provide the best applications for planning.  The sequential approach being proposed here is in the best interests of the State and the resources at our disposal.  I am sure, on reflection, the Deputy may consider what I have just referred to.</p></speech>

The wording of section 287(2)(b), as it exists, is sufficiently broad to allow the board to specify any type of documentation to be submitted with an application, in addition to what might be prescribed by regulation.  Moreover, the specific forms and level of detail required for maritime applications will be prescribed by regulation, as referred to in sections 291 and 306.  It would weaken the system potentially overall to give the board discretionary powers in such matters.  This is something that should be consistently regulated as currently done through the planning and development regulations. While I fully acknowledge what Deputy Higgins is attempting to achieve here through this amendment, we believe this is a matter for secondary legislation and regulation.</p></speech>

In effect, at pre-planning the board can relate to the applicant what it is likely to look at during the consideration of an application proper.  The formulation in the existing text at paragraph (f) used the word "will" and may have inadvertently limited the board to considering only those matters discussed at pre-planning.  This would be at variance from the existing land-based provisions and would, in effect, have precluded the board from considering new information raised, for example, in the public consultation during the period.  I am sure Deputies will agree this would not have been satisfactory.  The board must be allowed to examine all matters it considers relevant when the planning application proper is set before it.  Not all of the details may be apparent at pre-planning stage, and the public and prescribed bodies may be allowed to raise new issues that can be material considerations in the decision-making process.</p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 233 is to confirm that being the holder of a lease under section 2 of the Foreshore Act 1933 for the same development is a qualifying criterion that enables the board to consider an application for screening for environmental impact assessment in respect of a proposed development.  This is related to other amendments that make foreshore leaseholders eligible applicants and it is designed to accommodate those foreshore functions remaining with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It replaces the existing text to link the lease more tightly to the development concerned, thus closing off any avenues for other legacy foreshore leases to access the planning system.  It is related to earlier amendments, but not grouped, and it is specifically related to environmental impact assessment screening.</p></speech>

It requires that the board would, first, make the application available on the website of the board within two working days of it being received, and that the board would make any documentation related to the application, correspondence and submissions available online as soon as is practicable, but not later than three days after they are received or sent by the board.  This is very important for public participation in the process and for scrutiny.  It is important those applications and documentation are available relatively quickly from the board for scrutiny and analysis, and for involving people so they can have a say and see what is in the application and the detail of it, and that it is available to them quickly and particularly on the website.  It is important enough that it needs to be in the legislation.  Certainly, in terms of other planning processes there can be issues with that documentation not being available for some time.  It puts people at a disadvantage with regard to the time they have.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

These provisions are repeated here for maritime applications in section 287(2)(c), so the requirement to publish the application documentation online is already in place.</p><p> This amendment is also unnecessary and would repeat obligations already placed on the board under section 146 of the Planning and Development Act.  The amendment to the Act proposed at Schedule 12 in respect of section 125 provides that the obligations of the board to publish material on its website will be applied to maritime applications.  I will propose a further technical amendment to this section later to ensure its applicability to both applications under sections 291 and 297.</p><p> The formulation the Deputies propose would deviate significantly from the existing land-based provisions and could result in a situation in which one type of application has a different set of publishing requirements from another simply by virtue of the fact that a part of it is in the maritime area.</p><p> I oppose the amendment.  Ultimately, I feel it is not necessary on foot of the aforementioned.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties with those websites is, of course, that they expire, and, therefore, they do not have the longevity that, for example, the board's website or a local authority's website has.  The value of this amendment is that it would all be centralised on the board's website, although I accept that there would be links on the board's website.  When that private sector website closes - and it will close - the link on the board's website will close.  Therefore, there should be some way of it being stored on the board's website.  While I know the Minister of State will not accept the amendment, I ask him to examine that.  For example, I had reason to go back to my local authority just to get the history of records for an SHD that had been approved in 2018.  The difficulty is that none of those records are online any more and I now have to try to get them manually.  The Minister of State's provisions are not satisfactory.  If he could at least consider the intention behind this amendment and come back on Report Stage with some alterations to his own proposal, that could be helpful.</p></speech>

Of course, they can access the information through the process Deputy &Oacute; Broin is going through now, but that is incredibly inaccessible, so a lot of that information and the access to it are lost.  That creates problems with compliance and enforcement where people may think there is an issue and they want to go in and have a look at the information before they take up anyone's time in an enforcement role or capacity.  They want to check themselves to see whether they are correct in thinking there is a potential breach.  If they cannot access that information, it is hugely problematic for them.</p> <p>  There is another issue.  The websites for the SHDs can be user-friendly, which is good.  On a negative note, they can have certainly aspects of marketing from the developer.  I understand why a developer would do that but it can also just create a public perception of not getting the information from an independent source but from the developer, with their nice drawings or images or whatever, presenting the development in the best possible light.  That tends to be how it looks on the home page.  There are those aspects as well.  I know they may seem a bit superficial, but they have an impact on the process.  The core issue here is having access to that information on a centralised website such as the board's.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that.</p></speech>

Second, while I hear the Deputies' viewpoints, for applications that are approved, all the submission details will be held under the marine spatial plan portal on the <i>marineplan.ie</i>website.  For all successful applications, all documentation relevant to the planning decision will be held on that portal and captured for all time.  That is provided for under Chapter 8, if the Deputies wish to refer back.</p><p>Amendment No. 237 seeks to provide that the board may hold meetings with the applicant for permission or any other person for the purpose of determining the application or resolving any issue with the applicant or any disagreement between the applicant and any other party, including in advance of an oral hearing.</p><p>I thank the Deputies for this proposal and I understand that it is their intention that such a facility could encourage the speedy resolution of specific matters with the aim of expediting the delivery of much-needed infrastructure.  It is my intention, however, that the provisions in this Bill as they relate to the planning process would avoid instances in which the public might be excluded from decision-making.  It is my understanding that this power, as it exists in the SID provisions under section 37F, is rarely used by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for this very reason.  Although I understand the Deputies' desire that decisions be made more quickly, I want to ensure the public can participate where such matters can be resolved in a public forum such as an oral hearing.</p><p>Therefore, based on the aforementioned, I ask the Deputies concerned to consider withdrawing the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 238 is a reference to section 293(2)(a), which states that the board shall not grant a permission under that section that materially contravenes the national marine planning framework or the maritime spatial plan.  There is no mention of city or county development plans in that subsection.  While there are large areas of the marine in respect of which there will be nothing in the city or county development plan that would be relevant, there could well be something in aspects of it.  Therefore, some mention of the city and county development plans in this section would be appropriate.</p> <p>  As for amendment No. 239, we had long conversations during pre-legislative scrutiny and engagement with various sectors earlier in the proceedings on the Bill about trying to ensure employment benefits and positive impacts on the local economy, not just, for example, if there are construction works or activity but for the longer-term benefit.  Deputy Gould and I, therefore, propose to insert an additional subsection (p) that would ask the board to give consideration to applying conditions on those local employment benefits and positive impacts on the local economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021111000002#G00900"><p>Amendment No. 238 seeks to provide in section 293(2)(a) that, subject to section 293(2)(b), the board shall not grant a permission under this section that would materially contravene a city or county development plan in addition to the national marine planning framework.  There are fundamental technical issues surrounding this amendment.  First, the purpose of section 293(2) is to ensure that the board must not materially contravene the national marine planning framework except in very specific circumstances.  This ensures a level of consistency in decision-making across the entire maritime area and ensures that decisions in respect of the State's maritime area are made in accordance with a plan passed by the Oireachtas.  Given the conversations we had on Parts 1 and 2, where every policy or plan was to be approved by the Oireachtas, the Deputies' approach here surprises us somewhat.</p> <p>  The amendment, even if it were worded appropriately, would place a county development plan at the same level in the plan hierarchy as the national marine planning framework.  This would be entirely inappropriate from a policy perspective, not only because the framework is a national plan but also because the development plan is a land-based plan.  The national marine planning framework was subject to a significant development and consultation process, as set out in the document itself.  In the amendment as worded, however, the Deputies have not referred to the particular plan that should have this effect in what particular area.</p><p>For instance, the development plan for an inland county could be binding on the board in respect of a site 100 km off the west coast.  Notwithstanding this, as the Deputies are no doubt aware, section 308 of the Bill, as proposed, in effect limits the jurisdiction of development plans to land above the high-water mark.  Development plans have no jurisdiction in the maritime area.<br/><br/>However, section 293(3)(e) obliges the board to have regard to any relevant development plans of coastal local authorities.  These circumstances would include development on coastal sites that may be adjacent to land that is subject to special local objectives and in that respect, local democracy has its role in this process.  Moreover, the DMAP provisions, as discussed, can be used as an effective tool for local plans in the maritime area in the nearshores of coastal local authorities, as we have discussed in previous hearings.  DMAPs will, of course, form part of the national marine planning framework having regard to section 2 of this Bill.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 239 seeks to provide that the board can attach a condition or conditions to a permission for development under this section in respect of construction and operation requiring local employment benefits and positive impact on the local economy.<br/><br/>While I acknowledge the Deputies&rsquo; intentions here, there are some fundamental technical issues with the amendment as it is worded.  First, there is no definition of &ldquo;local economy&rdquo;.  Therefore, for instance would a condition be applied to a development that is located a significant distance from the coast?  These limitations are important in primary legislation if it is to be robust and defensible.  What would be defined as being a positive impact on the local economy?  What are local employment benefits?  We should avoid value judgments in technical drafting as a rule, yet both these phrases imply an element of judgment, meaning that any such condition would be open to challenge.<br/><br/>Second, many of the technologies employed in the construction of larger offshore installations are highly specialised and can only be sourced internationally, meaning that the skills and labour may not be available locally.  This makes a condition such as this difficult to apply in all circumstances, however well-intentioned.  Indeed, it is questionable whether such conditions should be applied in all circumstances; rather they should be applied where the circumstances warrant it.  <br/><br/>We appreciate the intention to provide for community gain and we have sought, in a manner consistent with the existing SID provisions, to provide for a broader provision in section 293(7)(n).  In addition to this, in respect of offshore energy production, all onshore and offshore projects supported via RESS are required to contribute &euro;2 per MWh of energy produced to community benefit funds and these funds are activated several years prior to project energisation, offsetting disturbance during the construction stages.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the use of local employment clauses in construction contracts can be appropriately channelled through environmental impact assessment reports, EIARs, and mitigation proposed therein.  This has been the approach taken on SID applications in the past.  What could actively promote the use of such clauses would be to explore how they can be targeted at particular types of developments in particular areas through the development and application of the guidelines being proposed under this Bill.  This would ensure that such clauses are considered from the outset rather than attached as an <i>ad hoc</i>condition at the end of the application process.  Indeed, one could envisage that it might even be a mandatory policy requirement of those guidelines that the applicant puts forward for consideration by the board appropriate local employment benefit proposals for any areas on land affected by a particular aspect of a development.  These things need to be looked at closely and I would invite the Deputies to get involved in that.<br/><br/>In essence, I am saying that the idea being promoted by the Deputies is laudable and we understand the intention.  I am supportive of the overarching objective but there is more than one way to achieve what they desire here.</p></speech>

I mean that in good humour.</p> <p>  In respect of amendment No. 238, I ask the Minister of State and his officials to read the recent High Court judgment on an ongoing dispute between the provisions of the county development plan and central government statutory policy with respect to a retail shopping centre in Cork.  I will not discuss the issue because it has almost concluded its High Court proceedings.  I mention that because there has been a growing tension between the local democratic legitimacy of the county development plans, for example, and various attempts, sometimes for good sometimes for bad, to try to streamline, centralise, or standardise planning rules at a central level.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is right: city and county development plans have very little to say about the overwhelming majority of the marine.  Therefore, this does not become important with respect to those areas.  My concern is precisely the example the Minister of State gave at the end where there might be a conflict with a specific local objective.  At that point there is a question about which set of guidelines or which plan has primacy.  Is it the marine planning framework and the marine spatial plan or the city and county development plans?  The courts are beginning to take a view that it is not as straightforward as the Minister of State or his predecessors outlined.  It would be a mistake to assume that that might not continue to be the trend.  Part of the purpose of the amendment was to make the point that the Minister of State needs to consider that very carefully; I did not expect him to support it.</p> <p>  I also wish to speak about the second amendment.  While I know I am sounding like a broken record, if we had the resources the Minister of State has, our amendments would be much more technically proficient and adept.</p></speech>

If it is left too much to the discretion of the developer's engagement, we might get good outcomes or we might not.  If it is left solely to local lobbying, albeit very well-intentioned, by local authority members, Deputies or community groups we may get results or we may not.  Given the significant benefits to private investors from these successful projects, in addition to the tax liabilities of the State, local communities which may feel discommoded or excluded from those benefits have a right to get something additional.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is right in saying we do not have the skills for much of the labour involved both in construction and in operation.  Therefore, one of the economic contributions for consideration under a plan could be the contribution to a fund managed by MARA to train people in coastal communities to be able to take advantage of those new jobs.  The Minister of State is right that a local labour clause, if it is limited to people from a geographical area, would absolutely be in contravention of several EU laws.  The State has employed what are effectively local labour clauses in Grangegorman, for example, but it uses things like the live register or other access points into those employment benefits that are not deemed discriminatory under EU law.  I urge the Minister of State and his officials to look at that again.</p> <p>  It would be terrible to have large-scale offshore investment producing very good-quality renewable wind energy which is a benefit potentially to the taxpayer centrally but coastal communities feel they are not getting direct access to some of the benefits for the long term.  That would be a shame.  If the Minister of State agrees with the intention of the amendment, perhaps he could come back on Report Stage with some suggestions as to how to achieve its objectives.</p></speech>

The county development plan does not relate to anything beyond the high-water mark.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council county development plan has objectives, priorities and so on for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  It could as easily be Bullock Harbour, Galway Harbour or Cork Harbour.</p><p>How does all this impact on that?  We fought quite hard to get D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour integrated into the local authority.  It was previously managed separately by a harbour company.  That caused significant problems due to divergent objectives.  We now have, at least in theory, the possibility of having an integrated approach between the county and the harbour, which is a very important asset for us, as I am sure the harbours of towns and villages across the country are.  How then do these two things relate to each other?  Will the Minister of State explain that?</p><p> I am not sure whether this is the section where I should raise this issue but the Minister of State referred to it there.  I ask for the Chairman's direction on that.  In this section we are dealing with, and I am pretty sure the Minister of State referred to it, permission may be granted where the national marine planning framework or maritime spatial plan is materially contravened.  There are conditions where permission may be granted.  I must express concern about that.  It states the conditions under which this might happen are if: "the proposed development is of strategic, economic or social importance to the State" and where they may be conflicting objectives, essentially, that are "ambiguous" in the national marine planning framework or the maritime spatial plan.  That just opens everything up.  Anything goes then, potentially.  We have all these safeguards, all these plans and we have this framework but then, actually, anything goes if it is considered to be "... of strategic, economic or social importance to the State".  Alternatively, I can tell the Minister of State that from looking at the marine planning framework, it would not be difficult to construe multiple competing objectives in the same maritime space.  Then we are into a situation where literally anything goes and it is about whoever happens to be making the decision at the time and whatever his or her particular prejudices might be.  Will the Minister of State respond to those concerns?</p><p> As a final point, I refer to the benefits and impacts for the local economy, communities and so on.  That is absolutely imperative.  There is nothing that frustrates people more.  By the way, I do not think there is anything discriminatory in it.  It would be discriminatory if we set religious or ethnic conditions or if we were saying there were particular natives or something.  If we are talking about benefits to the local community and people who live in that area, as long as it is done on a non-discriminatory basis it is critically important there are benefits and employment benefits of developments which may be impacting on that area.  It is an entirely laudable and legitimate aspiration.  Maybe the Minister of State could set out what his thoughts are on how we are going to achieve that.  Does he agree that is what we should be trying to achieve?  If it is, what is he intending to do to try to achieve that?</p></speech>

As I said, I agree with the spirit of the amendment but when you look at primary legislation and introduce subjectivity and something that can be challenged, you introduce uncertainty into the process.  As I was saying, we will potentially have a look at it through guidelines.  We absolutely agree with the merit of it and want to try to protect local communities, and obviously the local economy, as best we can.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, on the county development plan and guidelines which may be in connection with a coastal county, you may have discretionary guidelines, in the first instance, for development.  Second, I have very clearly outlined the provisions of section 293(3)(e) where the board must have regard to coastal local authority plans.  Third, the critical point we must be very clear on is the county development plan does not have jurisdiction past the high-water mark.  I want to be very clear about that point.</p> <p>  Moving on to the provisions whereby plans may be contravened, this is the exact same process that is in our terrestrial planning system.  They obviously must be used only very rarely and must stand up in that a sound case must be put forward for them.  The board of MARA, having the required skill set, will be able to adjudicate on that.  We expect this to be very rare, in line with our terrestrial planning and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

The concern I have is the frequency of very significant decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la with respect to terrestrial planning applications where there is dispute over which has precedence, national planning guidelines or local county and city development plans.  They have been increasing and there is now a precedent over about five cases.  One relates to strategic development zones, SDZs, the other relates to retail strategies.  The assumption central Government had had up until this point was that a national planning framework terrestrially took precedence, or ministerial guidelines - and this document has much to say about those - take precedence but the courts have found that is not the case on at least five occasions.  They are unique and may or may not be comparable to the kind of decisions we are dealing with here.  All I would urge the Minister of State to do is be conscious that although central Government says the national planning framework, the marine planning framework and ministerial guidelines take precedence, the courts are not agreeing with that at the moment.  With some of the cases, my non-legal opinion is I am sympathetic to the court's decision and with other cases I am not so sympathetic to their decision.  However, the courts' trend at the moment suggests this is more complicated than the Minister of State's answer has suggested.  To go back to the point we have made from the start, what we do not want is want much-needed offshore wind to be locked into interminable judicial reviews at the High Court, the Court of Appeal and up into the Supreme Court.  We want good-quality planning decisions at the outset.  I emphasise that to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It requires foreshore permission and that is going to be replaced by the DMAP.  Okay.</p><p>I want to express concern about the second point - the conditions under which you can breach the marine planning framework or the spatial plan, where it is deemed strategic.  The SHD process has been very widely discredited to the point that the Government has agreed, notwithstanding a delay, to drop it and replace it with something else although it is not clear what that will be.  The reference to "strategic, economic or social importance" worries me and I want to signal that.  I think it worries people because it can become a blank cheque for doing things that people do not feel are beneficial if the Government decides at some point that they are strategically important or of benefit, even if it might be argued afterwards that they did the opposite or completely failed to achieve those strategic objectives.  It leaves things quite open to subjective assessments of what is strategic.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021111000002#K00300"><p>Amendment No. 240 proposes a new subsection (9), which provides that the board can attach to a planning permission for development in the nearshore area of a coastal planning authority, or in the outer maritime area, a condition that the person to whom the permission is granted agree points of detail with the coastal planning authority or with the board.  If agreement cannot be reached with a coastal planning authority, the coastal planning authority can refer the matter to the board for determination.  In the case of a permission that the board has determined, the board has the ultimate say.</p> <p>  This provision is related to amendment No. 221.  The initiated text resulted in a situation where applications on land could have these types of conditions applied to them and applications in the maritime area could not.  Clearly this anomalous situation could not be permeated into the final system and this amendment seeks to address this.  The primary difference in this amendment relates to what happens in the outer maritime area, where there is of course no local planning authority.  I would highlight to Deputies who are unfamiliar with the land-based planning system that such conditions are utilised frequently to address points of detail post planning and there is a great deal of precedent established as to what they can and cannot be used for.  Any significant or material changes to consented developments will have to go through the processes set out in section 297, as happens at present with SID development permissions.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 241, as proposed by Deputy Higgins seeks, to provide that conditions can be attached to a planning permission providing that points of detail may be agreed between the MARA and the person carrying out the development.  In amendment No. 240 I have proposed a related amendment, in which points of detail would be agreed between the person granted permission and the coastal planning authority or the board as the case may be; the primary difference being the absence of the MARA in my amendment.  This is because the MARA has no formal role in the environmental decision-making process for development applications, as has been said previously.  I would suggest that my own amendment is preferable, if Deputy Higgins is in agreement.  In any event, what the Deputy is proposing here that has the same effect as my own amendment.  I suggest to the Deputy that in this respect we are aligned and her intention has been satisfied.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 242 is a technical amendment to section 297(2) to expand the list of things that must accompany an application to alter the terms of a permission granted under section 297.  These additional mandatory items from the initiated text are plans or drawings &ndash; the initiated text did not specify these; the prescribed fee for processing the application; and an environmental impact assessment report, if the proposal has already been screened in for such purposes.  In addition to the mandatory requirements, this amendment further provides that the applicant may submit certain materials at the application stage, including an environmental impact assessment report or a Natura impact statement.  In effect, this allows the applicant to pre-empt the screening determination by the board in respect of these assessments and would allow the board to consider these reports in the first instance.  This is a common occurrence in regular planning applications and does not presuppose the outcome of any screening.  Instead, it allows applicants to submit the relevant documents where they are sure any alterations would be screened in for environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 243 is a technical drafting amendment and is related to amendment No. 242.  The purpose of this amendment to section 297(5)(d) is to expand on what is included in the definition of "relevant materials" in this section.  In essence, it allows the board to take into consideration all of the things submitted by the applicant in the first instance as set out in amendment No. 242, including any environmental impact assessment report or a Natura impact statement.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 245 is a technical drafting amendment to delete the word "and" in order to accommodate amendment No. 246. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 246 is a technical drafting amendment.  The purpose of this amendment is to add "relevant materials", as defined in section 297(5), to the list of things the board shall have regard to when performing its functions in relation to a requested alteration that is a material alteration.  This amendment is related to amendments Nos. 242 and 243.</p></speech>

The first amendment simply seeks to extend the number of days that the EIA would be available for public display.  Thirty days is a relatively short period.  We are talking about coastal areas.  The people interested might not necessarily be close to Dublin or have the ability to get to the relevant office in Dublin to access the assessments.  Thirty days is too short.</p><p>Amendment No. 248 returns to the issue of ensuring that the application and further or additional information submitted on the application will be available on the application website and the website of the board.  We discussed the issue earlier but we think this is particularly important given how significant EIAs and Natura impact statements are, and their centrality to the biodiversity and environmental protection of the marine that we have been raising throughout this debate.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 247 proposes timelines for strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs.  These are potentially large and complex applications as they relate to the marine environment.  There is a lot of information that people do not know about.  It is somewhat easier to deal with a planning application for the terrestrial environment in respect of knowledge and know-how.  Those applications do not need the same level of expertise in getting the information together for something happening in the marine environment.  We do not want inordinately long periods involved because we have to have movement and these are pressing issues, but the period referred to is the minimum required to ensure proper consultation about the complex issues that are considered.  I would be fearful of losing information if we do not have that longer time period.  I have made the general point that information from public consultation can be very beneficial to a project and its success.  There is often knowledge in the wider community that the developers and their consultants or engineers do not have.  That information can often come out through the consultation process from the local fishing community or other people who have knowledge that may not be captured otherwise in the process.  Issues can then be dealt with as part of the process and that can then lead to the success of the project.  If that is not captured and dealt with in the process because there is not enough time, it may cause issues with development and things can get derailed.  This should be seen as ensuring the process is strong enough to capture all those issues to lead to more robust outcomes.</p></speech>

This is about allowing for a period longer than 30 days for the public to inspect the EIA or the Natura impact statement.  We all know that the public often feel these projects pass them by before they have a chance to know about, consider and inspect them.  It is a reasonable provision to try to ensure that level of public participation in the process.</p></speech>

Regarding the conditions attaching to the pre-application stage for a MAC, we set a clear process for public engagement, which will make a big difference.  That is an innovative direction we are taking.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 247 seeks to increase the period during which members of the public may inspect a copy of the EIA report for not less than 30 days to not less than 56 days.  The Deputies are proposing what we feel is an excessive timeline for the submission period on the documents referred to which are, in effect, a revision of the existing documents to account for any changes in measurable impacts arising from a proposed alteration to an already consented development.  The timelines set out here are reflective of the requirements of Article 6 of the EIA directive, as added to in 2014.  The suggestion here is that the Bill potentially would be inconsistent with that directive.  What is being proposed may lead to a full rerun of the application process rather than an amendment procedure.  Moreover, this would render the timeline inconsistent with the SID procedures and result in a situation where an application that incorporates part of the maritime site would have a different timeline than one wholly on land, something which we cannot accept.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 248 seeks to provide that a copy of the application and any further or additional information submitted to the application subsequently will be available on the application website and on the website of the board.  We feel this provision is not necessary having regard to my proposed amendment to Schedule 12 to ensure the applicability of section 146 to applications to the board under section 297.

I will ask for a quick clarification on amendment No. 248.  Will his amendment ensure all documentation relating to this will be for future reference available on the portal or where will it be available and accessible if not on the board's site?  I will pick up on a point made by Deputy O'Callaghan.  The types of developments, particularly large offshore wind developments, are not similar to regular planning applications.  They are much more akin to SIDs.  In fact, it is arguable that they are SIDs, given their strategic importance to our renewable energy targets.  If 56 days is an acceptable time period, for example, for a flyover on the N7 at Newlands Cross in my constituency as part of an SID, why would the same time not be allowed for something that could be much bigger and impact a far greater number of people and have far greater levels of technical documentation?  I do not understand the reluctance.  It is a short amount of additional time that could make a considerable difference in terms of public knowledge and participation by allowing them time to consider the documentation involved.</p></speech>

It ensures the provisions listed will not apply in the maritime area.  It slightly changes the layout to include subsections (a) and (b), and to list separately every relevant section in subsection (b) rather than include a cumulative list as in the initiated text.  It also adds Part XIII (Amenities) to the list of provisions in the Planning and Development Act that will not apply in the maritime area.This does not mean the amenities will not be protected in the maritime area but rather that Part XIII of the Bill will not apply.  Amenities in the maritime area will, of course, be addressed in the national marine planning framework, including DMAPs prepared thereunder.  In fact, all the forward planning aspects of the maritime area are to be covered under the Bill rather than in any existing parts of the Planning and Development Acts, as that is the primary purpose of the Bill.</p><p>The overall effect of this provision, in simple terms, is to ensure these Parts and sections will not be applied to maritime developments through the extension of the functional areas of coastal planning authorities into their nearshores.  Fundamentally, the provisions referred to in this section either are provided for in this Bill or will be accommodated through the forward planning provisions such as the marine spatial plans and DMAPs.  </p><p>Amendment No. 251 <font color="#212100">is a technical drafting amendment and is similar to amendment No. 250 in that it will amend the syntax to deploy more appropriately the provision, as advised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.

The purpose of amendment No. 254 is to include in this subsection a definition for &ldquo;Act of 1954&rdquo; as referred to in other amendments.</font></p></speech>

This is to avoid conflicts between the new MAC system being established and CPO powers.  It will not prohibit local authorities from acquiring land in the maritime area but will prevent them from engaging in a CPO in respect of same.</p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 255 is to provide more precisely for the construction of references to proper planning and sustainable development as being references to maritime spatial planning.  It is also the purpose of this amendment to provide more precisely for the construction of references to principles of proper planning and sustainable development as being references to objectives of maritime spatial planning.  In essence, while this provision exists in the initiated text, the revised wording provides for better and more exact drafting as advised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  All of this means that, where the local authority or the board is dealing with a maritime site, it must apply the maritime-specific considerations set out in respect of sustainable development and better reflect the requirements of the MSP directive. </p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 256 is to provide more precisely for the construction of references to the national planning framework as being references to the national marine planning framework.  The amendments to the syntax are related to those proposed under amendment No. 255.  This provision, in general, will allow the board or the coastal planning authority to read a reference to the national planning framework as being the national marine planning framework in the context of dealing with a maritime site.  The specific required exclusions to this reading of the national marine planning framework are also provided.</p></speech>

In effect, the listed relevant provisions at Part II of Schedule 9 are where, in relation to a maritime site, &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; will be read as meaning the national marine planning framework. </p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 258 is to confirm that this section applies to development wholly or partly in the outer maritime area.  This ensures that for the purposes of a section 5 referral - declaration on exempted development - An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not confined to considering only that part of a proposed development that is situated in the outer maritime area.  This is purely an avoidance of doubt measure and it will be up to the applicant to determine what question is being asked of either the board or a relevant coastal planning authority.</p><p> Amendment No. 259 is a technical, drafting amendment, which seeks to insert, at the commencement of section 317(1) "Subject to section 289," before "Part X".  The reason for this is that the board has already been granted its screening powers under section 289 and the initiated text would have resulted in a doubling up of those provisions.</p><p> Amendment 260 is a technical, drafting amendment, the purpose of which is to delete "a planning authority" and substitute "planning authority".  There is no other material impact.</p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 261 is, for technical and drafting reasons, to provide that 'excluded provisions' are expanded to include the listed sections.  These references need to be excluded for procedural reasons as follows: section 175 refers to local authority development and is not needed here; section 173(1) and (2) refer to appeals and are not relevant to Chapter III; section 173C(9) relates to applications to the coastal planning authority and are not relevant to Chapter III and section 174(1) and (2) already refer to the board appropriately and are not needed.  Similarly, the references to section 172 are necessary as the board is already appropriately referenced here already.</p><p> Amendment No. 262 inserts a new section 320 into the Bill.  The related amendment No. 263 seeks to delete the existing sections.  For clarity, I will deal amendment No. 263 separately.  Effectively, these new sections provide coastal planning authorities and the board the power to consult with the MARA with respect to the eligibility of the applicant to apply for planning permission in the first instance, but it is not limited to this.  The reason for this is that the planning authorities need to be sure the applicant is eligible to apply for permission having regard to the MAC requirements.  Moreover, there may be specific conditions to the relevant MAC that the planning authorities should be aware of when assessing the applications.  This amendment is relatively straightforward.  I am sure the Deputies will agree it is a useful provision.</p><p> I am dealing with amendment No. 304 with amendment No. 263 as they are related and should be read together for completeness. </p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is, for technical and drafting reasons, to delete the current sections 320 and 321.  There are replacement powers provided for elsewhere to ensure the MARA can carry out the functions referred to in the deleted sections.  A similar provision is provided in the amendment proposed for page 227 of the Bill, being the insertion of a new subsection (1A) into section 157 at amendment No. 304 and the powers of authorised officers at amendment No. 209, already approved.  I can assure Deputies that I am not diluting the powers of the MARA, but I have redrafted the Bill to accommodate the powers elsewhere.  For drafting purposes, I am reusing the vacant sections remaining here.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 304 is an amendment to Schedule 12 of the Bill - the direct amendments to the Planning Act.  The purpose of this amendment to section 157 of the PDA, prosecution of offences, is to insert subsection (1A) providing that summary proceedings for an offence under Part VIII of the PDA may be brought and prosecuted by the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority whether or not the offence is committed in the maritime area.  This relates to a previous deletion at amendment and gives the MARA the power to pursue offences such as the non-compliance with an enforcement notice, which technically takes place where the notice has been served and not in the maritime area.  It effectively replaces the deleted section 321.</p></speech>

This amendment inserts a new provision into the Foreshore Act to recreate a specific element of Part XV, where a local authority own development requires both planning permission and foreshore consent, and an environmental impact assessment report, it is subject to a single environmental impact assessment in the planning permission process.  This is not a new policy or approach.  Appropriate assessment will still be required under both regulatory regimes.</p></speech>

We collectively deleted it.  That is good.</p><p>I also have concerns in respect of paragraph 15(b), relating to "a terminal, building or installation ancillary to a terminal that is used for the liquefaction of natural gas or the importation, offloading and re-gasification of liquefied natural gas", because some of us think that we do not need LNG infrastructure.  If we are serious about our climate goals, we should not be envisaging further development of LNG infrastructure.  I doubt the Government will agree with us on this, but it runs counter to the commitments we have to try to reduce CO2 emissions.</p><p> As regards paragraphs 16 and 21, it may be that I need them to be clarified.  If I understand this correctly, in the context of the installation of storage for certain developments, there is no requirement for full development consent if the development is less than 20 ha.  All of this applies for developments of more than 20 ha.  Developments of 19 ha, 10 ha or 5 ha are quite large.  The installation of storage for natural gas capacity, combustible gases, oil or coal on an area of 15 ha, 10 ha or even 5 ha is a pretty big deal.  Is the threshold adequate?  What is the logic behind it?</p><p> There is a similar point to be made with regard to paragraph 21, which relates to port installations and works relating to parking areas, unloading areas, ship repair areas, associated office facilities or areas for transport of goods in circumstances where the enclosed area is less than 20 ha, involves the reclamation of land that is less than 5 ha or involves the construction of a quay that is less than 100 m in length or the provision of facilities that would admit vessels that are less than 1,350 tonnes.  Those would all be quite big developments to happen in a port.  Why is an effort to put a rigorous regime in place for significant development proposals, if I understand this correctly, while proposals that are pretty significant but below that threshold will not be subject to the same sort of development consent process with all the associated consultation and compliance with directives and so on that, obviously, we have all said we are committed to?</p></speech>

It is not something that would be considered.</p> <p>  As regards the points made by the Deputy regarding the Schedule, in the first instance, it is not a judgment; it is a jurisdiction issue in the context of whether the board or the local authority cast judgment on a matter.  It is an issue of jurisdiction.  Everything that is specified in the Schedule goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is just a matter of which body has jurisdiction over the decision.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.609" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021111000002#R01800"><p>I move amendment No. 292:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 220, to delete lines 27 and 28 and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;2. Subsection (6) of section 34.  	3. Subsection (2) of section 177K.<br /><br />4. Subsection (2) of section 247.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>This is a technical drafting amendment.  The purpose of the amendment is, for technical and drafting reasons, to add section 34(6) of the Planning and Development Act to relevant provisions for the purposes of section 312, relating to construction of references to development plan.  This effectively will apply the material contravention procedures to the national marine planning framework, ensuring that coastal planning authorities are held to account where they intend to deviate from the plan or, indeed, their own designated maritime area plan, DMAP.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 293 to section 4(1) of the Planning and Development Act is to include, in the category of exempted development, development by a coastal planning authority in its nearshore area, where the coastal planning authority is the owner of the maritime site on which the development is proposed to be situated, or it is the holder of a MAC granted for the occupation of a maritime site for the purposes of the proposed development.  The initiated text only provided for an exemption where there was a MAC.  This amendment applies the exemptions in the limited cases where the local authority is the owner of the maritime site. </p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 294 is to delete from section 4 of the Planning and Development Act, relating to exempted development, development consisting of prospecting for or working of minerals under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 and 2017, and the restoration of the area in which such prospecting for or working of minerals has taken place.  This type of development is now being brought into the maritime planning regime owing to the lack of a suitable assessment framework for EIA in the maritime area.  Amendment No. 291 relates to this issue. </p><p>Amendment No. 295 is a technical drafting amendment to change the reference of the current subsection (1A)(d) in section 4 of the Planning and Development Act to subsection (1A)(c).  This is a renumbering required as a result of the deletion of paragraph (c) of the initiated text and the subsequent amendments all do likewise in respect of the relevant paragraphs. </p><p>Amendment No. 296 changes the current subsection (1A)(e) to subsection (1A)(d).</p><p>Amendment No. 297 changes the current subsection (1A)(f) to subsection (1A)(e).</p><p>Amendment No. 298 changes the current subsection (1A)(g) to subsection (1A)(f).  I note a typo in the listed amendments.  The number &ldquo;5&rdquo; should be inserted after &ldquo;Part&rdquo; in this amendment as in the initiated text.</p><p>I will be instructing the Bills Office accordingly.</p><p> Amendment No. 299 changes the current subsection (1A)(h) to subsection (1A)(g).  The purpose of amendment No. 300 is to adjust the numbering in this list to reflect the renumbering.  This clause is similar to existing clauses in the Planning and Development Act 2000 that limit exemptions where an environmental impact assessment is required.</p><p> The purpose of amendment No. 301 is to adjust the numbering in this list to reflect the renumbering.  This clause is similar to existing clauses in the Planning and Development Act 2000 that limit exemptions where an appropriate assessment is required.</p><p> I want to flag to Deputies that I will table a further minor technical amendment on Report Stage to paragraph (b)(i) of the list in the new section 4(1A) to reference more accurately sections 8, 9 and 19 of the referenced Act at line 41.  These references were inadvertently omitted from the initiated text and should be inserted.</p><p> Amendment No. 302 inserts a series of new direct amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to do two key things.  The first is to ensure the hierarchy of land-based plans, where they interact with the maritime area, has appropriate regard to the national marine planning framework when they are being prepared.  The second element relates to the functions of the Office of the Planning Regulator, where it is proposed to increase its training and functional review functions to cover the provisions of the Bill.  I will address each of these in turn but I note that, for clarity, all of the numbering in this Schedule will be adjusted to reflect the new insertions and deletions as provided for in the proposed amendments.</p><p> The following references follow the numbering in amendment No. 302.  Reference No. 4 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 12(18) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that there is an obligation to ensure that any development plan prepared by a coastal planning authority should be consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This is to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.</p><p> Reference No. 5 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 13(14) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that there is an obligation to ensure any development plan prepared by a coastal planning authority should be consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This is to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.</p><p> Reference No. 6 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 23(3) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that a regional assembly, in preparing its regional spatial and economic strategy, must ensure it is consistent with the national marine planning framework if the strategy is likely to affect the maritime area.</p><p> Reference No. 7 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31(1)(ba) of the Planning and Development Act is to allow the Minister to issue a direction to a planning authority where its development plan is not consistent with the national marine planning framework.  This is to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.</p><p> Reference No. 8 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31Q(1)(a) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that the Office of the Planning Regulator can provide education and training programmes for members of planning authorities and regional assemblies in respect of the role of such members, authorities and assemblies in relation to guidelines issued under section 7 of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 and policy directives issued under section 8 of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  The purpose of the amendment to section 31Q(1)(b) of the Planning and Development Act is to provide that the Office of the Planning Regulator can provide education and training programmes for members of the staff of local authorities or regional assemblies in relation to maritime spatial planning.</p><p> Reference No. 9 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31S(1)(a) of the Planning and Development Act is to add section 7 or 8 of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 on ministerial guidelines and directives to the policies and objectives to which the Office of the Planning Regulator, in performing its functions, must have regard.  This is consistent with the provisions in respect of the land-based planning systems.  The purpose of the amendment to section 31S(1)(c) is to require the Office of the Planning Regulator, in performing its functions, to have regard to the national marine planning framework in addition to the national planning framework.</p><p> Reference No. 10 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31AM is to require that the Office of the Planning Regulator includes consistency with the national marine planning framework in its evaluations and assessments of matters relating to development plans.  This is to ensure compliance with section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.</p><p> Reference No. 11 is that the purpose of the amendment to section 31AQ(2) of the Planning and Development Act is to require that the Office of the Planning Regulator includes consistency with the national marine planning framework in its evaluations and assessments of matters relating to regional spatial and economic strategies.  This is to ensure compliance with section 14 of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021.</p><p> With regard to amendment No. 303, on foot of legal advice the purpose of the amendment to section 125 of the Planning and Development Act, regarding appeals, referrals and applications with which the board is concerned, is to insert a new subsection (2) stating that Chapter III of the Planning and Development Act, other than sections 126 to 134, inclusive, shall apply to applications under section 291 of the Planning and Development Act and requests under section 297 of the Planning and Development Act.  Section 125 as it stood before the insertion of this amendment will become subsection (1) of the section.</p><p> This construction will ensure the board is obliged to comply with the provisions of Chapter III of Part VI, save for the excluded provisions.  The excluded provisions are not relevant to applications under section 291 or requests under section 297 or a specific provision has already been made in the Bill, for example, oral hearings under the new section 305.  It is here that the obligations are placed on the board to publish the material referred to in earlier discussions.</p></speech>

This is to ensure applications made under Chapter III are covered under the provision that relates to environmental impact assessment.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 306, the purpose of this amendment to the new section 178A is to provide for agreements between a local authority and another person to carry out development.  This is to provide for commissions, joint ventures and partnerships, and the previous wording did not permit this.  This would, for example, allow local authorities to work together or allow local authorities to employ a third party to carry out the works.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 307, the purpose of this amendment of new section 178A is to provide for agreements between a State authority and another person to carry out development.  This is to provide for commissions, joint ventures and partnerships and is similar in effect to amendment No. 306.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 308, the purpose of the amendment of section 182 of the Planning and Development Act on cables, wires and pipelines is to insert a new subsection (1A) which, to be eligible to apply for approval in respect of a maritime site, requires a local authority to be the holder of a maritime area consent, or be either the owner of the land or be applying on behalf of, or with the consent of, the owner of the land on which it is proposed to carry out the development concerned.  This is to align with other provisions already proposed and to require local authorities to have a MAC for the purposes of this section.</p></speech>

As I read amendment No. 302 and as the Minister of State outlined its provisions, a shiver went down my spine as he articulated the iron grip of central government planning regulations closing in on what little is left of the local democracy of our city and county development plans.  I will not open up the argument here.  Much and all as I am concerned with this direction in terrestrial planning, I am equally concerned with the way in which it is articulated here.  It is a fight for another day.  The Schedule has 22 pages of amendments to planning and development Acts.</p><p>The Minister of State's amendments to that Schedule provide for another 35 changes.  If people here think this Bill is long, technical and complicated, they should look at the fully consolidated Planning and Development Act because it is probably one of most unwieldy legislative measures.  If the Department has a draft consolidated version of that Act incorporating both all of Schedule 12 and these amendments, it would be helpful to share that with the committee.  Trying to decipher Schedule 12 and the Minister of State's amendments has been difficult.  If he is in a position to share a draft consolidated version including the amendments, if there is one, between now and Report Stage, I and other members would benefit from that.</p></speech>

I believe these issues arose yesterday but I want to ensure they are on the record.  They are the concerns we have about access to justice issues in terms of the various consents for which the Bill sets out the provisions.  Without making statements on it, there are concerns about the consents, the standing of NGOs and so forth as well as costs issues regarding access to justice in respect of the various provisions of the Bill.  I wish to signal that in case we may need to table amendments in that regard on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I thank all the members of the committee, both Government and Opposition.  We valued the engagement and the contributions.  We have acceded to a number of changes in the legislation where we could.  That will add value to the process and I hope we have demonstrated our willingness to do that by how we have conducted the hearings.  We will continue to do that on Report Stage.  I also thank my officials, who have done great work.  It is a very demanding legislative measure and is very complicated.  However, I am very confident that it will be of great service to the State into the future after it is enacted.  It will provide a robust regime that will have public participation and transparency at its core and allow our maritime to be protected, in the first instance, and to be developed in a sustainable way.  I thank everybody for all their engagement to date.</p></speech>

We have received no apologies.  We are here to process Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences) Bill 2021.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice with special responsibility for law reform, Deputy James Browne.  Members will be aware of the norms of behaviour in our new hybrid world.  Members can participate from the rooms within the campus.  In the event that a is division called, members will be requested to attend the committee room for that purpose.  If members wish to speak, I ask them to catch my eye in the room here or to raise their hand using the Microsoft Teams function.  At this stage we are all quite proficient in all of that.</p> <p>  With out any further ado we will move on now to the Bill.  I ask that the Minister of State make some remarks at the end rather than at the start, if that is in order.  He will, of course, want to take us through the different sections, as amendments arise.  Only four amendments have been tabled, all of which are by the Minister, and no members have any amendments down for this particular Bill.  We will begin our deliberations then.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are to be taken together and allow for non-European Union states operating to a framework decision.  This is particularly relevant for Schengen-associated states, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, which are not EU member states.  The new section would allow states to be designated based on an agreement between those state and the EU.  There are ongoing discussions with the EU Commission on the appropriate scope here and it is likely that we will make a further amendment on Report Stage based on those discussions.  At the moment the Schengen-associated states are currently listed in the text of the Act and we expect these to be removed on Report Stage and to rely solely on the designation power.  That covers all of these various amendments.</p></speech>

The hope was to bring a number of significant amendments on that on Committee Stage.  Due to the complexities of these issues, they were not ready for Committee Stage but they will be ready on Report Stage.  Again, due to their complexity I am happy to share those amendments in advance with the committee in order that it might have a look at them as I do not just want to land them on members on Report Stage.  I had hoped to have them today but because of the complexity of trying to transfer over, in particular in the context of the situation in the UK, where prisons are released with significant restrictions, the issue then arises as to how that can be implemented in Ireland where we do not have similar restrictions.  I will also touch on that a little later.</p></speech>

It is not particularly germane but is a general question on the number of prisoners who have been repatriated under the agreements in place.  I understand that, as we discussed on Second Stage, nobody has been transferred in the last five years.  Does that remain the case and are there any prospective transfers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.683" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021111000002#B00400"><p>I am told there was one transfer very recently.  However, the position remains the same in that it is very difficult because of the decisions in the courts here in Ireland to try to meet those criteria in terms of how we implement restrictions that are put on prisoners in the UK.  Effectively, it is almost impossible to apply them because we do not have those same restrictions here and prisoners could be let out very early, without restrictions, if they were brought back home.  That is what we are going to try to resolve.  I am not sure about the situation with the one particular case that we were able to manage.  I assume the restrictions on early release that were put in place were able to be implemented here in Ireland, whatever they were, and I do not have the details of the particular case to hand.  Certainly, we have had a five-year period where, in effect, it was almost impossible for any prisoner transfers to happen and that is obviously having a serious impact on them and their families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.684" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021111000002#B00500"><p>Is it envisaged that there will be a substantial change in the numbers?  If we review this Act in, say, two years' time, will the Minister of State and his Department envisage that there would, at that stage, have been a number of prisoners transferred into this jurisdiction from other jurisdictions?  In terms of where we stand with the United Kingdom being outside the European Union, how many prisoners from the United Kingdom would be envisaged?  Would it be expected that they would be the majority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-10a.685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2021111000002#B00600"><p>A bit of a backlog would be expected because there have been so few transfers and, as I said, there has only been one in the last five years.  For some of those who wanted to transfer five years ago, their prison time would have passed anyway.  The estimate is that there may be a backlog of about 30 to 40 and once they are dealt with, we are probably looking at about ten per year thereafter.  Again, depending on how the amendments work out and what we put in place, those prisoners will have to make a consideration as to whether or not they would still want a transfer.  That is the big question, whatever system is put in place.</p></speech>

It is an area I wanted to flag when we got to this section.  As I said, we are considering the additional provisions that are required in respect of sentenced persons in regard to their opinion and their consent and, in order to ensure it is fully informed, we are looking at what additional safeguards are required around that.  The idea would be that, in order to approve the forwarding of the judgment, the Minister must be satisfied that the transfer would facilitate the sentenced person&rsquo;s social rehabilitation and successful reintegration into society.  The opinion of the person is an important feature of this assessment and the Minister is required to consider that opinion.  It will be a legal requirement and I expect we would have to show that it was given appropriate weight.  We are looking at this to see what further additional safeguards would be required and this may come up on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This section provides for the surrender and return provisions where a person is surrendered with a condition that he or she will be returned to serve his or her sentence.  As a consequence of changes introduced on foot of the Brexit trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, it will require further amendment as a relevant warrant may now include both a European arrest warrant or a surrender warrant under the TCA.  Returns under European arrest warrant, EAW, will take place under the framework decision but special provision will be required for a return of persons under a TCA surrender warrant.</p></speech>

The Bill currently applies to all EU member states and, of course, Schengen associated non-EU member states, namely, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.</p><p> Amendment No. 4 will allow the Minister for Justice, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to declare a state, not already covered by section 2, a member state for the purposes of this legislation under the condition that such an agreement has been reached by the said state and the European Union.  A similar designation provision was added to the Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill to achieve a similar purpose.  It is a preference of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to exercise this designation power and to still explicitly include the existing Schengen-related non-EU member states rather than designating them by means of a statutory instrument.</p></speech>

The courts here have had difficulty with the rights of prisoners with natural justice being served in the transfer over of sentence.

Glacann muid leis freisin gur chaill muid deiseanna chun &aacute;r bhf&iacute;s maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn.<br/><br/>Leagtar c&uacute;ig thaca amach in&aacute;r strait&eacute;is Ghaeilge chun &aacute;r bhf&iacute;s a bhaint amach.  T&aacute; m&eacute; chun labhairt anois faoin dul chun cinn a rinneadh i ngach taca.  Glacaim leis ar&iacute;s go bhfuil go leor le d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;s.  Ar dt&uacute;s, labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; faoi chomhl&iacute;onadh na reachta&iacute;ochta agus rialach&aacute;in.  In 2019 rinne an fhoireann Ghaeilge 166 athbhreithni&uacute; g&eacute;illi&uacute;llachta ar r&eacute;imse seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sna hospid&eacute;il agus sa phobal.  N&iacute; dhearnadh ach 14 athbhreithni&uacute; in 2020 de bharr Covid-19.  Cuireadh an bh&eacute;im seo ar an teagmh&aacute;il leis an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga maidir le neamhgh&eacute;illi&uacute;lacht le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003 le 20 m&iacute; anuas.  &Oacute; Mh&aacute;rta 2020 go Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair 2021, fuarthas 45 gear&aacute;n.  I measc na ngear&aacute;n bh&iacute; gear&aacute;in maidir le h&aacute;bhar Covid-19; cl&aacute;r&uacute; breitheanna post agus b&aacute;sanna; iarratais ar ch&aacute;rta&iacute; leighis; seirbh&iacute;s teangaireachta; agus docht&uacute;ir&iacute; teaghlaigh.  Bhain formh&oacute;r na ngear&aacute;n &oacute;n gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga sa tr&eacute;imhse seo leis an bhfreagra a tugadh ar Covid-19 agus le comhartha&iacute;ocht sna hionaid t&aacute;st&aacute;la agus vacsa&iacute;nithe, eolas faoi Covid-19, agus le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, an tairseach vacsa&iacute;nithe.  Is c&oacute;ras r&iacute;omhaireachta at&aacute; sa tairseach vacsa&iacute;nithe chun gur f&eacute;idir leis an bpobal cl&aacute;r&uacute; don vacsa&iacute;n.  Is i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in a bh&iacute; an tairseach seo ar f&aacute;il ag an t&uacute;s ach le himeacht ama t&oacute;gadh c&eacute;imeanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la chun go bhf&eacute;adfadh daoine cl&aacute;r&uacute; i mB&eacute;arla n&oacute; i nGaeilge agus t&aacute; muid i mbun oibre i gc&oacute;na&iacute; chun go mbeidh daoine &aacute;balta a gcl&aacute;r&uacute;ch&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh go hioml&aacute;n tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  D&eacute;anann FSS gach iarracht faoin taca seo chun a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a leanas i nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: altra&iacute; sl&aacute;inte pobail; teiripe urlabhra agus teanga; fisiteiripe; teiripe saothair; agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; fiacl&oacute;ireachta.  Coinn&iacute;tear cl&aacute;r de bhaill foirne a chuireann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus t&aacute; 149 ball foirne ar an gcl&aacute;r seo.  Cuirtear seirbhis&iacute; ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sna haonaid altranais poibl&iacute;, ina measc &Aacute;ras Mhic Dara ar an gCeathr&uacute; Rua; &Aacute;ras R&oacute;n&aacute;in ar Inis M&oacute;r; Ospid&eacute;al Pobail Chorca Dhuibhne i gCiarra&iacute;; agus Teach Altranais an Fh&aacute;il Charraigh i nD&uacute;n na nGall.<br/><br/>Is &eacute; an dara taca na tac&uacute; le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; agus feidhmeanna FSS.

Bh&iacute; r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach ag an tseirbh&iacute;s chun a chinnti&uacute; gur cuireadh an chomhartha&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge sna hionaid t&aacute;st&aacute;la agus vacsa&iacute;nithe.<br/><br/>Is &eacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; taca n&aacute; hoili&uacute;int, earca&iacute;ocht agus forbairt.

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm ach n&iacute;l mo chuid Gaeilge s&aacute;ch maith chun ceisteanna an chomhchoiste a fhreagairt i nGaeilge.  Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al ach tabharfaidh m&eacute; mo chuid freagra&iacute; as B&eacute;arla.</p> <p>  We have four people within our Irish language service led by Mr. Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute; to my left.  I cannot tell the joint committee how many others within the communications division are fluent Irish speakers but I can get that figure for the committee.  I will discuss the issues raised by the Deputy about communications, as mentioned by Mr. Canavan.  Obviously our services to Irish speakers and Gaeltacht communities go beyond communications but communications is a very important part of it.  </p> <p>  During the period of Covid-19, we produced three booklets or leaflets that were delivered door-to-door across the State, including to Gaeltacht communities.  In listing these things, I am not saying we have done a fantastic job but describing what we have done and perhaps giving a commitment that we will build on it.  The booklet was in English only, and was produced very quickly in March 2020.  A decision was taken that there was an urgency to get the information out and that it would take some time to produce an Irish language version and therefore it was put out in English only.  The latter two booklets, in November 2020 and March 2021, related to vaccinations and were produced both in Irish and in English.  Key television advertising on Covid-19 vaccinations was translated, produced and played in Irish on TG4 and online.  We did over 100 Twitter posts in Irish on social media during the course of the campaign.</p> <p>  The HSE website has developed as a key resource for everybody during the pandemic for information about Covid-19 and the vaccination programme.  With the help of Mr. Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute; and his team, we translated 108 pages of the website relating specifically to Covid-19 information into Irish.  As I said earlier, I am not making any great claims about that as there are 80,000 pages on the HSE website but these were the most relevant pages and information on the pandemic.</p> <p>  The next step in the course of the first part of 2022 is to scope out a proposal to expand the Irish language content provided by the website, to come up with a proposal for how best to curate and manage that on the website, to cost it and to move forward from there.</p> <p>  I fully accept the Deputy's point about things we did not do that we should have done in communications.

I can list micro lessons we have learned from a communications perspective and maybe give an overall lesson.  In micro terms, there are specific things we could have done better.  There are more outlets for radio advertising as Gaeilge than we used and which we could use next time.  There is scope to better grow and curate the Irish language content on our website.  Quite early on in the pandemic, we started to maximise the exposure of those at senior level in the HSE who could speak Irish to do broadcasting, such as the chief clinical official, Colm Henry, and the national director for infection control, Martin Cormican.  We use them as much as possible on Irish language stations.  I could list all the things we did and all the things we certainly did not do.</p> <p>  As regards an overall lesson, reference has been made to Irish being not central, or being left to one side.  Many legitimate complaints were made about the vaccination portal and how little one could do in Irish in that regard for quite some time after it was introduced in English.  When the Covid tracker app was introduced, it was introduced in Irish and English at the same time.  The difference was that the vaccination portal was based on software bought in from elsewhere on which a lot of work then had to be done.  We built the Covid tracker app ourselves.  That work was not done terribly quickly.</p> <p>  The overall lesson is the point Mr. O'Connor made - that Irish was not central to our thoughts for many of those times.  I can give the reasons.  Deputy Connolly has very fairly laid out the reasons in that we were doing things quickly and fast.  I have to put my hand up and say that as we were doing those things, I did not think of Irish very often.  The lessons to learn is we have to understand accept the deep anger and annoyance out there over that, ensure we take steps to fix that and pursue the 2019-23 Irish language strategy.  Much work has not been done on that because of what we have been through over the past 18 months.  A lesson has to be learned about understanding the anger, irritation and annoyance that was caused and work has to be done to implement that Irish language strategy to take steps to ensure that if we face any extraordinary crisis such as this again, Irish is more central than it was over the past period.</p></speech>

Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; go leor daoine, m&eacute; f&eacute;in ina measc, nach mb&iacute;onn an t-am acu gear&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh nuair is g&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> Baineann an dara pointe leis an teastas Covid.  N&iacute; h&eacute; gur rinneadh dearmad ar an nGaeilge, mar t&aacute; ceann acu agam anseo.  T&aacute; cuid acu i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla agus cuid acu i mB&eacute;arla.  Luaitear &ldquo;Disease or agent targeted&rdquo; agus ansin cuirtear ceist faoi &ldquo;galar a ghn&oacute;thaigh an duine&rdquo;, in other words, c&eacute;n galar a fuair an duine.  N&iacute; h&eacute; sin a bh&iacute; i gceist ar nd&oacute;igh.  An rud a bh&iacute; i gceist n&aacute; go nd&iacute;reodh an vacsa&iacute;n isteach agus go stopadh - go gcoiscfeadh - s&eacute; Covid.  N&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n chaoi go raibh orthu an saol a dh&eacute;anamh chomh casta d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in.  An l&aacute; a cuireadh iad seo amach, ghlaoigh duine as mo Dh&aacute;ilcheantar orm.  Chuir s&eacute; c&oacute;ip den teastas chugam agus d&rsquo;iarr s&eacute; orm an rud f&iacute;rinneach n&oacute; br&eacute;agach &eacute;.  Bhreathnaigh m&eacute; ar an QR c&oacute;d agus d&uacute;irt m&eacute; gur bhreathnaigh s&eacute; f&iacute;rinneach go maith.  Ansin, bhreathnaigh m&eacute; ar&iacute;s air agus chonaic m&eacute; t&iacute;r nach bhfuil ann luaite air: "Republic of Ireland".  N&iacute;l a leith&eacute;id d&rsquo;&aacute;it ann.  N&iacute; h&eacute; sin ainm an St&aacute;it seo.  T&aacute; a fhios ag gach duine gurb &eacute; "Ireland" an t-ainm at&aacute; ar an St&aacute;t seo.  F&oacute;s f&eacute;in, bh&iacute; ar FSS athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh, agus anois t&aacute; "Ireland" luaite ar mo theastas.  N&iacute;l "&Eacute;ire" air ach t&aacute; "Ireland" air.</p><p> N&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n chaoi, nuair a thagann daoine ar ruda&iacute; bun&uacute;sacha mar sin, go gcuireann siad an m&eacute;id antrom orthu f&eacute;in agus iad ag iarraidh rud chomh bun&uacute;sach agus simpl&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os simpl&iacute; &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart n&aacute; &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh m&iacute;cheart.   Feictear dom go bhfuil daoine ann nach cuma leo faoin dl&iacute;, faoi ainm na t&iacute;re n&oacute; faoi conas ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ansin caitheann na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; c&eacute;anna an t-uaf&aacute;s ama agus costais nuair a cuirtear br&uacute;, &oacute; leith&eacute;id&iacute; an choimisin&eacute;ara, orthu chun clo&iacute; leis an dl&iacute;.  B&iacute;onn orthu dul ar ais agus i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; oibre a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; rud amh&aacute;in foghlamtha againn uilig - s&aacute;bh&aacute;lann s&eacute; airgead nuair a clo&iacute;tear leis an dl&iacute;.  Caitear n&iacute;os m&oacute; ama agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid ag ceart&uacute; an dam&aacute;iste a dh&eacute;antar, n&aacute; mar a chaithf&iacute; d&aacute; nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; an rud i gceart an ch&eacute;ad uair.</p><p> T&aacute; rud beag eile tugtha faoi deara agam a chuirfeadh olc orainn.  T&aacute; aithne agam ar dhuine a bh&iacute; ag iarraidh c&aacute;rta leighis n&oacute; ceann de na c&aacute;rta&iacute; d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; os cionn 70 bliain d&rsquo;aois.  Bh&iacute; an fhoirm ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ir i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla, ach ar l&iacute;ne n&iacute; raibh s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il ach i mB&eacute;arla.  &Oacute; tharla go bhfuil an fhoirm aistrithe, sh&iacute;lfe&aacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; an-simpl&iacute; go teicni&uacute;il an leagan Gaeilge a chur ar l&iacute;ne, ach n&iacute;or bacadh leis &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ansin beifear ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil aon &eacute;ileamh air, n&oacute; ag fiafra&iacute; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th ar chuir duine an fhoirm ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ir isteach nuair a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; an ceann eile a chur isteach.  Nuair a dh&eacute;antar ruda&iacute; ar l&iacute;ne, mar shampla, m&aacute; th&eacute;itear isteach ar an iarratas sin, iarrtar ainm an docht&uacute;ra a dheimhni&uacute; agus cuirtear an seoladh ioml&aacute;n, an ceann oifigi&uacute;il at&aacute; aige n&oacute; aici, ar f&aacute;il.  Baineann an cheist seo le dearcadh.  T&aacute;im gear&aacute;nach faoin easpa cumais chun clo&iacute; leis an dl&iacute;.  Le bheith n&iacute;os dearfa&iacute; faoi ruda&iacute;, tuigfidh Tony Canavan gurb iad na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; idirphearsanta is deacra mar go gcaitear teacht ar dhaoine at&aacute; oilte sa Ghaeilge.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh duine at&aacute; gan Ghaeilge clo&iacute; leis an dl&iacute; &oacute; thaobh rud p&aacute;ip&eacute;ir de.  N&iacute;l le d&eacute;anamh ach dul chuig aistritheoir c&aacute;ilithe at&aacute; ar liosta at&aacute; ag Foras na Gaeilge agus &eacute; n&oacute; &iacute; a fh&aacute;il leis an gcuid sin den obair a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is rud difri&uacute;il ar fad &eacute; m&aacute;s t&aacute; duine ag iarraidh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Is deas a chloiste&aacute;il go bhfuil 13 teiripeoir urlabhra le Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-t&aacute;bhachtach.  Bh&iacute; n&oacute;s ann nuair a thiocfadh daoine a bh&iacute; ag labhairt Gaeilge lena gcuid leana&iacute; chuig teiripeoir urlabhra, comhairle a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh labhairt leo i mB&eacute;arla.  A mhaighdean na ngr&aacute;st, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuil an n&oacute;s sin imithe i bhfad &oacute; shin.  Samhlaigh an nd&eacute;arf&aacute; le daoine sa Fhrainc le gas&uacute;r beag a bhfuil fadhb aige leis an bhFraincis, an labhr&oacute;id&iacute;s B&eacute;arla leis agus go mbeadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os fearr as, seachas d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an bhfadhb at&aacute; ag an ngas&uacute;r.  I dteanga ar bith, t&aacute; go leor gas&uacute;r ann nach mb&iacute;onn aon fhadhbanna acu nuair a fh&aacute;sann siad suas, nach f&eacute;idir leo fuaimeanna &aacute;irithe a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart ag an t&uacute;s.</p><p> T&aacute; ceist amh&aacute;in eile agam.  T&aacute; go leor daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht anois - daoine a thagann agus nach dtagann &oacute;n nGaeltacht - ag labhairt Gaeilge lena gas&uacute;ir sa mbaile, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r nuair at&aacute; siad an-&oacute;g.  An bhfuil bealach ann chun ainmneacha na dteiripeoir&iacute; urlabhra a chur ar f&aacute;il le go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s cl&aacute;r&uacute; le duine acu agus an tseirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a fh&aacute;il?  N&iacute; rud deas &eacute; gas&uacute;r tr&iacute; n&oacute; ceithre bliana d&rsquo;aois a thabhairt isteach chuig teiripeoir urlabhra nach f&eacute;idir teanga an ghas&uacute;ir a labhairt - ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; B&eacute;arla ag go leor gas&uacute;r freisin &ndash; agus gan a bheith in ann an teanga baile a labhairt leis agus tuiscint a fh&aacute;il ar na fadhbanna at&aacute; aige.  Bheadh r&eacute;iteach ann d&aacute; gcuirf&iacute; an liosta sin ar f&aacute;il ionas go mbeadh daoine, mar shampla, &oacute; chathair na Gaillimhe at&aacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il a ngas&uacute;r le Gaeilge in ann cl&aacute;r&uacute; leis na teiripeoir&iacute; sin.</p><p> S&iacute;lim f&eacute;in go bhfuil obair le d&eacute;anamh ag an gcoiste seo.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re ar chor ar bith faoin mBille nua at&aacute; ag dul tr&iacute;d an Teach, caithfimid dl&uacute;s ollmh&oacute;r a chur leis an obair at&aacute; ar bun ag an HSE tr&iacute; airgead &oacute;n Roinn agus &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta a shol&aacute;thar le daoine a thraen&aacute;il at&aacute; oilte chun na jabanna seo a dh&eacute;anamh sa Ghaeilge.  N&iacute;l aon mhaith ann a r&aacute; gur cheart d&uacute;inn daoine a fhost&uacute; mura bhfuil siad ann agus traen&aacute;ilte.  N&iacute; bheadh aon mhaith ann le sin.  Caithfidh s&eacute; seo a bheith ina phlean cuimsitheach.  Ba cheart don choiste seo a mholadh go gcuirfeadh an St&aacute;t infheist&iacute;ocht i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os m&oacute; ar dhaoine a oili&uacute;int agus scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh, ionas go mbeadh siad ceangailte an oiread seo blianta a chaitheamh ag cur seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il.</p><p> D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaimis moladh a thabhairt do na comhairl&iacute; contae go mbeadh s&eacute; scr&iacute;ofa sa phlean contae m&aacute; ghlacann duine post i nGaeltacht Chonamara, mar shampla, mar theiripeoir urlabhra, mar dhocht&uacute;ir n&oacute; mar altra teaghlaigh, agus mar sin de, go nglactar leis i bprionsabal go mbeadh riachtanais tith&iacute;ochta tuaithe acu.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go gcuideodh s&eacute; sin le daoine a mhealladh.  Ag breathn&uacute; siar 100 bliain, bh&iacute; siad glic go maith fad&oacute; &oacute; shin.  Fuair gach uile m&uacute;inteoir bunscoile ar fud na t&iacute;re a bh&iacute; amuigh faoin tuath teach leis an bpost.  Bh&iacute;odh docht&uacute;ir&iacute; ag f&aacute;il tithe leis na poist.  Tharraingeodh s&eacute; sin daoine do dt&iacute; &aacute;iteanna.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go gcaithfimid dul siar, seachas ar aghaidh, le cuid de na dea-n&oacute;sanna a bh&iacute; ann san am at&aacute; caite a fh&aacute;il ar ais.  D&aacute; bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s a bheith cinnte go bhfaighid&iacute;s cead plean&aacute;la, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh s&eacute; sin ina th&uacute;s.</p><p> &Oacute;n m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag Tony Canavan, is l&eacute;ir go gcaithfidh an tOireachtas agus an tAire d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an rural practice allowance agus &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os tarraingt&iacute;.  Is cuma m&aacute;s ea An Cloch&aacute;n, An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, Leitir M&oacute;ir, Ros Muc n&oacute; in &Aacute;rainn, t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair docht&uacute;ir&iacute; a fh&aacute;il.</p><p>M&aacute; im&iacute;onn na docht&uacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; ann at&aacute; thar cionn beidh fadhb againn.  S&iacute;lim gur rud ann f&eacute;in &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go mbaineann s&eacute; sin leis an tuath ar fad ach is rud &eacute; sin a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht chomh maith.</p><p> Sa dara ch&aacute;s, ar&iacute;s bh&iacute;odh li&uacute;ntais oile&aacute;nacha ann le haghaidh altra&iacute; agus mar sin agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur cheart d&uacute;inn iad a thabhairt ar ais.  Ba mhaith liom tuairim&iacute; &aacute;r bhfinn&eacute;ithe a fh&aacute;il faoi seo.  An gcuideodh s&eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh li&uacute;ntais gro&iacute; oile&aacute;nach, agus i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr, ann le haghaidh cleachtadh faoin dtuath n&aacute; mar at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair na huaire?  Fi&uacute; d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il do chleachtas tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla, bheadh breis &iacute;oca&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine a bheadh in ann seirbh&iacute;s a dh&eacute;anamh sa d&aacute; theanga seachas i dteanga amh&aacute;in.</p><p> T&aacute; rud deiridh ar mhaith liom a lua.  B&iacute;onn &uacute;dar agamsa &oacute; thr&aacute;th go ch&eacute;ile dul isteach ar shu&iacute;omhanna ar an ngr&eacute;as&aacute;n anseo agus taobh amuigh den t&iacute;r.  Rud aisteach a th&oacute;gaim faoi deara n&aacute; nach mb&iacute;onn m&oacute;r&aacute;n faidhbe ann go hiond&uacute;il leis na s&iacute;nte fada m&aacute; th&eacute;im isteach, mar shampla, ar shu&iacute;omh Idirl&iacute;n i Meirice&aacute; agus fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in i Sasana.  Sna earn&aacute;lacha pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach agus poibl&iacute; anseo, cib&eacute; c&eacute;n rud at&aacute; &aacute; cheannach acu &oacute; thaobh bogearra&iacute; de, t&aacute; fadhb ann.  Ar&iacute;s, ar ais, t&aacute;imid ag caint go bhfuil an Bhreatain imithe as an AE agus go mbeidh na Francaigh ar na comharsana is gaire d&uacute;inn.  Rinneamar an Ghaeilge a shimpli&uacute; mar chuireamar na &ldquo;h&rdquo;-anna in &aacute;it na bponcanna agus n&iacute;l f&aacute;gtha anois ach na s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada.  T&aacute; grave agus acute agus cedilla agus God knows acu si&uacute;d.  T&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; aisteacha in ainm an Coimisin&eacute;ir &Scaron;efovi, at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis an Eoraip, ach n&iacute;l againn ach an s&iacute;neadh fada simpl&iacute;.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mba cheart breathn&uacute; ar na pac&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il i ngach uile &aacute;it eile ar domhan seachas an anglophone world.  Mar a deirim, n&iacute;l Meirice&aacute; go dona &oacute; mo thaith&iacute;.  M&aacute; chuirim s&iacute;neadh fada isteach, n&iacute; deirtear liom: &ldquo;your name is incorrect, would you please use a character that is acceptable?&rdquo;.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&aacute; bhfuil na bogearra&iacute; &aacute; gceannach ach n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur fadhb ar bith &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go r&eacute;iteofar an fhadhb sin sa Seanad le linn an Bhille a bheith ag dul tr&iacute;da agus go dtabharfar sprioc ama le go mbeidh s&eacute; ina cheart againn &aacute;r n-ainmneacha a chur isteach.  Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; mar dhuine le tr&iacute; sh&iacute;neadh fhada ina ainm, is cur am&uacute; ama ar fad go gcaithf&iacute; cuimhneamh chuile uair an dt&oacute;gann an c&oacute;ras seo s&iacute;neadh fada n&oacute; nach dt&oacute;gann s&eacute;.

An bhfuil strait&eacute;is ar leith ann chun daoine a chur ar an eolas faoi na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge?  Is minic a ghlacann daoine leis nach bhfuil siad ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge agus d&eacute;anann siad an fhoirm a l&iacute;onadh i mB&eacute;arla n&oacute; an tseirbh&iacute;s a lorg i mB&eacute;arla.  Casann Gaeilgeoir&iacute; sa chathair ar an mB&eacute;arla mar go nglacann siad leis nach bhfuil s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il mar nach raibh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il anois.  Luaigh m&eacute; &eacute; seo le Ranna eile anuas ar an Roinn Sl&aacute;inte.  M&aacute; t&aacute; seirbh&iacute;s nua &aacute; cur ar f&aacute;il, caithfimid &eacute; a chraobhscaoileadh go bhfuil s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il agus b'fh&eacute;idir go dtiocfaidh &eacute;ileamh n&iacute;os m&oacute; uirthi n&aacute; mar at&aacute;.  Is ait liomsa mar is minic a bh&iacute;onn daoine ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il agus is f&eacute;idir dul ar l&iacute;ne agus teacht air ach n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il uaireanta eile.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l dabht ar bith ann ach gur cheart d&uacute;inn n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun an t-eolas faoi na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il anois tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine.  Is &eacute; an PCRS an aonad laistigh den FSS at&aacute; ag bainisti&uacute; na gc&aacute;rta&iacute; leighis.  T&aacute; feabhas tagtha ar an tseirbh&iacute;s sin i dtaobh na Gaeilge ach b'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil a fhios ag gach duine go bhfuil s&eacute; sin tarlaithe.

T&aacute; Jade Pepper ag cur b&eacute;ime air le cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil traen&aacute;il maidir leis an nGaeilge ann.  T&aacute; 20 duine l&iacute;ofa ann agus t&aacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n eile le Gaeilge mhaith.  T&aacute;imid chun d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith acu agus iad si&uacute;d a bhfuil beag&aacute;n Gaeilge acu chun iad a thabhairt ar aghaidh.
