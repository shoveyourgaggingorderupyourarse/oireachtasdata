Deputies MacSharry and Devlin are tied up with some parliamentary duties but hopefully they will join us later.</p> <p>  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Due to the current situation in respect of Covid-19, only the clerk to the committee, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are complying with that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today we will engage with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We will examine the following from the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation accounts for 2019: Vote 27 &ndash; International Co-operation; and Vote 28 &ndash; Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We will also deal with chapter 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018 - control of humanitarian assistance funding.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs: Mr. Niall Burgess, Secretary General, Mr. John Conlan, chief financial officer and director general of human resources, and Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, director general of Irish Aid.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Brendan Rogers, deputy Secretary General, and Ms Barbara Jones, director general of corporate services.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Vote section in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform: Mr. Brian O'Malley, principal officer, and Ms Victoria Cahill, assistant principal.  They are all very welcome.  I thank them and the rest of the staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs for the briefing material they have supplied for this meeting.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so no background noise or feedback will be picked up.  As usual, I remind all of those in attendance to have their mobile phones turned off or on silent mode.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations regarding parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or witnesses who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask the witness responding to state his or her name when first contributing.</p></speech>

Gross expenditure under Vote 28, Foreign Affairs, amounted to &euro;266 million in 2019.  Administration subheads accounted for 72% of that expenditure.  The largest element of this was salary costs of some 1,745 staff which came to just under &euro;102 million.  Premises expenses of &euro;35 million included costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s network of embassies and missions abroad.  The bulk of the non-administrative expenses comprised annual contributions to a range of international organisations and grants to support services for Irish emigrants.</p> <p>  Receipts into the Vote comprised mainly fees related to the issue of passports and visas, and other consular services.  These receipts were about &euro;10.3 million or 17% above the level projected for the year.  This was primarily due to a higher than expected level of passport applications in 2019.</p> <p>  A net surplus of just over &euro;15.3 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the year end.  I issued a clear audit opinion for the account but drew attention to a significant level of non-compliant procurement in 2019 under the Vote. </p> <p>  Vote 27, International Co-operation, is administered by the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation division.  The Vote accounts for around 63% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, which has a particular focus on states in sub-Saharan Africa.  The 2019 appropriation account for the Vote records gross expenditure of nearly &euro;544 million.  A surplus of nearly &euro;1.4 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  I issued a clear audit opinion for the Vote.</p> <p>  Chapter 8 from my Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018 concerns Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official development assistance and, in particular, the controls applied by the Department in respect of the humanitarian assistance funding it provides.  I ask members to bear in mind that this report was completed in September 2019 and primarily uses 2018 data.  The Accounting Officer will be able to provide updates on any relevant figures.</p> <p>  Humanitarian assistance is distinct from other development aid in that it is often reactive in nature, for example, in emergency situations, such as earthquakes, droughts, wars or political uncertainty resulting in refugee displacement.  Such crises can be protracted and there may be a continuing need for humanitarian assistance over an extended period.</p> <p>  In 2018, which was the year of focus for this report, Ireland provided nearly &euro;186 million in humanitarian assistance.  Humanitarian assistance accounted for almost a quarter of Irish official development assistance that year.  Given the level of humanitarian assistance expenditure, as well as the acute needs of intended beneficiaries, robust control and assurance procedures are key to ensuring that funds are used for the purposes intended and that positive results are achieved.</p> <p>  The conflict in Syria, and the resulting refugee crisis in many neighbouring countries, have been the focus of Ireland&rsquo;s largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The majority of the funding is channelled through various UN agencies, International Red Cross partners, the World Food Programme and non-governmental organisations working in the region.</p> <p>  Depending on the circumstances, the Department may be more or less prescriptive about how the humanitarian assistance funding is to be used.  Elements of funding may therefore be referred to as "earmarked", "softly earmarked" or "un-earmarked".</p><p>All of the Department&rsquo;s development aid is now allocated, monitored and evaluated using a standard grant management procedure.  The examination team found that the majority of controls had been appropriately applied by the Department in respect of three funding interventions for refugees inspected in Jordan.</p><p> The critical controls over unearmarked and softly earmarked funding are those applied at the partner identification stage.  Once such grants have been awarded, the Department does not control how the funding is used by the recipient.  It will typically receive a retrospective financial statement showing how the funding was applied, but that-----</p></speech>

In such cases, the Department reserves the right to carry out an audit of original documentation in support of grant requests, held at the offices of the implementing partner.  The Department has procedures in place for monitoring financial statements submitted by partner organisations.  However, audits in funded agencies are only conducted in circumstances where this analysis of financial statements highlights problems or there are other indicators of concern.  As a result, no such audits have taken place in Jordan and none were carried out in respect of any projects during 2018.  I recommended that the Department should undertake a limited number of planned audits each year, to verify information reported by selected humanitarian assistance partners in receipt of earmarked funding and to check original documentation supporting financial returns received.</p> <p>  Overall, we found that the Department has a comprehensive control framework with regard to the provision of humanitarian assistance and that that framework had been relatively effectively applied in relation to the specific projects sampled.</p></speech>

I will do that.  I thank the committee for inviting me to assist the committee in its examination of the Appropriation Accounts 2019 and Chapter 8 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018 &ndash; Controls over humanitarian assistance funding.  The committee has already had a summary of the main areas of departmental expenditure and receipts in 2019, and I do not propose to introduce that orally.  In many respects, the year under review, 2019, seems far removed from the year that has just passed yet I believe work undertaken then has served us well since.</p> <p>  We published a new framework for providing consular support to Irish citizens abroad after extensive engagement and attentive listening; we expanded our mission network; and brought our global network of honorary consuls home for consultation on how we could improve our service to citizens abroad.  We could not foresee that within months we would assist the largest repatriation of Irish citizens in modern times and help protect the social infrastructure supporting Irish communities made newly vulnerable by the pandemic.</p> <p>  We also continued to invest in our passport service, increasing access to the online service and strengthening the safeguards for citizens in the process.  The passport online service is now available for 97% of applicants worldwide and the investment of recent years has allowed us to provide an essential service safely during lockdown and to accelerate the return to standard processing times as we tackle the outstanding Covid backlog.</p> <p>  In 2019 we entered the final phase of the process that ultimately saw Ireland take a seat on the UN Security Council and assume weighty responsibilities in January this year for issues currently affecting the lives of millions affected by political, humanitarian and climate crises.</p><p>Following extensive consultation with the Oireachtas and the public, we launched a new policy framework for our development assistance.  We also supported the restoration of political institutions in Northern Ireland.  We sustained engagement in Brussels and scaled up the resources allocated to mitigating the economic and political consequences of Brexit.</p><p> I am conscious that the spectrum of programmes and activities covered by Votes 27 and 28 is a wide one.  I will elaborate on two aspects, namely, the development and humanitarian activities provided under Vote 27 and the services we provide to citizens under Vote 28.</p><p> The scale of the challenges faced by our aid agencies and our development and humanitarian programmes is increasing sharply and rapidly.  Last year we saw an increase of over 40% in those requiring humanitarian assistance, an increase of 15% in those facing hunger and food insecurity and the shadow of famine return to Ethiopia.  This is against a backdrop of a decline in global GDP last year of over 5%, impacting most severely on the weakest economies.  To respond effectively and in a timely manner to the unprecedented level of need, the allocation for emergency response and humanitarian assistance is likely to exceed &euro;180 million this year.  It is a source of assurance that the OECD last year concluded that, although Ireland may be small, we are a donor who does things well, channels our development assistance to where it is needed most, exercises leadership and makes a visible difference.</p><p> I referred to the investment in technology underpinning the passport service and to the role it has played in helping us to keep pace with demand, which has risen from 647,000 passports in 2014 to 937,000 in 2019, an increase of 45% in five years.  While the pandemic reduced demand, the passport service was also required to adapt its service in compliance with Government and public health guidance.  When the service scaled up operations in early May, we had some 89,000 passport applications on hand.  Today, approximately 55,000 of these applications have been issued and 20,000 are awaiting further action from the applicant.  I am happy to say that all of the remaining 14,000 applicants will have been issued with passports by next week.    </p><p> I have also referred to the unprecedented consular operation to assist with the repatriation of Irish citizens last year.  Our network of outstanding honorary consuls was critical to this operation.  The service continued to respond to a high level of cases not directly related to the pandemic last year, assisting over 250 families following the tragic death of a loved one abroad as well as over 500 cases requiring complex medical, welfare or legal assistance.   </p><p> I should mention the complementary work of the emigrant support programme in disbursing assistance to communities made newly vulnerable by the pandemic, especially in Britain, the US, Australia and Canada.   A dedicated response fund was established, aimed primarily at protecting the elderly, mitigating the impact of social isolation, responding to individual cases of exceptional hardship, providing mental health supports and bereavement counselling and moving more services online.</p><p> As I will step aside from my current role this year, I take this opportunity to make a few brief acknowledgements to those whose support for my role as Accounting Officer has been invaluable.  First, I acknowledge the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office and my finance directorate, led by John Conlan, and internal audit and evaluation unit, led by Tom Hennessy, for their rigour and impartiality and the assurance this has provided to me.   Second, I acknowledge our audit committee which plays a critical role in our oversight and governance, particularly its chair, Jim O&rsquo;Brien, who will step down this month after five years of public service in this role.  Third, I acknowledge the members of this committee, not least for the detailed work they have undertaken over recent years in examining directly our programmes in complex environments in both Africa and Asia.  I am conscious that it has been three years since this committee had the opportunity to visit a partner country and see the programme in operation.  As the pandemic recedes and we grapple with its legacy, I hope this aspect of its work can be resumed.</p><p> I am joined this morning by deputy secretary for global affairs, Brendan Rogers; director general of corporate and passport services, Barbara Jones; chief financial officer, John Conlan; and director general for development co-operation, Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca.  We look forward to working with the committee in further examining our two Votes and addressing any questions arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on humanitarian assistance.</p></speech>

Forgive me, if I refer to you in an informal manner.  I am a former Minister of State in that Department and I have worked with you in the past.  We have all been tremendously impressed by the leadership that you have given in such challenging times.  I note that you said you were retiring, but you are stepping down as Secretary General.  We hope that you will stay within the service in some way, shape or fashion.  Personally, I wish you well.</p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, both for the work that it does at the bilateral level in terms of its bilateral relations with countries throughout the globe and also at the multilateral level where it deals with the United Nations and other such organisations.  We are lucky to have a Department of Foreign Affairs that is staffed by what I would I call the A team in terms of the work that it does as a Department throughout the globe.  I note, in particular, the reference to consular services.  For us, as TDs, and for Senators, our primary interface with the Department of Foreign Affairs is normally through either consular services or the Passport Office.  I want to acknowledge that that often hidden and silent work is very significant and that it has helped so many of our constituents throughout the country, particularly where bereavements have occurred.  I fully acknowledge that role because it is vitally important, and also that it would be resourced appropriately.  Let me start with that.</p> <p>  On passports, where stands the foreign birth registrations process?  That might be one that the Secretary General might want to defer to his colleagues.</p></speech>

I am happy to bring Barbara Jones, who is managing the passport service, in on this as well.  Essentially, we are prioritising the passport service and the passport backlog at present.</p> <p>  The processing of foreign births registrations is extremely complex and extremely time consuming and, therefore, we are not processing foreign births registrations, FBR, applications as a priority.  We are, however, processing emergency foreign birth registration applications.  By that, I mean where an application has been submitted which is critical to passing on citizenship to the child of an applicant, we will process that application as a priority.  Otherwise, our intention is, in the autumn, as we overhaul the backlog and we return to normal processing times for the passport service, to tackle what is now an accruing backlog in the foreign births registrations.  I am joined by Ms Barbara Jones who. with your permission, Chairman, may wish to add anything on this.</p></speech>

It is significant that today we have a British-Irish intergovernmental meeting here in Dublin.  The organisation of that will consume a lot of the resources of the Department.</p><p>Where are the priorities in respect of the reconciliation fund in the light of the challenges of Brexit and Covid and is there a clear earmarking of funds now to meet those challenges?  I would like an understanding of where the thinking is on how those resources are deployed and if there is a pivot towards the challenges of Brexit, or not.</p></speech>

The fund has increased steadily in recent years.  That is one response.  Three years ago, it stood at &euro;2.7 million and this year it is &euro;5 million, inclusive of a contribution to the northwest partnership.  That reflects a commitment made by the Government under the New Decade, New Approach agreement to increase funding for reconciliation fund activities.  Funding has increased beyond the scope of that commitment.</p> <p>  We recently agreed a new strategy for the reconciliation fund.  Much of what the fund has long been doing still needs to be done.  It is doing work that other donors and assistance providers are not doing.  One element of that work has been to increase its accessibility to applicants.  Another element has been to increase the component within the fund for North-South activities, but also for east-west activities.  Therefore, we are investing more of the total proportion of the reconciliation fund in activities that support British-Irish links or in activities within Great Britain.</p></speech>

I will move now the Irish Aid programme.  A number of conflicts have arisen in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Ethiopia where there is an Irish embassy and aid programmes.  I refer to the Gambella and Tigray regions.  I am concerned about Irish citizens who are working in those regions.  I am concerned on the one hand that there may not be a sufficient deployment of resources to ensure the safety and security of Irish citizens and, on the other, that the programmes, in particular what are known as the safety net programmes to ensure food security, are being hampered by the conflict.  Can Mr. Burgess reassure us that there is sufficient protection of Irish citizens, in particular embassy staff, Irish, non-Irish and local, and of those working in NGOs in the conflict areas in order that they can carry out their work?  What is their status?  It would be helpful to know if increased resources have been deployed into that effort in real time.</p></speech>

It is a concern not just for our embassy staff, but for Irish citizens who play a vital role in many of these regions.  There have been two drivers of insecurity in the past couple of years.  The first is the growth of humanitarian displacement and conflict in several of these areas, not only in the wider Horn of Africa, but across the Middle East and in parts of the Gulf region and large parts of the Sahel as well.  It is apparent from our consular statistics that Irish citizens are to be found in all regions, including the most insecure, for many good reasons.  The other driver has been the pandemic.  This has been of real concern to us, including in regard to the protection of our staff also in areas that are not particularly subject to conflict or other forms of insecurity.  We have extraordinarily dedicated staff across our embassy network in Africa, but many of them have been working in areas where the pandemic has taken a very significant toll through a period when they have not been able to benefit from vaccination.</p><p>Many have been working in areas where the pandemic has taken a significant toll and they have not been able to benefit from vaccination.  We have strict protocols in place regarding the safety of our staff.  Safety comes first.  Most of our staff in Africa have been working from home where they can.  On the other hand, we have new responsibilities on the UN Security Council and we have taken a lead in its efforts to address the conflict in Ethiopia.  Security and safety have to be balanced with the job that we do.  We have visited Tigray a number of times.  Our ambassador and head of development in Ethiopia have been to Tigray, always in close consultation with the UN and local authorities, and under strict security protocols.</p></speech>

That is the first time that we have heard that.  We have read about the conflict in Tigray but it is reassuring that there are clear protocols for the safety of both embassy staff and those working on the ground.  I cannot let the opportunity pass to ask about B&oacute;thar and whether there was any financial exposure of Irish Aid or the Department to the recent B&oacute;thar scandal.  Can the Secretary General tell us anything about any exposure that the taxpayer has had?</p></speech>

I will put the question another way.  Has Irish Aid ever funded B&oacute;thar?  That is a factual yes-no answer.  I want to get a perspective without prejudicing any ongoing case.</p></speech>

We had some concerns and as a result, we did not respond positively to applications for funding in 2018 and 2019.  I ask my colleague, Mr. de B&uacute;rca, to elaborate briefly and carefully on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062400002#G00600"><p>The Department historically funded B&oacute;thar.  We have no evidence to suggest that the funding that we provided was used in any way improperly.  In 2016 and 2017, we raised a number of questions regarding B&oacute;thar's corporate structures.  It did not provide us with satisfactory answers.  On that basis, we decided in 2018 not to agree to a request for additional funding because it had not progressed the governance changes that we asked for.  Without wanting to go into any area which may be the subject of an investigation, this showed the robustness of our controls and how we look at and assess the corporate structures of organisations that we fund.  We took the best decision we could at the time.  We have regular contact with the Charities Regulator which is in some ways a new operator.  The Charities Regulator conducted its own investigation which is currently suspended pending other actions.  We are at advanced stages of negotiating a memorandum of understanding between Irish Aid and the Charities Regulator, which will give us additional comfort in the future.  We will be able to take advantage of changes in the past year to the rules and oversight role of the Charities Regulator.</p></speech>

Is the Department satisfied that this disbursement is going exactly where it needs to go?  I know there is a particular emphasis on funding education within the occupied territories.  Can Mr. de B&uacute;rca or the Secretary General provide a perspective on the importance of funding by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish taxpayer into the occupied territories?</p></speech>

There is an assessment under way following the recent conflict to understand the nature of the destruction caused and we will be making an additional disbursement of humanitarian assistance once we have received that information from the United Nations.  That will be followed up on by our representative office in Ramallah on the ground as well to make sure that it is targeted at the most needy.</p></speech>

Our ongoing commitment to humanitarian assistance and particularly to overseas development aid is one of the reasons I am most proud to be Irish.  It is one of the most important things that we do on a global level.</p> <p>  I want to stick with the occupied territories now that it has been brought up.  Is that &euro;16.3 million an increase from last year in terms of a response to the recent unrest and the damage that has been caused?  What controls does the Department have in place?  While I am aware this is done in conjunction with the UN, the Irish taxpayer is possibly funding construction or structures that are then removed or bulldozed.  What structures do we have in place or what kind of value for money reviews and follow-up work are we doing in instances where that is a concern?</p></speech>

The &euro;16.3 million is approximately the same as the allocation we started out with last year.  We have made an initial response of just over &euro;1 million, from memory, to the conflict.  As I said in response to Deputy Sherlock, we are awaiting a UN assessment of needs and we will be making a further allocation based on that shortly.  I would anticipate that by the end of the year, the total allocation to Palestine will be quite a bit higher than it was in 2020 but we want to do this in a sensible way and on the basis of need.<br/><br/>On the potential destruction of properties, we are part of the West Bank Protection Consortium, along with a number of EU member states and the EU itself, which, over the last decade, has collectively put about &euro;15 million into various infrastructures, of which our share is approximately &euro;1 million.  At present, and this is without an assessment of damage done in the recent conflict, there are outstanding compensation requests for about &euro;625,000, which have been lodged and on which we are awaiting adjudication.  Our <i>pro rata</i>share of that is about &euro;12,500.  We are active on that.  The Minister has raised the question with the Israeli ambassador and directly with his Israeli counterparts in the region.  Our ambassador to Israel has also raised this, as have our EU counterparts, and it is something on which Brussels and the EU ambassador to Israel are active.  It is one of those things we are working hard on.</p><p>I think its significance is possibly beyond just the financial value but we are very active on it, as is the Minister.</p></speech>

I want to return to the passport service and, more specifically, the visa service.  Immigrants in Ireland who apply for re-entry and renewal are being blocked from making appointments with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service by Internet bots or opportunists.  I believe this matter was raised in 2018.  I have had representations since Christmas that this is still an issue and people are still being required to engage with an outside actor, shall we say, to make an appointment for a visa.  A visa appointment is often time-specific for the people who need it.  They need to renew a visa or access something.  I understand that things are more complex because of the pandemic, but where are we with that issue?</p></speech>

The immigration and naturalisation service operates under the framework of the Department of Justice.  The Department of Foreign Affairs provides the platform globally through our embassy and mission network which allows for those who wish to come to Ireland and who need a visa in order to do so to make an application through an Irish Embassy.  It essentially operates through a Department of Justice process so I am not sighted on the mechanics of that.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is not for me to call it "significant", but there was an underspend in recent years.  The Estimate grant provision to the IFI was &euro;2.6 million but only &euro;200,000 was expended in 2019.  Can the witnesses speak to that and elaborate on why that might be the case?  For people who do not know what we are talking about, the IFI includes initiatives such as the personal youth development and the peace impact programme across the island.</p></speech>

The International Fund for Ireland, until very recently, was essentially scaling down its activities and working through its existing workload.  One of the real values of the International Fund for Ireland has been the connection it made between the US, in particular, and other donors and reconciliation activities in Northern Ireland.  We have been working with the board of the IFI for some years to allow it to sustain and maintain its activities, particularly with US support and possibly also with EU support.  However, it was unable to secure matching funding or support until recently.  The funds we had in our account were not ultimately deployed to the IFI because we did not have matching funds from other organisations.  That has now finally changed because the IFI has secured funding support and a commitment to funding support for another phase of activities with a significant commitment of funds through Congress in the US and from the UK.  We now believe its funding activities and programmes are getting back on track, as is needed.</p></speech>

Does the governance structure mean that the &euro;2.6 million cannot be accessed unless it has a partner fund from an outside source?</p></speech>

From our point of view, therefore, critical to giving the IFI the role and the authority it needed was that it had a broader funding base.</p><p> In its very origins, the IFI received funding from the US, Australia, New Zealand and then subsequently from the European Union as well.  We offered some modest support to help it scale up its activities and we have also been encouraging the British to give it support in order that it has a broader funding base and can operate in a way that is perceived as a wholly independent entity.  The commitment to funding, by the way, is &euro;20 million over the lifetime of its new strategy, which runs from this year to 2024.  That is the context in which we are funding it this year.</p></speech>

It seems extraordinary to have &euro;2 million or so sitting in a bank account every year waiting and not being utilised, however.  Having lived in Belfast for five years, I must say, when one is dealing with things like the peace walls, we have never needed it more and there is a lot one could do with that money.  While I understand the intention, is waiting for the partner funding the best option?  Does that not curtail the good work that money could do?</p></speech>

Through that period, for some of those years when we were not drawing down the funding, which was allocated but not drawn down by the Department of Foreign Affairs for the IFI, we were also scaling up our reconciliation fund programming and we also had funding coming through from European Union sources.  I cannot say that the IFI was knocking on the doors for a project that was critically in need of funding that could only be supplied through this route.  I am not sure there were opportunities missed there.  From our point of view, however, it would not have been helpful to the IFI if it had been in receipt of funding solely from the Irish Government.  That is so much outside the kind of framework in which it is operated and that is the reason we did not draw those funds down for the IFI.  They were earmarked for the IFI.</p></speech>

I understand that is still under construction.  It is for the embassy and will obviously host State agencies such as IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and so on.  I understand there was a significant discount from the Japanese Government.  Mr. Burgess might tell us what the site initially cost and what discount was achieved.  Were other sites shortlisted?  How was the site identified?  Would, for example, IDA Ireland make a contribution or does it exclusively come from the Department of Foreign Affairs' budget?  Has Covid-19 had an impact on the delivery of the embassy?</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy as succinct an answer as I can on that.  First, I am acutely conscious of leasing versus purchasing.  We know that where we have purchased before, in the long term, that has delivered much more value for the State.  We have been looking for opportunities where we can save in the long term and provide a better platform for promoting Ireland through purchase.  In a way, Ireland House in Tokyo is probably the best example of that on the ground at the moment.  Construction has not yet begun.  We are still in detailed discussion with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the other agencies and interested partners on the precise fit-out of that building and on the exact requirements they need for their own platforms in Japan over the next ten or 15 years.</p><p>We are taking a long-term view here.</p><p> The site was purchased for &euro;7 million and it is a premium site in Tokyo.  It was a discount of 40% to 50% on the commercial value of the site.  We hope to put that project out to tender in the early autumn and begin work on construction of the site in the spring.  The timescale has fallen adrift but only by a few months.  It has not been materially affected by Covid-19.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Burgess for that.  I will also ask about Irish Aid and Palestine.  The briefing cites a figure of &euro;12.7 million for 2019 only.  I am trying to address cases where medical supplies might be destroyed by conflict, for example.  Does the Department seek reparations in such cases?  Has it recovered anything from Israel in that year?  Is that approach taken by the Department?</p></speech>

There has clearly been enormous destruction in the region over recent months.  We seek compensation.

We have purchased over recent years where we see an opportunity to do so.  We have been opening new missions at quite a rapid rate in recent years.  By the end of this year we will have opened 14 new missions in total.  The best way to establish a presence on the ground and to understand the market well is to either co-locate with another partner, and in many cases that is done with EU partners or the European Union itself.  Once established, we can then look for opportunities for purchase.  For example, with recent missions opened in both Bogot&aacute; and Santiago and having been established there in the past two to three years, we are looking at purchase options to give us a more sustainable footing in both of those countries in the longer term.  It is a part of our thinking and process.</p></speech>

I ask this question because the Minister stated last week that 37,000 of the 89,000 had been processed and would be cleared by the end of June.  Given that the backlog is even larger now, I suspect that it will more likely be the end of July or August before the backlog is cleared.</p></speech>

As Mr. Burgess has clarified, we have issued 55,000 passports, with 14,000 more on track to be completed by Thursday.  When we get the information for the extra 20,000 applications, they will be fast-tracked because we are keen to support the issuing of passports to those who have been affected by the pandemic.  In the meantime, we have continued to meet our service target of a ten-day turnaround for all online applications.  Therefore, there is no backlog in our system.  In fact, it is a great tribute to the staff of the office, who must attend on site, that they have resumed.  We have scaled up services, are clearing the backlog with great speed and are accelerating the return to normal service levels.</p></speech>

The investment we have consistently made in recent years in a modern, award winning, world-class passport service is now paying off as we scale up post-Covid.  We have apologised to, and are very sorry for, those who have been delayed by any of the disruption in service, which was due to the Covid-19 pandemic and not through any fault in our systems.

We see that &euro;91 million was disbursed, predominantly to Irish NGOs.  Can the witnesses outline what the checks and balances are there when money is disbursed to an NGO?

There is a series of extensive checks.  NGOs apply to a number of different schemes and, depending on the nature of the contract, the checks may vary but they are always thorough and rigorous.  For very large NGOs, the household names such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and organisations like that, we have predictable multi-year funding.  We agree a set of multi-annual outcomes, which determine that funding.  We do a very thorough investigation of organisational capacities, governance checks, etc., at the beginning of that multi-annual framework period, which then enables us to have a degree of satisfaction that this is an organisation in which we can have trust.  Every given year, we have a secondary checking process, through our standard approach to grant management, which the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned, where on the basis of audit checks, monitoring, reports and a series of other meetings, we agree to disburse.</p></speech>

Moneys were supposed to be allocated for projects.  It appears those projects never got any funding of any description.

We do audits, management checks and monitoring visits.  Our embassies also check.  We have regular meetings.  We go and see, and we follow the money.  We have quite a strong record of uncovering frauds where they occur and we follow them up.  As the question arises in the context of a given organisation, we have no evidence to suggest that Irish Aid funding that went to that organisation historically did not go to where it was intended.  However, our governance checks indicated that we were not happy so we decided not to continue funding.  That shows that the checks are robust.</p></speech>

In one of the areas I visited, I found two different organisations and both of them were getting the same level of funding.  This was not from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  One organisation was looking after and providing education to approximately 300 people and the other one, with the same amount of money, was providing education to 3,000 people.  How does Irish Aid check that it is getting the results and the best value for the aid it is giving?</p></speech>

One of the things we do with organisations we fund is take a detailed check, an organisational assessment, of their capacity to deliver.  We agree a results framework, which is reported on regularly and also monitored and checked.  One of the really important elements in that is to benchmark performance.  We look at that and we make assessments, such as organisation A is better placed to do something than organisation B.  One of the other things we bring into this is the fact that often we are not the only funder.  We often fund in consortia.  One of the very important elements in that is that the members of the consortium share information.  A key element here is that we, through our evaluation and audit unit, also evaluate performance perhaps midway through big relationships or we do a joint evaluation, and those evaluations are shared among OECD donors.  A very good suite of information is shared.  We work with a relatively limited number of organisations.  In those partnerships there is a sense of historical knowledge as well.  Past performance helps us to determine and give a risk assessment in terms of future relationship.</p></speech>

First, I wish Mr. Burgess well in his next endeavours.  Starting with the positive, I pay tribute to him and his staff for the wonderful information they disseminate on social media.  Mr. Burgess leads from the top in that regard.  He is very active on Twitter and that applies across the various missions across the globe.  I congratulate him on the work he has done.</p> <p>  I also pay tribute to the staff in the various diplomatic missions across the world for their support to Irish citizens in the face of the pandemic.  From early 2020 all of us parliamentarians were engaging with the Department and the work it did and support it gave to citizens in need of sometimes just simple information, but also with regard to repatriation.  On that point, does Mr. Burgess have a number?  He may have said it in the opening statement and I did not catch it.  Does he have the number of people the Department assisted in terms of repatriation from early 2020 and the cost associated with that?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

I also thank him for his comments about my colleagues in the mission network.</p><p>We assisted some 24,000 people with phone lines during that period.  We assisted directly around 8,500 Irish citizens in returning home, mostly during the first six months of the pandemic.  With regard to those 8,500 citizens, we operated three repatriation flights, one from Nigeria, one from India and one for our citizens in Peru, which was arguably one of the most complex of all the operations.  In addition, towards the end of the year we activated our crisis centre and phone lines again to assist citizens who had been stranded in Great Britain.  We assisted around 3,500 back then, some on flights and some on ferry connections.</p><p> On the total cost of those repatriations, they were handled in very different ways.  The flights we organised were mostly reimbursed through EU sources and many of our citizens came home from other parts of the world on flights organised by other EU partners.  A basic reimbursement system was put in place for that.  In some cases, the operators took direct reimbursement from the citizens and in some cases we brought the citizens home but asked them to reimburse us later.  The amount outstanding to our own account is in my report.  The actual cost so far is &euro;147,000.</p></speech>

He mentioned the Peruvian repatriation.  Constituents of mine needed to avail of that and it was quite complex owing to the location in which they found themselves.  The support and information available to them and the assistance given to them on the ground were exemplary.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  On the passport service, I note what Ms Jones said about the volume of renewals and new passport applications.  We are all being contacted by constituents at this time.  The online service is working excellently.  The point was correctly made that people need to provide correct information in order for a passport to be issued.  However, there are some anomalies in that regard and where these are brought to the Department's attention, they are generally dealt with very quickly.  I thank the Department for that.  Is there a figure for the number of renewals expected before the year end?  A large number of people have not looked at their passport because they are not planning to travel abroad.</p></speech>

Our projections have held fairly firm so far.  Our planning is based on the assumption that whereas in 2019, the last full year of operation, we issued just under 1 million passports, the largest number we have ever issued in a single year, next year, in 2022, we will probably issue 1.5 million passports.  Many of those not renewed over the previous two years are likely to come back to us for renewal next year.  Our current experience is that some people whose passports are due for renewal are not renewing them at present because they are not planning to travel this year.</p></speech>

On the Appropriation Accounts 2019, I will start by looking at the diplomatic consular offices abroad.  The capital assets are listed in note 2.1 on page 11.  The total net capital assets at December 2019 was &euro;169 million, with &euro;159 million accounted for by land and buildings.

I would like to get an understanding of the Department's plan to expand the diplomatic footprint, especially following Brexit.  Recently, I heard the Minister speak about plans to set up more than a dozen new missions in locations across the globe in places like Latin America, India, Africa, the Middle East and New Zealand.  How are the plans in this regard progressing?</p></speech>

The figure is 167 properties in total, of which in the region of 35 are owned by the State.</p> <p>  We have been asked to increase our footprint by 25 or 26 new missions by 2025.  That is set out in the Global Ireland programme.  Broadly speaking, the idea is to double Ireland's global influence in the period up to 2025.  Stepping onto the UN Security Council was one very immediate measure of how we are trying to do that.  Essentially, we are trying to increase Ireland's influence on outcomes that matter to this country and to our citizens.  By the end of this year, we will have opened 14 new missions.  We have already opened 11 missions this year to date.  Last month we opened a new embassy in Kiev and next month we will open a new mission, a consulate, in Manchester.  In the autumn we will open new embassies in Morocco and the Philippines.  The new embassies are one measure of that.  We have also scaled up several of our existing embassies.  For example, our embassy in London has significant new resources not only from the Department of Foreign Affairs but from across the Government.  Our properties essentially provide the platform for a whole-of-government presence.  We scaled up our presence in Berlin, in Paris, in several EU missions, in China, Tokyo, in the US and Washington and in the UN.  There is another dimension to the scaling-up which is less visible.  In that context, we expect that we will open in the region of another 12 missions over the course of the next four years, at about three a year, but the decisions on where those will be have not yet been taken.  That is a matter for the Government.</p></speech>

We are approximately halfway through the passport reform programme and have another couple of years to run on this before it is finally concluded.</p> <p>  On the impact of Brexit, most of the Covid-19 backlog of passport applications are from citizens on this island.  The number of applications from citizens in Great Britain is a relatively minor portion of that.  An area where we are seeing the impact of Brexit is our foreign births registration.  For example, the growing number of foreign birth applications that will need to be processed in the autumn, when we can come to that, contains a very high proportion of applications from Great Britain, possibly in excess of half.  I will bring Ms Jones in if she wishes to add anything on this point and on the reform programme.</p></speech>

We are making a highly ambitious and necessary move to continue the programme that we started in 2016.  We started out with a very significant investment of &euro;21.5 million.  Our completion date is September 2021.  We are now moving towards a final delivery phase of a programme called the passport issuance and processing system, PIPS, not orange pips but a programme for identification, passport and foreign birth registration.  We will deliver the final phase of the project of taking traditional paper-based processing and streamlining and re-engineering the service for delivery in 2023.</p></speech>

I want first to recognise the work of the Department on Brexit, including the work of the officials in Brussels, Belfast and Dublin,  Their work on behalf of the State and the Oireachtas was to ensure that the worst of all Brexits and its worst effects on this country and on this State were mitigated.  This should be recognised.</p> <p>  To return to the Passport Office itself briefly, does it have plans to open a passport office in the North?  There have been requests for such an office and I am aware that a substantial number of passports have been sought by people, particularly in the years since the Brexit referendum and I note that a majority of the people in the North voted to stay within the European Union.  Obviously, the vote unfortunately went a different way and there was an upsurge of applications for passports from the Six Counties.  Does the Department have any plans or has there been any discussions around opening an office in Belfast, Derry or anywhere else in the North?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062400002#R01000"><p>The short answer is "No".  Our focus on the passport service essentially has been to put the passport office on one's own desk.  In other words it is to bring it directly to the citizen in order that one can apply in one's own home for one's passport where it can be done quickly, with an increased assurance around one's identity and where we can then process and return that passport to the person within days.</p><p>That has been the objective and it has really narrowed if not disappeared the space between somebody here in Kildare Street who wants to apply for a passport - the Passport Office used to be around the corner in Molesworth Street - and a citizen anywhere else in the country or in the world.  This should shorten the processing times for all of them and this has been the overwhelming focus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062400002#S00200"><p>Perhaps Ms Jones may wish to answer this question.  On the passport services, the cost of the booklet I understand in 2019 went from &euro;800,000 to in the region of &euro;7 million.  Was there a particular reason for that?</p> <p>  On counter services, I am aware that we have discussed this and it is good that it is happening online.  She has outlined where the office is turning passports around online now in ten days, for the time to fully complete and issue an application.  I commend the office on that.  On that point, there is a section of the population that do not use computers and 15% to 20% of people is the figure generally given.  What is the situation in respect of counter services for such people and what is the position regarding the increase in the passport booklet costs in 2019?</p></speech>

In fact we will need to design a new passport booklet, which is part of our passport reform project over the next number of years.  The volume of booklets purchased may have increased in that year and I will defer to Ms Jones, who may have that information or perhaps our chief financial officer, but the passport booklet itself has not increased in cost.  Does Ms Jones wish to elaborate on that point or deal with the Passport Express issue?</p></speech>

Of course, people who have difficulty accessing this very digital online framework can pick up the old-fashioned telephone and speak to a person and get support through the process.</p> <p>  One thing I want to emphasise regarding that category of people who have a vulnerability is that the people from the National Adult Literacy Agency who helped us to simplify all of our business processes have commended us on the ease of access, that is, the simple supportive way we go about delivering our service.  That means, therefore, if somebody in the category that the Chairman rightly has concerns about were to have an urgent need for a passport or support as to travel, they can pick up the old-fashioned telephone, call one of our colleagues, get support, lodge with us and signal their need for a passport, for example, for God forbid, a death in a family, a need to travel to the UK for a funeral, or some such event, and we can then fast-track such an application.</p></speech>

Ms Jones mentioned vulnerable people and there are many people who would not be vulnerable who still do not use computers for a number of reasons.</p><p> Moving on to Palestine and the situation there, it was mentioned by one of the officials that &euro;16.3 million is being allocated for Palestine this year.  That is welcome.  The village of Khirbet Humsu has been raised to the ground by Israeli forces no less than three times.  It has been reported, included in photographic evidence, that some of the material used to construct that village had Irish Aid labels on it.  We are speaking in this regard about vulnerable people in the West Bank.  It was mentioned that the matter has been taken up with the Israeli ambassador here and that the Irish ambassador in Israel has also taken it up with the Government there.  It is good to hear that.  What is happening at EU level in terms of turning the screws in relation to the Israeli Government and these types of what can be only described as war crimes?  These are totally illegal actions by the Israeli Government.  Is much effort being made to put pressure on the Israeli Government in respect of the actions it has carried out against innocent civilians in these areas?</p></speech>

I have been looking at the figures for the Passport Office.  We purchased an additional stock of passport booklets in 2019.  I wonder if that is the figure referenced by the Chairman.  We purchased it as a buffer against Brexit, in anticipation that passport demand would increase in 2020.  That may show in the accounts as an increased cost for passport booklets.<br/><br/>On the destruction of these villages, we have said repeatedly that that is unacceptable.  We have said that to the Israelis at all levels.  We have spoken about the efforts we make to recoup and seek compensation for assets that Ireland has contributed directly or indirectly.  Ireland is one of the most vocal members of the European Union in discussions on these issues.  The Chairman asked what more we can do to exert influence.  We are influential but there is a significant body of opinion within the European Union that does not agree with us.  It strikes me that while the Minister or Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said recently that what is happening in the occupied territories amounts to <i>de facto</i>annexation, not many other EU partners have joined us in that assessment.  That is the issue within the European Union.  I believe we are as vocal and influential as we can possibly be.</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il recently passed a motion brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in in regard to the annexation of that part of Palestine.  It is welcome that Ireland is vocal.  I take on board Mr. Burgess's point that we have to bring others with us.</p> <p> On compensation from the Israeli Government, have we ever received compensation for damage caused by Israeli military actions to equipment, buildings or any other type of aid supplied by the Irish Government?  </p></speech>

For example, the Shankill Women's Centre is an organisation that we have long supported and worked closely with.  We do not allocate or apportion funding according to the geographic area or community.  We consider funding applications on their merits and we fund them accordingly.  Within the framework of the reconciliation fund, we fund a number of projects that have a cross-Border dimension and projects in respect of which there are links between communities on either side of the Border.  Each application is considered on its own merits.  That has been a really valuable part of our overall work on reconciliation in Northern Ireland and on North-South work because it connects the work of the Department in a deeply rooted way to work that is happening at community level.  That is where the expansion in the reconciliation fund and the additional resources behind it will make an impact over time.</p></speech>

I presume the issue of cybersecurity was foremost in the minds of people when it was being designed.  Has there been a review in that regard and is it an ongoing consideration?</p> <p>  On the missionary organisations, have any of them been identified as not capable of meeting their long-term development programmes?  If so, in 2019, did funding cease to any of them?</p></speech>

We fund an organisation called Misean Cara, which works with missionary organisations to vet projects.  It is not that missionary organisations are funded.  Projects proposed by missionary organisations that are members of Misean Cara are funded on the basis of project applications, which are assessed against a set of criteria.  Some of those applications pass and others fail.  It is not orders that are funded; it is projects in different parts of the world.  From memory, missionary projects in more than 100 countries were funded in 2019.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question, but that is the model that we use to fund missionaries.</p></speech>

I consider cyber to be a significant operational risk across our operations.  We take extensive measures to protect passport data.  Our passport data are kept separate from the rest of the Department's data and they are encrypted.  We take continuous actions to upgrade our measures to deal with cyber.  We can see the activity.  We are subject continuously to phishing attacks at the Department.</p><p>In addition to technological measures, we also take human measures.  We do a lot of training and testing of our measures across the Department to increase awareness of the risks of these attacks but it is something we are very keenly aware of.</p></speech>

I heard Mr. Burgess say that there were 259 families impacted or requiring repatriation due to citizens who had died abroad.  I know this is a sensitive issue for those impacted.  I am also aware of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, KBRT, which I am sure the Department is as it works closely with it.  Are there any plans on behalf of the Department to re-examine the support for families that have been impacted by bereavement abroad and that require that service?</p> <p>  If the witnesses do not have time to come back on my second question they might send me a note on it.  On expanding the Irish footprint abroad with our diplomatic missions, I understand the witnesses said that missions in Morocco and Philippines will be opening in 2022.  My understanding was that would take place in 2020 and a further 13 missions were anticipated to be open by 2025.</p> <p>  On our diplomatic missions, particularly in the more challenging areas and regions, Deputy Sherlock referred earlier to physical security reviews for both the diplomatic missions themselves and our staff.  How often are they conducted?  I note that there was a saving of &euro;897,000 in that arena in 2019.  While that is welcome and I compliment the Department on making savings, it is important that we spend wisely and that we ensure we have the best and most robust security system.</p></speech>

It is in the nature of things nowadays that Irish people are travelling further, staying longer, travelling at an older age and travelling at a younger age.  That means that the number of assists with bereavements has been increasing.  The number of cases where families have genuine financial difficulties with repatriation are a modest proportion of those cases.  That is where organisations such as the KBRT play a vital role and provide support.  We take a human and flexible approach to how we work with citizens and that approach has stood us in good stead.  </p> <p>  We have to continuallly review the suite of consular services and the way we provide them.  That was something we did when we brought our honorary consuls back to Ireland in 2019.  On expanding the footprint, those two missions in Morocco and Philippines will open this year and not next year.  We will have them open in the autumn.  That will leave us with a plan to potentially open another 12 missions over the following four years.  The average we are working towards is about three per year.</p> <p>  On the physical security reviews, we are putting more time, care and attention into physical security than ever before.  We are working on this jointly with other partners to some extent.  I was involved, for example, in the collocation of our embassy in Cairo with another EU partner, where we were able to significantly benefit from their security systems, and that brought particular assurance to our staff.  We carry out a rolling programme of security reviews with the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Security is fundamental to the way we are opening new properties and we have built that expertise into our property management unit as well.</p> <p>  The simple reality now is that one might have held security as a primary consideration in more fragile parts of the world but some of the most difficult security issues I have had to deal with as Secretary General have been in response to events in Paris and Brussels, where we have large numbers of staff.  The old assumptions around security and how it operates simply no longer apply, which means we have to step up our support.</p></speech>

If we take 2019 as a baseline year, there were 32,000 applications for FBR in total to be processed by the Passport Office.  To the best of my knowledge, that has risen from 6,000 pre-Brexit in 2015.  What is the current backlog?</p></speech>

For example, if an applicant tells us that he or she is expecting a child and that acquiring citizenship through FBR is essential to passing Irish citizenship on to his or her child, then we will pick that application out and work with him or her to make sure there is no loss.  The numbers of FBR applications have been increasing as a result of Brexit but for the greater part, these applicants have another citizenship and are carrying the passport of another country.  Therefore, for the time being that is where we have prioritised resources for passport applications from Irish citizens and the processing of FBRs.  We hope to address this backlog in the autumn.</p></speech>

The time limit on passport applications is that there is a requirement that the photograph be a current image.  Therefore, that requires the photograph submitted to have been taken within six months.  That does not apply to FBRs.</p> <p>  Ms Jones was talking about the passport reform project and the intention is that as this project concludes, we will bring FBR applications online as well.  It is not sustainable that one waits 12 or 18 months for an application to be processed.  The intention with the reform programme is to bring it online so that it is issued with the kind of efficiencies with which passports are issued.</p></speech>

It is hard to overstate the role they play in helping us repatriate our citizens.  There is an honorary consul in Perth, Lagos and Lima in Peru, where we do not have missions and where we were not able to travel as we would have wanted and they were absolutely critical in organising repatriations.  Our honorary consul in Lima in Peru met our citizens coming in on buses from different parts of the country and ensured they were put on a plane safely and returned home.  They work for a modest stipend, which I think is in the order of approximately &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500 per annum.  Some of them provide a high volume of consular products, such as a visa service, and they retain some of the processing fee in order to cover their costs.  Some of them maintain offices and a secretariat to help provide services to Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, assistant professor, school of social policy, social work and social justice, UCD; Dr. Barra Roantree, economist and research officer, and Dr. Theano Kakoulidou, postdoctoral research fellow, ESRI.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if a witness is giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, he or she may not, as such, benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present would do.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na ha&iacute;onna at&aacute; ann inniu.

As mentioned, I am an economist and assistant professor of social policy at the school of social policy, social work and social justice, University College Dublin.  I was also a member of the 2008 to 2009 Commission on Taxation and, within the commission, chaired the subgroup on tax expenditure.  As a researcher, I am also part of an international research group focused on the links between taxation and social policy and within that I focus on the often hidden role of the State in using taxation systems to encourage and support certain activities among individuals and corporates via tax expenditure.</p> <p>  I also welcome the decision of the select committee to return once again to the topic of tax expenditure.  The committee's report on the topic from 2019 was most welcome and reflected the relevance of giving this area increased attention as part of the annual budgetary oversight process.</p> <p>  It may be useful to put the scale of tax expenditure in some context.  Budget 2021 outlined an expectation that the State will collect &euro;77.6 billion in tax and social insurance contributions this year.</p><p>Data from the Revenue Commissioners for 2018 show approximately 85 discretionary tax expenditure measures costing a total of &euro;15.8 billion in revenue forgone.  These are measures which are not structural to the taxation system but which have been put in place to incentivise certain activities or as a means of pursuing certain policy objectives.  Many of these are well targeted and worthwhile, although for the most part we assume this rather than have any hard evidence to support it, while others have a less robust basis for defending their cost and effectiveness.  Overall and put simply, for every &euro;5 collected in taxation and social insurance, the State currently decides not to collect an additional &euro;1 forgone through the provision of various tax breaks and reliefs.</p><p> The information available to this committee, and to Irish society in general, regarding tax expenditure measures has increased dramatically over the last decade or so.  When the Commission on Taxation commenced its work in 2008, there was limited information on the annual costs.  This situation has been transformed following the work of that commission, revisions to the scale of information on tax expenditures published by the Revenue Commissioners, annual reports from the Department of Finance and requirements at European level for all countries to report on the nature and scale of the tax resources they decide not to collect each year via tax expenditure.</p><p> While this increase in information is welcome, there remains a deficit in parliamentary scrutiny of tax expenditure measures concerning new proposals and existing provisions.  I encourage the committee to consider these measures as equivalent to direct expenditure by Departments or Government agencies and to approach them in that way.  In particular, I recommend and encourage the committee to select a theme each year and to review the merits of each existing tax expenditure measure under that scheme.  Approaching the long list of tax expenditures in that way will make them more accessible and the exploration more intuitive.  I also recommend that the committee review the case made in the budget and finance Bills, and in associated documentation, for the introduction of each new tax expenditure measure.  The Commission on Taxation and the Department of Finance have each provided a useful set of criteria to assess the appropriateness of new measures and it would be worthwhile for a committee such as this to consider if the measures as proposed and designed adhere to these criteria.  Overall, if we treated tax expenditure more like new and recurring departmental expenditure it would represent a more comprehensive assessment of the State's decisions regarding taxation collection and resource allocation.</p><p> While my main message to the committee is concerns the merit of establishing recurring and structured assessments of tax expenditure as part of the process of budgetary oversight, I am conscious of the discussions the committee has had in recent months and the forthcoming post-pandemic fiscal context.  The pandemic has reminded us of the often hidden role that welfare states, such as ours, play in providing a safety net for all members of society.  No doubt, that experience will frame much of the policy response in the years to come and points to at least a greater recognition of the role of the State and, most likely, a more enhanced role for the State.  Coupled with the impact of higher public debt, higher than anticipated debt-financing costs and the long-overdue reform of the international corporate taxation system, it seems inevitable that the State will have to raise more taxation on a recurring basis once the pandemic has subsided.  In the absence of large-scale reductions in public services and redistributive supports, an increase in total taxation and social insurance contributions is a matter of how and not if.</p><p> Within the context of broadening the tax base and ensuring a progressive overall taxation system, reforms to tax expenditure have an important role to play in the period ahead.  The following is a shortlist of five such reforms which I encourage the committee to consider in the context of budgets in the years to come.  These measures are a mixture of those seeking to enhance fairness and those likely to generate significant additional taxation income; some do both.  The first of these measures is to broaden the high-income individuals&rsquo; restriction to cover all tax relief measures.  Currently, this measure, which ensures a minimum income taxation contribution from higher earners, those on more than &euro;125,000 per annum, applies to specified reliefs rather than all tax reliefs.</p><p>As a consequence, some tax expenditure measures, such as relief on pension savings, are excluded from the restriction.  It makes sense to have a minimum income taxation contribution.  There was none prior to when this measure first emerged in 2006-2007, but it should cover the use of all tax relief measures.  The committee should note that the minimum rates are low, when benchmarked against the rates paid by others down the earnings distribution.  Currently, the minimum rate gradually rises from 20% at &euro;125,000 to 30% at &euro;250,000 and to 40% at &euro;400,000 and above.  A 20% rate is equivalent to the tax level faced by a single PAYE worker earning &euro;39,000.</p><p> A second proposal or suggestion is to phase out tax credits for those earning more than &euro;100,000 per annum.  The provision of tax credits to workers, the self-employed, and families is an important part of the tax system.  These measures are in strict terms tax expenditures, although I did not include them in my calculation of discretionary tax expenditures, which were mentioned earlier.  While these measures serve important objectives in terms of work incentivisation and income support for many earners, particularly those on lower income, they have less relevance to those on the highest incomes in our society.  Revenue data from 2016 showed that approximately 85,000 earners with incomes above &euro;100,000 per annum are less than 3% of all earners in the State.  Phasing out the personal tax credits from these earners would have almost no disincentive effect and would generate approximately &euro;70 million per annum in additional income taxation.</p><p> A third area is the reform of tax reliefs associated with pension savings.  The largest area of personal tax expenditure relates to pensions.  Overall, pension reliefs amount to &euro;2.7 billion per annum in revenue forgone.  Reform to this area sits in the context of other proposed reforms to pension savings supports, including the introduction of auto-enrolment, which may carry significant additional costs in State subsidies and tax expenditure.  Within the area of pension savings, three tax expenditure measures are worth reforming.  The first of those is limiting all pension contributions to tax relief at a single rate of income taxation.  Currently, this is offered at the marginal rate.  This means that the State supports the savings of higher income earners more than those on lower incomes.  Depending on whether the adjustment was to a standard rate for all or to a hybrid rate, say 31%, the annual savings would be between &euro;200 million and &euro;400 million per annum.</p><p> A second aspect in the context of pensions relates to restricting the tax-free lump-sum payments to an equivalent to two thirds of average earnings.  At present, the first &euro;200,000 of pension savings, or up to 25% of the total, can be drawn down tax free.  This is an abnormally high level in international contexts.  Many countries do not facilitate any tax-free drawdown.  The benefit is much greater to those with the highest incomes and the largest pensions savings.  While there is a case to abolish the tax-free lump sum in its entirety, the provision of a smaller tax-free lump sum to all retiring workers has some merits.  A value set at two thirds of average earnings would correspond to approximately &euro;30,000.  The Revenue Commissioners have not provided a costing of this tax expenditure since 2014.  It then cost &euro;134 million.</p><p> The third aspect regarding pensions relates to reducing the standard fund threshold, SFT, to &euro;1 million.  The SFT is a limit or ceiling on the total capital value of pension benefits that an individual can draw from tax-relieved pension arrangements.  It is currently set at &euro;2 million and has been since 2014.  It was &euro;5 million when it was introduced in 2005.  It reached a peak of &euro;5.4 million in 2010.  Prior to 2005, there were no tax-supported pension savings limits.  In effect, the threshold represents the point at which the State will step aside from using tax reliefs to support pension savings.  Judged from that perspective, it is difficult to justify why the State should continue to subsidise savings beyond a threshold of, say, &euro;1 million.  It is not that individuals should be impeded from saving resources at more than this level.  Rather, it is that the State has done its job in supporting savings, when they reach this point. There are better uses for the State&rsquo;s resources beyond that.</p><p>The fourth area of tax expenditure I wanted to bring to the attention of the committee is to abolish the special assignee relief programme, SARP.  It provides a tax break to high earners, those working for international companies who relocate to Ireland and have earnings of more than &euro;75,000 per annum.  According to Revenue data, individuals earning above &euro;75,000 are in the top 6% of earners in the State.  The scheme provides for full income tax relief on 30% of income over the &euro;75,000 threshold subject to an upper limit of &euro;1 million per annum.  The scheme also allows tax-free employer-provided benefit-in-kind of &euro;5,000 per child per annum in school fees and one trip home per year for the individual and his or her family.  In 2018, the scheme cost &euro;42.4 million and was availed of by 1,481 individuals at an average benefit of &euro;28,629.  Based on the Revenue Commissioners' numbers this suggests the average recipient has an income of &euro;313,000.  That would put them in the top 0.5% of the earnings distribution.  While there are economic benefits to schemes such as this, one could make similar arguments for many other jobs and roles, do earners at this level of income need a tax reduction?  On the grounds of fairness, the scheme is hard to justify.  Simply, there are better uses for these resources.  </p><p> The fifth area is on standard rating of other tax reliefs.  There is a general point of principle where government supports are provided through the taxation system, they should be worth the same to all income tax payers irrespective of whether they are fortunate enough to have a high income.  As well as the aforementioned tax relief on pension contributions, a number of other tax expenditures are granted at the marginal rate, that is, that they are worth 40% to some and 20% to others.  A recent reply to a parliamentary question identified that making this reform for those tax expenditures costing more than &euro;5 million per annum would yield &euro;147.7 million in additional taxation revenue each year.  Again, on the grounds of fairness, such a reform seems appropriate.  </p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage this morning.  I strongly encourage it to adopt a recurring and systematic approach to the oversight of these budgetary choices.  Tax expenditures are a hidden but important part of the decisions we make on the allocation of state resources.</p></speech>

We thank the committee for the invitation to appear on foot of a report published through the ESRI tax, welfare and pensions research programme, which examined options for raising tax revenue, including by restricting tax expenditures.  The reviews expressed in the report and by ourselves today are our own and should not be taken to represent those of the commission on taxation and welfare to which I was recently appointed.</p> <p>  As set out in our report, we believe there will be a need for tax increases in coming years to pay for planned and promised spending increases, for example, to implement Sl&aacute;intecare and to maintain existing levels of public services in the face of an ageing population.  Such increases are unrelated to ongoing Covid-19 spending and go above and beyond the additional level of borrowing that our ESRI colleague, Dr. Kieran McQuinn, has shown could be sustainably financed given the current low level of interest rates.  This need for future tax increases is made more pressing by structural deficiencies in the existing revenue base, including a potential over-reliance on volatile and highly-concentrated corporation tax receipts and an inevitable decline in motor tax revenues as part of our planned transition to electric vehicles.  Our report provides a range of options that a future government seeking to raise or replace tax revenues might consider.  In doing so, it does not seek to advocate any particular tax raising measure as ultimately those are political decisions that depend on distributional goals, value judgements and wider priorities; rather it seeks to provide evidence for those in the Houses of the Oireachtas who have responsibility for making those decisions.  </p> <p>  We argue in the report that the most straightforward way of raising substantial tax revenues is through increases to the main rates of income tax, the universal social charge, USC, PRSI, VAT and the local property tax.  Even small increases to any of these broad-based taxes could generate considerable revenue precisely because they affect almost all households.  Such tax rises can be designed to meet a range of distributional objectives with, for example, increases to higher rates of income tax and the USC at the most progressive and increases to VAT the least progressive options.</p><p>The report also considers measures more targeted at the better off, as well as options for raising revenue by restricting tax expenditures, a topic to which I now turn.</p><p> While many tax expenditures are well targeted at achieving clear and coherent policy objectives, we draw attention, in our report, to around a dozen which are less well targeted or have a questionable underlying economic rationale.  Three reliefs we highlight that are particularly poorly targeted are as follows.  First, business and agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax, CAT, cost &euro;360 million in 2019, an average of almost &euro;175,000 per claim.  While intended to support the growth of, and succession within, small family farms and businesses, the relief, as currently structured, primarily benefits those inheriting substantial rather than small family farms and businesses.  Second, a reduced 10% rate of capital gains tax, CGT, on certain assets called entrepreneur relief, which cost &euro;92.4 million in 2018, an average cost per claim of more than &euro;100,000.  Such blanket reduced rates of tax are poorly targeted at encouraging start-ups, with evidence on a similar UK scheme suggesting the relief is more likely to generate efforts to avoid tax on retirement than to spur entrepreneurship or investment.  Third, allowing those retiring to draw down &euro;200,000 from their pension as a tax-free lump sum, which cost &euro;134 million in 2014, the latest year for which data are available.  In addition, people can draw down an additional &euro;300,00 at the basic rate of tax of 20%.  That primarily benefits those with substantial pension wealth, especially in the form of defined benefit pensions, and encourages the withdrawal of large lump sums on retirement, something that is hard to reconcile with the Government's goal of encouraging individuals to ensure a regular stream of income in retirement.</p><p> The most recent information available on the cost of the tax-free pension lump sum dates from 2014 raises a broader issue about the availability and transparency of information on tax expenditures.  It is something that both the committee and the Parliamentary Budget Office have highlighted previously.  While there have been some welcome steps towards the greater availability of information in recent years, there is still room for substantial improvement.  This is especially true in terms of CGT and pension reliefs, where many previously available costings are no longer provided by either Revenue or the Department of Finance.</p><p> There is also room for improvement in the way in which we review and evaluate tax expenditures more generally.  Evaluations are routinely based almost exclusively on responses to surveys of beneficiaries gathered through a non-representative public consultation process, a methodology which cannot deliver rigorous or credible evidence on their impact.  One way in which that could be addressed is the development of expertise within the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, perhaps through the establishment of a dedicated tax expenditure evaluation unit.  Another is by ensuring that reviews of tax expenditures are published in advance of, instead of on, budget day to allow for sufficient scrutiny, perhaps alongside the Department of Finance tax strategy group papers, which, in a welcome move, are published before the budget in the autumn.</p><p> As we conclude in our report, the likely need for significant tax increases in the years ahead provides an opportunity to reassess how effective various parts of the tax system, including tax expenditures, are at achieving their objectives.  Doing so could result in a tax system that not only raises the revenue necessary to fund desired levels of public spending in the years ahead, but one that is better designed to meet the challenges of the coming decades.</p><p> I thank the committee members for inviting us to appear before them and I look forward to answering any questions that they may have.</p></speech>

I will open the floor to members now.  I am first on the list of contributors, so I will begin.</p> <p>  I will address Dr. Roantree and Dr. Kakoulidou first.  I will start with the news of the day in respect of the announcement that Irish growth is forecast to be 11% for the year, despite the unemployment rate remaining at 16%.  We know that Ireland had the fastest-growing economy in 2020.  It was one of the few growing economies in the world.  That was with the Covid-19-adjusted unemployment rate of approximately 25% and the longest lockdown in Europe.   We know that changes to international corporation tax arrangements could negatively impact our corporation tax baseline to the tune of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion annually.  I note, from the witnesses' opening statement, that there is a potential over-reliance on volatile and highly concentrated corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>  I also note that details of a scenario analysis are provided in table A.1 of the Quarterly Economic Commentary.  This analysis details growth rates for Irish exports in 2021, and makes a comparison with a non-pandemic baseline.  I found that really interesting.  In the absence of a pandemic, export growth would be 6.9%, whereas it is currently forecast to be 13.3%.  Do the witnesses consider that very strong growth rate as indicating that we are in a corporation tax bubble?  I am interested in the over-reliance and the volatility in that.</p><p>In its report, the ESRI says that this is linked to the pharmaceutical and IT sectors.  Can Dr. Roantree say how many companies are driving this growth?  I would be very interested to know what kind of relationship that has with the real economy.  I would love to hear his views in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barra Roantree" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#F00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  The ESRI report published this morning was authored by my colleagues, led by Professor Kieran McQuinn and Dr. Conor O'Toole.  It highlights the incredible performance of exports over recent months.  That is what kept growth so strong over recent months as measured by GDP, although we all know of the problems and issues with that.  That growth looks like it is set to continue.  That is what is driving the very high growth figures in the report.</p> <p>  With regard to over-reliance on corporation tax, this is something we highlight in the report.  The most striking illustration of this is the fact that just ten companies were responsible for over 50% of those receipts in the latest year for which we have data, 2019.  Many of those firms make a vast contribution to the real economy as well as to the Exchequer coffers.  We do not know exactly which companies these are.  We may be able to guess.  I direct the committee towards the work of Seamus Coffey in that regard.  He put some interesting information together and has identified which firms he believes some of those big players are.  I direct the committee towards that work in respect of the specific companies involved.  Many of these companies are also linked to the real economy.  This does not get us away from the fact that, by virtue of so much money coming from so few companies, we are left in a position whereby something outside of our control may happen due to the actions of, for example, the US Government which could significantly affect the amount of revenue collected.  That is a real cause for concern and is something we highlight in the report.  It is something we should seek to address in the coming years.</p> <p>  I will highlight an additional revenue vulnerability which does not get as much attention.  I mentioned it in the opening statement.  We currently raise approximately &euro;3.5 billion a year from taxes on motor fuels.  That is linked directly to the burning of fossil fuels.  We know the plan is for us to transition towards electric vehicles.  The official Government strategy is not to burn the fuel which gives rise to the excise duties and other taxes that are responsible for this revenue.  There is therefore a real need to look at how to move away from those revenues and at how to replace them.  It is quite a substantial amount of revenue to replace before we even get on to the question of the likely increased demand for public services in the coming decades, which Dr. Collins highlighted in his statement, and how to pay for them.  There is a real challenge before us in the years ahead.  It is not just because of a potential over-reliance on corporation tax but that is an important factor.</p></speech>

Personally, I have an interest in tax gap analysis.  There is much value in carrying out such analysis on different tax heads.  In a nutshell, the tax gap measures the difference between what is collected, the effective rate and what would be collected if everything that was owed was paid, the nominal rate.  Examples of such gaps arise from the likes of aggressive tax planning, tax arbitrage, tax fraud and tax evasion.  The revenue loss can also be caused by negligent omissions in insolvencies.  Tax gaps are handy for legislators who are not necessarily tax experts to look at with a view to identifying where these revenue losses occur.  What is Dr. Roantree's view on incorporating such analysis into the budgetary cycle?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barra Roantree" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#F00400"><p>It would be welcome.  That type of analysis is carried out in other countries.  It provides very useful information for legislators, as the Deputy has set out.  It can be conceptually difficulty.  The whole area of tax expenditures is fraught because it is both conceptually and empirically difficult to work out how much many of these things are costing.  The reason for this is often that these are measured relative to a benchmark and it is not always clear what the benchmark should be.  An example that comes up frequently is in the area of the taxation of pensions.  What should be considered the benchmark in that regard?  There is no right answer to that question.  There are a number of possible answers, some of which are more credible than others.  Ultimately, setting out what should be considered a tax relief in the context of pensions depends on how you think about the benchmark system and what you consider a neutral system to compare it to.</p><p>It would be welcome to see more work on tax gaps.  It is something that could form part of the work of a new tax expenditure unit, or would be related to, if one were to be established.  As the committee well knows, having studied the issues through multiple reports, it is in many cases a thorny issue to identify how much a tax expenditure costs and getting the estimate can be difficult.  That does not mean we should not try or have a good, credible process for trying to get that estimate.</p></speech>

He mentioned the hidden role of the State and using the taxation system to encourage and support certain activities among individuals and corporations via tax expenditures, an issue I am interested in.  Anybody who has studied economics will have heard of the invisible hand of the market, but it is often mentioned to the exclusion of the hidden hand of the State.  The State, through the taxation system, can be used to modify taxpayer behaviour, while corporate taxation can be used to modify corporate behaviour.  I am interested in the investor court system that is part of CETA.  In the opinion of many people, those kinds of courts can have a chilling effect on legislatures.  What are Dr. Collins's views on the imposition of such a court system?  Will it negatively impact on the State's ability to use the taxation system to modify corporate behaviour?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#G00300"><p>I might begin by picking up on one small matter related to the questions the Deputy had for Dr. Roantree.  The ESRI's report today is interesting and we will see a bounceback, but we should remember and expect that the bounceback to the economy will be quite uneven among sectors of the economy and regionally, which throws up a number of significant issues.  Points that both Dr. Roantree and I have raised suggest there will be added pressure and need for the State to engage in further expenditure in the decades to come, and there are issues and challenges regarding how we will raise the revenue to pay for that.</p> <p>  Regarding that, the examination of the difference between what the State expects to receive in taxation and what actually arises is worth pursuing.  Tax gap investigations are challenging and difficult to conduct, but we should watch them.  It would be interesting for committees such as this to explore those issues and put them on their agenda in the years to come as budget policy is examined.  We spend much time thinking about budgets and budgetary policy decisions before they happen and then do not examine them enough after they have occurred and been implemented.  There is an important role, in the context of oversight for budgetary decisions, to begin to think about that.  I am familiar with some work done on tax gaps relating to VAT that suggests there are leakages there.  Some interesting comparative analyses have been carried out, through EUROSTAT and others, on that as well.</p> <p>  It aligns with the issues we are examining in respect of tax expenditure as well.  In a sense, as I put it earlier reasonably simply to try to make it accessible to as many people as possible, for every &euro;5 the State collects in tax and social insurance, there is a further &euro;1 it does not collect because it decides not to do so through the provision of various tax reliefs and measures.  They are entirely legitimate and we have made decisions for the system to be structured in that way.  Some of that relates to legitimate decisions that are worthwhile for the State, while for others there are questions that should be raised and examined from time to time, which is why it is so important that committees such as this one ask these questions from time to time.  It is part of that hidden role of the State.  The State has a significant impact, through its taxation decisions, on the resources it needs to collect.</p><p>If it decides not to collect a certain amount of money and resources there is a kick or knock-on effect for either raising that money elsewhere or cutting back on the provision of public services, which is the alternative to that.  I have to honestly say to the Deputy that I am not an expert in the world of the detail of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, so I will avoid that question, please, purely on that basis.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of questions.  What worries me most, as I have often said before, is that when economists start talking about the things that can happen with relative ease, I begin to get worried because that has not been the experience in the past.  My first question is what do our guest witnesses consider as higher earners and people who might be suitable for the phasing out of tax credits, for example, and at what level of income do they meet the criteria of higher earners?  Is it &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000 or is it &euro;200,000?  What is it?  Can any of our guests answer that question, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#H00400"><p>I am happy to come in on that question given that I would have mentioned the term once or twice.  It is not an unfair question and one can look at it from the perspective of asking people who are low earners or high earners and it is always very hard to define those thresholds.  The high earner restriction, which is the structure that the State has in place to ensure that taxpayers pay a minimum rate of income tax, kicks in from an income of &euro;125,000 a year.  Our legislation and the structures that the Revenue Commissioners implement define high earners as incomes of &euro;125,000 and above.  When one puts that against the figures that the Revenue Commissioners show for all of the earners in the State, about 6% of these earners are above &euro;125,000.  It is, therefore, quite a small group of people.</p></speech>

A single individual on an income for of &euro;125,000 a year would pay somewhere from 38% to 40% of their income in taxation and social insurance, assuming that they did not avail of any potential tax reliefs through savings and pensions, or something like that.</p></speech>

We would pay an amount greater than that.  I would admit myself to not having any special pension arrangements or anything like that but approximately 50% of the income is gone by one means or another.</p> <p>  My next question is on pensions.  Dr. Collins is proposing as if it was a simple thing, to change, for instance, the entitlement to pensions and to defined pension funds.  Has Dr. Collins looked at the degree to which that kind of policy can be successful given that people were led to believe during the course of their working lives that they will have an entitlement to &ldquo;X&rdquo; &ldquo;Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;Z&rdquo; at the end of these lives?  When one interferes with that, has Dr. Coillins looked at the legalities and constitutionality of those proposals?</p></speech>

Many workers are of the view that when they retire, their pensions will initially pay out a tax-free lump sum and that they will subsequently receive a pension payment.  The first point I would make is, internationally, that is an unusual system.  The second comment I would make is that at one point I was of the view that should not be in place and that we should ensure individuals had sufficient resources in their pensions to be able to support themselves and their families for the rest of their lives.  I was convinced by one of my fellow members on the previous Commission on Taxation that it was a good idea-----</p></speech>

There is some merit in individuals receiving some lump-sum payment that is tax free on retirement.  The proposal I suggested is it would be of the order of &euro;30,000.  Unfortunately, we do not have enough information from the Revenue Commissioners and others to give us an insight into how big lump sums are.  They are very big for some individuals but tend to be quite small for the vast majority of individuals.  We can see that from the structure of retirement.  It would be good to have that information.  Some limits should be on such payments.  That is the logic of the point I was making.  It would not take resources away from individuals, the resources would remain in the individuals' pension savings accounts and they would draw them down and pay income tax, as appropriate, on them over the remainder of their years.  It is not about taking anything away from people but about making the system fairer and limiting the exposure of the State to some of the costs.</p></speech>

To what degree has Dr. Collins consulted representatives of pension funds and their contributors to ascertain what the reaction might be?  Two reactions come to mind.  The first is a political reaction and the second is that if you want to stir up a serious reaction towards any proposal, attack the pensioners.  That is where you would get the biggest reaction.  To what extent has Dr. Collins already investigated that matter?</p></speech>

I am involved with some colleagues as part of a pension policy research group.  We engage with others in the pensions space.  For the most part, the suggestions are not about taking resources away from current pensioners but are about reforming the system into the future and, therefore, limiting the cost to the State of it.  There is a recognition, which I would share, that the current structure of pensions, in many cases, is not working.  The experiences the Deputy and his colleagues encounter from time to time are not surprising in terms of the difficult circumstances in which individuals find themselves because of the risks their pension funds have taken.  This throws up questions as to whether we should have a private pension system or whether we should only have a much more enhanced State pension.  I am of the view we should not have any private pension system and should have purely a proper and more generous universal State pension.  Perhaps, however, that is a discussion for another day and for another committee.</p></speech>

In 25, 30 or 40 years, when it comes to him having access to a pension, to which he has contributed in good faith, which we have to do through the public pension fund, I would like to think that he would get the benefits of it.  I would find it difficult to be able to sell to people that, in the future, they are not going to have a pension like there used to be and that they are going to have to take a lesser slice of the action.  How is that going to be compensated for?  I am using Deputy Boyd Barrett as a guinea pig in this scene but somebody has to be a guinea pig, and we had better take a young fellow.  How do we sell this to that age cohort?  We are selling to them the idea that they are going to have to take a lot of risk, with spouses, kids, huge mortgages and so on, and, at the end of the day, they cannot look forward to the fruits of their labours turning up in a lump sum payment because we are going to take that away beforehand.  How are we going to compensate for that?</p></speech>

I am part of a team at the ESRI that has done some research on a few issues related to that.  One aspect is the adequacy of income in retirement.  An issue we have highlighted is that while, on average, pensioners do very well relative to the rest of the population and their rate of poverty is less than the general population, in particular children, that is very sensitive to the rate of the State pension.  The key determinant is the level of the State pension to the extent that if we keep hold of earnings growth in the economy, rates of poverty among pensioners are not going to increase, but to the extent that it falls behind, they will.</p> <p>  One particular area that we point to is the issue with pensioners living alone, who maybe do not get as much attention as they should.  They are the group of pensioners that are more likely to have inadequate income in retirement and to fall below the poverty line, however it is measured.  We point to ways of ensuring those people have adequate income in retirement, for example, ensuring the living alone allowance is increased as it can be very well targeted towards the group of pensioners that are at risk of poverty.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a good point on the importance of stability in the pension system.  These are decisions people are taking over a long period of time and it is important there is a clear system and that that system is not changing every few years because, otherwise, it gets very hard to save and to encourage people to save.  The Deputy raises an important point about certainty.  However, as we both set out in our opening statements, there are some aspects of the pensions and taxation system that are not particularly coherent, sensible or fair, however we look at it.  To me, the one that stands out from that point of view is the tax-free lump sum, which primarily benefits very high earners.  To get a &euro;200,000 tax-free lump sum, people have to have a very generous defined benefit pension and have to have been on a high level of earnings throughout.  I would not be be particularly worried about anyone who might be affected by reducing that from &euro;200,000 to, for example, &euro;100,000 being at risk of having inadequate income in retirement.  These are people near the very top of the income distribution, both in retirement and through their working lives.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the importance of having stability in the pensions and tax system and, from that point of view, the Commission on Pensions is very welcome and, hopefully, will set out a roadmap there will be consensus around and that maybe we can move towards.  To follow up on the last part of the Deputy's question, we can do this in a way which ensures there is the prospect of a pension for those of us who might be retiring somewhat later than is the case now, in the later decades of the 21st century.  We have a pay-as-you-go pension system.  It is not pre-funded and it comes out of the State Exchequer.  There is a real issue in regard to intergenerational inequality and this is something I have published research on at the ESRI.  We are already in a position where many young adults are experiencing lower wage growth than their parents would have, and there is a real issue, particularly when this is combined with the issue of housing, about ensuring there is intergenerational fairness, as well as fairness across other dimensions.  The issue the Deputy raises about ensuring a sustainable pension system is important in terms of addressing those intergenerational inequalities as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#L00100"><p>I thank the witnesses from the ESRI and Dr. Collins.  I warmly welcome and support pretty much everything they said.  I have long advocated for some of the things for which the witnesses are advocating.  Tax expenditures are a shadow budget.  They constitute a pretty vast realm of public money that is being spent every year and is not scrutinised in any serious way.  For much of the time, we do not know what we are getting for it and whether it is beneficial spending.  Deputy Durkan is right to be concerned about pensioners.  A total of &euro;2.7 billion is going on pension tax reliefs.  Is it better that we have this hidden subsidy for pensioners, which I argue and I think our contributors have argued overwhelmingly benefits some of the wealthiest earners and pensioners, or would it better to stop those reliefs and double the State pension?  That is putting it in a slightly extreme form but I broadly favour that.  If we double the State pension, we would do a lot more to address pensioner poverty and would also have a much clearer view of the money that is being spent on pensioners and who it is benefiting.  It would overwhelmingly benefit the vast majority of pensioners as opposed to a tax relief system of subsidising pensions that tends to benefit the highest earners and the best-off pensioners.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the witnesses but this is implicit in what they have said.  This is the debate.  I do not know who said at a previous meeting of this committee that dealt with this issue that, broadly speaking, direct expenditures as against tax relief-type expenditure tend to be more effective in delivering results in terms of providing particular services or for particular needs in society.</p> <p>  I have a particular interest in film tax relief, which amounts to &euro;70 million to &euro;80 million in tax relief.  Do any of the witnesses have an opinion on this?  This is an odd tax relief because they get cash upfront.  Most of the people who get this corporate tax relief have never made a profit.  In fact, the way it is designed means that it is in the interests of the producers who get it to never make a profit.  It is a fascinating area.  I am also very curious.  We are told that the beneficiaries of the corporate tax credit are getting between &euro;10 million and &euro;30 million.  I do not understand how we cannot know whether they are getting &euro;10 million or &euro;30 million.  It is pretty bizarre.  What is it achieving for us?  A tax relief of this sort is about trying to build up a film industry on scale and create good employment.  In fact, the film tax relief is specifically linked in the legislation to creating quality employment and training but there is no checking of whether this is being delivered.  Almost nobody has a job in the film industry.  A tiny number of people - possibly 100 - have jobs.</p><p>They are like the dockers back at the beginning of the 19th century in that they are turning up and hoping they might be employed on a particular project.  It is a 19th-century Dickensian situation, yet we are paying out &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million in this context.  I would like to hear what our contributors have to say regarding this issue.  My perspective is we should be studying this situation and asking if that money would be better used by being paid out to create a film industry via direct expenditure instead of by means of a tax relief afforded to a group of film producers.  We should evaluate that possibility.</p><p> I welcome the suggestion that the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, create a tax expenditure section to evaluate this aspect.  That service has done some good work in evaluating the relative merits of money being paid out through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, programmes compared with money going directly into investment in public housing.  The conclusions in that regard speak for themselves.  IGEES evaluated that expenditure and concluded that it would be far better for us to build our own public housing than to continue with these expenditures.  I have long thought we should have an evaluation of what I see as a shadow budget and proper scrutiny of that spending.  I agree strongly with the recommendations in that regard.</p><p> I would like our contributors to comment on another point.  They have not focused a great deal in their submission on corporation tax expenditures.  To what extent are those expenditures included in the figure of &euro;15 billion concerning tax expenditures?  The witnesses are separating out structural expenditures, as they call them, or part of the base, from discretionary expenditures.  How do corporation tax expenditures fit into that context?  In broad terms, pre-tax, the gross profits of corporations are running at about &euro;180 billion.  Those profits have doubled over the past ten years, but only &euro;90 billion of them, roughly half the total figure, is subject to tax.  The taxable profits of corporations are halved by tax reliefs.</p><p> How much money, then, is going abegging in that regard?  The effective rate of corporation tax works out at 5% rather than 12.5% if we base this calculation on gross pre-tax profits.  If the minimum effective corporation tax rate were 12.5% instead, then &euro;7 billion to &euro;9 billion more in tax could be collected.  I am interested in hearing witnesses' thoughts on that area.  The implication being suggested regarding income tax seems to be there should be a minimum effective income tax rate because the system we have is not capturing some of the reliefs benefiting higher earners.  Do the witnesses hold the same view regarding corporation tax and a similar need for a minimum effective corporation tax rate?</p></speech>

I will come in briefly.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Yes, the phrase &ldquo;shadow budget&rdquo; is a good one and it is worth thinking about these issues in that context.  These decisions that are announced concern tax we deem we should not collect.  It is not as easy to see and identify those potential tax revenues because they are not coming in, but it is revenue the State could potentially collect.  It fits well within the context of the remit of a Committee on Budgetary Oversight like this one.  Therefore, I reiterate how welcome and important it is the committee has retained a focus on this issue.  It is very useful.</p> <p>  The questions being asked by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Durkan and others raise the expectation the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and others will provide the information that can make discussions in this regard considerably more informed than they have been previously.  At least with income taxes, it is necessary to have such taxes available and paid to offset some of the reliefs in place.  In and of themselves, therefore, they are skewed up the income distribution and availed of by individuals who are relatively higher earners in society.</p> <p>  The point made by the Deputy regarding direct expenditure is important.  The reality is if we were spending the same amount of resources in the form of direct expenditure, such expenditure would get considerably greater oversight from this committee.</p><p>I do not mean to underplay the excellent work the committee is doing but it would simply be more visible in the budgetary documentation and the public expenditure plans from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and elsewhere.  It is the visibility of these measures that makes it very difficult for them to be thoroughly understood and for the very difficult questions around them to be asked and answered.  Therefore, the more information on them, the better.  The film relief is a good example of that.  A number of people would be very strongly in favour of the film relief and others would argue the other side.  It would be good to have the information available on how the resources are being used, to whom they are flowing and the alternative use of those same resources because ultimately the State is expending here.  It could expend directly by spending the money in a particular Department, and the committee could hear from representatives of the Department in question on that, or it could do it through the tax system by deciding not to collect particular resources.  That throws up opportunity cost questions about what else could happen and how else those resources could be used.  The more information we have on that, the better.</p><p> On the corporate tax issue, there is an interesting contrast whereby we have a minimum effective tax rate for high earners but have resisted that for a long time for corporates, although that is now changing quite dramatically.  Looking at the structure of tax expenditure, the area that is hardest to understand and where it is hardest to know what is going on is capital allowances.  These are the allowances that companies, be they enormous or small, can use to offset assets and write down their tax bills.  I have no doubt that within that there is a mixture of legitimate activity and activity about which we could ask questions.  In the tax expenditure world, that is a very big black hole and it is deserving of attention. </p></speech>

One of the issues with this is that many corporations, particularly foreign multinationals, are very mobile and responsive to tax treatment so that creates a risk.  Even in the event that we do not change anything, if the US Government changes something, those companies might change their structure and that might significantly impact on our corporation tax receipts.  I would, therefore, caution about thinking we could or should be getting an extra &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion if we changed the allowances.  It is likely that a lot of the profit to which the allowances relate is highly mobile.  I am not sure we should necessarily be looking at that and saying we could be raising additional money from corporation taxes because we are already over-reliant on them, especially relative to other countries.  That is one note of caution I would apply to some of those discussions.</p> <p>  As regards pensions tax, we are on the same page as Dr. Collins about the tax-free lump sum being a very poorly targeted form of tax relief.  We have gone into detail and talked about that so I think we are on the same page.  However, we differ quite a bit on the overall system of tax relief.  I have argued previously, and quite strongly, in favour of a system broadly along the lines of what we have, whereby people defer the tax they pay at the moment.  They make pension contributions in their pre-tax income and then pay tax when it is drawn down.  That is a broadly sensible system.  In the literature it is called an exempt-exempt-taxable, or EET, system.  That has a lot to recommend it.  If operated properly, it should be neutral between consuming today and consuming into the future.  From that point of view, economists would say it has a lot to recommend it and it is a coherent benchmark system to have in place.</p> <p>  Our system involves a number of departures from that and that is where we could find more common ground.  People never end up paying PRSI on income that is saved in the form of a pension.  If they have a pension accumulating, because they do not pay PRSI after they retire, PRSI is never charged on a pension.  That is a gap in the system.  One issue I would raise is the often proposed idea of restricting relief to a standard or blended rate on pension contributions.</p><p>An issue with that is how to treat defined benefit pensions.  People do not pay into a pension pot from a defined benefit pension.  The pension is stored up and the person will get income from it in future.  We know these are the most generous type of pensions in operation today and they are primarily public sector in nature.  There is an issue there from the point of view of possibly moving to a blended relief-type structure or restricting relief to the basic rate.  In essence, that would be imposing greater tax on those with mostly defined contribution private sector pensions, whereas those in receipt of public sector pensions will still avail of that geometry.  It is very hard to price what the contribution to a defined benefit pension is if relief is not going to be applied at the marginal rate, which is essentially what we are doing at the moment.</p><p> I have raised a number of issues.  I will be happy to send the committee some materials.  We made a submission to the interdepartmental group on the taxation of pensions which sets out some of these points.  There are a number of tricky issues but there is considerable common ground as regards the tax-free lump sum being far too generous at the moment.</p></speech>

I will make a number of comments on which I ask for responses.  We are in the throes of passing the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill.  One of my concerns relates to the budget for climate action.  How will we replace the &euro;3.5 billion we raise every year in fuel taxes?  I think motor tax brings in approximately &euro;1 billion per annum, giving a total of &euro;4.5 billion.  If we give incentives to people to switch from fossil fuel to electric vehicles, how will we bridge the gap?</p><p>Succession rights and capital gains tax were also raised.  These issues are very pertinent to farming, especially family farms.  The idea that a son or daughter inheriting the family farm is inheriting an asset that will generate huge income is long gone.  Given the income from farming, the son or daughter may be taking on a liability rather than an asset at times.  We can see the number of young people getting involved in farming is reducing year on year, not just in Ireland but across the European Union.  For this reason, I have serious concerns about capital gains changes for farming and small business in rural towns and villages where people are passing down a business they are making a living from, and nothing more.  They are not storing up a large amount of savings.</p><p>It is interesting to note the comment by one of the speakers that increasing the amount of corporation tax does not necessarily mean you will get, <i>pro rata, </i>the same return from that.  By increasing tax, you may end up with less money because the money is not available to be taxed because it is in some other haven where it will not be taxed.  That is important.</p><p>Returning to what Deputy Durkan said about pensions, people entering a private pension scheme have an expectation about what will happen over the life of their pension, what they will be able to do with it and what benefits they will be able to draw from it.  When changes are subsequently made to the tax treatment of a scheme, it breaches the expectations of the pension holder who may have entered the private pension scheme in his or her 30s.  The idea of deferred tax is good but when people are trying to create a retirement fund with which to support their families, we should not introduce draconian measures halfway or three quarters of the way through.  We cannot have a person finding out that the rules of engagement have changed within six months of his or her retirement.  People may act differently if they know what the rules will be at the end.</p><p>After all the contributions that have been made, I am concerned by the fact we are talking about the latest information we have when some of it goes back to 2014, 2015 or 2016.  We are effectively giving out more than &euro;15 billion in tax expenditure and we should have an annual report on it.  We must get to the stage where each year, as part of the budget process, we see the returns or costs for tax expenditure and in which section these occurred.  If there is a review every ten years, there can be many changes and such changes happen in our modern world over ten years.  Going back to 2014, which is seven years ago, it was a different economy and a different world.  Are we getting in more money or what were the costs last year compared with 2014?  It is a major concern I have in reporting.  It is a budgetary oversight committee and the key is that in the year following the financial year, there should be a report on the tax expenditure and the costs to the State.  We must get to that stage.  It may not happen overnight but we must be able to do that, especially when we see the major figures for costs.  Perhaps much of this tax expenditure is investment in our future or succession rights for businesses, for example.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy on the importance of stability for the pensions tax system and that people make these decisions with the long run in mind.  It is important we do not chop and change the system every year or two.  That is incredibly important.  However, it cannot be an argument that we never change the system, particularly given there are so many issues with it currently.  I agree that we should not go about doing this every year but we should try to set out a long-term vision for the pension system and move towards it.  We should have a set of reforms so nobody will be surprised on getting to retirement because he or she sees something different.  I agree with those kinds of statements.</p> <p>  On the question of motor tax, which I raised and to which the Deputy responded, I might defer in a moment to my colleague, Dr. Kakoulidou, on some of the environmental tax reliefs in place.  Looking at them might raise some revenue for offset.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point on family farms.  We tried to be quite clear and concise in how we worded our comments on this because we know it is an incredibly emotive and important matter in so many areas of the country.  I suppose this is not about small family farms or businesses being inherited.  With capital acquisitions tax, the way this business and agricultural relief operates is that the value of the asset for the purposes of inheritance is written down by 90%.  There is no cap on that.  Combined with the &euro;325,000 threshold for class A transfers - a person inheriting a family farm business from a father or mother - it is possible for multimillion euro businesses not to pay any capital acquisitions tax.  Our point is merely that if the intention is explicit when the reviews are made to support succession within small family farms and businesses, it is not well targeted at doing that.  It is all we are saying.</p> <p>  We can see there is a very clear and coherent policy rationale to encourage that succession but the point is that most of the benefit of this very expensive tax relief, at &euro;360 million per year in 2019, as we have up-to-date information on that, is not going to small family farms and business.  It is instead going to very large businesses.  That is what we are drawing attention to rather than the validity of succession in general.  I agree with the Deputy that it is incredibly important for so many areas of the country, such as my own in west Wicklow, where I grew up.  I needed to clarify that as we do not want the wrong perception to come across from the matter being raised.</p> <p>  Dr. Kakoulidou might speak to the environmental tax reliefs.</p></speech>

The problem with this is the biggest part of that revenue is mainly from jet kerosene and it is part of the EU directive that they should be exempt from a tax bill.  As far as we know, for the time being there is a discussion in the EU to re-evaluate this directive and start taxing this type of fuel.  This could be a source of revenue, but only in the short term.  If the environmental goals are fulfilled, all revenue from these tax expenditures will be reduced.  The main point our report made is that to assign a new source of revenue for the motor tax yields that would be diminished for the year, the Government should see a broad-based statutory measure.  It will be very difficult to raise significant extra sums of revenue without increasing one of the four main taxes: income tax rates; the universal social charge; pay related social insurance, PRSI; or value added tax, VAT.  It will be very difficult to find another source of revenue that will give the same amount of revenue.</p></speech>

I have been learning a great deal from listening to the earlier discussion.  I am glad the points on inheritance tax and the concept of the upper limit have been clarified.  Is there a view on the lower threshold available there?  House prices have increased a good bit since those thresholds for the A,B and C bands were set a number of years ago.  I am interested to know if there is a view on that.</p> <p>  On pensions, the witnesses touched on a bugbear of mine, which is the single pensioner.  It is possible this person would have been part of a couple, but unfortunately when he or she is then a single person and down to one income, many of the same overheads are there.  How could that be addressed?  There is a particular vulnerability there for the single pensioner.</p></speech>

It is a very important issue and recent ESRI research has been pointing towards the issue.  On average, pensioners have lower rates of poverty than other ages groups but there is an issue with those who live alone and who are the single pensioners.  We published a report a few months ago that showed that, at the turn of the millennium, almost one in two pensioners were in poverty and it was only the sustained policy action over the 2000s in increasing the State pension that brought the figure down to where they are the age group with the lowest poverty levels.</p> <p>  With regard to the policies that are well targeted towards the cohort of single pensioners the Deputy is worried about, the living alone allowance is a very effective means of giving income to those people.  The Government has increased the living alone allowance in budgets in recent years.  This was explicitly linked to some of the ESRI research that was done highlighting that.  The instrument on the adequacy of pension levels is, ultimately, a matter for political decision.  There may be a need to look at it.  I believe that the Pensions Commission is looking at the issue of balance between a pensioner who lives on his or her own and a pensioner who is part of a couple.</p> <p>  On the capital acquisitions-----</p></speech>

Would there be a ballpark or a direction the ESRI could see that going in?</p></speech>

Again, the appropriate living standards deemed adequate for different age groups is really a political issue and one I do not believe the ESRI can come in on.  We can say, however, that increasing the living alone allowance will do a lot to reduce poverty among pensioners.</p><p>That is far as we can go without stepping into the normative realm.</p><p> In terms of capital acquisitions tax, inheritance tax, and houses, which the Deputy mentioned, we highlight in our report that the average liability for a group A payer, that is, from a parent to a child, in 2019 was almost &euro;86,000.  This implies that the average group A taxpayer received almost &euro;600,000 worth of inheritance or gifts from his or her parents over his or her lifetime.  The first important point to note is that most people who pay inheritance tax or capital acquisitions tax in Ireland receive a large amount of inheritance.  It is a lot larger than most people know about.  To the extent to which those bands and thresholds are raised, most of that gain goes towards those people who receive a huge amount of inheritance.  From that point of view, it is not a well-targeted measure towards those whom the Deputy might be worried about who are receiving a home in the context of increased house prices.</p><p> People often compare the &euro;325,000 threshold with the average value of a home in Dublin and say it is less than that amount.  This is a per-person threshold.  Inheritance tax in Ireland is broadly well designed.  It is based on the person receiving the gift rather than the estate giving them.  From that point of view, it is an infinitely better system than that which operates in the UK, for example, where it is incredibly easy to avoid inheritance tax.  If a person transfers gifts seven years before he or she dies, no tax is paid.  From that point of view, our system is well designed.  The threshold is on a per-person basis.  Unless a person is a single child inheriting a house, it is unlikely that he or she is will pay capital acquisitions tax on that.  For example, if a family has a house worth &euro;900,000 and they have three children among whom they spilt it equally, none of those children will pay capital acquisitions tax.  The extent of the issue is often overplayed.  I am not sure it is taken into account that when people pass on an estate, it is usually to multiple beneficiaries.  From that point of view, it is overplayed somewhat.</p></speech>

I will ask two consecutive questions first because I am aware of my time.  I am concerned because in the ESRI's budget perspectives paper, reference was made to changes in capital gains taxes for older people.  As Sinn F&eacute;in's spokesperson for older people, I am interested to hear about the practicalities of this proposal.  If the witnesses would outline in layman's terms, or laywoman's terms, for that matter, how this might work, I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  I am interested in our guests' opinion on the provision of basic income, in general and specifically for older people.  In my office, we deal with many people who battle red tape when trying to access a sufficient contributory pension.  They struggle to prove their working record before 1980 due to the scant records that are available.  I am also interested to know how the witnesses think we could pay for a basic income and whether it should apply universally or to just certain sections of society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barra Roantree" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#R00400"><p>I think the issue the Deputy raised was some of the options that are looked at in our report relating to retirement relief, which is a relief from capital gains tax, CGT.  This is a similar relief to capital acquisitions tax - agricultural and business relief are mentioned - in that the intention is to benefit small businesses, but how the retirement relief operates is a big giveaway to those who are disposing of their businesses, and those businesses tend to be larger ones.  The point to be taken from this is that it is not particularly well targeted.</p> <p>  We also raised the matter, and maybe this is what the Deputy was getting at, of relief from CGT at death.  When a person who accumulates assets passes on, CGT is relieved at death and is not levied.  We make the point, in this and in other work, that this system encourages individuals to hold on through retirement to a second home they might own and which they would like to bequest that to a child, because then CGT is relieved and they can pass on to that child an asset that might be worth more.</p><p>This draws on work that I and my colleagues, Anne Nolan and Keelan Beirne, did on this issue.  It essentially creates a situation where elderly people who are quite well-off in terms of their assets - I am not referring to their main home; it could be shares or a second home - are incentivised by the tax system to hold on to the asset until they die, rather than selling it off and using those proceeds to have a better standard of living in retirement.  That is the point we are getting at with regard to the relief at death.</p><p> There is also an interaction with the fair deal scheme which, in a way, goes in the opposite direction in the sense that if one thinks one will go into the fair deal scheme, one will want to get rid of one's assets at least six years before one enters the scheme.  There is a big issue in this regard and we have hinted at it in some of our previous work.  The fair deal scheme does not sit very evenly with the broadly well-designed system of capital acquisitions tax on which I responded to the questions of Deputy Aindrias Moynihan.  Whereas the system of capital acquisitions tax is based on how much one inherits over one's lifetime, which is a good and sensible way of doing things and is certainly much better than the British system, the fair deal scheme operates in such a way that, essentially, the charge applies on assets that are held or have been disposed of within the past six years.  This creates an incentive for people who, in the words of John Kay and Mervyn King in respect of the British system, are healthy, wealthy and well advised to just get rid of their assets to their kids earlier.  There is an issue there in terms of the design of the fair deal scheme and how it sits with the capital acquisitions tax system.  I hope that helps the Deputy on those issues.</p><p> I will say a few words on the broader issue of basic income.  I know Dr. Collins has many views on it, not all of which align with mine.  One point I will make on basic income is that it is often quite difficult to know to what people are referring in that regard.  It can refer to a broad range of schemes and cover a significant range of things.  If we are to have, essentially, a payment which distinguishes on the basis of need, that is, it pays more to people with a disability, elderly people or those who are out of work, then I am not sure it is very different to the current welfare system.  Once one starts incorporating those differential needs across the population, one ends up at a better-designed welfare system that may integrate the various benefits that are currently available.  There can be significant issues for people who have to claim different benefits from different agencies or as they move in and out of work.  In a way, universal basic income could just be seen as a way of resolving those anomalies in the system and having a more integrated tax and welfare system.  From that point of view, there is a lot to recommend that kind of line.  However, we will need to retain differentiated payments for different needs and, from that point of view, I do not see much benefit in a payment that does not recognise the differential needs across the population.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.257" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#S00200"><p>I will briefly come in on those points.  The issue raised by the Deputy with regard to basic income sort of chimes with the remarks.of Deputy Aindrias Moynihan.  Both Deputies' questions relate to the welfare system and its effectiveness.  Ultimately, in terms of the living standards of the vast majority of people we are discussing, it is the welfare system rather than the tax system, and certainly rather than the tax breaks in the tax system, that has the significant impact on the living standards of individuals, echoing the two issues raised by the Deputy.</p> <p>  Overall, that speaks to a point around the distributive profile of many of these tax breaks; that is, to whom does the benefit flow.  It comes back to the point raised by Deputy Canney that the more information we have on such issues and the greater clarity that is available to the committee and others, the more we can think about whether they are good outcomes or there are better ways through which those resources could be targeted and used.  It is not unusual for those involved in these discussions, particularly public representatives in the context of pensions and so on, to know from their own work that the action in terms of living standards is through the welfare system and through supporting individuals.</p><p> On the broader basic income issue, one of the great problems we have had - it is beginning to change slowly and Covid-19 has helped - is that we have separate taxation and welfare systems.  Deputies will know from dealing with constituents that in people's lives they work together and come together to provide the living standards for people and families.  Administratively, they have been separate.  The closer they come to each other, the better because it is from the two systems operating simultaneously that the living standards of people are derived.  There is strong merit in further integrating the taxation and social welfare systems.  The combination of these systems leads to the living standards of individuals but, administratively, they are structured differently.  The Department of Social Protection does one thing and the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance do something else.  In reality they come together for individuals and their living standards.  The more integrated those systems are, the better the policy system will be at responding to the needs of individuals.</p><p> Ultimately, much of what committee members are pointing at relates to issues around welfare rather than taxation.  I suppose it comes back to the point that we can realistically expect that a large chunk of the current taxation flowing into the Department of Finance every year will not be flowing in the years to come.  It will take some time for the corporate tax issues to change and it will take some time for the environment-related taxes to change.  Change they will and, as they do so, it will throw up interesting questions about how we use our current resources and where we may raise additional resources from.  That points to tax expenditure questions being more pronounced and interesting.  I would have thought that, as both of us have indicated, there is potential for changes which would simultaneously enhance revenue and fairness.</p></speech>

My thanks to our contributors.  This is such an important topic and I am pleased that we are starting to make it an issue.</p> <p>  One particular suggestion which came from Dr. Collins was about how we up the scrutiny on tax expenditure so that these measures start to be taken as seriously and scrutinised as intensely as the direct expenditures we have in the budget.  A related issue is what our role might be in that regard on this committee.</p> <p>  Dr. Collins suggested that we take a theme.  Will he elaborate on that point?  Does he mean that we take a particular expenditure and look at it as an example and work our way through year by year and one by one?  What does Dr. Collins mean by a theme?  Personally, I favour taking a cross-section each year with two or three types of reliefs to bury in to.  Obviously, we cannot do all 85 in any given year, although that would be useful, as Dr. Collins suggested.  Perhaps he could amplify the point.  Perhaps it was Dr. Roantree who said that along with the tax strategy papers we would have a more detailed budget book on tax expenditures, what they are, who they are going to and an analysis of each tax expenditure.  For the benefit for the practical outworking of this discussion for our committee and for the budgetary process, perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on those points briefly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#U00100"><p>I am happy to come in on this.  I strongly encourage Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues to engage further on this and I am delighted to hear him explore it.  There is a long list of tax expenditures and they are complex.  It raises a question as to how we can assure we can do it without getting buried in it.  It is such a big area it could possibly overcrowd the work of the committee.  My thinking on the suggestion is that we can categorise tax expenditure into various themes.  As we have gone through this today, we have spoken about those related to cultural aspects, corporate aspects and savings in various ways.  There might be merit in doing this because agriculture is similar.  They begin to sit next to each other and we can see the coherence across them.  I acknowledge it is frustrating because one ends up looking at one area conscious that there are a number of others.  If members were to proceed down such a route, it would put down a marker that over time each of these would be examined by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  In a sense, this would increase overall the level of expected scrutiny and actual scrutiny of the expenditure.</p> <p>  There is merit in examining new and recurring issues.  Dr. Roantree may wish to speak about it more and about the suggestion the ESRI include in its proposal to the committee of getting the annual reviews that are ongoing from the Department of Finance published in time for the committee to consider them, rather than dropping them with the budget documentation which, as committee members will be aware, is substantial and all arrives in two minutes flat after the Minister sits down having delivered the budget every year.  There is a better way to do it.  This would also help with the deliberations.  Of course, if the Department of Finance can produce such reports, it can produce many other similar reports the committee could look at, request and include in its annual reviews of these areas.</p></speech>

It is an exciting time in our lives when we can go through all of them.  Some useful information is included in these papers with regard to setting out an intention of what the Government is looking at.  It is useful for scrutiny purposes that they are put out there well in advance of the budget so we can have a discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas and so we in society have time to scrutinise, consider and think about them.  From this point of view, it would be welcome if the tax expenditure evaluation papers came out over the summer and autumn prior to the budget.  It is important to commend the Department of Finance on putting out the tax strategy group papers so early.  It was a great decision and it has improved the quality of debate on this quite a lot.</p> <p>  There is another specific suggestion the committee might take up.  As Dr. Collins said, these tax expenditures are complex and doing a rigorous evaluation is also incredibly complex and difficult and we should not lose sight of this.  However, this is a case in and of itself for building up capacity and expertise to be able to deal with these issues.  From this point of view, perhaps we could have a dedicated tax expenditure evaluation unit within the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.  Perhaps it might be better somewhere else.  This is the type of thing we should look at to ensure these evaluations are as good as they can be.  I reiterate that far too often they ask beneficiaries of reliefs whether a relief should continue.  There is no surprise as to what the answer to this often is.</p></speech>

In a different incarnation I was Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare and had responsibility for dealing with the fallout in respect of cases where anticipated gains from lump sums did not materialise.  What I want to mention and for everybody dealing with this issue to keep in mind is that very often people run into difficult times in mid-life during their careers.</p><p>They may struggle greatly to continue to meet contributions and, in some cases, may have spent the lump sum or part thereof in the run-up to their retirement, for whatever reason.  I can recall vividly several cases involving people who found themselves in desperate situations having been told they were going to inherit an asset at whatever age they retired but it suddenly transpired it was not there.  It was a fresh air shot and it does not work.  I would advise serious caution in dealing with that area.  I already mentioned dealing with the confusion.</p><p> I refer to defined benefits and defined contributions.  I have had many struggles through the years with regard to those schemes.  People were being sold products on the market in the belief that a sum would accrue to them at age 65 or whatever the case may be.  These were Government-introduced stabilisers, for want of a better word, that prevented the people from getting access to what they considered to be their full entitlement, leading to serious anger, annoyance and disappointment, usually among people who were at an age when they could ill-cater for it or deal with it.  Some cases ended tragically.  To what extent have our guests pondered these issues and their potential to make life very difficult for the pensioners who have worked all their lives?  I refer to the principle of these people having worked all their lives.  They will say readily they have done so, made significant sacrifices and done everything they were asked to do but, at the end of the day, the only thing coming to them is a punishment, as they see it.  That is a dangerous place to go.  Politically, it is a very dangerous place to go.  Have our guests considered those issues and their implications for the workforce?  I am not talking about millionaires; I am talking about people who make a contribution and have a contributory pension.</p><p> Incidentally, going back to when I was Minister of State, there was a situation relating to the ordinary social welfare pension at the time whereby those who did not have an average of more than 22 contributions per annum over their working life did not qualify for a contributory pension at all.  My view at the time was that was unconstitutional.  The system indicates there has to be a break-off point.  There may well have to be a break-off point but it has to be on a sound constitutional basis and that was not the case.  We changed that and introduced a system that was proportionate to the contributions.  That is a principle that would stand up in any court and should be borne in mind in the context of all pensions handled by the State.</p></speech>

I stress that neither of us are suggesting getting rid of a tax-free lump sum of &euro;200,000 entirely; we are suggesting that consideration be given to restricting it.  The people who would be affected are not far off being millionaires in terms of the value of the pension fund one would need to have for the &euro;200,000 limit to be binding.  For example, on a defined contribution pension, you can take out a maximum of 25% of that.  We are talking about the &euro;200,000 limit-----</p></speech>

If our guests were listening to the news this morning, they may have heard it mentioned that a modest house in the Rathmines region is on sale for &euro;1 million-plus.  That is an indication of how these things can and do change, which can put the taxpayer in a very difficult position at a time when he or she may be least capable of dealing with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barra Roantree" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#W00100"><p>Indeed.  Again, for the &euro;200,000 limit on the tax-free lump sum to be binding, one needs a very generous defined benefit pension based on a high salary.  Most such cases would involve high-paid public sector jobs by virtue of who has a defined benefit pension and who does not and by virtue of the fact that one needs substantial accruals to get a very large lump sum.  Otherwise, you need a defined contribution pension pot amounting to hundreds of thousands.  Very few individuals are in that position.  We are talking about the top of the distribution.  While I am sure that, as Deputy Durkan says, there are cases in which these people have borrowed on that basis, we are talking about a substantial tax expenditure.  It was in excess of &euro;100 million in 2014, the most recent year for which we have figures available, and I imagine it is substantially in excess of that figure now, given increases in pay, pensions and equity since then.</p> <p>  What Deputy Durkan says does not mean that, because something has been set, we can never change it again.  As I have said throughout this session, however, he raises an important point about the importance of stability in the pensions tax system in that we should not be chopping and changing from year to year, that we should have an overarching strategy and a view of how that system works, and that we should try to stick to that insofar as possible.  I do not accept, however, that the people who would be excepted from reducing that tax-free lump sum, even from &euro;200,000 to &euro;100,000, could not be considered well off.  These are people with very substantial pension pots or very generous defined benefit pensions.  That is important to bear in mind when we talk about these things.  We are not talking about people who are at or near the poverty line.  That is where the welfare system comes in.  In part, these things are related.  We are talking about ways to ensure we have money to pay for the State pension in the future.  From that point of view it is important to be clear about who we are talking about being affected by these types of measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#W00200"><p>I will come in briefly on all that if I may.  I have two things to say.  With any of these tax expenditure measures, whether pensions, film reliefs, the corporate changes or whatever else, transition is always important.  There is always a need to facilitate and allow a transition as you move from one system to another.  In fairness to the Revenue Commissioners and others, we in Ireland tend to be quite good at doing that, and that is the right way to proceed.</p> <p>  As for pensions specifically, this comes back to a point Deputy Canney raised earlier, which was the frustration of not having up-to-date figures and information.  I think this would be a much easier conversation for all of us if we were able to see, and if the Revenue Commissioners were able to provide, a more detailed breakdown of how this tax expenditure is distributed.  In and of itself, the structure is such that there are very substantial benefits arising to very small groups of individuals with very large pensions.  That is why it is very important we do not just remove the tax-free lump sum.  The vast majority of the people Deputy Durkan has mentioned and those he and his colleagues have met in their careers will be looking at lump sums much smaller than &euro;200,000.  However, those lump sums will of course be very important to their standard of living and to their well-being, and many of those people will expect the lump sums to be an important part of their lives and living standards.  It is about protecting that and thinking about how we distribute these State resources fairly rather than undermining the well-being of the vast majority of people, which is not what it is intended to do.</p></speech>

I read with interest Dr. Roantree's article in <i>The Irish Times</i>last month in which he wrote that an approach similar to that used to combat pension poverty in 1990 is needed to help millennials.  I am interested in hearing how he and our other guests feel this can best be done.  Also, how can we address pension poverty, which, unfortunately, is slowly but surely returning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barra Roantree" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#W00400"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right that there is a risk that pension poverty rises again if the State pension does not keep track with the broader living standards of the population.</p><p>We are at the point where we may be starting to see pension poverty creep back up again for certain groups of pensioners.  The point I was making in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i>to which Deputy Ryan referred was just how phenomenal an achievement it was that, as a country and a society, over the 2000s almost one in two pensioners was below the poverty line but that that decreased to less than 10% over the course of a decade.  The reason for that was a political commitment to the living standards of pensioners, and the policy instrument that was used to fulfil that was increases in the State pension.  It rose over that period by, I think, 50% in real terms, after accounting for inflation, so substantial increases in the State pension were made over the 2000s and they were remarkably effective in not entirely eradicating but certainly massively reducing pension poverty.<br/><br/>Again, the point I was making in the article was that there is now a huge issue with the living standards of younger adults, particularly those who have emerged from education in the face of the financial crisis and the recession that followed it and now Covid.  If we want to address that, and that, ultimately, is a political decision, we need the political commitment to do so.  There are ways to address it.  We need sustained action on housing, which is a completely different conversation and one to which my colleagues in the ESRI have contributed fulsomely.  We also need to be sure that, as we emerge from the pandemic, the supports are in place for younger adults to retrain, if necessary, into the jobs that will be there.  Also, younger adults need to be supported with their incomes and living standards as we emerge from this pandemic because they are the ones who have been worst hit by the labour market impacts of the pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#X00200"><p>If I may briefly come in on that point, the lesson from the late 1990s into the 2000s, and in fact over recent years as well, is that if you increase welfare payments which are targeted not only at older people but also at those who in various other ways are dependent on welfare, that feeds across to very substantial outcomes in the form of decreases in poverty and in inequality.  We have, in historical terms at least, much lower levels of poverty and inequality at the moment.  The reason we do is that we have had notable increases in welfare payments over recent years - not every year, and they have stopped, as the Deputy will be well aware.  Nonetheless there were increases, including some targeted increases.  It comes down to what we want to do as a society and what objectives we want to pursue.  That is where the tax expenditure issue fits in as well.  In a sense, these are resources and we can allocate them in different ways through the welfare system and the taxation system.  It is about having visibility of them and their outcomes.  That is important for the Deputy and her colleagues as they make decisions on the allocation of the State's resources.</p></speech>

A report was published by my colleagues at the ESRI earlier this week which drew attention to one thing that might be especially relevant in this context and in thinking about this, namely, the level of the grant for those participating in education.  There is a parallel there in how in the 1990s the State pension was neglected and fell behind the level of wider living standards.  The same has been the case for quite a long time for the grant available to students participating in education.  It has fallen significantly behind.  I think that was one anomaly to which the ESRI drew attention in its report on this released on Monday.  The report also referred to the levels of jobseeker's payments for younger adults.  Those are two things that follow up on and link into what Dr. Collins was talking about.</p></speech>

I will ask briefly about the special assignee relief programme, SARP, the recent review and the justification given by Indecon to extend it.  Will the witnesses briefly outline their views on that?  Then we will make sure we finish by 11.30 a.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-24a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021062400002#X00500"><p>I am very happy to do that.  SARP is a particularly interesting tax relief.  It is quite expensive and targeted very much at a very small group of individuals.  I was quite struck when I sat down and crunched the numbers on it to see that the average recipient is on an income of &euro;313,000.</p><p>There is an argument that these are good jobs, which we should bring in because they deliver long-term benefits for the State but that argument could be made in various different ways for almost every job in the State.  One can construct an argument around that.  One has to stand back and ask whether this is a good use of resources, given the resources that are available, or whether they should be put somewhere else.  A report carried out by Indecon examined the issue.  There was a brief cost-benefit analysis at the tail end of that report, although it did not include any sensitivity testing and only limited information on the dead weight and displacement assumptions that were made.  It echoes a point Dr. Roantree made earlier, which was that if one asks people who are in receipt of a tax break whether it is a good idea and whether it should be continued, one will generally get "Yes" as an answer.  We need to take a slightly broader view and consider whether, overall, it is a good use of resources for society.  When one looks at it, it is quite stark that it is not and that the benefits involved are quite small.  I suspect there are some benefits but they are quite small and we could make better use of those resources.</p></speech>
