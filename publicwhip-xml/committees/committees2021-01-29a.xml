    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#B00200"><p>No apologies have been received but Deputy Matt Carthy will be late because he is attending the agriculture committee, which is meeting at the same time, unfortunately.  I welcome everyone to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely but, on the basis of legal advice, members must be within the precincts of Leinster House to contribute to the meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is also attending remotely.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The business before us is the minutes of the previous meeting, financial accounts and statements, correspondence and our work programme.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings on 21 and 22 January, which have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes for 21 January agreed?  I need a proposer and seconder.  I thank Deputies Hourigan and Devlin.  The minutes are agreed.  Are the minutes for 22 January agreed?  I thank Deputy Verona Murphy.  The minutes are agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published.</p> <p>  Six sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 14 and 22 January 2021.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a qualified audit opinion for Children's Health Ireland.  These are the first accounts of Children's Health Ireland, which was established on 1 January 2019 through the merger of three predecessor hospitals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General states the accounts give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, which is standard for many health bodies.  Our attention is also drawn to significant non-compliant procurement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued clear audit opinions in all other cases, which are the environment fund, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Oberstown Children Detention Campus and Laois Offaly Education and Training Board, although the Comptroller and Auditor General also drew attention to non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;575,727 in the accounts of Laois Offaly Education and Training Board.</p> <p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if he wishes to comment on the financial accounts and statements before I open the floor to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#B00300"><p>There are no particular matters to bring to the attention of the committee.  The qualified audit opinion is a technical matter.  The Minister for Health has issued a direction in regard to how pensions are to be accounted for by health sector bodies.  Children's Health Ireland is compliant with that direction and it is doing it the way the Minister has directed, but it does introduce this technical qualification in regard to a true and fair view.  In the other cases concerning non-competitive procurement, certainly in the case of Laois Offaly Education and Training Board, I understand the value of non-compliant procurement is declining.  It is the first year of operation of the hospital.</p><p>It does not seem to be as bad as other health sector bodies in relation to that but we will keep it under review.</p></speech>

I refer to significant non-compliant procurement.  With regard to the recent revelations about one of the main education and training boards, ETBs, in the country, could the Comptroller and Auditor General elaborate on what is happening there?  Did he state the value was &euro;575,000 in the Laois and Offaly ETB?</p></speech>

I do not have the precise figure but it is something of that order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C00500"><p>The figure is &euro;575,727.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C00600"><p>The brief states that our attention is drawn to significant non-compliance.  Has it been taken in hand?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C00700"><p>Yes.  There is evidence that the figure is reducing year-on-year.  They are very close to the level at which I would not be drawing attention to non-compliant procurement.  I use a threshold value of &euro;500,000 for any public body.  It comprises a mix of different types of procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C00800"><p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I will ask the clerk to the committee to write to the CEO and ask for a progress report.</p> <p>  Is it agreed that we note the accounts and statements?  Agreed.  As usual, we will continue our practice of writing to bodies with significant non-compliant procurement, and to bodies that are late laying their accounts before the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  Members will recall that we agreed at a recent meeting to hold over a number of items for consideration in public session.  Two correspondence lists have been circulated to them.  The list entitled "Correspondence List HELD OVER" includes items held over from that recent meeting.  The list entitled "Correspondence List NEW" includes correspondence received since the latest meeting.  As usual, items that are not flagged for discussion for this meeting will be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions, and decisions taken by the committee on correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is: correspondence from Accounting Officers and or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  Members will recall that, at our meeting on 16 December, we agreed to hold over six items of correspondence.  These are items that had been flagged for discussion by members, and we will deal with them first.  I will generally request agreement to note and publish the items and if members then wish to propose additional actions, we will consider them.</p> <p>  The first correspondence is No. 252B from Ms Anne Graham, CEO, National Transport Authority, dated 26 November 2020, providing further information requested by the committee regarding procurement in respect of rail services on the Maynooth Line.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had a particular interest in this and I ask her to contribute at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C01000"><p>I cannot put my hand on it.  I had it here a while ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C01100"><p>It is full of good news.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#C01200"><p>It is useful to get the information because there have been several announcements on the same matter over a number of years.  It is to get some degree of certainty about what, in fact, is ordered - what has already been paid for - and what the lead-in time is.</p><p>Obviously, the number of companies from which the kind of rolling stock we seek can be procured is limited.  As a result, it will be quite difficult to know if we get value for money in respect of this very large and necessary expenditure.  The information is useful from that point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00200"><p>There is some information in that letter regarding what has been ordered.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	There are two types of fleet orders that are in the process of being acquired to address passenger capacity needs on the rail network.<br /><br />The first order relates to 41 inter-city rail cars and the second order type relates to new DART fleet, potentially both fully electric and battery electric DART fleet. </blockquote> <p>The letter goes on to set out some information on that.  I think the Deputy's was a non-DART one.  On page 2 it is stated: </p> <blockquote> 	While the initial delivery date of the first vehicle to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was targeted for the end of 2021, various delays have occurred in the intervening period, mainly related to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Accordingly, the train manufacturer has now advised that the first carriage is likely to arrive in mid-2022, with the full order of 41 carriages to be completed before the end of 2022.  Subject to final commissioning by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the new carriages will go into passenger service on a phased basis from mid-2022 onwards, over a six month period. </blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00300"><p>If I may make a couple of additional points.  There is a DART upgrade on that particular line and work has started on its design.  It requires significant changes with things such as bridges.</p> <p>  On procurement, it has been announced several times but the order has not gone in.  Even the specification will be important in ensuring it is fully accessible.  That was one of the components.  If it is already gone, one cannot influence it; if it is not, one can do so.  That is why timing is really important on this.  I am sure the transport committee will follow up on the details.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00400"><p>An order has been placed for the provision of 41 intercity rail cars since September 2019 with a company in Tokyo.  On the DART fleet, the letter states that tenders for the fleet framework contract have been received and are being evaluated.   I will not read it out, the information is extensive.  That is No. 252B.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00500"><p>I have just found it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00600"><p>What does the Deputy propose on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00700"><p>It is straightforward, but we should get periodic updates or monitor the procurement because it is a very sizeable contract.  It is fine, we should just publish the information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00800"><p>Okay.  We will ask for the committee to receive updates on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  No. 253 was flagged by Deputies Carthy and Munster.  Deputy Carthy is at the agriculture committee meeting and will be a little late.  He has asked that we hold this over until he arrives.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 254 is correspondence from Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive of Tusla, dated 8 December 2020 and providing information requested by the committee in respect of non-compliant procurement of over &euro;7 million.  We will note and publish this.  Several Deputies wish to speak to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#D00900"><p>It is clear that Tusla has serious issues with procurement compliance.  I understand that the agency is funded through the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth yet it seems to make use of HBS Procurement.  Why are we seeing such procurement issues when a dedicated service is used?  I just cannot understand.  Can we ask Tusla to clarify whether it uses HBS Procurement generally?</p><p>Can we ask, just to clarify, whether it uses HBS Procurement generally, whether it is supposed to, or whether it is meant to be working to a different body or framework?  If we could write to Tusla and ask those questions, that would be a start.  I also suggest we as a committee include Tusla in the work plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#E00200"><p>There is an issue there.  Looking through non-compliant procurements, one thing that stands out is that a company called CPL seems to come up regular basis under the heading of agency staff.  There is a sum of &euro;694,000-plus down as being non-compliant.  There are two other companies that got contracts that were deemed to be non-compliant, but they are &euro;78,000 and &euro;46,000 respectively.  The CPL one is very high at almost &euro;700,000.  When we write, I propose that we look for further information on what that is about, what exactly it was sought for and whether that company has any other contracts with Tusla, if the committee agrees.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#E00300"><p>That is the company that has been largely used to source people for the track and trace system in the context of Covid.  There has been quite a lot of criticism and complaints about the way some of those contracts have been handled.  We should have a close look at that one.  It is not historical; it is current in terms of the use of that company.  We need also to get from Tusla exactly what kind of choices are available in that area in terms of competitor organisations, or if some of this stuff can be done in house.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#E00400"><p>I will make a couple of points that may be of assistance to the committee.  Tusla emerged from the HSE when it was established and, therefore, many of the legacy systems and organisational structures that were in place were taken over directly from the HSE.  Effectively, one sees in Tusla a microcosm of the problems that are also found in the HSE.  That probably explains the link with Health Business Services, HBS, which is a procurement unit within the HSE.  If you like, the organisational relationship has continued.</p> <p>  On CPL, it certainly is a name that comes up.  It is a provider of agency staff and is used in other organisations.  There are other suppliers of agency services, so one would expect scope for a competitive procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#E00500"><p>Do any other members wish to come in?  Okay, on the basis of that discussion, we will ask the clerk to write to Tusla to seek further information on those issues.  Specifically, we will seek the explanation for such a large figure going to CPL, as well as asking how many contracts and engagements that company has had and how many pieces of work it has done for Tusla and the full value of those.  That would be useful.</p><p>The next item on the agenda is complicated because there is a number of pieces.  Nos. 257B, 273B and 274B are related.  We will take Nos. 257B and 273B first and they are from Nick Ashmore, CEO of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, dated 9 December and 21 December respectively.  These are responses requested from the committee on matters raised in correspondence by an individual, which, with the consent of that individual, we forwarded to the SBCI for response.  In my opinion, the responses do not sufficiently address the concerns raised.</p><p>We also requested the Department of Finance to respond to these matters, which it did in correspondence item No. 274B<b></b>from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, dated 21 December 2020.</p><p>Although not flagged for discussion, it is related.  This response is not in any way illuminating either.</p><p> Arising from our consideration of several items of correspondence and related responses, I do not believe the matters raised have been directly or sufficiently addressed.  We had previously agreed to include the matter in our work programme, and I propose that we schedule an engagement with representatives of Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to examine this matter in the context of its latest financial statement.  Before I put that proposal to members, I will open the discussion to the floor.  Does any member wish to comment on the SBCI correspondence?</p></speech>

An issue that has been brought to our attention concerns an incredibly important fund that is very much focused on the SME sector and the availability of finance.  I base my judgment on one of the items of correspondence, No. 296 C.  The person who gave us the information in the first instance states the Act specifically advises against these funds being used to replace existing borrowings and indicates that if they are not used within two years, they are supposed to go back for reuse by others.  They have not gone back.  Essentially, this may well deny others the opportunity to be resourced to conduct their business because they cannot access funding.  The funding was not to refinance but specifically for use by Irish companies.  We have been told that there is at least one incident of this not occurring.  That is very significant in terms of the functioning of the SBCI.  It derives its funding from a source wider than what I believe remained of the pension fund, if I am right, but we really require the body to function in the way envisaged in the legislation.  We must be satisfied about that.</p></speech>

I have been reading through the correspondence.  The whole issue remains opaque and therefore it would be well worth having a session on the interaction in respect of the fund and how it is being made available to those it should be made available to.  Therefore, I support further consideration of this.</p></speech>

The issues he raised on 18 January are certainly interesting in that he comes back to the issue of what exactly the money from SBCI can be used for, how it can be used, how it can be loaned, who it can be loaned to and for what purpose.  That is an issue that we need to follow up on.  It is proposed that we schedule an engagement with the SBCI.  Have we a proposer and seconder?</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I also propose to request that the HSE keep the committee informed of updates regarding Autism Initiatives Ireland.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is flagged for discussion.  This benchmark has been a bone of contention with the committee because we have been told that for various commercial reasons, we cannot see it.  However, the committee has asked in the past to see it in private session, which is a reasonable request.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this issue and wished to make an intervention.</p></speech>

On the Revenue correspondence, particularly the report on the use of data access requests to telecommunications companies, we see that in 2017 there were 40 such requests.  That dropped to 26 in 2018 and according to the correspondence we received from Revenue, there have been no requests since then.  Could the committee write to Revenue seeking clarification as to why that is the case?  I have a suspicion it might relate to the introduction of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Could we get clarification from Revenue on whether these types of requests simply will not be issued in the future and if that is the case, whether that points to a deficiency in the GDPR legislation and a need for it to be updated?  Could we ask Revenue if there has been any engagement with the Government in this regard?  As I mentioned, 66 requests have been referred.  It would be useful if Revenue could inform us as to the amount recouped to date with respect to those 66 requests, if it has any data reflecting how often it would have made similar requests if this option remained open to them, and if it believes its ability to recoup tax owed to the State has been impacted by the GDPR legislation.</p></speech>

It is from Deputy Matt Shanahan and is dated 11 January.  It raises concerns about the recently advertised role of the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  At our meeting on 14 January, the committee agreed to write to the acting Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the matters raised.  This letter issued on 19 January.  We also agreed at our private meeting yesterday to proceed to make an application to the committee on remit and oversight - the Committee on Procedure - to examine the processes by which high level remuneration in the public service is determined.</p><p>It is proposed to advise Deputy Shanahan of that.  We thrashed out this issue at length and we sent him a lengthy letter.  We also sent a lengthy letter to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in which we asked 14 questions.  I think Deputy Shanahan's letter even made a recent appearance in the media.  At yesterday's meeting we agreed to write to the acting Secretary General.  It is a very serious issue and people are wondering what exactly has happened here.  It is four weeks since the matter was first raised publicly and, at this point, we are no clearer as to who made the decision to bump up the pay by &euro;81,000 or why the decision was taken.  Was the decision made by civil servants or politicians?  We are told it was not the Government.  Was it a group of Ministers?  The question is who was involved.  We are no clearer on the matter.</p><p> Lately, there was a suggestion that part of the reason is that given the head of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, is on an amount in the region of &euro;360,000 that the Secretary General of the Department supervising him would need to be on a higher salary than &euro;210,000 to do that.  I am not sure of the logic of that, because the Secretary General of the Department of Finance is in a supervisory role to some extent over the Garda Commissioner, who is on more than &euro;300,000, and the CEO of the National Treasury Management Agency.  Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy flagged the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#H00200"><p>I welcome the decision by the committee to investigate the overall issue of the remuneration of high-paid public servants.  This stinks to high heaven.  There is no other way of describing it.  Essentially, a job is teed up for a former Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who is now moving into a new Department.  There are so many questions regarding the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the first instance.  You mentioned the governmental impact of it, Chairman.  It is clearly a source of concern for many that this would lead to a situation whereby other high-level public servants would seek significant pay increases in line with what has been proposed for the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  There is no rationale, economic or political, for this decision.  The silence has been deafening in the official response to the issue.</p> <p>  Anybody looking at the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts would have to say that we have an obligation, let alone a right, to delve into how this matter was addressed.  I ask whether there is a remit to ensure that this decision is reversed, because it sends out all the wrong signals.  Public servants are on a two-tier pay scale where newer entrants are operating under worse conditions than their colleagues working alongside them, whether it be in schools or other public services.  We must tackle this issue in a robust manner to ensure full transparency in respect of what happened but also so that there is accountability on why the decision was made and whether it can be reversed.</p></speech>

We do not, nor should we try, have a role in setting the level of pay for any public servant.  The issue being flagged is the process or lack thereof and the unusual nature of the case in terms of the potential knock-on effect on public sector pay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#J00100"><p>Obviously, a very comprehensive letter went from the Committee of Public Accounts to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I completely concur that that captured many of the concerns we collectively had, and that letter came about as a consequence of a collaborative effort to make sure the issues we were concerned about were adequately covered.  I subsequently read in an article that the intention is to reply to the finance committee, which is investigating this and has a different remit to ourselves, but that the Department will reply to everyone on the same day.  The article gave the impression that we were all going to be at loggerheads with each other.  The key issue is that we get to the origin of how this decision was made, what the process was, who was involved in it and what the knock-on consequences are likely to be.</p> <p>  As to the piece of work we are going to do, it is important, every time we come up with a constraint in regard to our work, that we name the change that has happened in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts, and that is the standing order the Chairman himself read out at the beginning of the meeting, Standing Order 218.  That imposes pretty strict restrictions on what we can do as opposed to what we were able to do before.  While it does not look like we will be the committee that will be investigating this particular aspect, there is a wider aspect that we are considering.  Obviously, we are looking for an extension of our remit to inquire into such matters, which I think will be very helpful in looking at the broader issues of process and public pay, particularly at the high end.</p> <p>  The Chairman or the clerk might go through exactly what the timeline is for us to get a response from the Committee on Procedure on that.  We will have to put that into our work programme in a timely way because it is a complementary piece of work that we will do alongside the work that is obviously going to be undertaken by the finance committee.  The one thing we, as politicians, should not be is to be at loggerheads with each other on this.  If the other committee is going to deal with this, I am perfectly happy that it will do that and it will do that job thoroughly.  However, I think there is another solid piece of work for us to do, and that is what we are seeking to do and seeking an extension of our remit to do.</p> <p>  This is going to keep coming up over and over again because this constraint on our remit, as it relates to what it was like before, is a significant change to how the Committee of Public Accounts operates.</p></speech>

Again, I stress this is about the process going forward and as this is the Committee of Public Accounts, I feel it should be for our committee.  I read the same article that Deputy Murphy referenced.  It is important this is looked at and, not to prolong matters, I concur with what has been said.</p></speech>

I raised it with individual members of that committee and they came back to us formally and said they would respond to any request from the Committee of Public Accounts to that committee, and they would turn it around within a week.

Has any indication come back as to how it is going to be approached?</p></speech>

There is a clear need for the committee to examine this matter because of the likely questions and lines of questioning we will have in subsequent years on decisions of this nature.  Work in this area that does not infringe on the policy issues around pay that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach will examine is needed.  Process and the procedure by which this was adopted is probably key to the work of our committee on this.  I echo what other members said.  The idea of Members across the House being focused on this issue to hold to account those at a senior level in the permanent government is important and something we should pursue.</p></speech>

The clerk to the committee informed me that the application has been drafted and needs to be signed off.  That will be followed up on straight away.  It is proposed that we advise Deputy Shanahan accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I will go back to the item of correspondence we held back, No. 253B, correspondence from Mr. John Dollard, chief superintendent, Commissioner's office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Deputy Carthy wished to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012900002#K00400"><p>This relates to the infamous Cabra account and the apparent diversion of EU funds to what was a dubious, potentially fraudulent, account.  This is a long-standing issue.  Unfortunately, the response from the Garda suggests that it cannot comment on the update in respect of this matter because it is currently the subject of an external investigation.  My understanding is that the external investigation comprises the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.  A role may also have been undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  I suggest we write to both of those bodies inquiring as to whether they are conducting investigations into the Cabra account and if they could provide us with a timeframe.</p> <p>  There is an issue with regard to a number of these external bodies which allows agencies that should be accountable to say they cannot comment while the other investigations are taking place.  I note that previously, according to media reports dating back to 2017, the Garda refused to comment because the Committee of Public Accounts was investigating.  Now, it is refusing to comment to the Committee of Public Accounts because another investigation is taking place.  That is simply not good enough.</p> <p>  The issues pertaining to the Cabra account were well aired at the time.  We still do not have the nuts and bolts, however, in terms of exactly what happened and, as a result, we cannot put in place procedures to ensure such activity does not take place in the future.  My proposal is that we write to OLAF and GSOC inquiring as to whether they are conducting investigations and if they can give a timeframe as to when those investigations will be concluded.</p></speech>

Essentially, this follows on from quite a lengthy inquiry carried out by the previous Committee for Public Accounts.  There were two strands to that.  The aspect the previous committee looked at was related to the Garda College.  The bank accounts and the Cabra account would have been linked to that.  The work in this regard was done in a timely and effective way.</p><p>Some significant changes happened as a consequence of it and it is one example of the effectiveness of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p> The second strand related to European funds.  I concur with what Deputy Carthy has proposed.  My understanding was that GSOC was conducting an investigation into this, but I do not think anything precludes us from inquiring from the commission as to the time it is working to.  We debated two items of legislation in the D&aacute;il this week, one of which related to nominating two additional people to the board of GSOC.  One issue raised by me and others concerned the timely conclusion of investigations and whether there were adequate resources.  The other item of legislation we debated related to European finances and transposing an EU directive.  The reason we are doing it as late as we are is we would be fined if we did not do it.  There is a bit of an irony that we are discussing this issue today, given that it relates to European funds.  We have to pay close attention to it because there are significant consequences for us.  My understanding is that is the aspect that GSOC is examining.  It may well be we need to ask it what the headline of the issue is.  I do not mean the detail, because I understand that an investigation has to happen and GSOC is the competent authority, but we might inquire as to exactly what the investigation is and whether it relates to the two strands of the issue or just one.</p></speech>

Deputy Carthy has proposed that we request An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to keep us apprised of developments insofar as it can.  We have to be careful in respect of GSOC.  Obviously, we cannot get involved if it is involved in an inquiry into the matter, but we can ask it for a timeline if agreed.  That is as far as we can go.  If it is agreed, we will correspond with the chief superintendent and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and seek a timeline from GSOC.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The final item of correspondence is from Ms Rachel Downes, CEO of Caranua, dated from 15 January 2021, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with representatives of Caranua in December.  At last week's meeting, we agreed that Deputy Munster would request the consent of the two survivors to forward their correspondence to the committee, which would then be sent to Caranua for reply.</p> <p>  I ask members to bear in mind that at the beginning of every public meeting, they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  If the discussion on this item moves to criticism of Caranua or its CEO, who is not here to respond, as Chair I must intervene.</p> <p>  I propose that we proceed with the action we have agreed and that we note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Deputy Munster flagged up the matter and Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy had proposed that we would hold over this item for discussion until this public meeting.</p></speech>

It gave us information in response to question No. 5 but I refer in particular to point 11 on the correspondence.</p><p>We have discussed the effect that Standing Order 218 has on the work of the committee and how it can be stymied.<br/><br/>Point 11 of the correspondence that we received from Caranua is an apt example of how the committee's work can be stymied.  One case in question was raised in the public domain in <i>The Irish Times</i>last August.  It related to a survivor who had an issue with the colour of her bathroom tiles being the same colour as the tiles in the institution in which she was held.  The correspondence that we received was a direct response to questions about that individual.  Ms Downes stated that everything named in that is not the full facts of the case.  Looking at the correspondence that we received, she stated that she was not familiar with the specific cases but she acknowledged that she was familiar with that case while at the committee.<br/><br/>The correspondence states that committee members did not contact Caranua in advance of the meeting to discuss individual cases but instead opted to voice allegations as fact without giving Caranua an appropriate or fair right to reply.  I am aware that at least one of the two survivors whose cases were brought up in advance of the committee meeting emailed Caranua directly before the meeting to give their permission to Caranua to discuss their cases and for Deputies at the committee to discuss the case in a public forum.  I have seen that email.  That does not fit with what is in the response and I take issue with it.<br/><br/>Caranua claimed in response to previous correspondence from the Committee of Public Accounts to be unfamiliar with the two cases that we are referring to.  That does not hold any weight.  It said it did not know who the individuals were, yet it went on to contact one of those individuals in person after the committee meeting to apologise and re-engage with the person.  The re-engagement did not fully meet the needs of that survivor.  We take issue with this.  We had permission from at least one survivor to raise the issues at the last meeting when Caranua was present and it transpired that the survivor had contacted Caranua to make it aware of that, yet this most recent correspondence does not refer to that at all.  In fact, it is the opposite and Caranua still says it was not aware.  I have seen that email.  There are many issues involved.  We also flagged up the lack of compassion.  For a body set up to help survivors, I was flabbergasted at the lack of compassion shown when we flagged up the two cases that were still outstanding and had not been fully dealt with, and the response was what we received.  We are still engaging with those survivors and will send on the details to the secretariat to try to ensure they get their full entitlements.<br/><br/>Caranua indicated that it cannot approve applications for more than &euro;15,000.  Can we ask Caranua to outline what underpins that limit?  Is it primary legislation?  Is it Caranua policy?  Was it a direction from the Minister or just a policy decision of Caranua?</p><p>Other issues relating to that remain outstanding.</p></speech>

Will Deputy Munster clarify?  I was aware of correspondence from them giving Deputies permission to raise these issues with Caranua when it was before the committee.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I concur that several of us got an email in advance of the meeting.  The Chairman read out the notice at the beginning of the meeting about not naming people, but that is difficult to do when people actually give us permission to name them.  There is a balance to be struck.</p> <p>  Caranua is winding down.  It appeared before us after the formal close-off date and is not receiving new applications.  The fund was finite to begin with, but anything remaining was to go to, I believe, the children's hospital.  It is not likely that there will be funds remaining.  The Department of Education will take responsibility for Caranua's documents and so on once they are handed over.  However, my understanding is that that legislation has not been published yet.  Whatever funds remain will be used for salaries and so forth because of the time lag between Caranua's closing and the formal handing over, which is required to happen by way of legislation.  We might write to the Minister for Education and ask for the timeline so that we might be satisfied about the issue.</p> <p>  A lesson should be learned in all of this about how the metric used to show satisfaction with the service provided by Caranua was one of complaint.  That was wholly inappropriate, given the cohort of people involved.  With the recent publication of the report into mother and baby homes and the discussion of a redress scheme, lessons must be learned about what metrics are employed in evaluating schemes from their users' point of view.  This will have to be a consideration.  We have all heard complaints about how Caranua operated since its establishment.  It is important that Caranua be properly evaluated and that its evaluation not be based exclusively on complaints from people who have been conditioned throughout their lives not to complain.  We must contact the Department of Education and find out where the legislation stands.</p></speech>

In some cases there were appeals, where applications failed and so on and people were not happy, but an awful lot of people were satisfied.  Deputy Murphy may recall that at yesterday's meeting I asked that in its correspondence and in our dealing with the Department of Education we would highlight the issue of the use of that learning.  We are going to have more redress boards etc. in respect of the mother and baby homes, and there are all the issues around adoption as well to come up.  The other issue we have highlighted to them is to revert to us on the issue of legislation.  I asked yesterday for that to be included when the legislation for the wind-down of Caranua comes before the Houses.  I was under the impression that the legislation would arrive straight away after Christmas, as soon as we came back after the Christmas break, and that it would be before the House.  I do not know.  Maybe some of the Deputies can advise me as to whether it is due to appear on an Order Paper any time in the near future, but we asked that question directly yesterday and we will seek clarification on that, so we are on it.</p><p> Two issues have been flagged up here.  One is that there is a question as to where this &euro;15,000 limit came from and whether it is underpinned by legislation.  We will ask that question of Caranua.  We will also bring to its attention when we correspond back with Caranua that committee members did have the permission of the two survivors to raise the issue with Caranua and that Caranua was aware of the case.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I do not think there is any doubt that the people who were best able to make the applications were those from whom the applications were first received.  I think that because the funding was finite, that was an internal decision of Caranua to make sure that there was sufficient funding for people making applications.  I think there is some information we already have on that.  Again, we certainly got complaints - I did over the years - and they were certainly worse at the beginning.  There were people who did benefit from this funding, and there is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

The limit of &euro;15,000 was a determination made, I think, around 2015, after about a year and a half of operation.  Some of the applicants who were in earlier got significantly more than that amount, but the decision was made by the Caranua board itself that in future payouts would be limited to &euro;15,000.</p></speech>

It is an issue that came up all right.  There were some figures in the earlier applications whereby there were grants made available that were significantly higher than that.  What we will do, then, is proceed with the actions we have already agreed and then note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will move now to new correspondence that has not been previously considered by the committee.  The first item that has been flagged up is R0299, from Ms Marguerite Ryan, finance officer, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 18 January 2021, providing information requested by the committee on the Limerick regeneration framework.  I propose to forward this item to the correspondent who raised the matter with the previous committee during the term of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I advise that Limerick City and County Council is audited by the Local Government Audit Service and, as such, it is outside the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>We can also request the correspondent&rsquo;s consent to forward his correspondence and the response from the Department to the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for any action it deems appropriate.  Can we note and publish this correspondence?</p></speech>

I understand that local authorities are audited by the Local Government Audit Service, but it does not attract the same level of public attention or transparency that would be provided by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given the large amounts of money involved, provided that the correspondent gives permission us to, would it be in order to forward it to the Local Government Audit Service and for the Committee of Public Accounts to request that we be included on any related correspondence on an ongoing basis and the results of any investigation that might take place?</p></speech>

It is not that we do not want to be helpful to the correspondent, but it is better that we do not get our wires crossed here.  We could create the impression that somehow we have a role in sorting this out.  Unfortunately, the local authorities are quite separate from the Committee of Public Accounts.  There has been talk in the past of legislation to change that.  However, local authorities are audited by the Local Government Audit Service.  We should inform him of that in the first place.  To be helpful, we can point out to him that he can correspond with them and maybe send him the contact details for the Local Government Audit Service.  That would be better than confusing the correspondent.</p></speech>

It is certainly perfectly open to the original correspondent to communicate with the Local Government Audit Service and see if it wants to take it up.  There is obviously a demarcation line between the Department and the local authorities which is constitutionally founded.  That is why a separate audit service deals with local government.  It reports directly to the relevant council.  My only access to this issue would relate to the oversight by the Department.  I do not have the original correspondence.  I do not have any dispute with what is said by the Department.  However, I would need to go back to the original correspondence to see what the issues raised are before making any other comment.</p></speech>

The first one flagged is No. 296B.  We have dealt with this already.  It is correspondence from an individual dated 18 January 2021 providing further information regarding concerns over the use of public funds by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  As we have already considered related matters, I propose that we note this correspondence and address this matter when the SBCI is before the committee.  We can thrash it out then.  He is actually a constituent of mine but if he is willing to come before the committee we can see the information he has.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 304B, which is from an individual dated 20 January 2021 raising concerns with regard to NAMA and its adherence to statutory provisions.  As I understand that the previous Committee of Public Accounts in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il wrote to NAMA regarding this matter and forwarded NAMA's response to the committee, I propose to advise the correspondent accordingly.

At our meeting yesterday, we agreed to reschedule our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to Tuesday, 9 February.  We were to have those witnesses in a lot sooner and people are mindful of what has happened.  On the first occasion they had an engagement in their diary that they were not able to move.  That is accepted.  Tuesday, 9 February is subject to the committee being granted one of the available meeting slots on that day.  We are in the hands of the Business Committee on that one.</p> <p>  In the following weeks we have provisionally scheduled engagements with the National Shared Services Office, the SBCI, Horse Racing Ireland and the Higher Education Authority.  Is it agreed to proceed with these engagements in the weeks ahead?  Agreed.</p> <p>  With regard to other bodies that have been added to the work programme but not scheduled, are there any that members wish to prioritise?  I will open the floor to them if they wish to put in one or two others.  I have sent two to the clerk to the committee to be put on the list.  Does any member wish to come in?  If they do not have it to hand they could email it to the clerk following the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Is there any other business members wish to raise?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#A00400"><p>I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Apologies have been sent by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.  The Deputy said that he would have liked to have been here but that he is not able to be within the D&aacute;il precincts today.</p> <p>  I remind members that in the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room and that all members must join remotely from elsewhere within the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on Microsoft Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts.  Members should mute their microphones when they are not making contributions and use the "raise hand" function to indicate if they wish to speak.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  The agenda today is to discuss the challenges facing the forestry sector.  This is one of a series of meetings the committee has been holding to discuss the forestry sector.  After today's meeting, it is hoped that the committee will be able to put together a report and recommendations to the Minister on the sector.</p> <p>  I welcome the officials from the Department of Agriculture and the Marine, Mr. Colm Hayes, assistant secretary, Mr. Seamus Dunne, chief forestry inspector, and Ms Patricia Kelly, head of forestry division, all of whom join us remotely.  We have received the opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions so the committee has agreed that the opening statement will be taken as read so we can make full use of the session for questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Those participating in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  We had a meeting here with the Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, and her officials, some four or five weeks before Christmas and there was significant disquiet - to put it mildly - with some of the answers and information we got on that day.  The committee gets the dashboard from the Department each week, which is most helpful.  It is six months since the Department set targets for itself in respect of the industry.  Unfortunately, every week we see that the Department is coming in significantly below its self-prescribed targets for forestry.  There has been much focus in the past on felling licences.  I have received a great deal of communication in recent weeks from the private sector from people who feel that there is a serious bias towards Coillte in the issuing of felling licences at the moment and that the private sector is not getting its fair share of licences.  There is a serious shortfall in afforestation and in the issuing of licences.  If we do not plant now, in 30 years people will say "What was Ireland doing and why was there such a shortfall in planting in these years?"  I hope we will get answers from the Department on how these issues will be addressed.</p><p>As matters stand, we will be lucky to hit 20% of the afforestation target in the programme for Government.  That is a serious issue.  As I have said, the private sector also has serious issues with felling.  The other issue on which I would like to hear the Department's proposals is ash dieback, which is an issue we have dealt with in a previous meeting.  Forest owners who are affected by ash dieback feel extremely aggrieved.  I would like to hear from the Department officials whether they have plans or proposals on dealing with ash dieback.</p><p> Deputy Carthy was the first to indicate that he wanted to speak.  He had indicated to me that he must attend a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and asked to be given the first opportunity to speak.  Due to his clash of engagements, I will allow Deputy Carthy to put the first set of questions to the Department officials.  We cannot hear Deputy Carthy.  His microphone must be muted.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#B00400"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach and I thank him for his indulgence.  I thank the guests for their attendance.</p> <p>  The figures that have been presented in the Department's opening statement set out the challenge we are currently facing.  The State has a target of over 8,000 ha to be planted per annum.  Last year, licences to approve 4,300 ha were issued but only 2,433 ha were actually planted.  This equates to about a 25% success rate.  Considering that applications were granted in previous years that one would have expected to come on stream this year, the Department should give a rationale as to why the response has been so slow in terms of actual planting.  </p> <p>  A set of figures we received from an outside body shows there is obviously a real problem in encouraging and enticing farmers to participate in the afforestation programme.  That has had and will have serious implications if it is not tackled.  In 2014, 96% of all afforestation was carried out by farmers.  That occurred in a year when around 6,500 ha were planted.  In 2020, according to the figures we have received, about 24% of afforestation was carried out by farmers and this was in a year in which around 2,500 ha were planted.  The removal of the farmer premium appears to be a particular issue that needs to be addressed.  Do our guests have a position on that?  </p> <p>  The second issue that has come up concerns the Natura impact statements, NIS.  This is an issue because they can be expensive but also because of the apparent new two-tier system put in place by the Department.  It allows those who can have an NIS carried out privately to be fast-tracked in the process so that they receive approval within two to three months, whereas this can take several years for those who cannot afford it privately.  As I understand it, the average cost of an NIS is about &euro;1,100 to &euro;1,300 per year.  Can the Department give clarification on this two-tier system?  Does it accept that it discriminates against smaller holdings and the participation of farmers in this scheme?  Does it have proposals to address this issue?</p><p>I understand a proposal has been made for a form of planning grant to be provided to private forestry applications from farmers.  Has that been given any consideration?</p><p> I note in the opening statement that last year approximately 34% of new planting was broadleaf.  This was a welcome increase from approximately 21% just three years ago.  It meant the 30% broadleaf planting target was met for the first time.  Do the officials accept that, to balance out years of historic failure in this regard, we need to substantially increase that percentage?  What measures are being put in place to encourage further development of broadleaf planting?  </p><p> Finally, with respect to the proposal from Bord na M&oacute;na for planting on their land.  We have seen in different parts of the country the disaster that has occurred when peatland is planted with forestry.  We have seen mudslides.  There is clearly a big question as to the environmental benefit of planting on peatland, which is quite a useful source of carbon sequestration.  There appears to be a problem in that much of the land used for afforestation is peripheral land.  Land that might be considered more premium has not been considered for forestry, either by private sources, local farmers or anybody else for that matter.  I ask the officials to give a view on how they could change that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#C00300"><p>We are here to build on the November session with the Minister.  As the Chairman said, our statement is taken as read.  It does contain some important updates and I am delighted that it has been circulated and obviously will feature in the transcript as well.  There have been a number of updates across forestry since November, which does not seem that long ago.  The Chairman has asked us to focus today on licensing and ash dieback and we will do that.</p> <p>  I counted five questions altogether from Deputy Carthy.  Please remind me if I miss one but I will try and deal with them as they arose.  </p> <p>  The first question is on why planting rates are below the approvals rate.  As the Deputy pointed out, approximately 4,300 ha were approved in 2019 and only approximately 2,400 ha planted.  There are a number of explanations.  The highest months for approvals came at the end of the year and we expect these licences to have a three-year duration.  Some of this planting will inevitably take place this year but once we grant the licence, it is at the discretion of the landowner and the forestry company as to whether they wish to proceed.  There is an issue, which we have flagged previously, with the low conversion rate from approvals to planting, which does not happen in felling and roads.  Usually approximately 60% of all hectares approved end up being planted.  That is something that is in everybody's interest to resolve given the difficulties there are right now in the processing of a licence.</p> <p>  Our figures would show that the sector has just under 5,000 ha at its disposal, which are completely out of appeals.  Inevitably, landowners will change their minds.  I am sure the delay in issuing licences has played its part.  We would hold our hands up on that.  There are a number of factors but there is almost a need to talk to landowners and companies individually as to the exact reasons.  As we have said, it is certainly our goal, and it should be everybody's goal, to drive up the conversion rate of number of hectares approved to number of hectares planted, and to make it almost one for one if we can, although we accept some fall-off.</p><p>The issue of the farmer premium and non-farmer premium has arisen.  There was a decision taken in the current forestry programme to flatten those into one level.  As Deputy Carthy rightly points out, it has caused the previous ratio to disappear.  There are now more people who plant classified as non-farmers than farmers.  This is an issue.  The last thing we want to see is farmers disengaging from afforestation.  We absolutely see them as central and core to planting.  They are the biggest landowners.  As many people point out, forestry offers a fantastic alternative land use for farmers and an alternative and secure income as well, so we want to see them engaged.  It would be a huge pity if that was not the case.  Ultimately, on the question of whether there should be a distinction between the non-farmer and farmer rate, we have extended the current forestry programme but we are kicking off the drafting of a new national forest strategy.  I have no doubt this will be one of the issues but that is probably the place for it to be discussed.  At its heart, we want farmers to be engaged as well.</p><p> The question of a planning grant is something that was recommended in the Mackinnon report last year.  As I noted in the opening statement, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has commissioned Jo O'Hara, an external consultant, to advise her on the implementation of the Mackinnon report.  I am fairly certain that is something that will feature there.  We set out our stall in terms of dealing with this crisis last summer.  We made it clear that dealing with volume was what this sector needed to stabilise things.  The number of licences does not always equate to volume, be it hectares or kilometres.  A good quality NIS that comes in from an applicant makes our life easier.  If one's side is screened in, there are two ways in which one can have it dealt with.  A good quality NIS coming in is something that helps us.  We flagged that up and interested applicants availed of that.</p><p> There is a question on broadleaf planting.  We welcome the increase to 34% last year.  That did not come about by accident, but as a result of targeted policy changes.  Many members of the committee will be aware of the midterm review of the forestry programme in 2018 when we got a significant increase of approximately 8% in the rates for broadleaf grants and premiums.  We have developed a number of other initiatives.  As members of the committee may have seen, last week the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, participated in an initiative with Aldi, which wants to plant 1 million native trees in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the woodland environmental fund.  It is a public-private model.  A number of initiatives have taken the rate of broadleaf planting from 21% to 34%.</p><p> I will go back to the point on the national forest strategy.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has made it quite clear that native woodlands and broadleaf trees must play a bigger role.  The policy forum for discussing that will be the national forest strategy.  It is definitely on the right road.  It has taken a sharp increase, which is very much related to the policy changes that have been made.  Farmers, to their credit, and forestry companies have responded.  We are very pleased with that.</p><p> Deputy Carthy's final question was on planting on peatlands and the role of Bord na M&oacute;na.  The Department is certainly aware that Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte are collaborating on a potential, very significant, native woodland project to plant native woodlands on former cutaway bogs.  At face value, it is something we absolutely support because it is very clear that if we are to achieve the planting targets set out in the climate action plan and the programme for Government, we are going to need all landowners to plant trees.  I refer not just to farmers, but to public bodies with big tracts of land as well.  Of course, the planting of native woodlands on peatlands will be done with full environmental compliance at its heart.  We know that Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na are working on an environmental impact assessment which we expect to receive in the near future.  There is no question of this being planted without the full environmental rigours being applied.  If it is not suitable, it is not suitable.  If it is suitable, it would be fantastic but it is an open question at the moment.  We wait to see what the environmental impact assessment, EIA, will show us.</p><p>I hope I have answered Deputy Carthy's questions.</p></speech>

I ask that the answers could be kept fairly brief because there is a huge number of questions to be asked by the committee members.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are a long way off hitting the targets we set six months ago.  I would like to see a focus.  The question was asked as to why there has been a huge drop in farmers planting trees.  We will go back to that because we have two hours to deal with everything.  Why farmers are deserting afforestation is an issue that must be addressed today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#E00300"><p>I will ask some individual questions for the officials in my five minute slot.  The weekly dashboard in November shows that the Department issued only 84 private licences.  That does not reflect the Department's target of reaching 200 files.  In November, the committee was informed that 16 ecologists had been hired and at the time there were 84 files on hand.  Each ecologist was dealing with five files per month or one file per week.  How much are the extra ecology resources costing the Department and the taxpayer?  I do not believe there is good value for the taxpayer here, particularly when one considers the number of ecologists versus the number of files being processed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#E00500"><p>I will clarify for the Deputy.  We have three strands to our licensing programme.  There is the Coillte strand and then there are two different categories of licence.  The Deputy referred to November when 84 files came off the project plan.  There were, however, 91 other private licences that also issued in November.  These did not go near the ecology private plan.  That is 175 licences for the private sector for the month of November.  I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify that.  The project plan is one subset of the overall licences and the average of about 300 licences per month since October is made up of Coillte, private ecology and private non-ecology.  In private licence terms, when one combines the two for the month of November, it was some 175 licences.</p> <p>  There is no question that those figures would not have been achieved without the input of the resources and the additional ecologists.  The starting salary for an ecologist is approximately &euro;32,000, but I would have to check that figure for the Deputy.  This might give the committee an indication of the costs involved.  There is no way we were going to get from the base where we were to 300 licences a month without that investment in resources.  As an investment it is growing.  The committee will receive our dashboard on Monday for the month of January, but I expect the figure for January to be somewhere around 350 licences.  Again, this dwarfs anything we did in any month last year.  It is a process of continual improvement.  Ecologists come in, they must be trained and they have to get up to speed.  When they do get up to speed, it starts to come through.  It is from October, November and December onward that we start to see the benefit.  The onus is on us to take that to the next level for the remainder of the year.</p></speech>

I was going to touch on the matter.  At the rate of one file per week per ecologist, as we are seeing currently, how long will it take to clear the backlog?</p><p>I presume the ecologists are costing big money.  As taxpayers and committee members we want to see a larger turnover of files.  The current rate of turnover of files is not good value for money.  It was mentioned that there was a great deal of work involved.  How long will it take to clear the current backlog based on the rate at which files are currently being processed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#F00200"><p>To be clear, the 16 ecologists are spread across the strands of the licensing.  Some of them are working on Coillte licences and others on private licences.  In regard to the 300 licences, the output is a mix of the output across the 16 ecologists.  In the context of a sector that is worth &euro;2 billion annually to the economy and is in crisis, it is an investment that is absolutely essential in our view.  In this day and age, it is not possible to function without ecology resources being at the heart of everything we do.  That applies to the forestry companies as much as it applies to us.</p> <p>  In terms of the question, we have about 1,900 licences in what we classify as our ecology backlog.  We have set ourselves targets this year which will involve clearance of that backlog by the end of the year.  That is a massive challenge.  We would hope to have the capacity to do more in terms of files that are screened in for ecology.  In overall terms, we processed about 2,500 licences last year.  We would be very hopeful that we can process somewhere in the region of 4,500 licences this year, which will be an 80% increase on licences issued in the last year.  That is a massive challenge.  I cannot underestimate the challenge when it comes to an individual licence.  Part of the work in regard to the 4,500 licences will involve the clearing of the backlog of files on the ecology work list in addition to the private files which do not go near ecology and the Coillte files as well.  I hope this gives the Deputy and the committee an indication of where we see the broad outlook for the year.</p></speech>

He mentioned that there are a number of them within Coillte.  Is that the reason Coillte is getting more applications through than are coming through for the private sector?  I ask Mr. Hayes to have a look at that and come back to me on it.</p> <p>  What is the administrative cost to the Department in 2021 to achieve 2,300 ha?  If Mr. Hayes does not have that information available to him today, he might come back to me or the committee on it.  </p> <p>  I am conscious that other members are waiting to get in.  The industry stakeholders have submitted a very detailed and costed proposal to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to help alleviate the ecology crisis.  I have read the MacKinnon report.  The industry stakeholder recommendation is also in the MacKinnon report.  It is clear from the dashboard that committee members receive on a weekly basis that the current approach is not working and will not work.  Has the Department and the witnesses as officials considered the proposal from the stakeholders and advised in the MacKinnon report?  If so, is it proposed to implement it or leave it to one side?  What is the plan in that regard?</p></speech>

First, there are approximately 150 staff in the Department who work on forestry at any one time.  I am not sure if we have a breakdown of costs because they vary across grades, structures and roles but that will give the Deputy an idea of the number of people working on forestry.  I will do my best to get those costs for the Deputy.</p> <p>  We hold up our hands that while there has been substantial progress, it is very uneven and afforestation is not progressing the way we or the stakeholders would like it to be progressing.  It is also not progressing in the way that felling or roads are progressing.  I do not make any bones about that.  We do not try to pretend that it is progressing the way we want it to progress.  It needs to be a clear focus this year.  Evening out that progress would be a good thing by bringing everybody up to enjoy some of the benefits that we have seen in felling that have not been seen on afforestation.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the MacKinnon report, which I touched on in response to Deputy Carthy.  The Minister has commissioned an external consultant to advise on the implementation of MacKinnon.  We expect that report to be with the Minister at the end of February.  It will also be sent to the Minister's new forestry policy group, which includes the stakeholders.</p><p>I cannot say for certain but I would expect that Jo O'Hara's report will touch on that, how it might work and the merits of a planting grant, as it has been called.  I reserve judgement on that.  We do not have any view for or against.  We will wait to see what the report brings at the end of next month.</p></speech>

I stated at the previous committee meeting in December that this strategy is absolutely killing off the private sector.  I come from the private sector and worked there for many years.  We will see the loss of more jobs.  I stressed the last day that millions of trees will be dumped and destroyed that the private sector have put in place to meet the afforestation targets.  Through no fault of that sector, it will have to dump trees if 2021 is in any way similar to 2019 or 2020.  The Department says it hopes to meet its targets but, given the importance of deforestation and considering the Government's climate change commitments, why are afforestation licences being sacrificed as the Department fails to deliver enough licences overall?  To achieve the 8,000 ha of afforestation, how many licences for planting would the Department need to issue weekly when the existing conversion rates from approval to planting are considered?  I am sure the witnesses, as officials, will have that worked out.</p></speech>

We are roughly meeting only 20% of those targets now.  It is a serious issue.  I welcome the Department's target for 4,500 licences this year and we will monitor that closely.  Deputy Kehoe raised afforestation.  Will Mr. Hayes give as concise answer as he can because many other members are looking to come in?</p></speech>

I go back to the original point.  The conversion rate is a concern and the sector has just under 5,000 ha available to it now, but I appreciate not all landowners may want to go ahead with a licence that has been received.  However, it is there and it has gone through the system.  It behoves us all to ensure that every licence application that comes in is a viable one.  In proportional terms, we received 3,300 applications last year.  We get about double the amount in felling that we get in afforestation.  We are not going to get a one-for-one output.  The Deputy is correct to point out that afforestation has been a bit behind the curve.  It is a concern to us because we are well aware of the Government's commitments and afforestation targets.  Nobody wants to see a 2021 that is like 2020.  That is absolutely sure.  We will do everything we can to make sure that is not the case.</p></speech>

It must annoy somebody in the private sector when they see the licences of Coillte going through and it is highlighted in the witnesses' statement.

That is part of their job.  Forestry inspectors do the initial screening.  Sometimes they get advice from our ecologists before concluding that.  Our standard operating procedure, SOP, is in the public domain and tables around the standard operating procedure, which we issue to the trade that highlight this, are in the public domain.  The companies in the sector know our screening procedures.  The initial screening is done by the district inspectors.</p></speech>

For instance, Roscommon will have a licensing inspector - a district inspector - and they hold the file.  They will consult with the archaeologist if there is an archaeological site or monument present.  The Department has in-house archaeologists.  The inspector will get advice from them and will get an archaeology report and if that states one must stay 20 m or 30 m back, the inspector will co-operate.  The district inspector is the person who integrates the advice, whether it is from an ecologist or archaeologist.

Realistically, we are not going to receive 14,000 ha worth of applications in a year.  We are not going to be in a position to approve those so the onus is on everybody to get that 60% figure up.  In other words, if 8,000 ha is what is needed to be planted, that requires 9,000 ha of approvals, for example, in a year.  The days of the speculative application are gone given all of the difficulties involved in approving a licence.  We want to increase that 60% figure as high as possible.  I am sure the companies want to increase it also because it is an investment on their part.  Everybody has skin in this game and I believe we all want to see the same outcome.</p></speech>

It is probably more now because of the backlog.  It is not an agri-environment scheme.  There is no set deadline.  Applications come in every day and licences are issued every day.  It is like the Passport Office or the National Driver Licence Service.  It is a continuous service.

When we presented our project plan to the sector last July, for example, the figure was in the region of 1,750 but it clearly said that this is the cohort of files which are on the ecology backlist.  It does not include Coillte.  It does not include files which are not screened in for ecology.  The Deputy will see that every month in terms of the licences that are issued.  If there was a misrepresentation on my part, I put my hands up but there was absolutely no misleading of the committee and we clarified that as quickly as we could afterwards.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Hayes agree?</p></speech>

If we look at the afforestation licences that issued this morning, some of the applications would have come in four or five weeks ago.  I do not regard those as being stuck in the system.  Absolutely not.  These are applications that came in and were processed and the licences were issued as quickly as they possibly could be.  One has to wait at least a minimum of 30 days.  Of course, there will be some applications that would go back to last year, some going back to 2019, and unfortunately there may even be some dating back to 2018, but the phrase "stuck in the system" does not relating to something that is applied for and issued one or two months later.  There are examples of those kinds of licences being issued every month.</p></speech>

We gave approximate figures in the opening statement, which I can clarify now.  There are 4,436 licences on hand in the Department for processing, of which 2,705 are for felling, 691 are for roads and 1,040 are for afforestation.</p></speech>

In November and December, 541 licences were issued, of which 116 were afforestation, 58 were roads and 367 were felling.  In the same period, 499 came into the Department.  That is a difference of 42.  Even if we go on the basis of the 200 that the Department has gained from its own interpretation, from reading the submission would I be correct in saying that to get on top of this fiasco we are looking at six years.  Would it be fair to say that if the Department gained 200 in three months and if there are that number of licences in the system, as well as those that are still coming in, it would be six years before we get on top of it?</p></speech>

It is a continually changing block of new applications coming in and licences going out.  We will never reach a point when we are at zero.  That would be impossible.  It would be like coming into work in the morning at saying that there is no work on the desk for the day.  There is always work there that has to be done.  If we ever reach a point where we are at zero, I will have a lot of forestry inspectors and ecologists with nothing to do and it will be a real crisis then because it would mean there would be nothing coming in by way of application.  The figure was 4,700 back in October.  We have issued 1,200 licences since then but these are replaced by some 900 new applications.  That is the way it works and the way it will continue.</p></speech>

What figure would this be down to instead of 4,500 or 4,600?</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to look at it this way; if I had applied in October, I would have seen that the Department had 4,700 applications on its books and that 1,200 of those people have got licences from us since then.  It depends on what way one looks at the figures.  As I said earlier, the 300 licences per month is not a figure to our satisfaction and we have set ourselves a goal of 4,500 licences this year.  It is, however, a moveable feast.  We are well aware that there are commitments in the Forestry Acts, for example, four months for a felling licence, which is absolutely where we want to get to.  We are not there yet; we are probably a long way away from it.  Three months for an afforestation licence would be a very good outcome also.  That is absolutely where we want to get to.  As the Deputy said, however, there was a massive crisis and we are doing our best to eat into what is there, but the progress has to be approved.</p></speech>

I am a farmer.  I presume the Department will accept that if farmers are waiting two or three years for decisions, they would move on to something else.</p><p>I presume the witnesses accept that.  In the past year, were they instructed by a Minister to prioritise Coillte applications?</p></speech>

There was prioritisation around volume to try to drive out the biggest licences in order to stabilise the sector.  Many jobs depended on us getting out a lot of volume.  The number of licences does not equate to volume.  Rightly or wrongly, that was the strategy we adopted in the various project plans.  For certain, it is not a long-term sustainable strategy but we are not leaving anybody behind.</p></speech>

I would like to revisit some of the responses given to Deputy Fitzmaurice, which I do not accept.  We are going nowhere if that is the quality of responses we are going to be given.  It was stated that the number has been reduced from 4,700 to 4,500 since October.  Like Deputy Fitzmaurice, while Deputy Keogh was speaking I did the sums.  Giving the Department the benefit of the doubt at every corner by rounding off to its advantage, it is going to take 5.35 years before we reach parity.  If we are to reach anywhere near 8,000 ha, the volume of afforestation applications which are due to come in to meet that target will have to increase.  I do not accept the answer given.</p> <p>  There is a further question posed by Deputy Fitzmaurice in respect of which I do not accept the answer, that is, how long it takes for a licence to get through the system.  With the permission of Deputy Fitzmaurice, I will rephrase that question.  What is the target set by the Department for the length of time it should take for a licence to go through the system?  I ask the witnesses to please not respond to the effect that the Department does not set targets.  Without targets, nothing can be achieved.  I would like those questions to be answered more definitively.  </p> <p>  I would also like to comment on the statement that the Department is now prioritising by volume.  In my opinion, that discriminates against small individual holdings because by virtue of the size of volume the large international operators and Coillte will have the largest volumes.  If that is now our philosophy, we are heading for a major car crash.  If we are cherry picking large volume to keep the industry supplied with timber, then when we run out of large applications and have to return to the small ones we will be faced with a major shortfall in the supply of timber to businesses down the line.  It will be on record that the Department was the cause of that, if that is the approach it is taking.</p> <p>  I have a final question in regard to ash dieback, in respect of which I would welcome a brief comment from the witnesses.  The opening statement states that over 250 applications have been submitted and that the Department has communicated directly with the majority of the applicants and the remainder will receive notification this week.  I would like clarification on whether that communication is just an acknowledge of receipt or if any action is being taken.  I have been contacted by a number of people who have applied for the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, and have received only an acknowledgement of that application.  There has been no action and there does not appear to be any plan of action for them going forward.</p></speech>

Working off those figures, that means 3,600 of the 4,700 licences will be gone by this October so 12 months on and not five years.  Those licences will be replaced by new ones and we will deal with those when they come in.  We are not satisfied with an output of 3,600 licences for the year.  We have upped the figure to 4,500 licences which will mean that more or less see everything that was in with us last October will be gone.</p></speech>

I think that there is a commitment in the farmers' charter as well of a target of four months for felling licences and three months for afforestation licences.  We do not claim to meet those targets and I touched on that already with Deputy Fitzmaurice.  The Mackinnon report  recommends the drafting of a new customer charter.  A charter would be timely, set targets and review them again but we are not meeting them.  There will be some people who will get their licences in less than three or four months if it is a straightforward licence but there will be people who will have to wait longer.  Obviously it is the question of the people who must wait longer that troubles us the most.</p></speech>

If that information was on the dashboard then we could see how many of the licences issued were in the system.  That would be a good barometer for us to see how efficiently the licence system is operating.</p></speech>

Every licence application that comes in whether it is from Coillte or a private applicant is very much treated in the same way in terms of the environmental assessment and public consultation.  Rightly or wrongly, given the imminent threat to jobs in the entire forestry sector last summer, we prioritised volume.</p><p>We presented that to the sector.  My interpretation was that it was on board with that and saw it as something that should be in place as a short-term solution.  We do not view it as anything more than a short-term solution either, but I believe it was needed.  When we are trying to knock a mountain, we try to chip off as many big blocks as we can.</p><p> There is one figure that surprises people.  Of the 5 million cu. m of timber issued last year under felling licences, some 2.7 million cu. m was for Coillte and 2.3 million cu. m was private.  It is a 52% to 48% breakdown, not the divide that people assume.  That has continued into January and that is the way we want to continue.  We certainly do not want to leave anyone behind.  That was a strategy at a point in time but it is certainly not a long-term strategy - that is for sure.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the pace of licensing and decisions from the forestry appeals committee is nowhere near where it needs to be.  This is the key to addressing the short-term supply issue that continues to decimate the industry, especially sawmills such as Grainger sawmills in west Cork, which employs up to 500 people.  Some 2,700 licences were issued by the Department in 2020.  The figure needs to be closer to 5,000 this year to meet industry requirements.  The numbers need to increase further in the long term.  As noted, some 2,700 licences were issued by the Department last year but the industry requirement is for 5,000 every year as well as dealing with the backlog.  Some 400 of the licences issued by the Department were appealed and there are still 400 in the forestry appeals committee.</p> <p>  I have several questions.  We have a full-scale emergency impacting the entire forestry and timber industries.  It poses an ongoing threat to the future of 12,000 jobs throughout Ireland, including 500 jobs in Grainger sawmills.  This is a priority for me and my constituents as well as the many farmers who are without licences and cannot cut down trees or get the raw materials that sawmills need to operate.  This is the question I need answered.  As I outlined, the industry requirement is for 5,000 or more licences per year.  How many licences will the Department issue in 2021?  It issued 2,000 licences last year.</p> <p>  There is a backlog of files in the Department and it is going nowhere.  There seems to be no plan for getting through it.  Will the Department write to each applicant in respect of each file and give the applicant a clear statement of where the file is, what will happen with it and when?  Does the Department accept that its current system is simply not able to cope with demands placed on it by the sector?  Should the Department not realise that it needs to change its system and processes if it is to meet the needs of the sector and allow it to function formally?  Will the Department admit that ordinary people - farmers, forest owners and wood processors - have heavily invested throughout the country and are being let down by the system?  These people cannot fell their crops or plant trees.  Can the Department give these people any reassurance around their needs?</p> <p>  There is a related issue in respect of the horticulture of peat.  Can limited extraction licences for peat be granted immediately?  Can Bord na M&oacute;na and others be directed to work with the forestry industry to use international experience on the preparation of bark and nursery stock production use?  Can supports and education be provided to the nursery industry immediately to allow transition to alternative growing as a matter of priority?  We are looking at importing peat from Scotland, Norway and further afield as well as other materials like core from south east Asia, with terrible environmental consequences.  There are several questions there but I would appreciate if we could get answers to them.</p></speech>

I will address the final question first.  Horticulture and peat are not my areas but I will take a note of the question and ask someone to respond to the Deputy directly.</p> <p>  We have set out our stall on the main question.  For this year, we see ourselves increasing by 80% the number of licences issued compared with last year, which was not a good year.</p><p>I have set a figure of 4,500 licences for the year as our output.  It really depends on the volume that those licences hold but in previous years the number of licences issued by the Department is usually between 4,000 and 5,000.  It was a bit higher in 2019 but that figure was skewed by a large number of Coillte thinning licences.  Our target is an 80% increase on last year.  I could not possibly underestimate the challenge in getting that out.  However, the improvement since October has given us hope that we can get there and certainly there is no effort being spared in investment in resources.  We went back to the market last week for more ecologists.  Every new person means more output and we want to continue that.  </p><p> We started the year as we mean to go on, with 350 licences in January.  That is 830,000 tonnes of timber which I think will be the end of month figure.  If it is, that is a very solid start to the year and one we would like to drive on.  That is our target and strategy for the year.  I would think that Grainger's and the people the Deputy referenced would be pleased if, by December, I was reporting figures of that order.</p></speech>

It would be a huge task for people that might otherwise be processing licences.  Licences do move.  I could write to people today but their licence could be in very different position next week.  However, good communication is something that we value.  We set up a direct project management unit last year where people can make direct contact if they are looking for progress on their licence.  I certainly encourage them to avail of that.  I will certainly review the Deputy's question and see what is possible.</p></speech>

I have been hearing from the industry that we are dealing with a scenario in which Coillte has gone from having anything up to ten auctions per year to only two last year.  The first one so far this year will be in the first quarter.  The lack of timber going through the system is a huge issue for confidence in the industry.  One of the biggest issues the Department has is to try to get confidence back into the sawmills, the growers and the hauliers because there is a huge issue of confidence there unfortunately.</p> <p>  I wish to look at issues regarding licences not relating to Coillte but involving ecology.  I have looked at figures over the last week.  The Department set out a quota plan last June that could have put a licensing stream in place for what it considered to be a crisis.  On that stream, which was to be licences excluding Coillte but involving ecology, the Department proposed: 75 licences in August, of which 56 were delivered; 120 in September, of which 60 were delivered; 140 in October, of which 79 were delivered; 200 in November, of which 84 were delivered; and 200 in December, of which 60 were delivered. This meant that only 60% of the Department's targets were hit in that category.  That is a huge issue because it leaves approximately 1,900 or 2,000 licences in that backlog.  It is a huge issue as to how to clear that backlog.</p> <p>  I take it that the Department is saying that the entire backlog is going to be cleared in the next 12 months and that the 1,900 licences in that category are going to be cleared by 1 December 2021.  That is a really significant step because form has shown, unfortunately, that the Department has delivered approximately 50% of what it previously said it had delivered.  Can I get an assurance from the Department that it is guaranteeing that the entire backlog will be cleared by the end of this year?</p></speech>

They are the most complex files for a reason.  It is because they are screened in.  They require far more in-depth analysis than any other type of licence but we are well aware there are files on that list that have been there for too long.  As part of the 4,500 licences we hope to issue this year, cleaning out that list is certainly one of our priorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012900002#P00300"><p>In June last year, the Department presented its  plan for processing forestry licences, laying out the key performance indicators that it would achieve from June 2020 into early 2021.  A major focus of that was the extra staff it would hire.  We are now seven months into the plan.  Why are we only hitting 46% of the targets for private licences when it keeps telling us about its additional resources?  Meanwhile, 60% of felling licences were issued to Coillte.  While it maintains it wants to enable the delivery of higher output, should it not rethink its approach and bring more equality to the situation of the private operators?</p> <p>  When we talk about felling licences, is it not the case that there was a lower number of felling applications in 2020 than in previous years?  In 2017, there were 3,300; 2018, 5,900; 2019, 3,300; and 2020, 1,700.  There is poor performance even with the lower application numbers and the increased staff.  Can the Department account for that?  Who has overall responsibility for the targets it has set?</p> <p>  On the presentation of data we keep getting, the volume system is completely misleading as the Department is also double-counting the volume.  Following the commencement of the Forestry Act 2014, forestry owners are able to apply for multiple harvest events on the same forest plot in a felling licence application.  However, when this information is being reported in the tables provided, any area that has been applied for thinning and clearfell has been included in each column.  For example, if a 10 ha block is applied for thinning in 2020 and clearfell in 2025, those 10 ha will be registered as 10 ha in the thinning column, 10 ha in the clearfell column and 20 ha in the total column.  A 10 ha licence application is presented by the Department as a 20 ha official license area.</p> <p>  When a farmer is forced into an unthin management system due to delays getting either a forest road or a felling licence from the Department, it means that farmer has no income for their forest until they clearfell.  The earnings from the timber crop will be reduced by 10,000 per hectare.  Is the Department going to compensate farmers for the loss of earnings incurred?</p> <p>  Why, when the committee asked for a total number of licences backlog, was the Department selective in the figures it produced and referenced only those in ecology?</p> <p>  I have a couple of quick observations on ash dieback.  Under the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, applicants must now get planning permission from the county council where a landowner wishes to replace their diseased ash crop.  Under the previous scheme, any replacement conifers up to 10 ha did not require planning permission.  Under SI 45 of 2020, the replacement of any area of broadleaf forests with conifer species requires an application to the local authority and its approval before works can commence.  Could the Department not be the single consenting authority?  There needs to be an urgent amendment to the legislation to rectify that issue and to speed it up.  From talking to different organisations and stakeholders, the RUS in its current form is drafted in a way that ignores the fact all ash trees will eventually succumb to the disease.   This is apparent in the aid given under the scheme.  For example, if a forest has 10% infection, then 10% of the aid is all the owner can avail of.  These are suggestions coming from the stakeholders.</p><p>Could it be that the answer is reform of the reconstitution and underplanting scheme by: grant aid for 100% clearfell of all ash plantations; grand aid for the replanting of a new crop; doubling the premium period from 15 to 30 years on all replanted sites; offering compensation to the value of the crop at the time of the clearfell; and offering the option not to replant?  The Department officials may wish to give us a written reply on the dieback questions but I will take a reply on the other matters now.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the replacement of broadleaf high forest with conifer species and planning permission.  In general, forestry activities are exempt from planning permission.  There is an exception where there is replacement of broadleaf high forest with conifer species over 10 ha.  The over 10 ha caveat is in the Schedules to the Planning Acts.  In particular Schedule 2 to Part 3 of the regulations deals with replacement of broadleaf high forest with conifer species and states, "The area involved shall be less than 10 hectares".  There is nothing we can do about it if the area is over 10 ha as it is in the Planning Acts.  If the area is under 10 ha and it is screened in for appropriate assessment, it will also require planning permission.</p> <p>  I have taken a note of the other questions and we can include written responses to those.  I can give more details on the planning permission situation as well.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that there absolutely is not.  The volume figure is calculated.  The sector will be well aware of it because it is a transparent methodology.  Coillte operates all clearfell and it provides the volume figure for its own sites, because it is in a position to do so.  For private sites we assume a figure of 330 cu. m per hectare where the site is clearfelled and 70 cu. m per hectare where it is thinned.  However, if it is a thinning-only licence, it gets 70 cu. m.  If it is a felling-only licence, it gets 330 cu. m.  If it is a felling and thinning licence, we only include the clearfell figure.  If anything, we are on the conservative side because the site will yield more timber over the lifetime of its licence.  If anything, we are underestimating the figure.  We are absolutely and definitely not overstating it.  If it is helpful, I can put this methodology in writing to the committee afterwards.</p> <p>  The other question that Deputy Browne raised was around felling applications in the past year and why the figures were different to previous years.  He is absolutely correct to pick up on that.  That largely comes down to Coillte.  Coillte will generally apply for felling licences in a batch application.  Coillte did not do much of that last year but we expect such an application to come in soon, most probably for the Coillte 2022 programme.  It is not like the private licences, where there is a steady input of licence applications every week.  The inputs and outputs from Coillte applications and licences can skew the figures in any one year.  It is important to bear that in mind when studying the figures.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question on why the figures in 2020 were a little different to other years.</p></speech>

Seven months into the plan we are still only at 46% coming near the end of the year and there was a similar percentage in June last year.  What is the delay?  Given the presence of all the extra staff and with fewer licences being applied for, why are we only at 46% at this stage?</p></speech>

This is one subset of our overall licensing output.  We are clear that it has not met our targets and it has certainly not met the targets of the stakeholders.  It is our first priority to redouble the efforts for 2021.</p> <p>  I will point out that this is not the only source of licences for the private sector.  In fact, over the same period the sector got more licenses that never went near ecology than those that went on to ecology.  The figure the committee members are seeing is only half of what the private sector gets.  Clearly, with this particular cohort of private licences with ecology input, the project planner is not where we want it to be and it absolutely has to be a focus of priority for 2021.</p></speech>

Who has the overall responsibility for not reaching targets?  This applies to any business, whether a small corner shop, a steelworks or a carpentry or joinery business.</p><p>If someone does not take responsibility for not reaching targets, nothing gets done.  We are getting reports continuously and they show that we are not reaching targets.  Who has overall responsibility for setting the targets and when those targets are not met?  Who has that responsibility for the targets the Department is setting and presenting to us every month or week?</p></speech>

I am equally upfront that we are not meeting that particular project plan of the private licences.  However, in terms of overall targets for felling we have issued licences for 2.8 million cu. m since last October.  People have to view the disappointing output on the project plan relative to the overall substantial improvement since last October.  We have had an excellent January or what is looking to be a good January across most categories - afforestation could be better for sure.  Now, we need a good February followed by a good March, because we have had a good October followed by a good November followed by a good December.  We hold our hands up on the private category.  As I said, no effort is being spared to get it right.</p></speech>

How do they explain to manufacturers that we cannot cut timber because of felling licences?</p> <p>  The second question is to the Department.  How does the Department explain to forestry nurseries that we are behind on our targets and that the Department and the Government are not reaching their targets?  We are in a situation now where they will have to dump millions of trees.  The nurseries were told the Department would meet its targets.  How can we explain to these people that we have to get rid of these trees now?  They were ready for selling or producing but they now have to be dumped.</p> <p>  I have been frustrated with the Department for the past two years.  I do not blame people.  I have listened to all the speakers.  I do not blame farmers and people who do not plant in this country because they are so frustrated with what is going on.  I know an elderly couple who want to get their affairs in order.  They regret the day they ever got involved in forestry.  They have been waiting three years - since 2019.  I have been in contact with the Department on this case, including in writing, and I have tabled questions in the D&aacute;il.  I will not call out the reference number now but I will email it after this meeting.  I am asking Mr. Hayes to personally investigate this matter to see what is going on.  This is not acceptable.  The reference number is from 2019 and it is now 2021.  These people are so frustrated that they would love to get out of forestry.  They are caught in a contract with a private company and cannot get out, but they want to get out.  We want a decision on this particular case.  I would like the official to answer these questions for me.</p></speech>

Deputy Ring may wish to send on the reference code.  The Deputy has my details.</p> <p>  The answer to the overall question is more or less the same as before.  There is no question but that 2020 was a very bad year for licensing.  We did 2,400 licences, which is 80% below what it should be relative to previous years.  The target now has to be to ensure that 2020 becomes a stand-alone bad year and one not to be repeated.  That is the position.  In quarter 4 of 2020, we saw a significant improvement on the previous three quarters and that progress has continued into January.  We now need it to continue into February and March.</p> <p>  We do not want to see logs being imported.  There is plenty of timber in the country to be harvested.  I appreciate that in giving our figure of 2.8 million cu. m of timber licensed from October to January, there is a timeline between licensing and when that timber arrives at the sawmill door.  However, all we can do is license it and get the licences out there.  The dashboard shows that there has been a noticeable pick-up since October.  We need to drive that on.  There is no question about that.  We were in a particular bind in 2020 and we were hit hard with several court judgments that were hanging over us in 2019.</p><p>A large number of forestry appeals had to be serviced, which obviously meant that what was licensed could not make it to market.  We have a much more efficient and functioning appeals system.  We have cranked up the licensing system, but it still has some way to go.  The message I would impart to the sector is to stick with us and to keep looking at the figures because they are improving.  I would not like to see any farmer completely dissuaded from working in forestry because if one looks at the challenges facing farming, afforestation offers everything in terms of farm diversification and an alternative, steady income.  That continues to be the case.  We need to get farmers re-engaged.  A fair bit has been done but there is a lot more to do.  That is the strategy for 2021.</p></speech>

Mr. Hayes said there was 830,000 cu. m or tonnes of fell.  Can we get the information on the dashboard?  If I am building a house, I have to send a commencement notice to the council to say I am starting to build.  Can we get an accurate figure of the amount of clear-fell timber?  The Department gives a licence to include the thinning and everything else, but can we get an accurate amount?  I refer to a scenario whereby the Department gives me a licence and I am at the 20-year stage.  Mr. Hayes is correct that the Department adds it all up.  I understand that but it could be ten more years before I would be cutting that, so the timber will not be fit for cutting this year.  Can we get an accurate figure on the dashboard for committee members or the public of the amount of clear-fell timber every month?  Is that possible?</p></speech>

We issue licences with a duration of up to ten years.  There are any number of reasons a landowner may decide to fell now or in two years' time, for example, income or the price of timber.  Landowners do not have to inform us when they plan to act on that but I believe they have to inform us when it is planned to plant.  Under afforestation we give technical and financial approval.  The system is designed to give landowners maximum flexibility and to minimise interaction and regulation, so it is up to landowners to decide when they want to bring the licence to market.  I tried to emphasise this point at the previous committee meeting in response to a question from Deputy Fitzmaurice.  We make no prediction around when the timber comes to market.  What we do is report on the volume of licences that we issue.</p></speech>

We do not know.  If I have a forest, I am going to thin it at the 20-year stage, and I might thin it again at year 24 or 25.  In fairness, 70% or 80% of the volume of clear-fell will not be ready until 2030.  We are not dealing with accurate figures and unless the Department brings in a system whereby a landowner sends a little note to say when clear-felling commences and the Department has a record, then we are dealing with figures from 20 or 30 years ago that we do not have a clue about.</p></speech>

I understand where he is coming from.  First, there could be thinning and then in five or ten years' time, it could be clear-felled.  I accept that it is a clear-fell licence and that thinning will also happen, but that timber is not available.  How does the industry know what is available today?  What we are doing is like going around in circles.</p></speech>

It is specified whether it is a thinning licence, a clear-fell licence or a combined thinning and clear-fell licence.  That goes right down to townland level.  We have a new portal via which any member of the public can view an individual licence and see whether it was for thinning, clear-fell or a combination of the two.  The lack of information that is there at the moment, as Deputy Fitzmaurice sees it, has not been an issue in the past because there has been a steady supply of licences and timber.  That steady supply was clearly interrupted last year because of a failure to issue as many licences as we would have liked.  Ultimately, by getting the system back on track and continuing with felling in the past four months and in January and continuing that through 2021, we will get the steady supply back again.  I do not envisage this being a continuous issue.  All we can report on in terms of a headline figure for the dashboard is the volume that we have licensed.  Each individual licence, which can provide more detail, is available from the Department.</p></speech>

There is no denying that the public and the industry have lost faith in the Department.  Every public representative hears it every day.  All of the industry has lost faith in the Department.  The national targets do not bother me, but that is what is set out under all these agreements.  The Department has reached approximately 53% or 54% of the targets in the past four years.  Mr. Hayes says the buck stops with him.  Is there not a serious problem in the Department that must be rectified, particularly when it has lost the confidence of the sector it is supposed to be working with and of farmers?  When one talks to farmers and one mentions planting, they throw their hands up in the air.  They say they would be better at anything other than that.  Do the officials not have a lot to answer for and is the Department not in serious bother?</p></speech>

I struggle to see how any planning system, no matter how well designed or resourced, could have recovered in the intervening period.  As to whether we could have done it faster or put in more resources, these are all arguable questions.  I am not saying that it is not the case, what I am saying is that the system has, unquestionably, improved, particularly since last October.  The new resources are coming on stream.  We are a forward looking organisation when it comes to this.  This year is about framing a new national forestry strategy.  Senator Lombard mentioned the key word, namely, "confidence".  We want to put confidence back into the sector.  We would like to think that the last few months have started to put a bit of that confidence back in.  We know that we have a long way to go, but nobody is more committed than this Department, right down through the forestry system, including the Ministers, who are engaging intensively with stakeholders, as are we.  It is all shoulders to the wheel to get this right.  I would like to think that the past few months have shown what is possible and what we can drive it on to achieve on the next level.</p></speech>

I was not a Deputy in 2011 or 2012 but I knew about the habitats directive and the 15-km zone.  I knew that the gate was left wide open if environmental impact assessment, screening and appropriate assessment were not implemented.  I do not agree with such measures.  I detest this stuff.  However, the Department stated on its website that those measures had to be implemented.  Mr. Hayes then says it was because of a court case.  To put it very simply, the court case happened because the gate was not closed by the Department.  If I was building a house in Galway right now - or ten or 11 years ago - I would have to carry out a screening exercise because of a river that is 40 miles away.</p><p>The Department has a ferocious amount of work to do to get the industry back.  I have spoken to people from all parts of the industry and they throw their hands up in the air about this Department.  It is sad, but it is true.</p></speech>

Deputy Kehoe asked a question at the last committee meeting the witnesses attended about the policy regarding unenclosed land and from where that policy was formulated.  The committee has not yet received an answer to that question.  It is a very important question about policy on forestry.  The question about unenclosed land was asked last November and I would like to get an answer to it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  My second question relates to ash dieback.  There are three bullet points here regarding ash dieback.  Unfortunately, in my constituency there is a great deal of ash dieback and many people are affected by it.  Has the Department any plans for any other financial assistance aside from what we see in these three bullet points?  This is clearly not a satisfactory response to the great financial loss the people concerned have incurred through no fault of theirs.  I will not start a big debate now about whose fault it was and how the disease got into the country, but the owners of the ash plantations were definitely not at fault for this disease inflicting major financial losses on them.</p> <p>  I am very unhappy today.  There is very intensive questioning taking place here and all I can tell the officials is that the reason we are applying such scrutiny is that, as public representatives, we are under great pressure from the forestry sector.  The sector is extremely worried about its future.  That ranges from nursery owners to timber contractors - everyone involved in the industry.  It is our job as public representatives to highlight that and to try to get resolutions to the issues.  We all want to see a forestry industry doing well and prospering.  It has a big role to play in respect of the climate change challenges we face.  At present, however, as was said by other speakers, there is a major lack of confidence there and all the committee is trying to do is highlight the issues that have been presented to members and try to come up with solutions to the issues on the ground.</p> <p>  Perhaps the officials will answer the two questions on ash dieback and the enclosed land policy first.  A few other members then wish to put questions.</p></speech>

We believe in full transparency.  That is why we developed dashboards and it is publicly available information.  We welcome that and welcome the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee at any time, or direct contact from any member of the committee at any time on any issue of relevance.</p> <p>  On ash dieback, we would be straying into areas of policy if we were to comment on the merits of the scheme or whether future policy is to be amended or considered.  It is a scheme that was introduced under the last Government.  It is what it is at present and, as officials, we are not in a position to comment on whether the scheme is good, bad or otherwise.  It is in place and there are some 250 applicants.  Our focus is very much on engaging with them and making sure they get their approvals as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Seamus Dunne to comment on the unenclosed land question and if there are outstanding elements to that, we can submit them in writing as well.</p></speech>

Land is defined by us in three categories - enclosed improved land, unenclosed land and lands not eligible for grant aid.  By and large, unenclosed lands are located in wetlands, mostly peatlands.  They are mainly too impoverished to be drained or fertilised by man or used for intensive farming.  In the past, a large number of plantations were located on unenclosed land.  They were used in the 1990s when up to 40% of lands were unenclosed lands.</p></speech>

There was an indication that it was EU policy and there was a clear assertion that this was not the case.  We would like to see written confirmation of how exactly this policy that unenclosed land cannot be planted was formulated.</p><p>It has completely devalued the land of people who own unenclosed land.  I would say it has devalued those people's property by up to 80%.  That was the question that was asked.  It is an important and serious question and we would like to have a detailed written answer to it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I have a serious concern about this and I can only imagine that if I was a farmer, a private individual who had a small application in at present, how he or she would be feeling on hearing this revelation today.  Based on the problems I foresee in using this system into the future, and it has now been made public today, I plead with the officials to approach the Minister to introduce an amnesty for applications that are in the system.  The Department can put a fixed period on it.  I refer to applications that do not require an ecological input and applications that are of a small volume.  We should implement an amnesty, clear the desk and start on a level playing field.  Then there will be no favouritism or cherry-picking into the future and we will be able to keep up to speed with the applications.  I plead with the officials to bring that forward to the Minister today, because we have opened a can of worms here by identifying the fact that licence applications are being cherry-picked based on volume.</p></speech>

In addition, the backlog is approximately 300 at present.  We are told by Coillte that this is the biggest issue it is facing to liberate timber that will have licences in 2021.  Since putting additional resources in place, the FAC has held 61 hearings and 42 hearings were scheduled for December, but the requirement is 40-plus appeals to be dealt with each week, not the 20 or so being done at present.  Will this increase in future?</p> <p>  Will the departmental officials admit there are ordinary people - farmers, forest owners and wood processors - who have heavily invested all over the country and who are being let down by the system?  These people cannot fell their crop and cannot plant trees.  Can they give them any reassurance about their needs and does it concur with Senator Paul Daly's suggestion of an amnesty, which is very important?</p></speech>

To put it into context, the committee received appeals regarding approximately 1,000 licences since it was established in 2018.  Of those, some 700 are closed and we now have 339 licences to be dealt with.  It is true that the committee was only hearing about 24 licences per month, but since the forestry Act was implemented in October there have been several changes, as members may be aware, to the running of the committee.  We now have four committees and they are averaging approximately 60 licence hearings every month.  This has had a very positive effect on the number of hearings held, and 191 cases have been heard since November.  The extra committees were established on 9 November.</p><p>It obviously took some time after the legislation was enacted to get the expertise and the appropriate people in place to set up new committees.  The number of licence applications now on hand, which is what concerns both appellants and applicants who are waiting for decisions, is 339.  Of those, 164 are already scheduled, including what is scheduled for January.  That leaves 175 licences to be scheduled.  The current rate of output by the committees is around 60, although they have advised us that this may improve, so we would expect that what is on hand at the moment will all be dealt with by June.  </p><p> It is also worth pointing out that the new legislation introduced several changes and one of the more positive ones was that the committee can now remit cases back to the Department.  This means that cases that might have been cancelled previously are now sent back to us to review and to issue a new decision on.  Since the enactment of the new legislation there have been 147 decisions, 82 of which were affirmed and 65 of which were set aside and remitted back to us.  </p></speech>

The target set for roads is 125 km licensed per year.  I am glad to say that we exceeded that target last year, with 130 km licensed.  That was down on the previous year but we have had a good start this year, with 20 km licensed in January compared to 5 km in the same month last year.  We are determined to drive on in that area.</p> <p>  To return to the question of prioritisation by volume, while there is such prioritisation, it is not exclusive.  I will point out that every day of the week, the inspectors in the Department are working on licences of all shapes and sizes.  It is open to any applicant, no matter what the size of the site, to submit an Natura impact statement, NIS, which, as we have made very clear, will bump him or her up the list.  Prioritisation based on volume is what comes next but we do deal with sites of all shapes and sizes every day of the week.  Last summer it was made clear to, and agreed with, the sector that this would be the approach.  As I said, it was a short-term solution to a very immediate problem.  It is a strategy that has worked in terms of driving more output, particularly on the roads and the felling but it is not a long-term, sustainable solution in our view.  I respectfully disagree with Senator Paul Daly; it is not the revelation that is being portrayed here today.  The prioritisation is known but is not exclusive in terms of individual sites and it is not an approach that we intend to continue with in the long term.  </p></speech>

It does not look to be legally feasible in the Department's view and the Minister has conveyed that to some stakeholders already.</p></speech>

What is the total number of licences required to serve the industry's demand?

What percentage of timber comes from Coillte and what percentage comes from the private sector?

According to the opening statement there are 1,090 afforestation applications, 730 road applications and 2,700 felling applications on hand.  Can the officials tell us the oldest application in each category?  When was the earliest application submitted in respect of those three categories?  Can they give us figures in hectares in respect of the afforestation and felling applications?  Those figures suggest to me that a very big alarm bell should be ringing because we have 2,700 felling applications but only a little over 1,000 afforestation applications on hand.  If we are proposing to move to a point where there are 8,000 ha planted per annum, then we should expect and hope that afforestation applications are ahead of the felling applications.  I ask the witnesses to explain the reason for that differential.</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne deals with inspectors and approving applications.  My remit includes making payments and providing support to the inspectorate in issuing licences.  I also deal with promotion, which is a difficulty at the moment, given the situation in which we find ourselves.  I have been in this position for the past two years and, as has been well articulated by Mr. Henry, the Department is dealing with an unprecedented challenge on foot of an unprecedented change to the way in which we do things.  I worked previously on the rural development side and know that we must always comply with the habitats directive.  I have seen first hand the effort involved on the inspectorate side in terms of training, guidance, recruiting ecologists and bringing in a robust system that will stand up to appeal.  The things we have tried to do in the last year in recruiting more ecologists and overhauling the appeals system, which was a great source of frustration for people who wanted to realise their licences, are bearing fruit now.</p><p>We have had only 50 appeals since the new legislation has come in, so we are well on the way to having a well-functioning appeals system.  I have confidence in my colleagues that we will deal with the backlogs.  It is a difficult and complex issue and all efforts are being made to address it.</p></speech>

I am not sure if we have a figure for the tonnage imported.  We can explore that.  I will let Mr. Dunne respond directly to the Brexit question.</p> <p>  As for the number of licences needed to achieve the targets, it is a stated goal of successive forestry programmes to try to increase the average size of a plantation applied for when it comes to afforestation.  People often draw comparisons with Scotland, but in Scotland it is not unusual to have sites that are a couple of hundred hectares when it comes to afforestation.  Our average is 6 ha.  I think we had a goal in the previous mid-term review to get that up to around 8 ha.  Working off that figure, and the annual figure being 8,000, we are looking at 1,000 to 1,500 applications.</p> <p>  Deputy Carthy asked a question which I think I have answered, but I wish to inform him that there were 4,436 licences on hand as of this morning.  We ran these figures again this morning.  They were 2,700 for felling, 1,691 for roads and 1,040 for afforestation.  That is a slight update on the statement before the committee because we ran the figures just before coming in this morning.</p> <p>  May I make just one further comment?

To respond to the Deputy's question about the oldest licence application, I am working this off a page here, but it looks to me that about 40% of the licences issued last year were also applied for last year.  Some were applied for in 2019, some in 2018.  Looking, for example, at the 2,700 felling licences we have on hand at the moment, 123 are from 2018, so the other 2,600 have come in at some point since 1 January 2019, and the majority of those came in in 2020.  That will give the Deputy an idea.  I am sure there is an outlier of a licence application going back five years.  It is inevitable.  Sometimes licences sit on our system as well and may be moribund but, in broad terms, we are looking at 98% of all felling licences on hand right now having come in at some point in the past two years and I would say 60% of those having come in in 2020.  That might give the Deputy an indication.</p></speech>

Obviously, everything changed on 1 January.  As a result of that, it may be difficult to get figures on importation of logs before then because before 1 January logs could move into Ireland without border controls.  Since 1 January there have been border control posts.</p><p>Two issues arise in that regard.  First, log imports must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate.  The Department has been engaging with all sawmills that import logs and they are well aware of that.  Second, these imports must come in through border control posts.  The Department has created two additional border control posts for the importation of logs, at Rushbrooke and Passage West in County Cork.</p></speech>

In line with the exceptional circumstances which we must endure, I remind those participating that apart from members of the committee secretariat and myself, all members and witnesses are participating remotely.  All members are within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey.</p> <p>  Today, I am pleased to continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill 2018.  This matter is one of the priorities of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I have a particular interest in it myself.  Last week we heard from Mr. Ian Drennan, director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I am pleased to be joined remotely by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Robert Troy.</p><p>In line with normal practice, members have been provided with documentation on this matter, including the opening statement of the Minister.  A briefing from the committee secretariat regarding the general scheme has been circulated.  This is in addition to the briefings provided to members at last week's meeting, which included a briefing from the Library and Research Service and written observations from a number of experts and stakeholders.</p><p> I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.</p><p> The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses may be giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p><p> Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> Therefore, to commence with our consideration of this matter, I ask the Minister to make his opening statement.  As his written statement has been circulated, it may be helpful to highlight the main issues that he wishes to speak on.</p></speech>

I am joined by my officials, Nina Brennan, principal officer, who is on the line and will help me out with any hard questions, and Orla O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal, from the office as well.</p> <p>  By way of background, this legislation was proposed in the previous Government's plan to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s corporate, economic and regulatory framework, which was published back in 2017.  The general scheme was developed by my Department and published in 2018.  Pre-legislative scrutiny commenced in early 2019 but was not completed because of the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  In the meantime, my Department worked with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on drafting the general scheme in consultation with the director.  In parallel, planning for the ODCE&rsquo;s transition to a stand-alone independent agency has progressed nonetheless.  This has included an increased budget and staffing levels, including additional garda&iacute;. </p> <p>  First, the main purpose of the Bill is to establish the new corporate enforcement authority and to enhance the framework for the conduct of business in Ireland under the Companies Act 2014.  By establishing the ODCE as an agency, it will be better equipped to investigate complicated breaches of company law, which are sometimes very large cases involving multiple offences and multiple parties.  The authority will also have operational autonomy, particularly in terms of the ability to recruit specialist skills and expertise, becoming an agency in its own right rather than an office of my Department.</p> <p>  The structure is based on the commission model with up to three members.  It is designed to give the authority the flexibility to structure itself in meeting the differing demands of its remit, which includes investigation, prosecution, supervision and advocacy.  There is the possibility that different commissioners could be given a lead in one particular or another area.  This will also allow the authority to adapt if its workload expands significantly and if it needs to organise work into discrete areas or functions.  In combination, these organisational changes will enhance the capacity of the authority to carry out multiple and complex investigations in parallel if the situation arises. </p> <p>  The general scheme also provides that the authority&rsquo;s functional independence is fully compatible with statutory oversight by Government and accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We need to give the new agency the tools it needs to meet the challenges it faces in its investigation and prosecution of alleged breaches of company law.  The general scheme provides that all existing functions and powers of the ODCE-----</p></speech>

The Companies Act 2014 is kept under active review in the light of changing circumstances; for example, court judgments or problems that arise from time to time.  The Company Law Review Group provides valuable expert advice and recommendations on the reform of company law in Ireland.  The general scheme implements recommendations of the group on corporate governance and shares and share capital.  The general scheme also incorporates some additional provisions, including a new ground for the restriction of company directors, measures with respect to the conduct of liquidations and the oversight of liquidators, and measures providing for greater transparency when it comes to the register of companies.</p><p> Finally, the general scheme makes some miscellaneous amendments to the Companies Act 2014.  These include technical provisions replacing references to the director in light of the new authority being established.</p><p> I will consider any further powers identified as a requirement for the corporate enforcement authority in carrying out its functions in the ongoing development of legislation by the Department.  I wrote to the Chairman in December regarding the report of the Hamilton review and its support for this legislation.  Arising from that review, an action plan will be developed and led by the Minister for Justice.  The Department will be engaged in this work where relevant to its remit.</p><p> The Government is keen to progress this legislation.  It is an important milestone for corporate enforcement in Ireland.  By establishing the corporate enforcement authority as a stand-alone agency in its own right, and by providing for its autonomy, resources and enforcement powers, we will strengthen Ireland's regulatory framework for the conduct of business now and into the future.</p><p> I look forward to hearing members' views and taking questions on the general scheme.  I am joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who has responsibility for the Companies Acts and will be taking some of the legislation in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p></speech>

I recall when the Bill was first mooted.  There was an expectation and a shared ambition across all parties to carry through all necessary reforms to ensure Ireland can have a robust economic regulatory framework.  The legislation before us was first proposed in the Measures to Enhance Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework plan, which was published in 2017.  This legislation is an important part of that plan.  The establishment of the corporate enforcement authority was reaffirmed late last year by the report of the Hamilton review group.</p> <p>  I am eager that in 2021 the new authority be established and the Government publish the Bill as soon as possible.  Before doing so, it will be important for us to hear the views of this committee when it reports.  I am very much looking forward to this.  The T&aacute;naiste has set out the main provisions of the Bill.  I do not intend to repeat them.  I emphasise that the establishment of an independent agency is a key milestone in our reforms.</p> <p>  The Government is making sure the authority will have the wherewithal to carry out its mission.  The ODCE's funding has already been increased by &euro;1 million or 20% from its base level to reflect the costs of its transition to a stand-alone agency.  Last week, the Department approved the sanction of 14 additional civil servant posts, representing a 35% increase in civil servants.  This will complement the restructuring already undertaken by the director to improve the expertise at his disposal.  Consideration has also been given to the possible requirement for additional garda&iacute;.  Good progress has also been made on other organisational matters such as ICT and accommodation.  We are at a point where the organisation is ready for its establishment as an independent body.</p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for company regulation, I see the establishment of the corporate enforcement authority as a solid basis for future reform.  Company law should always be responsive to new developments.  Various suggestions have been made for additional powers, which will be examined by my officials.  I note the director identified possible avenues in this respect in a submission to this committee, but he also pointed out that the focus should be on finalising this legislation.</p><p>The Government will be continuing to work on new measures to tackle economic crime and corruption.  An action plan arising from the report of the Hamilton review group is being developed, and it is being led by the Minister for Justice.  My Department will be engaged in that work.  New powers and other enactments pertaining to the new authority are matters that will continue to be actively considered.  I look forward to hearing the members' views and taking any questions that arise on the general scheme.</p></speech>

We had representatives of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in with us last week.  They painted a picture of what they face, particularly in respect of resources.  It is clear from what they were saying that a certain amount of white-collar crime is going undetected because the resources are simply not available to deal with it.  That is just a fact.  I am aware that the staff do a very good job prioritising but they just do not have all the resources they need.  Do the Minister and Minister of State have a view on the level of white-collar crime that is going undetected and on how it will be tackled when this legislation is passed?</p> <p>  The ODCE painted a picture of the people they are dealing with.  They are well resourced and have deep pockets, and they are also litigious.  It seems like it is quite a combative environment for the office.  Resources will be key.  The representatives before us were looking for staff.  They outlined they would need new staff.  HR staff and other such staff are a given but it is more a question of staff at the technical end and on the front line.  I am interested in hearing whether the Minister and Minister of State accept that there is white-collar crime not being investigated.  Have they a view on staffing?</p> <p>  I have another question but want to leave as much time as I can for answers.  The question relates to the additional powers that the ODCE representatives referred to in their submission and in the course of our discussions.  They referred to the need to legislate and to modernise and update the search powers, specifically regarding the cloud, for example.  I will not get too technical because I am not technical, but it is clear that data that used to be in one place now move around.  The view was that additional powers would be needed.  Do the Minister and Minister of State have a view on the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau and Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC?  Are they in the frame of mind to believe that the new agency will need such powers?  Would they be minded to grant those kinds of powers to the agency to ensure it can do the best job it can?</p> <p>  I have taken only two and a half of my seven minutes.  The remainder is for answers.</p></speech>

Although I cannot prove it, I suspect that breaches of company, competition and tax law are considerable and much greater in number than we realised.  Obviously, there are various bodies that pursue the perpetrators.  The Revenue Commissioners are very well resourced and do a really great job.  There are also the CCPC and the ODCE, which is the weaker and least resourced of the three bodies pursuing the different types of white-collar crimes that are committed.  This Bill has two objectives - setting up the agency in its own right like the CCPC and Revenue Commissioners and giving the agency the resources to pursue breaches of company law.  I met the director only during the week, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  The director is relatively happy with the additional resources the agency is getting.  Even though the Bill has not been passed, the budget has been increased and there are additional civil servants, forensic accountants and so on.  The agency is also getting additional garda&iacute;.  It will have eight garda&iacute; at the technical level.  The director said a genuine issue arises over expertise because the really skilled people in areas such as forensic accounting and the really clever lawyers in this space can command the really big bucks.</p><p>Potentially, they can command those really big bucks from people who may be breaching these company laws.  Quite frankly, it is always a problem with the public service that we are competing with a private sector that can pay really well.  When we start paying people in the public service really well, we get understandable criticism from people who are on more modest salaries.  However, we think this will give us greater flexibility around that and a greater ability to hire people on a contract basis, for example, to do particular jobs.  One thing Revenue has done very successfully is to get some people back from the private sector who are maybe more motivated by public service and lifestyle issues than by the big bucks and I would like to see this body doing a bit of that too.</p><p> On the powers, we have had a talk about this between Departments and across Government so there is a plan for a new police powers Bill.  That Bill will give additional powers around getting access to electronic information and the cloud and all of those things.  The ODCE would like that but we think that rather than doing it on a piecemeal basis we should give that power across the board, to the Garda, the director and other enforcement bodies and do it through a different piece of legislation.</p></speech>

Does the T&aacute;naiste see that power applying to civilians under the auspices of the ODCE, the new agency, as well?  I ask because it is not just the experts CAB and the CCPC have, like garda&iacute;, they also have trained experts who come in, such as forensic accountants, etc.  Does the T&aacute;naiste see that power extending beyond the garda&iacute; to the civilians?</p></speech>

We would probably leave it to the Garda.  Ms Brennan or Ms O'Brien may wish to address that as they were involved in the talks with other Departments.</p></speech>

As matters stand, I do not think that civilians go in by themselves and do the searches.  The application for the search warrant must be made to the District Court and the Garda is responsible for making it.  It is something where, again, if it is system-wide it will be picked up by the ODCE.  We intend it to become part of company law but if it goes into the criminal justice law we are fine with that and that will cover the searches for the ODCE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012900002#F00500"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his presentation.  He has been quoted as saying that this new agency will be an Irish FBI for white-collar crime.  This certainly sounds very impressive, until one looks at the budgeting for the organisation over the past number of years.  The budget was just &euro;6 million.  I compared that to the amount of money the previous Government spent on welfare cheats.  I remember that famous campaign that I think he fronted: "Welfare cheats cheat us all".  That was a campaign costing &euro;163,000 that yielded just &euro;300,000 in repayments.  I did a bit of digging and I noticed there are 277 social welfare inspectors in the Department of Social Protection and a further 98 assigned to the special investigation unit.  In budgetary terms, that is a minimum of &euro;15 million in salaries.  My first question, therefore, is how the T&aacute;naiste explains this dichotomy over the years he has been in Government and has been leading Government, whereby we spend a minimum of three times as much chasing welfare spongers - one might call them poor criminals - as we do on the white-collar criminal class.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012900002#F00600"><p>The way I see it is all fraud is wrong, be it tax fraud, company fraud or welfare fraud.  Some people make a distinction between them based on perceptions around the social class of the offender but my view is that anyone who is committing fraud is stealing from the public and stealing from society so in whatever brief I hold, I intend to take a hard line on these issues.  I did so at the Department of Social Protection, I would be doing so were I in the Department of Finance and I am doing it now in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That is one of the reasons I am pushing this forward as a piece of legislation I want to get done so we can crack down on corporate fraud, as we should.  That is why I am putting forward the legislation now and why we are providing more staff and money for the body.</p><p>I would envisage that continuing to scale up over the years because we need to crack down on all forms of fraud.  I would never equivocate about the different types of fraud or seek to justify that one type of fraud is in some way different or another is somehow justifiable.  I found that argument very hard to understand when it was made at the time when I was in the Department of Social Protection.  The suggestion was that it was somehow justifiable because other people were committing fraud too and why did we not crack down on all forms of fraud.  This Bill is a good step forward in that regard.</p><p> Where I do not agree with Senator Gavan is his suggestion that this is the only means by which the Government combats white-collar crime and economic crime of this nature.  This is just one body and its entire remit is company law.  The Revenue Commissioners have significant resources to deal with tax fraud.  They have much greater resources than the Department of Social Protection.  The budget of the Department of Social Protection is between &euro;20 billion and &euro;30 billion.  Revenue takes in about &euro;50 billion or &euro;60 billion a year.  Revenue is much better equipped than the Department of Social Protection.  Even though Revenue is only dealing with double the amount of money, it probably has more than double the number of staff working as inspectors as the Department.  There is the CCPC as well, which is responsible for competition law.  Then there is the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  One would have to take them all together to give a read of it.</p></speech>

It does strike me as very stark that while the T&aacute;naiste was prepared to make very high-profile campaigns against so-called welfare cheats, this organisation has been underfunded for years.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste why that is the case.  I am conscious of time.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the FAI.  While I do not expect him to comment on an individual case, we know that there are 280,000 files.  The ODCE asked for an additional five staff yesterday.  Are we going to be looking at yet another rerun of the FitzPatrick file in three or four years' time, where because of a lack of resources the trial ended up in tatters?</p></speech>

It is best that I do not.  The Department of Social Protection estimates that it saves approximately &euro;500 million a year in fraud and control measures.  If it did not do what it is doing, that is the kind of money we would be losing every year.  I am not privy to the report Senator Gavan mentioned, but I would say it is more on the tax side than the company law side.</p> <p>  In terms of the various prosecutions, the FitzPatrick case went very wrong and we are all aware of that, but it is important to bear in mind that when it came to the cases involving the banks I think there were at least four successful prosecutions.  I will get the figures.  People tend to forget that.  I will see if I can find it here.  I had the figures.</p></speech>

They pursue tax fraud and they are probably better resourced than the Department of Social Protection in pursuing social welfare fraud.  This agency is only for one specific area relating to the Companies Act the Senator mentioned.  The idea that came from the Law Reform Commission was to have an FBI-type of body, a single body to deal with white-collar crime, but since the Hamilton review it was decided to stick with different bodies, that is Revenue, the ODCE and the CCPC.</p></speech>

Is the Government happy at this stage that we have clear offences across all the headings?  I know some will not be in company law and there are others in regard to banking restrictions, financial regulations and so on.  One of the features of the financial crisis was that the law was not sufficiently specific, the burdens of proof were often wrongly placed and it was difficult to get prosecutions.  Having had a lot of review of the legislation, are we in a robust position at this point?</p> <p>  The second question is a follow-up to Deputy Louise O'Reilly&rsquo;s question.  We heard last week that when a witness is being cross-examined, it can only be done by garda&iacute; and the experts have to sit outside the room.  People move to and fro and the cross-examining garda has to come out, listen to the comments and go back in.  As all of that is against a time-limited cross-examination, it can create problems.  Is that one of the things that will be changed?</p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement explained that after the financial crisis, the number of liquidations went up to 1,400 per year and then came back down to 400.  There is obviously a concern now that we would see another increase in liquidations.  I understand that will pose questions for the ODCE in terms of making sure that all of those liquidations are done in a robust way.  However, on the wider front, what progress has been made in regard to efforts to have a quicker and easier form of examinership that might avoid a rush of liquidations in cases where, perhaps, adjustment of some of the creditors&rsquo; commitments could keep that company viable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012900002#H00300"><p>To answer the first question, yes, I believe the laws and offences are robust in this area.  As the Deputy knows, the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, does a lot of work with us on updating the law all of the time, and we are going to keep doing that.</p> <p>  The issue around the experts in the room has come up a few times and came up in my discussions with the director as well, so we are going to examine that.  To me, logically, it makes sense that, say, the forensic accountant can be in the room to make sure the garda does not forget to ask the right questions or to pick up on the answers.  We are going to examine that and see if we can make a provision for this Bill, although we will probably be adding that in a bit later because it is not really provided for in the Bill before us.  That is something we are going to examine and we will do it if we can.</p> <p>  On the issue of liquidations, I will hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who is leading on that issue and on the kind of examinership-lite work we are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012900002#H00400"><p>I know Deputy Bruton has a strong interest in this and he raised it on Oral Questions before Christmas.  I want to confirm that the CLRG has put forward its proposals, or perhaps not really proposals, but an overview of the examinership process.  Unfortunately, it has not clearly identified what it advises needs to be done, so my officials are working through its submission at the moment.  It is our firm intention that we would have new legislation in quarter 2 of this year to take account of and deal with examinership-lite or a rescue package for small businesses, so to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012900002#H00500"><p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials to the meeting.  To follow up on the issue with respect to specialist staff interviewing alongside garda&iacute; and being in the same room, is the thinking that these staff would also have the power to question or interrogate witnesses in the room, rather than being there to pass notes to garda&iacute;?</p><p>I am aware of the complexity from some other work in which I have been involved.  The T&aacute;naiste is right.  The complexity of this area and the expertise available to the private sector, in particular, is enormous.  The State must be able to match that.  It is expensive to match it.  Some of these people are extraordinarily gifted and very experienced and knowledgeable on a complex area.  That is one question.  Will these people be given the power to ask questions and interrogate on an equal basis alongside garda&iacute;?</p><p> The next question concerns the fact that many documents are kept off-site, such as electronic evidence, electronic devices and so forth.  Are we happy this is future-proofed?  I mention the idea of someone raiding a particular facility and finding the material is actually kept on a server somewhere else.  Will the authority have the power to interrogate that evidence and so on?</p><p> The third question has to do with the number of members on the authority.  I note the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, legislation says not fewer than two and not more than six members.  Again, it was put to us that the possibility of having one member is an awful lot of responsibility for one person.  I note the CCPC has four members, including the chairperson, and each of the members has a different area of expertise on which to focus.  It seems to work quite well.  Perhaps that will be looked at.</p><p> Finally, is the issue of directors not putting insolvent companies into liquidation sufficiently covered here?  That came up last week and it has come up repeatedly in a few areas.  Those are my issues.</p></speech>

When it comes to having access to that new electronic information - although it is not that new anymore - which may be on servers, in the cloud or held electronically elsewhere, we will try to deal with it in the police powers Bill.  Therefore, that will be done across the board, not just for company law offences but for the Revenue Commissioners, Garda, CCPC and so on.</p> <p>  I have an open mind about the number of commissioners.  The legislation provides for three.  There may be a case for allowing a larger number or at least give me in my capacity as Minister, or future Ministers, the flexibility to expand the number of commissioners.  I have an open mind on that, quite frankly.  I will give it some more thought.</p> <p>  My understanding on the specialist staff issue is that our thinking is we would have them in the room.  The garda&iacute;, however, would still carry out the interrogation because that is what they are qualified and trained to do.  I am not sure the forensic accountant or company lawyer is trained to do so.  I will ask Ms Brennan to come in on that if she wishes to add to what I have said.</p></speech>

It is an area we must give some consideration to with our colleagues in the Department of Justice.  It would be an amendment to the criminal justice legislation because it is about when somebody is arrested and detained by garda&iacute; for up to 24 hours in a Garda station.  Therefore, it is to do with the custody regulations and who can be in the room and ask questions.  It is something we will have to give thought to and discuss with our colleagues in the Department of Justice.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  I thank them for their presentations.</p><p>Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State referred to the recent Hamilton review.  As we know, this was a wide-ranging review on tackling white-collar crime.  It was published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, in December.  The review references this Bill and welcomes it.  How will this Bill ensure that the new agency is able to hire more people and hire them more quickly?</p><p> My second question relates to the timing.  When does the T&aacute;naiste expect the Bill to be enacted?  Will there be a gap between the enactment and the agency being established?  Will it require a commencement order six months after enactment?</p></speech>

It is very much part of the Civil Service and the Civil Service structure.  We believe that becoming an independent agency in its own right will make it easier for the office to hire staff more quickly and hire and retain particular expertise.</p> <p>  Generally, this has been the model.  A specialist agency is more equipped to do this, whether it is ComReg, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland or whatever agency we wish to mention.  When they have a little more freedom to recruit, they find it easier to recruit.  That is particularly the case when it comes to specialist staff who might not fit in the traditional model, involving a principal officer, administrative officer and assistant secretary, that we have in the Civil Service.</p> <p>  The new entity would initially do its recruitment through the Public Appointments Service but that could change.  Then there would be more flexibility around contractors as well.  For example, it would be possible to bring in someone for a year on a particular case or file, perhaps someone with particular expertise.  That can be difficult with the normal Civil Service constraints.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about timing.  We would hope to have the Bill through the Houses by the summer recess and then establish the agency, probably, from the first day next year.  Notwithstanding that, the work is under way anyway.  We are not waiting for the Bill.  Additional staff and resources are going in.  Those responsible are getting ready and geared up with new information technology systems.  We are not waiting for the Bill to be passed to begin that transition.  That is well under way.</p></speech>

I thank them for their presentation.</p> <p>  As public representatives we are all aware that there has been a fair bit of criticism in recent years to the effect that the ODCE lacked the necessary resources to most effectively carry out its role.  I very much support this legislation and recognise the need for the corporate enforcement authority.</p> <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste speak to what sort of budget is envisaged to be made available to the authority to enable it to acquire the necessary resources to commence and hit the ground running?  This has been mentioned by one or two other members.  Is it anticipated that there will be a transition period during which more staff can be added?  Is it possible to get more detail, if it is available?</p> <p>  My next question is about the review of the examinership process.  Currently, small companies cannot avail of it.  It is certainly true for businesses in Galway.  My concern is that there is extraordinary pressure on businesses currently.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State will be well aware of this but what happens when Covid-19 supports end?  It is imperative that we give certainty in respect of the Covid-19 supports.  They have been helpful for the survival of many businesses, especially the business people I speak to in Galway city and county.  My concern is that when the Covid supports stop or end, there will be major financial pressure on those businesses.  Is a restructure available to them?  Will the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State comment on that?</p></speech>

We would plan to increase that and scale it up to 69 so quite a big increase.  On the civilian side, that is going from 39.8 staff to 52.8 staff and, on the Garda side, it is going from eight staff to 16 staff.  One cannot just double or treble these things overnight.  If one wants to do it properly one must scale up an organisation but that is the plan for scaling up.  So it is a significant scaling up in resources - a doubling of the number of garda&iacute; and increasing the number of civilian staff from fewer than 40 to 52 staff - and we will take it from there.  I see this body as growing, developing and becoming more resourced as time goes on.</p> <p>  On financial support for business, as the Senator will know, we have the wage subsidy scheme that helps the payroll and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which helps with mixed costs.  The plan was to start phasing that out at the end of March because we had thought that whatever third wave might arise in January would be much less than what we have experienced.  I think the picture is now very different and we need to be frank about that.  I chair the committee on the economy.  We are going to convene that next week because I think we need to take an early decision, as a Government, to extend the wage subsidy scheme and the CRSS really well into the second quarter if not until the end of the second quarter.  Even if businesses do re-open in the second quarter they will not all re-open and they are still going to need that additional financial support.  All of this is very expensive but, I think, the cost of allowing these companies to fail would be greater than the cost of trying to keep them alive.  We will have a Cabinet committee meeting on that next week.  I want to be in a position to give businesses an early indication of a decision on this so they know in February what is going to happen at the end of March, not in March what is going to happen at the end of March.</p> <p>  On the examinership question, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is leading on that so I might hand over to him.</p></speech>

I have looked back on my notes so I can say that the Company Law Review Group published a report in October 2020.  Our Department officials recognised the priority of this issue for myself and the T&aacute;naiste published a report, just before Christmas, on potential proposals and recommendations.  That is receiving further consideration and wider consultation with the various State bodies with a view, and a hope, that the T&aacute;naiste will be in a position to bring a memorandum to Cabinet at the end of quarter 1 or early quarter 2, so a general scheme for Bills.  We recognise that it is an ambitious timeframe but we also recognise the importance of the issue.  It is very much a strong commitment of this Government to bring forward a proposal, probably in quarter 2 of this year.</p></speech>

I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State for coming here.</p> <p>  I wish to make a few observations and then I will ask a couple of questions.  I welcome, as I think most people would, the formation of the authority.  One of things that I would hark back to is the Anglo Irish Bank debacle regarding David Drumm and Michael Lynn around property and the whole vista that that presented in terms of the perpetrators of white-collar crime almost being seen to get away with it.  For quite a long period that did a lot of damage to the State, in terms of showing that white-collar crime was a crime that was not being prosecuted and there was little fallout from such crime.  I hope that when this authority gets into being it is far more adroit at dealing with such situations.</p> <p>  I would reflect what some of the other members have already said in terms of their concerns around staffing and the T&aacute;naiste has already addressed some of those issues.  I wish to discuss the overall structure, skills set and technology training.</p><p>I hope a great deal of focus will be put on this area because modern business largely comprises high-level technology platforms, particularly for international business, and the forensic accounting that is required is of a really high level.  The T&aacute;naiste has highlighted that many people are seconded from the private sector.  We, along with the Garda, will have to consider high-level forensic accounting and ICT skill sets in the future.  Otherwise, we will not be at the races in this regard.</p><p>There is also an issue at times with the appropriateness of the direction of the authority, and I am thinking specifically of the SME sector, which I worked in for quite a while.  There is much regulation of private business.  Company directors must be fully registered and use the correct names and PPS numbers associated with the directorships.  That is all fine and well but it puts a great burden on small businesses which may not have a legal office to which they can direct issues.  As somebody who was in that space, I know that when a business owner gets messages from the Department and Revenue and potentially from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement regarding the director's requirements, it puts a great burden on people who are struggling to get ahead.  I hope there will be some balance in regard to the SME sector in the Bill.  Perhaps in future we need to think about a different structure of corporate policy for small businesses, understanding they do not have access to all those resources that businesses do.</p><p> The Minister of State highlighted the status of examinership-lite.  This will be a fundamental issue for business in the coming months.  I listened intently to the T&aacute;naiste's comments to the effect that he wants to give certainty to business.  That should be a prerequisite, and the sooner it is done, the better.  Many people have used up their savings and their businesses are closed, some of them because they do not have access to the CRSS.  People will be falling over and it is not fair to nail them to the floor because their business models have failed in these times.  Something in this legislation has to accommodate that, whether it is examinership-lite or something else.</p><p> In the main, I do not think the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State needs to add much to what I have said.  We welcome the Bill.  The authority needs to be properly funded and resourced, and the necessary skill set and technology must be pre-eminent in it.  Otherwise, we will not keep pace with where modern business fraud is going.</p></speech>

It is worth putting on record that when it comes to the ODCE's role in investigations relating to the Anglo Irish Bank debacle or saga, five separate investigations resulted in four trials, all of which resulted in persons being convicted on indictment of criminal offences.  While there is a strong focus on the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick case, which ended on 23 May 2017, and what went wrong there, and while for very good reasons there is great public concern and annoyance about that, it is often forgotten that of the five investigations, there were trials and convictions in four.  One would not necessarily have that impression from the way it is sometimes reported in public, but it was not a categorical failure by the ODCE by any means.  It secured prosecutions and convictions in four of five of the cases.</p> <p>  Regulation is something I want to have a closer look at in my time in this brief.  I know there is a great deal of regulation on business, which is very tough on small businesses in particular because they do not have HR and legal departments and so on.  It can be very frustrating and it has made it difficult to do business.  At the same time, I am conscious that one person's regulation is another person's rights, and what businesses will often complain about in terms of regulation is often what other people consider to be their employment rights, environmental rights, health and safety and so on.  I would at some point like to carry out a wider regulatory review, perhaps using the standard cost model, and take a look at all the regulation imposed on business as a whole to see if we could streamline it in some way, even if that just meant reducing the numbers of forms that have to be filled in or of licences that have to be obtained.</p><p>These things would not undermine the polity of regulation but might make it easier for people to manage and administer.</p></speech>

I accept what he is saying about corporate enforcement.  With respect to Anglo Irish Bank, it was a long, tedious, drawn-out affair, which was probably what annoyed many people but I accept that people were secured at the end.  I welcome the Minister's comments about looking at the regulatory burden on small businesses, which is critical.  The Minister mentioned giving visibility to small businesses in the future, which was brought up in the House recently.  It is a matter of expanding the Covid restrictions support scheme to many businesses that are excluded from it because they are not operating from a premises.  I received communication yesterday from somebody in the catering business, who has extensive lease purchases for catering equipment, and there is no more forbearance coming from financial institutions.  That is a significant burden.  I hope that something can be done shortly.  Is there any opportunity to talk to the banks again to try to begin another period of forbearance if we are going to continue in level 5 or even level 4, which it looks like we will, for any length of time?</p></speech>

We are aware that it is a problem and we hope to bring the scheme to Government next month.  It has always been complicated.  We spend much time trying to solve every problem and have come to the conclusion that we cannot solve every problem, but if we can help many businesses with the new scheme, it is better than helping no business.  We will have that next month.</p> <p>  There was another part of the Deputy's question which escapes me.</p></speech>

I have a brief question myself.  There is a perception that white collar crime, financial crime or whatever one wants to call it has not been treated properly over the last years.  I welcome the Minister's comments on a number of questions.  I had similar questions but they have been asked already.  Did I hear correctly that the budget for next year is being increased to &euro;6.3 million, which is an increase of only &euro;300,000 on this year?  The Minister talked about increasing the staff from 44 to 69.  I would have expected a more significant increase in staff if we are going to be serious about tackling this.  Does he anticipate that the additional staff will be specialist IT staff or will they be a combination of HR staff and IT staff?  I know these are necessary too but will the additional staff be specialists in IT and detective work?  Judge Aylmer famously said of the Anglo Irish Bank case that the failure of the ODCE was stark.  There was a failure to properly investigate shredding of documents and it was not seen to be impartial.  Is the T&aacute;naiste convinced that 69 staff will be adequate?</p></speech>

I will provide an outline of the proposed increase in staff.  On the Civil Service side, it will be two principal officers, three assistant principal officer equivalents - digital forensics, an enforcement lawyer and an ICT manager - one higher executive officer, two executive officers and five clerical officers.  There will be an additional eight garda&iacute;, which is an increase to 16.  I believe those garda&iacute; get paid through the Garda Vote.  As such, this budget does not fully reflect how much will be spent.</p><p> If we can double the number of garda&iacute; and increase the number of civilian staff by 22 over the next two or three years, we will see how it goes.  Since public bodies tend to expand over the years, I imagine that this will be a much larger body in five or ten years' time than it is now.  We will be doing well if we can get this legislation through and scale up the agency into something much stronger than what it is now.</p></speech>

This committee will not be lax in getting this legislation through as fast as we can.</p> <p>  I have a quick technical question for the T&aacute;naiste.  The ODCE is located on Parnell Square.

I appreciate the information he has given us so far.  My first question is a specific one.  The T&aacute;naiste is the line manager for his Department.  Yesterday, the ODCE requested five additional staff to work on the FAI investigation.  Will he commit that it will get those staff?</p></speech>

I am asking this question because I am concerned about the staffing plan as set out.  In fairness, the T&aacute;naiste has gone through it.  That the ODCE is now moving to agency status means that some of the new staff will have to perform HR and administration roles, for example, that would not have been required previously.  How many of the new staff will actually be available to work on cases?</p></speech>

These numbers comprise five clerical officers, two executive officers, one higher executive officer, three assistant principal officers and two principal officers.  I do not believe there is a straightforward division between people who are working on cases and people who are not.  In the case of the Senator's work and mine, we are public representatives but we have personal assistants or secretaries.  Are they not working on cases?  There is not a straightforward dichotomy in this situation.</p></speech>

He has been honest enough to acknowledge it.  An increase in funding of &euro;300,000 is a drop in the ocean.  According to figures from 2007, &euro;2.5 billion was being lost each year to corporate crime, white-collar crime or whatever one calls it.  It is extraordinary that the Government is proposing this Bill, which we all support, on the one hand but, on the other hand there seems to be little in the way of the required funding.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that, in her submission to the committee two weeks ago, Professor Deirdre Ahern made the point that this organisation has been consistently underfunded.</p><p>Professor Ahern stated:</p><blockquote>	We need to ensure that medium and large corporate players are subject to the same level of scrutiny and, where appropriate, enforcement activity, as small closely held companies and their officers.  This is particularly so given that Ireland is a destination of choice for incorporation of many large financial services and multinational companies. </blockquote><p>Her point is very well made and, in all seriousness, I do not think this organisation is resourced to do that right now, even including the plans the Minister mentioned.</p></speech>

The budget figures may be a little misleading because there is a &euro;1.5 million underspend.  The new agency had probably not got up and running.  I am not familiar with the report from which the Senator quoted but I highly doubt the &euro;2.5 billion relates to company law offences.  I am sure that if I pulled out the report and looked into it, I would find that the figure relates to a mixture of different offences, probably more on the tax side, the competition side or other sides.  I will take a look at the report but I doubt the &euro;2.5 billion relates to company law offences.  It may only be a proportion of that, perhaps even a small proportion of it.</p></speech>

I welcome from the high-level task force on Covid-19 vaccination, Professor Brian MacCraith, chair; from the Department of Health, Mr. Fergal Goodman, assistant secretary, health protection division, and Ms. Elizabeth Headon, vaccine communications co-ordination; and from the HSE, Mr. David Walsh, work stream lead of the vaccination process and workforce, Dr. Lucy Jessop, director of public health in the national immunisation office, and Mr. Fran Thompson, chief information officer.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statements, I point out to the witnesses that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to evidence given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Whatever the difficulties of rolling out the vaccine in Ireland, we should be mindful of the situation in the rest of the world, which the head of the WHO has said is on the brink of catastrophe.  There are also concerns over what the German medical authorities have said about one of the vaccines.  It is important for us to meet today and put some questions to the witnesses.</p> <p>  I call Professor MacCraith to make his opening remarks. </p></speech>

As I have sent in my statement, I will aim to be very brief.</p><p>I have been asked to comment specifically on the role of the high-level task force so I will make just a small number of points on that.</p><p> The overall objective of the task force is to support the Department of Health and the HSE in developing a strategy and implementation plan and to monitor the roll-out of, and provide strategic inputs to, an efficient and agile national Covid-19 immunisation programme.  As the committee will be aware, the Covid-19 vaccination programme strategy and implementation plan were launched and published on 15 December.  The programme has now moved into a live HSE operation with the commencement of the roll-out.  The ongoing role of the task force is now to support the HSE and the Department of Health in planning amid uncertainty and in developing and testing scenarios that enable the vaccination programme to be adapted to a very fluid external environment.  I do not need to elaborate on the issues surrounding vaccine supply.  The task force itself has no executive authority or direct responsibility for the roll-out.  The Minister and the Department of Health are responsible for policy matters, regulatory matters and funding.  The operational delivery of the programme is the responsibility of the HSE under the leadership of its chief clinical officer, Dr. Colm Henry.</p><p> There are two main areas on which the task force delivers.  First, the weekly task force meetings draw together expertise and inputs from the Department of Health; the HSE; the Department of the Taoiseach; the Chief Medical Officer; the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC; the HPRA, which is the regulatory body; the Irish College of General Practitioners; and others.  This creates a very valuable forum for addressing all elements of the programme and ensuring full awareness of key risks and issues, which can then be addressed by the appropriate departments or agencies.</p><p> The second element is of ongoing importance.  The task force is supported by a programme management office, PMO, led by a programme director, Mr. Derek Tierney.  A key piece of work developed through the PMO is the programme planning roadmap.  This is an integrated design tool which supports adaptive planning of the programme, for example planning for scenarios such as reductions in early deliveries of AstraZeneca vaccines and dealing earlier with the reduction in the number of Pfizer vaccines.</p><p> A key operating principle of the programme is that the administration of vaccines will be limited only by supply.  The committee will be aware that there have been some challenges in this regard.  Supply uncertainty remains one of the biggest challenges to the programme.  Supplies continue to arrive, however, and we anticipate continuing to scale up the vaccination programme over the coming weeks and months.  The programme is now firmly in operational mode, and a number of the programme's work stream leads are represented here today.  The task force continues to meet weekly in its role as support to the Department of Health and the HSE, to monitor the progress of the programme and to ensure a strategic and co-ordinated response to any issues that arise.</p><p> I will now hand the committee over to my colleagues to discuss the details of the programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Goodman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#B00200"><p>I am conscious of the committee's time constraints so I will perhaps keep to just a few brief remarks in order that we do not go over old ground all the time.  As Professor MacCraith said, we are just four weeks into the programme now, and for very understandable reasons there is intense interest in it nationally and internationally.  It has become a rolling story in some ways, and that probably makes it additionally difficult to continue in a straightforward way to plan and progress the programme under that spotlight.  Operationally, for the HSE and for the Department, we want the focus to be very much on working through this programme and dealing with the evolving events.  I think Dr. Colm Henry on the radio this morning - I do not know if anyone heard him - noted the constantly evolving nature of everything to do with the pandemic, and the vaccination programme, to an extent, is beset by the same challenges.</p> <p>  The priority from the start of the programme has been, first, to vaccinate and protect those who are at greatest risk from Covid-19 in terms of morbidity and mortality.  They are, as we know, predominantly older people in residential settings in the first place, and we will shortly move on to older persons in the community as well.</p><p>As members will be aware, front-line healthcare workers, on whom the country has been, and will remain, so dependent, have comprised a group that has been addressed early.  That work is in progress.<br/><br/>Regarding the challenges around authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine, we will hear from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, by early this afternoon.  That will provide a point of certainty from which we can move forward with greater clarity about supply and deliveries.  It will be another tool in our armoury, so to speak, with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines already in use.<br/><br/>My colleague, Ms Elizabeth Headon, is with me today.  The committee has identified communications and the communication strategy as an area of particular interest.  The Department works closely with the HSE on the communications aspect of the programme.  Work on it has been in train for several months.  It plays out in phases as the programme progresses.  It is crucial for the public to have confidence in, and understanding of, the vaccines; to be able to access accurate information easily; to receive relevant details at the level of the individual about when, where and how someone will receive his or her vaccination; and to feel confident in the administration of the programme.  The Department has provided the committee an ancillary report outlining the press and broadcast advertising to date as well as social media and news coverage, which we hope members will find useful.  There are high levels of public engagement with the communications channel, with 860,000 visits to the <i>gov.ie</i>vaccine site and 414,000 visits to the <i>hse.ie</i>vaccine site.  Social media engagement has reached a figure of 2.5 million.<br/><br/>Fortunately, research carried out weekly for the Department has demonstrated growing public confidence in and demand for Covid-19 vaccination.  In the early stages, there were questions about whether sufficient numbers in the population woulne, a number well up on what we saw last year.<br/><br/>There is a great interest in and demand for information.  At times, it could be said that there is a frenzy of information.  It is important that there be clear communication from all arms of the State regarding the importance of the programme and the fact that it is complex and being run and planned on a clear basis, as set out in the strategy and initial implementation plan.  That plan is a living document and will continue to evolve as we get additional products, the quantity being received comes on stream and we learn more in Ireland and internationally about how the vaccines work in practice.  It will be an evolving programme and will be a big job for most of the year ahead, albeit fortunately one with extremely positive prospects for the country as we vaccinate more of the population.</p></speech>

Since the committee has my written statement, I will not go through all of it.</p> <p>  Vaccines are highly regulated products and the systems and processes put in place to distribute, administer and record their roll-out reflect this.  As Mr. Goodman alluded, each vaccine is considered by the EMA, which then issues a conditional marketing authorization, CMA.  This information is considered in Ireland by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, which makes recommendations on the use of the vaccines to the Department of Health.  The HSE is then asked to implement those recommendations.</p> <p>  The Pfizer vaccine comes in multi-dose vials with specific time constraints and cold chain storage conditions.</p><p>The national immunisation advisory committee provides the scientific and other advice regarding the management of the vaccine and this advice is updated regularly as more evidence emerges both locally and internationally about the vaccine.  Each change in advice is rapidly acted on and updated guidance is issued to vaccinators.</p><p> The national immunisation office, NIO, leads on vaccine supply and distribution.  In addition, the NIO develops and delivers training programmes for already experienced vaccinators via a range of channels including live webinars and the HSE's training portal, HSELanD.  The NIO produces training and information material and distributes that material as well as providing ongoing support to the process.</p><p> Digital enablement of the programme is vital to its success.  The vision is to have a fully digitally supported process from end to end covering all aspects of the vaccine programme.  This is a challenging programme given the scope and timeframe for the roll-out.  We are attempting to deliver a national digital programme, which would normally take approximately six months, within three weeks.</p><p> The three main processes that must be digitally enabled to have a successful overall offering include the pre-vaccination process, with a citizen registration portal to enable registration, scheduling and consent.  Another is vaccine administration, including validation of citizens' identity, clinical workflow, recording of the vaccine, recording of adverse reactions, scheduling follow-up appointments and the production of a vaccine certificate.  Another process is reporting and monitoring, which is critical and includes reporting and management of data, adverse reaction tracking etc.  This delivery of the system and functionality is being undertaken in stages utilising an agile methodology.  The process involves constant collaboration with the stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage of the project.  Integration of the individual health identifier, IHI, is critical to enable the HSE to safely administer the vaccine.  IHI integration is now live on the system.</p><p> The core element for records about the vaccine has been operational since 29 December 2020.  The system is operational across 680 healthcare facilities and is being used by 3,600 healthcare staff who are licensed users of the system.  The general practitioner element of the portal is now live, which allows GPs to register to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.  Once a person presents for vaccination, he or she is validated by an administrative staff member and then the person who is administering the vaccine records the details of the vaccination.  The data are stored on the Salesforce system.</p><p> Progress to date includes integration of the system to the HSE service directory entries for more than 2,500 facilities including healthcare sites and new clinic locations.  IHI integration is available, enabling access to real-time GP tables, professional ID validation and Eircode validation.  The teams are working towards integration with GP systems to receive vaccine records.  By Wednesday, 27 January, the HSE had administered a total of 161,500 vaccines across a variety of settings including long-term care and healthcare workers.  The HSE will continue to roll out the vaccine programme in line with the Government strategy over the coming months in line with vaccine supply.  The HSE works in an integrated way with the high-level task force on Covid-19 vaccination, as Professor MacCraith stated, and colleagues in the Department of Health, other Departments and a range of State, voluntary and private agencies to ensure that this programme is successfully delivered.</p></speech>

We acknowledge all the work done so far, particularly with regard to the front-line workers.  We recognise the job they are doing at great personal risk to themselves and their families and hope this can continue.</p><p> We have come to a crucial stage in the fight against the virus.  We need to keep public confidence on our side.  The public needs to have absolute confidence in the ability of the system to tackle and deal with the virus.  One way in which that will be achieved is by ensuring there is confidence in regard to supply chains of the vaccines.  It would be very beneficial to have daily and weekly updates on the number of days or weeks of supply still available in the system and to relate that to the number of vaccinations taking place daily.  That would reassure the public and it is a very necessary part of the process at this stage.</p><p> We need to be able to indicate progress in slowing down the virus, that is, the acceleration of the vaccination programme, while at the same time identifying the period, between the roll-out of the vaccination programme and the introduction of restrictions, by which it is presumed the virus is being curtailed.  I acknowledge that we are gaining ground at present, as the recent figures indicate, but we had a problem over the past five or six weeks and we do not want to lose that progress.</p></speech>

The plan from the HSE is that once the IT system is fully up and running, there can be daily updates on the vaccinations.  The whole system is driven by supply and it varies often.  Since I started in this role, there have been up to ten changes in the information on the supplies of the various vaccines.  We have a level of confidence for this quarter, although it was dented in recent days by the AstraZeneca issue and we are awaiting clarity on that.</p> <p>  We are sticking to the principle of administering vaccines as soon as they arrive.  We work right to the edge of the supply that is available.  No vaccines are resting in the fridges or freezers in any given week and I can share those figures with the committee.  We have been adhering to that.  As an example, in the three weeks up to Sunday last, the average number of vaccines administered per week was 48,000, which equates approximately with the volume of supply.  We are adhering to the level of supply, therefore, and trying to manage the situation to keep a supply available for the second dose.  As the committee will be aware, the three vaccines we are considering at the moment are dual-dose vaccines.  I am happy to share the figures with the committee, and I agree with the Deputy about the public confidence issue and ensuring the vaccination rate adheres to the principle we set out.</p></speech>

There have been times where we have got close to requiring the deliveries to be coming in for the next lot of vaccines, but we are trying to titrate the vaccines we send out and to ensure we can fulfil our obligations.  Obviously, there were plans for the long-term care facilities to be vaccinated, so we ensured there was vaccine for all of them and for the second doses.  It is a complex process to ensure we can meet all those commitments at the correct time.</p> <p>  We need to remember that vaccines are very complex and sensitive biological products.</p><p>The storage and distribution even when bringing them into Ireland can be difficult.  Obviously, if there is a problem on a ferry or a difficult shipping crossing, the vaccines may not be able to get to Ireland on a particular day.  It is, therefore, something we are always aware of and we are always watching to make sure we know what is happening with our supplies.</p></speech>

We are working towards that and it is our desire to do it.  Obviously, the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Reid, is anxious to be able to meet the requirements around that so we are working through it.</p> <p>  As Dr. Henry said this morning on radio, we started the process because we had the vaccine and there was a requirement to commence vaccinating rather than wait for the system to be 100% ready.  Therefore, we went with the functionality regarding being able to record the actual vaccination itself.  We have, however, been working in quite a difficult environment across long-term care and hospital settings, which were not set up for system.  We are still trying to catch up with that element of it.  Perhaps Mr. Thompson might clarify exactly where we are with that at this point, which I believe would be helpful to all the members.</p></speech>

There are a wide number of sites across Ireland and many of them have little or no infrastructure for us to utilise.</p> <p>  There were also some challenges in loading some of the data because they are held by the nursing homes and some were a bit slow in providing us with them.  We have the self-registration portal now working for healthcare staff.  In the next week or two, we hope to be a position where will we have the solution and system in real time, or close to being real time, and, therefore, will be able to provide those figures to people on a daily basis.</p></speech>

A daily or nightly update like that could be hugely important in reassuring the people.  In the event of extra vaccines becoming available, the witnesses might consider providing daily information on news bulletins on the use of mass vaccination centres where it might be possible to accelerate progress, which is hugely important in reassuring the people.</p></speech>

We are under significant pressure from our CEO and the Minister to achieve daily reporting as quickly as possible.  Both operational staff and staff from Mr. Thompson's division are working hard to achieve that and are currently working through backlogs of data uploads.</p> <p>  To take members quickly through mass vaccination centres, our next targets are to finish off any residual vaccinations required in long-term care to go back to complete category 2 in the Government strategy, which is front-line healthcare workers.  Given the numbers, that will be a precursor for mass vaccinations with mass vaccinations sites to follow as soon as supply allows, which I believe the Minister said is in March.</p></speech>

It is important, from our perspective, that we do not over-promise and that there is a clear link and connection between what is being said by those rolling the vaccine out on the ground and what is being said at a political level.  I want to make that point first so that we do not overpromise in any of this.</p><p> It was stated by Mr. Goodman that there is a lot of intense interest in the vaccine, and, obviously, there is.  I see that as important, something that we should value and something that we should seize upon because ever before a vaccine was approved or a dose came onto this island, the debate and question was whether people would take the vaccine.  That question has been answered by the huge demand right across society for the vaccine.  That is important.  It needs to be recognised and valued and then we have a responsibility to deliver.</p><p> Professor MacCraith stated either in his opening statement or in response to a question that the supply depends on what we get from the various different pharmaceutical companies.  There has been, the professor stated, ten different changes.  We accept that as well.  Obviously, to some degree the task force is at the mercy of the providers of the vaccine, but Professor MacCraith stated that there was reasonable confidence for the first quarter of this year in terms of supply.  How does that measure with the Minister's assertions over the past number of weeks?  The Minister was making these assumptions based on the AstraZeneca vaccine arriving.  There has been a revision of that because of the dispute between the European Commission and the company.  The intention was for 700,000 people to be vaccinated by the end of March.  Is that still the case?</p></speech>

Naturally, the simple calculation is to say they are all due to those vaccines and that leads to 700,000 people being vaccinated.  However, as we have learned in recent days, AstraZeneca has indicated a significant drop at this stage.  Currently, that 1.4 million doses has reduced to just above 1.1 million doses while we await the outcome of the negotiations between AstraZeneca and the European Commission.</p></speech>

If I could clarify, there is due to be a second delivery in March from Moderna which the company will not clarify until the outcome of the negotiations, and we just do not know what the total will be.  The current confirmed total up to the end of quarter 1 is 1.1 million doses now but that may change today.  It may change tomorrow.</p></speech>

I thank Professor MacCraith for that.  I will focus, first of all, on the information technology, IT, system.  I note in the opening statement there is still some work to be done for this to be a fully operational and fully live system.</p> <p>  I refer to the first and obvious question that is being asked of us.  When we get to the third allocation group, which is the over-70s, starting with the over-85s, questions will be asked as to how the system will work and how people will be contacted.  Is it the case that the person, for example, let us start with the over-85s, has to contact his or her GP or the system, or does the system contact the individual?  Could that be answered first by Mr. Walsh?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#G00600"><p>The over-85s are a particular group that needs to be given all due consideration.  They place their trust in their GPs and, as have seen through the flu vaccination programme, what worked successfully was where GPs contacted their over-85s and called them in for vaccination.  The intention is the same process will apply in relation to Covid-19 vaccination.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#G00700"><p>I welcome that.  That is the appropriate course of action.  Is that also the case in respect of the other groups right down to the over-70s?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#G00800"><p>Yes.  As one works one's way down that list, there are many people well over the age of 70 who are very active and very mobile, and, indeed, in their 80s and 90s as well.</p><p>The intention is to use the GP network and that bond of trust to maximise the uptake in the older age groups, and that is our absolute target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#H00200"><p>I get that.  For the over 70s, the GPs will contact the people themselves and that is how that will work out.  For the general population, there was a promise of 15 mass vaccination centres or pop-up centres.  Have we locations identified for those sites?  When we get to that point, how will the IT system work?  Is it at that point that people will have to contact the system because, obviously, that will be more problematic or difficult?  Again, how will the system work?  Will people have to contact the vaccination centres and make appointments?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The second question is in regard to staffing.  How many people have come through the training process for vaccinators and support staff who will be in place for the mass vaccination centres?  Are we looking at Army personnel with medical backgrounds?  What is the capacity we are looking at?</p> <p>  Again, in regard to site identification, is that in train and what timeframe are we looking at for these vaccination centres to be in place?</p></speech>

The critical functionality, not only for mass vaccination centres but for the broader staff vaccination process, is to finalise the online portal so people can go on and register on the system, giving the relevant details required for the process.  Second, the system will then schedule someone for a vaccination once they have been registered appropriately, and then, third, schedule them for a second vaccination because we are still dealing with multi-dose vaccines.  The same will apply for mass vaccination centres or more local centres, when they are open.</p> <p>  In terms of training, and I will seek clarification on this, the last figure I saw was that in excess of 5,000 people have completed the top-up modules in regard to the Pfizer vaccine vaccinator training.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#H00400"><p>That is welcome and it is a lot of staff.  However, there are questions being asked in regard to the role of pharmacists.  There are 2,500 pharmacists, who, obviously, can play a crucial role.  The Minister said yesterday in the D&aacute;il that dentists will also play a role, which is great, and it is all hands to the pump as far as I am concerned.  However, the Irish Pharmacy Union is concerned that pharmacists have not had any assurances in regard to when their staff will be vaccinated and when they will be part of the vaccination process.  My understanding is that, from what they have been told, pharmacists may not be part of the roll-out for the over 70s, and there is a concern that GPs will be part of it but not pharmacists.  I ask Mr. Walsh to give clarity in regard to the role of pharmacists, first, in regard to when they will be vaccinated, and, second, on their role in regard to the vaccination programme.  Third, if pharmacies are not going to play a role until we get beyond the over-70s, when the Minister says dentists will play a role, at what point will they come into the equation as well?</p></speech>

Pharmacists potentially have two critical roles within the overall process.  One is that, for larger-scale clinics, pharmacists can add immensely to the efficiency of the operation of those clinics through their participation in the cold chain and, also, in the reconstitution of the vaccines prior to administration.  Second, community pharmacy will definitely have a very large role in the overall roll-out of this programme.  When we consider the numbers, although I do not have them in front of me, if there are nearly 500,000 people over the age of 70 in the country and our target for vaccination is ten times that figure, I think community pharmacy will have a huge role.</p></speech>

Before I go into the preliminaries, rather than get a written answer I will reiterate the question Mr. Walsh did not completely answer on the role of pharmacists in the roll-out of vaccines to the over-70s.</p></speech>

The clear relationship there is between the GP and the older person.  There is potential for people over the age of 70 to access the pharmacy line once that is set up, but from my own experience, in particular for the older group, the GP option is the one that they seek.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane also asked about the vaccination of pharmacists.  It is a priority that people who act as vaccinators are offered the vaccine.  Prior to commencing as vaccinators, GPs are currently being offered vaccination, as are their practice nurses, and the same will apply to pharmacists prior to them being asked to act as vaccinators.  They are also front-line healthcare workers in their own right, so as part of the second category in the Government's strategy, they will be offered vaccination in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Generally, the debate and discussion on the issue needs to calm down a little bit.  This committee meeting could serve a useful purpose for a resetting of the clock.  It is not useful or helpful to talk about overpromising.  What was said was based on figures that were available to us at the time.  We are all disappointed about AstraZeneca.  It is 29 January and I suspect by 27 or 28 February we may be in a different position given forecasting about other vaccines.</p> <p>  I am very grateful to Professor MacCraith for the clarification of his role.  From a communications point of view, between the high-level task force, NPHET and all the other bodies, one voice would be great.  Professor MacCraith has the co-ordinating role, so he has the benefit of having all the knowledge and information from the various inputting bodies.  We could use today as a reset.  We had expectations because of circumstances beyond the control of everybody.  Those expectations are not going to be met, certainly by AstraZeneca.  We should not be afraid of overpromising.  There is really good news about Novavax.  I would welcome any news Professor MacCraith has on Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and its vaccine in terms of timelines.</p></speech>

I spoke to the European lead of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  The name of its vaccine is Janssen.  It is expecting to announce the clinical trial results in the coming days and to submit to the Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration, FDA, in the first instance in early February.  What normally happens is that the submissions to the European Medicines Agency, EMA, would happen not too long after that.  We are hopeful of a positive outcome for Janssen.  It is very attractive because it is a single dose vaccine.  We hope there will be a positive outcome some time in March but these things remain uncertain.</p></speech>

I had questions on pharmacists and dentists.  Again, there was a big frenzy.  I have had emails.  All of the questions have been answered very calmly.  There is an answer to all these questions.  Media abhor a vacuum.</p><p>One of my key messages today is that everyone should just calm down.  The questions get answered.  The questions the pharmacists have had have been answered reasonably cogently this morning.  Politicians have a role in this.  Everyone is anxious to receive the vaccine.  I wish to clarify and confirm that the deadlines for the vaccine commitments up to the end of February will be met.  It is my understanding that up until the end of March there is an issue but that up until the end of February the task force is on target, supply-wise.</p></speech>

Things can change but at the moment we have very strong assurances, which are contingent on AstraZeneca getting approval today, which we expect.  However, we have clear numbers up to the end of February and similarly for Pfizer and Moderna.</p></speech>

The arrangements we have come to between the State and general practitioners and pharmacists on fee arrangements provide for two scenarios.  One is where the professional is providing the service in his or her own premises, in other words, a GP surgery or community pharmacy.  There is also an arrangement whereby the HSE takes on vaccinators or brings people in to do sessional work in a mass vaccination centre.  General practitioners and pharmacists can both fulfil that role as well so we have an arrangement in place that covered both options.  It provides flexibility and reflects the fact that we cannot predict exactly what the balance we will need will be as the programme develops.</p></speech>

There has been talk about overpromising and people being overly critical.  I want to emphasise the message that the system needs to be given an opportunity and time to respond.  I am satisfied so far with the answers we have received this morning.  On the roll-out by GPs and pharmacists, does it apply to the AstraZeneca vaccine only?  What other vaccines that may come on stream might be administered by GPs and pharmacists?  To clarify, I take it dentists may assist those teams in the mass vaccination scenario so I am inquiring about GP roll-out for other vaccines.</p></speech>

Obviously, an awful lot depends on what we hear today about the AstraZeneca vaccine and whatever determination the European Medicines Agency comes to in that regard and also whether it makes any comment on the age dimension, a bit like what we have heard from Germany.  Absent that, the original plan was certainly that the AstraZeneca vaccine would be used, through the GP network, to address cohort no. 3, which is the over-70s.  If for any reason that does not happen, the contingency plan at this stage is to use the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for that cohort.</p></speech>

There are other factors which might emerge today in terms of the dosage interval as well.  All of these factors add to the uncertainty.  Part of the work the task force is doing is to model through those very scenarios and then give advice to the various aspects of the structure the committee heard about earlier on.

The key issues that have concentrated the minds of people are the roles of GPs, pharmacists, dentists and others and questions about the establishment of mass vaccination centres.  We have confirmation, insofar as it is possible, of the continuation of supply, as promised until the end of February, and we have also learned that the best approach is to take this day by day.</p><p>Admittedly, there has been an interruption in the supply of AstraZeneca vaccine that was committed to but there is good, positive news on Novavax and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which may bring us better news in March.  There have been too many voices in this debate.  The information we have just received is excellent.  I look forward to the witnesses appearing before the committee again.  If we have learned any lesson since the vaccination news was launched, it is that we must take it day by day.  Every question that stakeholders and other vested interests, including the community and individuals, have had gets answered.  The answers may not be the answers people want but the questions are answered.  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing and all the agencies they co-ordinate in the teeth of the most challenging of circumstances.  It is very much appreciated.</p></speech>

At the outset, Professor MacCraith pointed out how uncertain the situation is.  We all appreciate that.  It is very fluid and it is changing by the day, if not by the hour.  There has been news today that could be quite a game-changer, depending on how it goes.  We all accept that, and it is important that people be reassured, but the best way to give people reassurance is to provide up-to-date, factual information because the goalposts are changing quite a bit.  It is important that we do not raise people's expectations unrealistically.  That is where accurate information comes in.  It is really important that it be provided to the public generally and also to us.  As health spokespersons and as a committee, we have really struggled to get our hands on up-to-date, accurate information.  There is the weekly session in the D&aacute;il but we have not got too much information from that.  What is the basis on which we are approaching this?  We need to be absolutely up-front with people and provide up-to-date, timely information.</p> <p>  This raises again the question of whom we must contact when we want to get information about vaccines.  That is a genuine difficulty.  I appreciate the attendance of all the witnesses this morning, but the reality is that the lead person in this area is not present today.  There is something wrong with that.  I accept that the lead person is very busy, was on the radio this morning and has a huge amount to do &mdash; too much, in my view &mdash; but, again, I return to the issue of governance and the question of whom the buck stops with.  While it stops with the Minister politically, whom does it stop with in terms of the operations?  There is a problem in that regard.</p> <p>  With regard to accurate and up-to-date information, we are now getting figures twice weekly on the numbers of people vaccinated.  Professor MacCraith said we have the figures on the numbers of vaccines delivered to the country or in the country at any one time.  It is important that we get that information and that it be put on the website of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  It would be great if it could done daily.  I refer to the number of vaccines we have received in the country and how many have actually been administered.  It would be great to get figures daily but even twice weekly would be a big improvement.  Professor MacCraith has said he has those data and is happy to share them.  Will he share them publicly on the HPSC website?</p> <p>  My second question relates to AstraZeneca.  Obviously, there are major concerns over the reliability of the delivery.  If the vaccine is approved by the European Medicines Agency today, is there an expected delivery schedule?  Can it be provided to us in the quantities expected?</p></speech>

My understanding is that Dr. Henry did not get a formal invitation to attend.  In any event, I had asked whether he might be able to join me here but he had another major commitment.  I believe that is the reason he is not here.</p><p> In response to the Deputy's question about up-to-date, factual information, I will set out the current position in respect of the regularity of vaccine supplies.  Vaccines come in from Pfizer once a week; from Moderna they come in approximately fortnightly.  I say "approximately" because in both cases we get confirmation, typically 48 hours in advance.  Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE, has been announcing those numbers at least weekly at his press conferences.  I imagine the HSE would have no problem in sharing those numbers.  Sometimes the way the system works, in terms of the buffer we try to maintain to cover the second dose, is not fully appreciated by everyone.  One has to explain the difference between the number of vaccines that have arrived and those that have been administered at a given point.  I am pretty certain the HSE will have no problem in sharing those figures.</p></speech>

We do not have absolute certainty on those deliveries yet.  I spoke to AstraZeneca's country lead as late as yesterday evening.  We expect to have a delivery in mid-February and one in late February.  The totality has been confirmed twice this week and comes in at 191,000 doses, which is approximately what we were led to believe anyway.  That does not affect our planning.  The issue is the uncertainty from March onwards.</p></speech>

They will only confirm at this stage the 95,000, which is the first delivery.  As the Deputy will understand, it is all tied up with the negotiations and the potential reductions.  The totality for quarter 1 now is 286,000, where we had been planning and expecting 600,000.  That gives the approximate 50% reduction.</p></speech>

Maybe the Chairman will not include the time he has spent speaking to me.</p> <p>  How many residents and staff in nursing homes are yet to receive their first dose?  What is the estimated timescale for completion of both doses to residents and staff in nursing homes?  Are there contingency plans in the event that the EMA today recommends that AstraZeneca is not given to over-65s and will Mr. Walsh share those contingency plans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#M01100"><p>I will start with the question on residents and staff in long-term care.  Taking it in chunks, there are four HIQA-registered nursing homes which have not been vaccinated yet on public health advice due to the scale of their outbreaks.  That includes both staff and residents - approximately 400 in total.  There are probably slightly more staff than residents in that, given the staffing ratios.</p><p>There are 117 nursing homes where substantial numbers of staff and residents who could not be vaccinated because they were either actively ill or within four weeks of having been ill.  Some of those facilities are emerging from that period so our next task is to plot how we will go back and catch up on all those missed people.  I do not have the total figures from those 117 homes but I will seek them.</p><p> This week, we are working through psychiatry of later life services, vaccinating those over 65 years of age, and disability facilities.  We will have completed all residents over 65 years in those settings this week but we will still have a substantial number of staff to vaccinate in those settings and we will commence doing so of the coming week.  I can get more specific figures and send them to the Deputy directly.</p></speech>

I will run through them in order to give the witnesses as much time as possible for answers.  The first relates to priority for people who may be under 65 years, those with heart conditions, respiratory illnesses and so on to receive the vaccine.  I am trying to understand how vaccines will be administered to these people.  It seems that GPs will recommend them to be vaccinated, but we do not have full GP coverage throughout the country.  In addition, there will be many who will be in contact with consultants and might not be in regular communication with GPs.  Is it the case that GPs must trawl through their own files and then contact people or should those who do not have a GP find one?  Should people contact GPs themselves?  What is the capacity among GPs in terms of making contact with people?  Some have huge numbers of patients in their practice who the may not see that often as those patients mainly deal with consultants.  We may not have talked much about the IT system this morning, but I am thinking of GPs' practices and trying to understand the IT set-up, whether the GPs are administering the vaccines themselves or referring patients on.</p> <p>  Also on priority groups, the list puts an order with healthcare workers, front-line workers, special needs assistants, those over 70 years of age and those over 85.  There will be thousands of people in some of those groups.  Will there be prioritising of vaccinating within those groups, say a healthcare worker with an illness or who is particularly vulnerable?  If that is happening, how is it going?</p> <p>  Finally, I have been trying to understand how the IT system will work.  From the early system I saw, it seems that people will be required to create a new account for the vaccination process.  The MyGovID system is intended to be used for exactly this kind of purpose.  In order to avoid the creation and maintenance of yet another single-purpose database containing millions of citizens IDs, will the HSE use the existing MyGovID system as the means to login to the vaccination management system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#N00600"><p>I will comment first on people with chronic illnesses - Mr. Goodman may assist on this - and the system in place for GPs to take on a lot more of the care burden in respect of certain chronic diseases.</p><p> With regard to GPs, I accept there may be exceptions but, in general, GPs keep a very close eye on their more vulnerable patients and are probably the best source of data and information in terms of joined-up registers of who is within their locality.  The Deputy is correct, however, in that if people are falling through the cracks, we need a means of making sure they are brought back into the system.  The same applies to people who are housebound and may not be able to attend their GP clinic.  We need to run through a range of scenarios to make sure that people are not excluded by virtue of their condition when, on the face of it, there is all the more reason there should be-----</p></speech>

Is there a mechanism whereby a nurse practitioner in an outpatient clinic or a consultant can refer somebody for a vaccine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#O00300"><p>Not currently, but there will be a mechanism to ensure that no one falls through those cracks.</p> <p>  I will answer the Deputy's third question in terms of prioritising within healthcare workers.  There are senior occupational health and public health staff within the HSE working on an orderly prioritisation of healthcare workers based not on their grade but on their risk of exposure to Covid-19.  That would apply regardless of their setting or employer, whether they are public, private or voluntary, self-employed or part of an organisation.</p></speech>

When we come to front-line workers, and it involves, say, teachers and SNAs, will that also apply?</p></speech>

We will move on to look at other categories immediately after that.</p></speech>

I propose that Mr. Walsh considers pushing that out to other bands.  Once the system has been worked out, it will probably be in place and he will be able to do that.</p></speech>

I will go to the GP solutions first.  We have been working with the GP vendors to make sure that their solutions can accommodate the vaccine.  The GP vendors and the solutions today are very good at managing the influenza vaccine and the cohorts.  They have functionality within the system to allow them to call in and manage the cohort.  We are working very closely with them.  In round figures, there are approximately 2,700 GPs for whom the system will have to be updated and rolled out to those people, and the GP vendors are in the process of doing that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the use of MyGovID.  We have been in discussions with the Government Chief Information Officer, CIO, on the best way to do that.  On our side, we took a decision that it is something we would like to do in the future, but for simplicity and speed we said we would allow people to register using their own email address and their own password, because in terms of trying to link that into MyGovID, and not everybody today has a MyGovID, we reckoned we were trying to make it as frictionless as possible for people to do that registration.</p> <p>  We are also very keen to make full use of the individual health identifier, IHI, and that, when we are registering people, we are assigning their IHI into the vaccination system to ensure we can uniquely track and trace them all the way through.  It is a very good use of the IHI in this instance.</p></speech>

At any given time there is a certain amount of vaccine in the State.  What is the situation with surplus vaccines?  On any particular day is there a surplus available if there is an issue with either transportation or the roll-out?  If there is a surplus of vaccine per week or per day, how can it be sourced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#P00200"><p>It is fair enough to say that there is not a surplus as such.  Every vaccine we currently have in the State is assigned against a day's vaccinations.  The National Immunisation Office has a very difficult job in managing that to ensure that on a given day sufficient vaccine is deployed to vaccinate those people we have committed to vaccinate.  On occasion, because of the success in getting a sixth or seventh dose out of vials, there may be a very small local surplus after a day's vaccinations.  Guidance has been given out to the system because this has to be used or discarded once it has been reconstituted.  Very clear guidance has been given on how that is to be used to vaccinate priority front-line healthcare workers.  That is quite small-scale.  The National Immunisation Office and the suppliers do a great job in trying to juggle from day to day, especially at this time while vaccine supplies are so tight, to try to meet the commitments we have made.  It is very tight.</p></speech>

I say very sincerely to him that Ireland obviously as a vast pharmaceutical industry.  We have one of the most advanced pharmaceutical sectors in the European Union.  If patents and intellectual property were not in the way, could the production of vaccines be ramped up in any way by our pharmaceutical industry, given that thus far &euro;5 billion in public money has been spent on the three vaccines - those produced by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca -  that will be available to the majority of people in the EU and beyond?  Can Professor MacCraith see any way that the pharmaceutical companies in Ireland and other countries could, particularly in view of the fact that &euro;5 billion has already been given to them, ramp up production to give us more vaccines to roll out as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

The Deputy may have seen the announcement earlier this week that Sanofi has agreed to take on the manufacture of extra vaccine supplies for Pfizer.  This is highly unusual in a highly competitive industry.  In anticipation of this question, I have spoken with IDA Ireland, which is in regular contact with all the pharmaceutical companies here.  Ireland has benefited from the fact that some of the pharmaceutical companies have shifted the manufacture of other elements to plants here to make way for a focus on the vaccine in other locations.  The key issue is that IDA Ireland is in direct and regular contact with all the relevant pharma companies in relation to the totality of their global supply chains, and to see if an opportunity exists.  That dialogue is ongoing but there is nothing to report in actual developments on that matter at this time.</p></speech>

IDA Ireland is in regular daily contact with these companies to explore opportunities as they might arise.  I cannot say any further than that in regard to IDA Ireland, but I did raise the question.</p></speech>

The first issue is the people who have a particular illness, which has been touched on already by Deputy Hourigan.  I refer in particular to people who are on dialysis.  Yesterday, I met a parent whose son is 33 years old and has lung cancer for which he is receiving chemotherapy.  People in receipt of such treatments and those on dialysis, for which they are required regularly to attend hospitals, are very concerned about their access to the vaccines.  Are there plans to co-ordinate with the hospitals in regard to vaccination for people who are at-risk patients?  Many of these people are not necessarily attending their GP and as such their vaccination will need to be co-ordinated through the hospitals.</p> <p>  My second question is in regard to Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the roll-out of its vaccine, if approved.  The advantage of this vaccine is that is given in one dose rather than two.  Its approval and availability would greatly fast-track the vaccination programme, but I understand the earliest it will be available is some time in May.  How many people could benefit if that vaccine were made available and in what timescale, on the basis that it is a one dose vaccination?</p></speech>

On vulnerable patients, there is a considerable amount of correspondence from various senior clinical people across the system to Dr. Henry in regard to the issue.  It is important to understand how the current schedule came about, which, as I understand it, was on the basis of a recommendation from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, to the Department and onwards to Government.  This is where the current scheduling came from.  With regard to when the particular cohort mentioned by the Deputy will be reached, as I said earlier, if we can capture the majority of people through GPs or pharmacies, that is the way to go, but we need to make sure people do not fall through the cracks.  I recognise that there are a significant number of groups that may not agree with the current scheduling and have written to us in that regard.  I am not aware of any process of review or anything like that.</p><p>We will continue to follow the current schedule and maximise the number of vaccines we have to deploy in order to get to those groups as quickly as possible, recognising that where there are exceptional circumstances we will have to put in exceptional measures to make sure that those people can get their vaccination.</p><p> The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson question might pass on to Professor MacCraith.</p></speech>

We would be slightly more hopeful than the Deputy that it might happen in April, even, at best, perhaps late March.  These things are not predictable.  The key point relates to the early results that we expect to hear in the next ten days or so in terms of their clinical trials.</p> <p>  Ireland, through the advance purchase agreement, has signed up at this stage to 2.2 million doses and they will be distributed across quarters 2, 3 and 4 of this year with the estimated peak in quarter 3, but we would expect, perhaps, in quarter 2, to have many hundreds of thousands.  Again, these things are uncertain.  That would be good news and all of those single doses would be single individuals not having to come back for a second dose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#R00300"><p>I refer to people on dialysis.  I am not taking away from people who are in nursing homes as they are an extremely important group but people on dialysis are also a very vulnerable group, in particular, because many of them attend hospital three days a week and have someone collecting them and someone dropping them home.  I wonder if that would be looked at and if they would be included at a very early stage rather, as is now planned, in group 7 of the programme.</p></speech>

Perhaps Professor MacCraith or Mr. Goodman know what that process is.</p></speech>

As colleagues have made clear in the discussion so far, we are dealing with an extremely limited supply confidence and for the next small number of months we hope we will be concentrating on the initial groups.  As we get supply, quarter 2 will look very different from quarter 1.  I am not referring to any patient group here but trying to paint a picture of how we see things playing out.  As we get to have a greater range of products and much more quantity to work with, we will quickly go down this list.  These are not all large groups in the Government table of allocation strategy.  It is only when one gets down towards the bottom part of that that one is into what my might call the other 4 million of the population.  Probably the first million is encompassed within the first ten or so groups.  We will make our way through those as rapidly as we can subject to supply.  The difficulty, when supply is so limited, is selecting out groups on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.<br/><br/>On the sequencing, as colleagues have said, this was developed through a process with the advisory committee.  An ethnical framework is also applied to ensure it is appropriately balanced.  The Government signed off on this.  As everyone appreciates, we needed a framework like this because if we had not had it, it would have been an untidy position to manage.  It is, should the Government decide to do so, open to be reviewed, probably through the same type of process through which it was developed, but it is not something that the Government sees as being reviewed regularly on the basis that one has to let it run out.  As we learn and have more options available, we may be able to take a look at it again.  The essential prioritisation, as we know, was based on the risk profile for groups of people.</p></speech>

When did the Minister for Health tell Professor MacCraith that he was accelerating the nursing home vaccine roll-out that he announced on 8 January?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.467" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian MacCraith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#S00300"><p>The dialogue regarding the decision involved the Minister talking to the HSE so we learned of the process through that.  We think everyone recognised the interest in addressing residents in long-term care facilities as quickly as possible given the external situation.  As regards an exact date, I do not have that information but I am sure we can come back to the Senator, through the HSE, on when that initial dialogue took place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#S00400"><p>Yes.  It would be great if Professor MacCraith could come back to me on that because in a briefing to Oireachtas Members and journalists he indicated that it would be prudent to keep a buffer of vaccines.  Obviously, when there was a change of tack that buffer was used up quickly.  The timeline from when Professor MacCraith said it would be prudent to have a buffer and the Minister changing tack and using up the buffer seems to have been quite tight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.469" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian MacCraith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#S00500"><p>I will certainly come back to the Senator.  The buffer was there for a reason.  In terms of the risk of the situation we are dealing with, the decision was taken to move forward and compress what was, essentially, three weeks of vaccinations in long-term care facilities into two weeks.  That has worked well, even in the light of all the outbreaks.  I can come back to the Senator on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#S00600"><p>That would be great.  Front-line workers around the country were told that their vaccination appointments were cancelled on the day the acceleration was announced.  In Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, they were told on 11 January and the Dublin Fire Brigade and paramedics were told on 13 January.  The reason was the nursing home acceleration.  Was it a good idea for the plan to change so suddenly and create a sense of disarray among front-line workers?</p></speech>

The nursing home vaccines were always allocated.  We knew we were going to use them and we just drew the timeframe forward by one week.</p> <p>  On front-line healthcare workers being vaccinated through hospitals, there was one extremely busy week.  I do not have a calendar in front of me to allow me to specify which week that was.  Many hospitals had arranged clinics in the expectation that they would continue to receive supplies at the same level.  That was never going to be possible given our supply constraints.  A number of the clinics that the hospitals had prospectively arranged were then deferred.  We are now planning for the recommencement of those once we get through the second doses that are already scheduled for the big first group.  By the middle of February, we will be flat out again vaccinating priority front-line healthcare workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#S01100"><p>Is it fair to say that the change of tack and the acceleration of vaccination in nursing homes are the reason a number of front-line workers had their vaccinations cancelled or postponed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#S01200"><p>No, I do not think so.  As I said, there was one big week of hospital delivered healthcare worker vaccinations.  Similar to the nursing home vaccinations and our acceleration of those, the number of healthcare workers vaccinated that week was actually ahead of what was planned.  I cannot recall the exact number but it was close to 40,000, which is a significant number.  That was done because of the amount of pressure in the hospitals, the amount of disease they were facing and to get that programme under way.</p><p>We were always doing the nursing homes.  I do not believe it is true to say that a vaccine that was going to go to a healthcare worker went to a nursing home resident instead.  It is also important to remember that of all the vaccinations done in long-term care, in excess of 50% went to front-line healthcare workers in those homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#T00200"><p>That is interesting because only a week ago Mr. Paul Reid spoke about this at the HSE briefing.  When asked if the nursing home acceleration had led to the cancellation of front-line staff vaccinations he said that was practically what happened.  It is interesting to hear the two different perspectives.</p> <p>  Looking back, what if the HSE and hospitals had known what they know now about the shift that was going to happen and the acceleration?  This is not a debate about who should or should not get it.  Decisions are made and that is fine.  Do the HSE officials believe that those hospitals would have been stricter in ensuring that the most at-risk healthcare workers got the vaccine if they had known their supply was going to be changed?  We know of some of the scandalous stories about hospitals giving vaccinations to people who were not necessarily on the list first.  Do the HSE officials believe that if they had known that it would have been somewhat stricter?</p></speech>

That simply should not have happened.  I think what hospitals did, quite rightly, was maximise the opportunity they had.  There were some errors made and they cannot be repeated.  Anyway, from the middle of February or earlier we will be back vaccinating those workers in big numbers and in strict adherence to the categories as set out in the Government strategy.</p></speech>

However, I am concerned and I believe we cannot ignore the fact that there is a need for a public health strategy in marginalised communities.  We all know that marginalised communities can be bombarded with false information and scaremongering when it comes to vaccines.  It is important that we develop a clear pathway to positive factual information and access to the vaccine.</p> <p>  I imagine the witnesses are aware of Safetynet, which is a primary care facility for marginalised people in society who do not have access to healthcare.  They have reconfigured to respond specifically to the coronavirus pandemic.  The facility has created a mobile health unit.  Those involved have built strong relations with the homeless, migrant and Traveller communities in recent years.  The services they offer are more important than ever now.</p> <p>  We know poor health rates are high in marginalised communities.  We need to come up with a good proactive strategy to combat this with the help, hopefully, of Safetynet and more mobile health sites.  Can we plan to strategise with Safetynet in the coming weeks to promote access to information on these vaccines within these communities?  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?  I believe those involved provide an important service.  I have one more question after the response, if that is okay.</p></speech>

She is working hard to put together the strategy the Senator spoke about.</p><p> Regarding priorities and vulnerable groups, homeless people and other marginalised communities are a very clear consideration and form part of our current thinking.  People living often in congregated settings, including hostels, are incredibly vulnerable.  We are trying to put together a plan to address that specific need, working clearly with Safetynet Primary Care and other similar smaller providers throughout the country.</p></speech>

We know of the Government's categorisation of key workers under its roll-out plan.  However, SNAs are not considered key workers.  UK research shows that SNAs cannot socially distance and have increased risk of contracting Covid-19.  Will SNAs be included with healthcare workers for vaccination?  Similarly, will personal assistants for people with disabilities, whose work by its nature requires close contact, be vaccinated under the front-line healthcare worker category?</p></speech>

SNAs work on the education side.  I did not have them in my consideration for inclusion in that group in the Government's strategy.  I ask Mr. Goodman to comment on that.</p></speech>

The SNAs are in group 9 or group 10.  I am not aware that any formal proposition has been put for consideration.  As we are all aware, there is much discussion about what would be involved in restarting education.  There has been no discussion or proposal on whether vaccination would be part of that.  It is not being considered as far as I am aware.</p></speech>

I reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Lahart, said.  It is very important to bring some calmness to this debate and certainly in this forum.  Terms such as "overpromising" and "kicking a political football about" do not help when many people are on oxygen support this morning and are battling Covid.  I hope we will see AstraZeneca and all the other vaccines we need come through the supply chains right down to community level in the country in the quickest possible time.</p> <p>  I thank those who have joined us from the HSE.  They are doing a very difficult job.  Many of the difficulties that have presented in the past three or four days are not of their creation.  It is a supply chain issue, which will largely need to be hammered out at European level in the coming days.  As we have done at each meeting of the joint committee, I acknowledge the immense work by our front-line health service staff.</p> <p>  Mr. Goodman might be in the best position to answer my first question.</p><p>In the context of the roll-out, from national level right down to county and local health level, I am very concerned that a large cohort of the mental health staff in County Clare and in the University Limerick Hospitals Group have not yet been vaccinated.  We are seeing around the country various news bulletins to the effect that everyone from administrative staff, people who may have the protection of a Perspex screen, to some outdoor staff in hospitals have been vaccinated, yet the mental health staff in Ennis and around Clare have not been vaccinated.  Many of them continue to circulate in the community and call to people's homes and they have not been given that all-important jab yet.  This is very important.  I have raised it with Colette Cowan of the University Limerick Hospitals Group, but still we have no certainty as to when they will get vaccinated.  Elsewhere in the country, I saw the other evening that Bantry hospital in Cork vaccinated everyone.  They have now moved on to vaccinating local GPs, bringing them in very successfully, so there is not parity right throughout the community.  I know a devolved responsibility has been given to each hospital group, but there is a need for co-ordination here as well, ensuring that some rungs of the ladder have not been missed.  In County Clare, they certainly have been missed.</p><p> If I may, I will also put the next point to Mr. Goodman.  It relates to GPs being vaccinated.  A number of GPs have been in contact with me.  In the early days of the registration portal there were some technological glitches which meant that as they put in their data those data were wiped, as I understand it, and they had to re-engage with the process again and again, meaning many of them did not register successfully.  It is only in the past day or so that they have been able to do so.  They are wondering whether that technical glitch will delay their vaccination.  That is what I would like to ask.</p><p> I have a number of further questions to come in on, but perhaps Mr. Goodman could respond to those two initial ones.</p></speech>

I am happy to answer them.</p> <p>  Regarding mental health staff in Ennis, and, indeed, elsewhere, and other front-line staff right across both acute and community services, at this point in time I know the numbers look big but we have completed a very small proportion of the total number.  Starting by mid-February, using the portal, which we will talk about again in a minute, and following the prioritisation document based on the relative risk of exposure of all those workers, they will be invited for vaccination and, based on our projected supplies, we should be able to ensure that all those priority healthcare workers will be vaccinated.  The first doses will be administered in February and the second doses, where appropriate, in February as well, with the tail-end of the second doses happening in March.  People have been very patient.  I have seen correspondence from the executive clinical director for that service, which has been very constructive in how it deals with the issues.  I assure the Deputy that they will be dealt with over the coming weeks.</p> <p>  Regarding GP vaccinations, GPs are about to become part of our critical vaccinator workforce as well as being critical front-line healthcare workers in their own right.  A significant number of them have had their first vaccinations through three channels.  One has been through some of the acute hospitals; the second has been through nursing homes, where they have attended on the day when they have patients during vaccination; and the third has been through clinics set up specifically to help with the vaccination of GPs and practice nurses.  That will be repeated and they will have access to those vaccinations.</p></speech>

I wish to make a few brief points.  It is my understanding - I am open to correction - that many of the child and adult mental health service, CAMHS, personnel have been vaccinated yet they are not offering any programme to the special needs children who are at home.</p><p>There is a whole other debate to be had about how their teachers are engaging with them online.  Many CAMHS personnel have been vaccinated, but from what I can see, CAMHS is not out delivering a service.  The HSE needs to consider this matter.  It is frustrating for mental health staff and GPs to see others passing them out on the ladder.  It is also frustrating for teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to see HSE personnel who ordinarily engage directly with children daily not engaging with those children anymore but nonetheless being vaccinated.</p><p> I hope that Professor MacCraith can consider having ambassadorial roles for people.  In County Clare, Mr. Anthony Daly, our famous hurler, has an ambassadorial role with Covid response teams.  It would instil great confidence in the nation and reassure the public that this process was safe if, as they were vaccinated, people like Ms Katie Taylor, Mr. Brian O'Driscoll and others with a high profile were used in an ambassadorial role.  There is also an onus on Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to do so.  It is okay to have concerns, but it is not okay for a small number of Deputies to spread false truths.  There is a great deal of fake news still circulating.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Nothing frustrates people more than others skipping the queue or, rather, being perceived as skipping the queue.</p> <p>  I feel let down by AstraZeneca and the issues surrounding it.  I hope that a solution can be arrived at quickly.  It smacks of big business taking advantage of a difficult situation, particularly given the &euro;336 million investment made by the EU and, by extension, the taxpayers of Europe.</p> <p>  The witnesses have answered many questions about pharmacists.  Pharmacists are at the heart of many communities and play a key role in administering vaccines.  They have the skills and training and are trusted.  Every year, they administer the flu vaccine.  They do a good job.  Their potential to support communities and provide services has not been realised across a range of areas.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions.  Deputy Crowe mentioned GPs.  What percentage of GPs have been vaccinated?</p> <p>  I have been approached by chartered physiotherapists, who literally play a hands-on role dealing with clients, be they people with bad backs, bad necks or whatever else.  In terms of placement on the list, they are not regarded as being front-line workers who engage with people despite the fact that they have very close contacts.</p> <p>  The situation regarding pregnant women is being reviewed.  Currently, they are at the bottom of the list alongside children and adults.  According to this document, that is to be refined.  Presumably, we are awaiting data from other countries.  What is the rationale?  When will their placement be refined or reviewed?</p> <p>  I hope that only a small number of people have received their first doses out of sequence.  When will they be receiving their second doses?  People have asked me that question.</p> <p>  Many people believe that, if they get vaccinated, they will be cleared to go and will not have to be restricted.  For example, if foreign holidays were permitted, they believe they could go and return.  Some clarity is needed.  Actually, not clarity, rather, it should be communicated that the vaccines do not stop people from transmitting the virus, only from getting ill.  This shows why everyone must keeping doing the things we have been trained to do over the past year and following the habits we have developed and why everyone who is willing needs to be vaccinated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.497" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#W00300"><p>I do not have a figure for the percentage of GPs vaccinated, but they have been vaccinated through a number of channels, as have their practice nurses.  I will try to draw that information together.  There will be another sweep to pick up GPs and practice nurses who have not yet been vaccinated.</p><p>It is clearly critical as they become vaccinators for the third cohort.</p><p> Regarding chartered physiotherapists, it depends on the setting that they are working in and their level of exposure.  They could be priority healthcare workers.  We have engaged with a number of the professional bodies about their members, especially those in private practice who may feel excluded.  If a chartered physiotherapist is working in an environment where he or she is exposed to Covid-19, he or she is the same as anyone else working in a hospital or other healthcare environment and needs to access the vaccine in line with peers with a similar risk of exposure.  I am happy to clarify that.</p><p> I ask Dr. Jessop to talk about the vaccine-specific issues that were raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.499" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lucy Jessop" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012900002#X00200"><p>Regarding pregnant women being of the lowest priority for the vaccine, that was written at a time when we were not quite so clear about some of the issues with the vaccine.  Pregnant healthcare workers are now being vaccinated.  We know that they are at great risk of Covid-19 and are exposed as front-line healthcare workers, so they are being offered the vaccine.  There are some clear guidelines about that and information has been provided by obstetricians and gynaecologists, and answers to frequently asked questions from pregnant women who are concerned about the vaccine are freely available so that they have that information.  Women who are between 14 and 33 weeks of pregnancy are able to get the vaccine if they are front-line healthcare workers.  That has carried on for the last several weeks of the programme.</p> <p>  There was a question about a possible misunderstanding about what the vaccine does.  It is clear in the leaflets that one receives before and after receiving the vaccine that it protects one from Covid-19 and its severe effects but it does not stop transmission as far as we know.  The leaflets and the information that people are getting are clear that one must still obey all the guidelines that every other citizen is following.  We and our colleagues involved in communication will continue to reiterate that information to make sure that people are clear that they must follow guidelines even though they are vaccinated.</p></speech>

We had examples of where family members ended up getting vaccinated at the end of a day in order not to waste the vaccines.

Has any intense pressure been brought to make any changes to the sequencing?</p></speech>

Clearly, that did not happen.  Were deadlines in respect of the ICT system missed?  Will further deadlines be missed or is the HSE confident that the ICT system will be robust and on time and will not compromise the roll-out of the programme in any way?</p></speech>

We are live on almost 800 sites today and it is a challenge to deal with them all.  We have also had to train almost 3,600 users, who were not always familiar with the vaccination process.  We took the decision that we needed to get the vaccine out fast and let the ICT system catch up.  It was much more important to get the vaccine out and to get it working for all those vulnerable groups, rather than to get all the processes and procedures working 100%, as we normally would.</p></speech>

It is a reassurance that everybody has a great thirst or demand for information about the vaccine.  My role is to co-ordinate the expert teams, the Department of Health and the HSE.  The HSE, in particular, has produced extensive patient information and an advertising campaign will begin this weekend.  It has found that what people want is factual information that is relevant to them.  We will roll that out cohort-by-cohort-----</p></speech>

Ms Headon is correct that the information has to be accurate but, unfortunately, we live in a world of social media, where information has to be provided quickly as well.</p></speech>

Forty days ago, we did not have a single vaccine dose available, but in forty days' time, we will have four different vaccines.  I have a couple of specific questions.  On front-line healthcare workers, a category that includes home help, there seems to be a differentiation between HSE employees and private employees contracted with the HSE.</p><p>Can Mr. Walsh clarify that they will all be treated the same?  </p><p> Mr. Walsh might highlight what is happening with the availability of the vaccine for carers.  Can Dr. Jessop confirm if there is any up-to-date information available with regard to a vaccinated person being able to transmit the virus?  Have we any new evidence as of yet?</p></speech>

With regard to home help or home support workers, as far as I am concerned it includes HSE direct employees, contracted employees through the various agencies and people working entirely in the private sector.  This is about a population vaccination programme and about front-line healthcare workers.  It does not matter who their employer is.  I am clear on that.  It adds significantly to the figures of front-line healthcare workers.  The various representative bodies write to me regularly about it.</p> <p>  Carers, by which I mean family carers, are currently not encompassed within that.  I know it is a source of unease among that group.  Dr. Jessop might respond.</p></speech>

There were tens of thousands of people in the studies, obviously, but that would not have been enough to be able to pick up whether it reduced transmission now that several countries are quite far on with their vaccination programmes.  Some of that data will be becoming available and we will be updating our information as soon as we have more data around that.</p></speech>

I have one quick question for HSE.  Mr. Walsh mentioned earlier that residents aged over 65 in disability and long-term care facilities have been vaccinated.  That is great.  Why have the staff not been vaccinated?  It is similar to staff in nursing homes.  There is much concern about this.  Can Mr. Walsh clarify when they will be vaccinated?</p></speech>

They are due to be vaccinated.  The latest they will be vaccinated will be as part of the recommenced front-line healthcare worker programme.  What we wanted to do across disability facilities was impacted by the supply glitches over the last couple of weeks, which reduced the supply available for that.  We would have liked to do all residents and staff in those congregated settings.  It is still our intention to do so.</p></speech>

Could the witness come back to us on that whole process regarding healthcare workers at risk and how he can reconfigure and reprioritise that area?  Mr. Walsh mentioned the 117 nursing homes and the staff who are ill.  Perhaps he could give us an update on that and the up-to-date IT systems for 2,700 GPs at some stage in the future.  Perhaps he could reassure people that none of this vaccine is going to waste and it is not being dumped at the end of the day.  That is a reassurance we can take as read here today.  We look forward to hearing from Mr. Walsh again in the next couple of weeks.  A huge responsibility is on him and all his colleagues.  We wish them well.  If we talk about a shining light, the vaccine has that potential .  We are hoping it is a game-changer.  There is still much concern about the efficacy of the various vaccines.  Mr. Walsh has clarified many of the concerns today, however.  I believe it is the start of a conversation we need to continue.  I wish him well in his work.</p> <p>  The committee will meet again in public session next Tuesday, 2 February at 10 a.m. when we will get an update on addressing how nursing homes are coping with Covid-19 issues with representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland presenting to the committee.</p></speech>

I wish to remind members that, since they are attending remotely, the Debates Office has asked that each speaker be clearly identified by name to help ensure the accuracy of the Official Report.  If members clearly identify themselves and state that they are within the confines of Leinster House, it would be helpful for the committee.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely by Ms Mary Flynn, acting director, and Mr. Brendan Kenny, deputy chief executive, from the Dublin Regional Housing Executive, DRHE.  We are also joined by Dr. Una Burns, head of policy and communications with Novas, Professor Eoin O'Sullivan, who is a professor of social policy at Trinity College Dublin, and Ms Alice Leahy, director of the Alice Leahy Trust.</p> <p>  A number of opening statements and briefing material have been circulated to members.  I realise that we did not get all the opening statements.  We will try to get those statements and put them up on the Oireachtas website.  I will ask the witnesses to make their opening statements presently.  Members will then be invited to address their questions.  Members should confine their questioning to five minutes, and that includes time for the witnesses to respond.  If we stick to that, we should be able to get in a second round of questions.</p> <p>  Members attending within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions.</p><p>This means that they have have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything that they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty, as Chair, to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p><p> For witnesses and members attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to that effect.

We welcome the invitation and look forward to the session this morning.  We circulated my report on Wednesday so I expect everybody to have it by this stage and will not go through it in detail.  It is broken down into four parts.  The first part refers to family homelessness in which there has been a significant improvement over the past two years or so. Good progress continues to be made on that aspect of homelessness.  The second part refers to single adults, which is far more complicated and on which we have not made as much progress.  There are just over 3,000 single people now in the hostel system in Dublin city, which is 1,000 more than were in the system two years ago.  The third part refers to deaths and persons finishing in homeless services, and a small number of deaths on the streets.  The fourth part refers to our response to the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme on homelessness that was aired about two weeks ago.  We are happy to take questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation and opportunity to share the experience of our clients who live in our services and whom we work with in the community.</p> <p>  Novas is a national homeless charity and an approved housing body.  Annually, we support more than 5,000 people who are homeless, at risk of homelessness or experiencing addiction.  We provide services in Dublin, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Kerry and west Cork.</p> <p>  Today, I will focus on the number of deaths experienced among the homeless community in 2020 and provide some insight into why there was an increase in such deaths.  For example, in Novas services, 13 people died in 2020, seven people died in 2019 and six people died in 2018.  From that we can see that there was, even among our own clients who were in our services, a significant increase in the number of people who died.  Some of that can be attributed to the increase in the number of people we supported, but the number of deaths is disproportionate nonetheless.  I will point to maybe a few reasons this happened and to some issues that we can address to prevent the extent of it happening in the future.</p></speech>

The first slide is the one that most people are familiar with.  It shows the number of people in emergency accommodation each month since April 2014.  The most recent data are for November of 2020 and the December data will be published later today.  These are the data that get most attention because they come out regularly each month.</p> <p>  I suggest that is not a particularly helpful set of data but rather that the next chart is much more informative.  It tells us the number of people who have entered emergency accommodation for the first time since the beginning of 2014.  We can see nearly 36,000 adults entered emergency accommodation in the country over that time, approximately half of those in Dublin and the other half outside of Dublin.  The significant issue is that over 60% exited emergency accommodation to housing, either in Dublin or outside of Dublin.  Another significant group exited through other means.  In Dublin, we can see over that period we had nearly 11,000 exits to housing and another close to 5,000 exits due to people returning home or, in some cases, going to prison or hospital.  That is why we are left with that figure of approximately 6,000 at any point in time.  However, that is a bit misleading because it does not take into account the huge number of people who enter emergency accommodation and successfully exit it and stay out of homelessness.  Sometimes the images we have of homelessness are of the rough sleeps, those in tents and in emergency accommodation.  It neglects the fact that the vast majority of people who enter homelessness or emergency accommodation exit successfully, usually to housing.</p> <p>  The next slide shows the shift that has happened over recent years between the exiting to social housing tenancies, either by local authority tenancies or approved housing bodies, or social housing supports, usually in the form of the housing assistance payment.  The balance has shifted increasingly towards people exiting via a housing assistance payment.</p> <p>  The next slide talks about what we have learnt and that we are doing well at present.  First, this is for Dublin.  Dublin runs a very good preventative scheme.  They do not highlight it probably as well as they should.  Every quarter, between 400 and 500 people are prevented from entering emergency accommodation, usually through the provision of the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, which is the basic HAP and up to 50%.  That has been very successful in preventing, as we can see in quarter 3, nearly 500 adults from entering emergency accommodation in the first place.  We are doing fairly well on prevention.</p> <p>  Equally, the next two slides give the committee some information on the Threshold tenancy protection services funded by the DRHE and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It shows the number of contacts, the number of tenancies that are protected and the very small number of households that end up in emergency accommodation following the intervention from the Threshold prevention scheme.  We know a fair bit about what works in prevention and it is proving to be particularly successful at present.  The following slide is the same data in another format.</p> <p>  We can also see, more generally, that since the Covid restrictions on termination of tenancies in the private rented sector - the biggest driver of numbers in emergency accommodation is people coming from the private rented sector - by April 2020 we had the lowest ever number of new entries into emergency accommodation because of that moratorium.  The number increased over the year.  They were declining again in November and, I suspect, again, in December and January, and will in February and March because of the moratorium on termination of tenancies.  If we were discussing this issue this time last year, we would have been told that due to the constitutional position on private property, we cannot have a ban on terminations of tenancies in the private rented sector.  We have, and we have seen the impact it has had on reducing the number of entries to homelessness.</p> <p>  The other issue I wanted to highlight for the committee is that we tend to get focused on Dublin and that the numbers, as Mr. Kenny pointed out, are rising in Dublin, particularly for singles.  Dublin is becoming increasingly unique.  Homelessness is decreasing in practically every other part of the country.  In the south east, numbers have been declining since 2018.</p><p>In the west, the number of adults in emergency accommodation has been declining since the beginning of 2019, and in the midlands, that number has been also declining.  Dublin is becoming increasingly unique.  Whereas numbers there are increasing, outside of Dublin the numbers in emergency accommodation have been decreasing since early 2019 and, as such, it is not a Covid effect and something more long-term is going on there.</p><p> In my concluding remarks I make the point that ending homelessness is possible but it will not be achieved through charity, compassion or caring, sleep-outs, shelters or soup.  It will be achieved through the large-scale provision of State-funded social housing tenancies, funded by local authorities and approved housing bodies with sustainable streams of funding and eliminating current disincentives to maintaining and retaining the stock.</p><p> I thank the members for their attention and I thank Ms Flynn for guiding us through the slides.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to give members our views and to hear theirs.  Yesterday, I forwarded a copy of my opening statement, entitled Wasting Time with People?, to the committee.  My comments are based on our day-to-day, hands-on work since 1973 with people who find themselves homeless.  I have also attached to my opening statement my biography and an information leaflet on the work of the Alice Leahy Trust.<br/><br/>We know that everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas and beyond is concerned about the plight of homelessness.  However, we must ensure that this complex issue receives a complex examination if we are to find a resolution.  Having worked in the field of homelessness for almost half a century now, I would have hoped we could have reached a better outcome than the one so graphically evident on our streets.  Unfortunately, we have not done so, and in spite of the efforts of many and the spending of immeasurable resources, the overall situation has, if anything, worsened.  We still have not reached that point of a holistic, cross-agency, State-sponsored pragmatic response.<br/><br/>Members will note the title of my opening statement is Wasting Time with People with a question mark.  This is based on my experience of meeting people in the statutory and NGO sector who find themselves accused of wasting time with people who, perhaps, just want a little time devoted to them alone.  A great deal of time is required to build up relationships with vulnerable people, and it is only from that base that we can hope to see some change.  Homelessness must be looked at from<font color="#004080"> </font>at least two angles.  The structural causes due to lack of housing, which can be eased by increased housing supply, is perhaps the simplest of the two.  The social and personal issues that can lead to homelessness are much more complicated and require early intervention if we are to halt the slide of vulnerable human beings onto our streets.<br/><br/>The people we meet who present as homeless have myriad social problems related to the complexity of their personal and unique human condition.  Intergenerational poverty relating to poor finance and education, absence of opportunity to work or to have a stake in society all combine to undermine the person.  Struggling families where child poverty, neglect, violence or abuse have never been addressed or acknowledged can all lead to low self-esteem and often<font color="#004080"> </font>result in homelessness.  Mental health issues are too often dealt with through a medical model response alone.  Relationship breakdown and domestic violence can be huge factors.<br/><br/>People become homeless because of their drug-alcohol problem and the challenging behaviour associated with it.  We have a very serious drug problem in our city and in our country.  Wider society needs to be aware of its responsibility and culpability when it comes to the use of recreational drugs.  People who use recreational drugs must recognise the reality that they are supporting a vicious industry.<br/><br/>The Alice Leahy Trust on Bride Road in the heart of Dublin regularly meets people from throughout the country and from other jurisdictions.</p><p>Cities, after all, are about diversity.  Some of these people are linked into services in other areas and this can cause considerable challenges for those attempting to meet their needs in providing shelter.<br/><br/>Tragically, we see homeless people dying on the streets.  We help but sometimes, in spite of our best efforts and the efforts of many others, it is not always possible to save each and every one.  We must support and comfort, give all we can in terms of compassion, but sometimes we just cannot enable change.<br/><br/>Government, interdepartmental and inter-agency collaboration is required to address these profound issues but it is meaningless unless the views of front-line workers are listened to.  Building up relationships must start with accepting people in all their vulnerability and listening to them; they have a right to be heard.<br/><br/>Just last weekend the American author, Sarah Jaffe, was interviewed by Tim Adams in <i>The Observer</i>.  She wrote about front-line workers in New York and the nurses &quot;would tell me that they were getting told, in these exact words, 'to not waste time on things that were non-productive', by which the hospital bosses meant caring, getting to know patients&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that working hands-on with people with complex needs takes time, commitment and a belief that anything is possible.  However, that is much harder than ticking boxes and the comfort of bureaucracy.  It is necessary if we are ever to make a real difference. </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses, their staff and their volunteers for the work they do every day supporting people who are unfortunate and who become homeless.</p> <p>  The four witnesses have made a great combination of contributions because they bring different perspectives, and they largely confirm a lot of what I believe and understand already.</p> <p>  The point was made by Professor O'Sullivan that the profile of people who are homeless, and those who have become homeless over the past five years, has changed.  That is not to say that there are no people who are homeless who have, as described by Ms Leahy, other significant challenges, but there has been a change in the past five or six years that has been driven largely by the lack of supply of affordable housing.  People who have been on the social housing waiting list for many years and who have been in private rented accommodation over the past five years have found themselves homeless.  I commend Mr. Brendan Kenny and the DRHE on the work they have done in Dublin in reducing the numbers.  We are always quick to highlight when the numbers are increasing but these are the lowest numbers in family homelessness, which is great.  We need to see it eliminated.  It is largely down to Mr. Kenny, but I would like his feedback on the funding that has been provided for the voids refurbishment for the city council to do a call for housing, to acquire housing to prevent tenants from being evicted, and to purchase those houses.  I thank him and his staff who have assisted me on a number of occasions and helped to prevent people becoming homeless.</p> <p>  Over the past six to 12 months, there has been an increasing use of private operators to provide emergency homeless accommodation.  The numbers of deaths in homelessness make the point starkly.  Eight individuals died on the streets in Dublin, but the vast majority of the remainder of the 60 people who died were in some form of provided accommodation.  Those numbers say that the people who slept on the street did better and were safer than those who went into the emergency accommodation.  I appreciate that there was an emergency response required, but I will give one example of how the emergency response has manifested itself in North Frederick Street in my constituency.</p><p>The street is only 100 m or so long but seven privately operated hostels have opened on it in the past six months.  They are operated by bouncers and security personnel.  When they were open I would not have gone into a pub in Dublin that had a bouncer outside it.  I will not do so in the future either because it indicates to me that a pub is not well run.  I would not want to sleep in a facility that required security and bouncers on the door.  I have a real issue with that.  North Frederick Street was lived in by Countess Markievicz, Harry Clarke and Oliver St. John Gogarty.  It is an historic street less than 500 m from O'Connell Street.  Concentrating all of these people in such accommodation is ghettoising people who are homeless.  These are people who had been getting on with their lives.  Many of them had been living in rented accommodation.  I would like a response from Mr. Kenny on that.</p><p> My second question is for Dr. Burns.  Dublin City Council, despite all the criticisms I have just made, has clearly made significant strides in reducing family homelessness.  That is due to interventions such as homeless HAP increases and investment in voids and other housing.  What is needed to achieve the same reductions outside Dublin?  While I appreciate the problem is acute in Dublin, there is also a problem outside the capital.  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#F00200"><p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick.  The issue with families has improved significantly.  We are very grateful for the funding for the repair of voids.  The HAP system has made a big difference also, as have the council's lettings.  For example, in 2018, we had only 1,400 lettings in the entire year.  In 2019, there were 2,000 lettings so the supply has been improving and that has made a difference.  Obviously, Covid-19 has also made a difference but even before Covid, the situation with regard to families was beginning to stabilise and numbers were reducing.</p> <p>  Touching on the issue of private emergency accommodation, the reality is that just before Covid we had a crisis.  We needed emergency accommodation but Covid very much worsened that crisis.  We had to empty some of the hostels in the city.  We had to thin out most of the hostels for social distancing purposes and so on.  We had to very quickly acquire hostels in the city as otherwise more people would have been sleeping and dying on the street.  We managed to have only three deaths from Covid during the whole of 2020.  I believe we would have had many more deaths if we had not done that.  Our only option was to go out and source accommodation in the private sector.  We know that the opportunities that came to us may have resulted in high concentrations in the areas where there was already a high concentration but we had to do that.  We believe the vast majority of these premises are managed very well by private operators.  They are being very carefully monitored.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned bouncers.  The only reason there is a bouncer on the street in question is that we received many complaints about problems outside the buildings and we asked a private operator to put on some security.  That made a difference.  The actual operation and management of the premises is not carried out by bouncers and security.</p> <p>  With regard to the deaths, unfortunately, deaths are occurring everywhere.  We have had more deaths in the NGO-managed premises than in the private emergency accommodation.  Deaths are occurring in all premises.  We are concerned at the increase in the number of deaths.  There was certainly a surge from July until the end of 2020 and also in January of this year.  </p> <p>  The bottom line in respect of emergency accommodation is that we just had to get it.  It was an emergency.  We have a good situation now, with plenty of beds to spare in the system.  We would like to think that as time moves on over the next year or so, we will eliminate some of the homeless premises - perhaps those on North Frederick Street - and operate in a more strategic way.  We may convert some of these premises into own-door apartments.  The reality, however, is that we had a major emergency in 2020.  We had to do as we did and we are managing.  We will also commission a company to inspect all our hostel premises in the city on a regular basis.  We will have those inspections in place soon.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the significant contribution Professor O'Sullivan is making to the evidence base of our conversations on these matters.  I also acknowledge two important submissions from other organisations.  The Simon Community has given us a good and detailed submission on prevention and actions it believes need to be taken and Focus Ireland has made a submission on the deaths of people experiencing homelessness and how we - agencies, politicians and the media - should all respond to that.  I strongly commend those submissions to members.</p><p>Dr. Sharon Lambert of University College Cork has an exceptional and timely article in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>today.  Novas and a piece of work the organisation is doing, to which my colleague, Deputy Gould, will refer in the second round, is mentioned in that article.  I also commend that to people to read. </p><p>I will direct my questions to Mr. Kenny and Professor O'Sullivan, and Deputy Gould will direct his questions to Novas and Ms Leahy.  I have four specific questions.  My first is for both Mr. Kenny and Professor O'Sullivan.  Obviously, we are all very concerned by the significant increase in the number of reported deaths of people experiencing homelessness, whether in emergency accommodation or rough sleeping.  I am not looking for an explanation of the reasons for that because I know reports by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and the HSE will look into that, but more what needs to be done now to try to bring that trend down in terms of emergency responses, both from homeless services and the HSE, particularly in terms of addition and mental health supports.  Should we be looking at the practice in the UK of holding adult safeguarding reviews and look-backs when people die in services or care to see how the care can be improved in the future for other users.  </p><p>Specifically on three of the issues that emerged in the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme, there seems to be a clear disagreement between the DRHE, as per Mr. Kenny's submission, and the Minister over local connection.  What exactly is the situation on the ground?  We are still hearing of people outside Dublin presenting in Dublin for emergency accommodation being sent back or turned away.  Also, given some of the very distressing phone conversations we were privy to in that documentary, will there be a review of the freephone service?  Are the relevant local authority staff getting the adequate trauma support that Novas is piloting in the south west to ensure they cope to the best of their ability with very difficult circumstances?</p><p>Specifically on Professor O'Sullivan's last point on housing, are we delivering enough Housing First tenancies annually?  The number was below 200 last year.  Given that he said we have about 3,000 people in this system, how many do we need on a year-on-year basis?  Does Professor O'Sullivan think the emergency measures that have led to the dramatic reduction in homeless numbers should be continued after level 5 so that we keep managing those numbers down?</p></speech>

A very intensive review is being carried out through the HSE by Dr. Austin O'Carroll which we will publish.  It is difficult to know exactly how best to try to reduce that figure.  We are not sure if anxiety and issues around Covid have made a difference.  There have been a number of suicides.  Mental health and addiction are the key issues as far as we are concerned.  They will have to be addressed and we will have to do that better than we have done before.  We are working very closely with the HSE on that.</p> <p>  On the RT&Eacute; programme, we are on the same wavelength as the Minister.  I have spoken to the Minister a number of times on it.  It is a difficult issue.  In the past month, between 60 and 70 individuals have been accommodated in emergency accommodation in Dublin who have come straight up from the country.  There is a significant increase.  This is all happening when there is a restriction on travel.  We have to be careful about those already in our hostels.  If someone were to come into a hostel with Covid, the disease could spread to everybody in it.</p><p> Every local authority has its own responsibility.  We changed the system at the beginning of this year.  We eliminated all the one-night beds, which is a good thing, but it means that we need to carry out an assessment.  We try to prevent people from going in.  We get parents contacting us.  A mother in the west was highly critical of the DRHE for accommodating her son so quickly in Dublin when she really wanted him back.  It is a tricky issue, but nobody is left homeless if there is a risk to anybody.  We are lucky that at the moment because we have beds.  We turned away people years ago because we had no beds, but there are plenty of beds now.  If somebody is genuinely homeless and we have reasonable evidence of that, he or she will get a bed and we will do the assessment afterwards.  Nobody is being turned away at the moment.</p><p> Before the outbreak of Covid, we had started a review of the freefone service.  That got stalled somewhat because of the pandemic.  We will reactivate it.  There will be significant changes in the freefone service in the coming months.  We are conscious of the trauma of staff there.  They take over 200 calls each day and it is a very difficult job.  We have managed our way through the pandemic very well.  Some of the DRHE staff contracted Covid and had to be isolated.  We have had to move staff from administration duties to the front line.  There will be significant changes in the freefone service.  We apologise for the incident that was shown on RT&Eacute;.

One was on housing.  There is a reasonably ambitious target to achieve 663 tenancies by the end by the end of this year.  Housing First needs to be expanded.  I sent an updated slide this morning to highlight that this is a clear evidence-based policy that works very effectively, particularly for those with a complex need who have been sold a part-time programme.  This is a tried and tested cost-effective way of managing this issue.</p> <p>  The difficulty is the supply of one-bedroom apartments.  We probably need a relaxation of the rule that Housing First tenants are only allocated a one-bedroom unit.  We need some flexibility on that.  There is clearly a distribution issue if a person is given a two-bedroom apartment when other people are on the waiting list.  A core element of Housing First is not just the housing but the reconnection of individuals to their extended families, their communities and having space for people to stay overnight and reconnecting with children.  I urge some flexibility on that.  I am not aware of any evidence from the big Housing First evaluations in France and Canada.  There is fear that if people have a spare bedroom, old acquaintances from the street or shelters will want to come in and that may disrupt the Housing First tenancy.  There are anecdotal stories about that, but there is no hard evidence that that is the case.</p> <p>  On a moratorium, before the Covid pandemic, a number of people suggested that we needed a period to slow down the flow of households into emergency accommodation and that that required rebalancing the rights of landlords and tenants.  It was a hypothesis at that stage as to whether it would make a difference.  As a result of the Covid pandemic, we now know that it has made a very significant difference, particularly for families and less so for single people.  The reason that single people are still coming in is that they were not in tenancies and rather were doubled up or sharing.  The pandemic exposed that.  It would be good if we had a period of time so that Mr. Kenny and his colleagues could in some way manage things to stop the extraordinary flow every day into emergency accommodation.  We now have very clear evidence that it has worked.  The current period will end on 15 March.  There would be a very strong justification for extending that moratorium, irrespective of the Covid pandemic.</p></speech>

Today's presentations are encouraging.  The figures are not where we want them to be but are encouraging nonetheless.  It is really good to see that the preventive scheme is working, that homeless HAP is being used as a successful intervention for families and that the eviction moratorium the Government introduced during level 5 is working.  It is interesting to hear Professor O'Sullivan talk about how he would like to see the moratorium extended beyond 15 March, which is the current plan.  I would be really interested to hear how long he would recommend it be extended for, whether we need a whole lot more time or whether quite a short stint might give us a little breathing space in being able to slow down the entry into emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  Housing First is very much the long-term solution when it comes to tackling this problem, but we also need to look at the short-term solutions, one of which is emergency accommodation.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has talked about this as well.  From my perspective as a Dub, I was quite taken aback that people from outside Dublin featured in the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" expos&eacute; were not getting the same treatment and the same access to beds as people from Dublin.  The Minister tells us there is an average of 40 empty beds in emergency accommodation most nights.  It was also quite disheartening to hear people say they would rather be in a tent on the banks of the canal than in emergency accommodation because they felt safer.  I wonder what we need to do - what inspections we need to carry out, what actions we need to take or what support we need to introduce - to make people feel safer in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  I watched the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" expos&eacute; with the same feeling in the pit of my stomach as everybody else and I agreed with pretty much everything that was said in it.  One time I did disagree, however, was when it was said how every homeless person needed greater access to a key worker.  It is not that I necessarily disagreed with that; I just thought, what if we looked at it a little differently?  It was felt that the key worker needed to be there to help people in homelessness navigate through the bureaucracy of finding permanent accommodation.  Is there a way that we can look at eliminating that bureaucracy instead to empower people and to help them get there more quickly?  I would be particularly interested to hear Ms Leahy's views on that.</p></speech>

For how long, it is hard to know at the moment, but I would suggest that it be reviewed every quarter.  The current moratorium will last until roughly the middle of March.  It should be extended by three months, reviewed at the end of those three months and then extended if necessary.  That might get over the difficulty the Attorney General regularly has with this issue of the balance between landowners' and tenants' rights post Covid.  Exit is no longer a hypothesis; we can demonstrate that the moratorium has dramatically slowed down the flow of households into emergency accommodation.  Therefore, if we do want to do that, we know that this is a policy tool that is available to us.</p></speech>

We would argue very strongly that our hostels, our premises in the city, have reasonable standards and are well managed.  A lot of them are managed by the charitable organisations themselves.  They provide food and toilet and showering facilities.  They are warm.  That cannot be compared with a tent, where it is unhygienic and dangerous and they are at risk of being attacked by gangs of young people and so on.  It is very unhygienic.  We get complaints from residents living in the canal area where people are using their gardens for going to the toilet and things like that.  It is a risky situation to be in and many of them are involved in drug activity.  So we still argue strongly that it is a far better option for people to go into hostels.  We can understand that it is not as simple as that and there are addiction issues and mental health issues.  On Sunday night we had 116 empty beds in the system.  I have never seen that in my whole career in Dublin City Council.  The night before last we had 97.  So there are plenty of beds there.  We know it is not as simple as that but, really, there is a serious issue when the most serious issue we have at the moment is people residing in tents.  It is dangerous and unhygienic and there is no need for it.</p><p>We must try to find some way of encouraging people - we are doing our level best through outreach and so on - into hostel accommodation, which is much safer than staying on the streets.</p><p> Outside Dublin, we got the balance wrong in a small number of cases.  RT&Eacute; highlighted that.  It is a difficult situation, what with the lockdowns, travel restrictions and so on.  If people have accommodation in Mayo, Galway or wherever but leave it, come to Dublin and seek out accommodation here, we try to return them to where they have local services and perhaps family connections.  Given that we have had excess accommodation for a few months, though, no one is turned away.  If anyone is at risk of having to sleep rough, he or she will be offered accommodation.</p></speech>

That is a matter that we think about constantly.  We encourage people to use services, but we also encourage them to do things for themselves.  While key workers are essential at the beginning to help people navigate the system, people should not continue needing them.  We are concerned that there is a danger of people becoming dependent on key workers doing things for them as opposed to key workers going along with them and empowering them to do things for themselves.  This is an issue that we should be examining more closely.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Kenny.  In my interactions with the four Dublin authorities, it is him whom I usually call first.  I acknowledge his significant role, assistance and support.  From time to time, all of us politicians encounter people who are facing homelessness.  They are not in the black area or the white area, but in the grey area in the middle.  There are issues and an immediate need for support, and I have always found Mr. Kenny's door to be open.  More importantly, I have found him and the four local authorities to be supportive.  I tend to go to him.  I apologise for that, but I know he gets things done.</p> <p>  I wish to concentrate on two matters in the time available to me, those being, children and other young people in homelessness.  A staggering number of young children are homeless.  We know that children in homelessness suffer higher rates of anxiety, illness and disease infection, difficulties in education, poor nutrition and obesity.  All of these issues have been spelled out for us, but these children also face difficulties from moving around and being unsure of where their homes are.  They are homeless.  There are major issues concerning the emotional stability and vulnerability of these children and their mothers, parents, guardians or whoever is with them.  Will Ms Leahy outline to the committee her first-hand experience of the challenges and difficulties associated with homeless children and young people?</p> <p>  We know anecdotally, from experts and from everyone working on the ground, that the cohort of people of 17 to 28 years of age who are transitioning from detention in the prison system or institutional care is exceptionally vulnerable in a range of ways.  When someone is homeless, he or she is vulnerable to exploitation, prostitution, alcohol, drugs, crime and other travesties that damage people's lives.</p><p>There are significant challenges with integrating, mixing and socialising the same cohort of people.  We have to do something about that group.  I ask the witnesses to focus on the significant challenges of homelessness for young children and their parents, who are invariably young too, and the challenges relating to people coming from institutional care.  I would like to hear first-hand experiences.  I ask Ms Leahy to address it first and I would be interested to hear other people's views.</p></speech>

We do not work with children because we do not have the facilities and it would be too dangerous.  However, we are acutely aware of the group of young people that the Senator speaks about.  In our early days working here, all the people we met came from the institutions of the State.  It is in the past now but we still meet people from those days.  It is shocking to see young people coming from care with nothing in place.  More than any other group, they need compassion.  That might be the wrong word to use but they need to be helped, understood and supported on the next step of the way because that is the most crucial one in their lives.  They can so quickly get sucked into homelessness and relationships that certainly would not help them.  This is important and it is why I said earlier that we need to look beyond just housing and have all the services in place to help young people to use the housing.  I know there is a good project in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It should be replicated throughout the country.  We can only do this if we listen to the young people, have patience, give them time and try to understand what they are going through.</p> <p>  Whatever we do, we need to make sure that it is a way to support them.  "Rescue" is the wrong word to use because if they are not supported at this vulnerable stage, their future is bleak.  What resources are there before they leave?  We need to get the help to them at the beginning but when they end up in care, what resources are in place to enable them to move forward with some degree of confidence?  That has to be addressed by government agencies and people like the Senator who are in a position to do something.  That will only happen if the front-line workers who are attempting to support these young people are listened to.  One needs to be with people.  It is challenging and difficult but it is essential.</p></speech>

Novas has worked with children who are homeless since about 2005.  It was a rare occurrence at the time and the work was largely preventative.  What Professor O'Sullivan spoke about, regarding Threshold's work to prevent homelessness, is vital.  Homelessness among children is an adverse childhood experience.  It is probably one of the worst adverse childhood experiences and the longer it goes on, the more enduring and difficult it is for children to deal with it.  It is important that we prevent children and families from becoming homeless.  The pandemic bringing about the moratorium in evictions has been important in stemming the flow into homelessness.  We can learn much from that and we need to extend it.</p> <p>  When children become homeless, evidence both nationally and internationally has shown that the duration of their homelessness needs to be kept to a minimum.  Six months has been the key point for families spending time in hubs.  It needs to be less than that.  The longer it goes on, the worse the childhood experience becomes and the greater the impact in later life.  We need to use hubs for short periods as safe environments which are supported by resettlement staff to get people into long-term secure tenancies.</p><p>Sharon Lambert has spoken about this on numerous occasions.  Adults who live in homeless accommodation, particularly those who are entrenched in the cycle of homelessness, will often have spent periods homeless when they were children.  In 20 years' time, for example, the impact this will have on children may be significant.  Prevention, therefore, is essential, whether that is through HAP, direct builds or whatever it is.</p><p> Senator Fitzpatrick asked about the issue in other parts of the country.  The HAP discretion rate outside Dublin is 20%, while in Dublin it is 50%, which is a key issue because the 20% rate is just not enough.  Simon Communities published a report earlier this week that showed that not one property in the private rented market in Limerick can be accessed through HAP, nor even through the 20% elevated homeless HAP.  If it is working well in Dublin, we probably need to consider rolling it out elsewhere, even on an interim basis until more public and social housing becomes available.  Again, it is about prevention and that we is what we need to examine.  Instead of trying to fix the problem afterwards, we should get in there before the person becomes homeless.  That is vital.</p></speech>

I allowed that section to run over time because the issue of homelessness among children is extremely important, given that it concerns them at the formative stage of their lives.</p></speech>

That is partly because families have been exited from emergency accommodation at accelerated rates.  While that may not be enough, the figure had increased from 500 to 4,000 in a period of five years and is now dropping rapidly.  It might be worth exploring the reasons for that in different regions.</p></speech>

My questions relate to standards of reporting and the practice of refusal, and they are for the providers.  Ms Leahy spoke to the standards of accommodation being provided by both private and public operators.  In her view and from her experience on the ground, are they safe environments in which privacy is given where needed and where the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues are met?</p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Kenny, with respect to standards in private and NGO homeless accommodation, are inspections carried out to ensure that standards are met?  If not, are accommodation providers being sanctioned?  Can the DHRE provide annual reports that include financial statements with details of capital and overhead spending?  This is vital for transparency and accountability.</p> <p>  On refusal, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the programme for Government are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to accommodation when requested.  Last week, however, "RT&Eacute; Investigates" illuminated the issue of people being refused accommodation for not being from the area or county.  Can Mr. Kenny speak to this?  If someone is not regularised or is without a PPS number, or for whatever reason is being refused either one night-only or long-term accommodation, what can the DHRE do to ensure that these people have safe accommodation?</p></speech>

Certainly, from what we hear from people who come to us, some hostels are very well run.  Nevertheless, there has been an increase, as Senator Fitzpatrick and Mr. Kenny noted, of privately run hostels and we have received complaints about some of them.</p><p>When we get a complaint, we encourage the person who comes to us with it to complain to the DRHE.  We have been in contact with it about some of those hostels and it dealt with any problems we raised.  I thank Mr. Kenny for that.</p><p> I believe that if hostels, privately-run or otherwise, are getting a lot of State aid they should be inspected.  People need to see if those places are comfortable and safe.  There is a terrible danger when one talks about inspections whereby somebody goes in and does not capture the humanity of the staff, which is required by the people staying there.  It is a bit like the bureaucracy where somebody rushes in, has everything in order and, perhaps, does not listen to the little nuggets of companionship or comfort.  I believe we need to look at hostels that are being run as a business, because many of those hostels are referred to.</p><p> On the other hand, emergency accommodation had to be found.  This is where we are at now and it is a good time to look at the whole picture.  Are these hostels suitable?  Why do we need to have so many privately-run hostels?  Are the services available or even allowed into those hostels?  We need to acknowledge, though, it is not too long ago that the mantra was to get rid of all the hostels.  There are, however, many long-established hostels around which a certain ethos has developed.  Perhaps, that is why they were set up.  They are very different from privately-run hostels, however.</p><p> Certainly, if a lot of taxpayers' money is going into these places we need to ask questions.  We need to ask if people feel safe and comfortable.  There is certainly drug-taking in hostels.  That has come across as a clear concern with people being afraid.  If places are properly run, people should be able to live safely even if it is only for a short time.  These, however, are issues our public representatives need to address.</p></speech>

That is monitored overall by the DRHE.  We are now in the process of transferring that framework to other premises that are managed by private operators.  We carry out inspections, however.  We inspect the private premises probably more often than we do the NGOs.  We also have this system where we respond almost immediately to any complaint that comes into us, perhaps within an hour.  We also have in-reach services going into private premises.  That can be like the HSE's social workers or our own in-house support workers.  If they see anything wrong or out of place, they are asked to report it to our standards team straight away and that is quickly addressed.</p> <p>  In the past year or two, we brought back some retired staff to carry out inspections on a regular basis.  We want that on a more professional basis.  We are now in the process of undertaking a procurement process to get an independent company to do inspections of all hostel premises in the city, both NGOs and private.  When that process is complete, which should be in the next month or two, we will have that company operating right through the city and all reports from those inspections will be published.</p> <p>  With regard to annual reports, we do a report every month to our councillors.  It is circulated to media, and it is not just councillors in Dublin city but those in the three counties as well.  There is no obligation for the DRHE to make up an annual report.  There has, however, been a request to do so in more recent times so we will do that, absolutely.  The previous organisation, the Dublin homeless agency, did it back in 2015.  Therefore, we will have an annual report to be published hopefully at the end of March.  We are under pressure because of Covid-19 but we will do that every year.  We have all the information people are looking for.  If there was any lack of transparency in recent months it is because we simply had to move administration staff to the front line.  We could not keep up with the number of requests.  Much of that information about finance and capital funding and so on is already on the Department's website.  The committee will, however, have an annual report from DRHE before the end of March and one every year from then on.</p></speech>

These are interesting topics and people are getting a lot of information out of this, so I am trying to manage the time as best I can.  I call Senator Rebecca Moynihan.</p></speech>

I thank the participants for coming today and, in particular, I pay tribute to Brendan Kenny.  I have worked with Mr. Kenny on Dublin City Council for the last ten years.  He is one of the great examples of a pure public servant.  He has a very can-do attitude and if anyone has a problem, they go to Mr. Kenny.  That is my experience of dealing with him.</p> <p>  Professor O'Sullivan talked about the decreasing level of homelessness in other parts of the country.  What would he attribute that to when compared with the situation in Dublin?  One of the things Councillor Anthony Flynn has talked about is that we do not have the numbers for homeless deaths in the country.  For example, we know the figure has increased in Dublin but we do not have a fair representation in Limerick, Cork or Galway.  Perhaps Professor O'Sullivan could give us his experience of that for this year.</p> <p>  On a question to Mr. Kenny, one of the issues that came up in the research conducted by BeLonG To on the LGBTQ+ experience of homelessness was the gendered nature of hostels and how some people, particularly trans and non-binary people, did not want to go into hostels because they did not feel safe.  Have any steps been taken to address that or to collect data on that issue?  Has any work been done by Dublin City Council and what is the Dublin Region Homeless Executive's perspective on that?</p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Leahy and Novas on the vaccine roll-out programme.  Have they had any indication from the Department of where both their service users and staff are on the list for the vaccine programme?  Do they have concerns about where they are on that list?  Mr. Kenny mentioned the DRHE is employing a company to inspect all private hostel places.  How many places are operating in a private capacity?  When does Mr. Kenny expect those inspections to be up and running and what are the terms of reference for that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eoin O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#O00800"><p>I am not entirely sure of the reason for that.  It certainly started in most of the regions in early 2019.  It seems to be related to the fairly dramatic slowdown in the rate of new admissions or new entrants into emergency accommodation, rather than more exits from emergency accommodation.  It is just the flow, particularly for families, so I think it is probably a mixture of both prevention and superior rates of exit.</p> <p>  Dublin will always be in that difficult position and, like any other capital city in Europe, it will have those additional problems.  At this stage, we probably need a dual strategy, one for Dublin and one for outside of Dublin, because the difficulties in Dublin are profoundly different from those in Mullingar, Galway, Limerick or Cork.</p> <p>  In terms of deaths, it is very difficult to know.  I have a difficulty with the term &ldquo;homeless deaths&rdquo; and I think Mr. Kenny has raised this point.  As we said, 37,000 people entered emergency accommodation over the last six or seven years and the number of people who died out of those is absolutely tiny.  While every death is appalling, to say that because I spent a period of time in emergency accommodation or in long-term accommodation funded under section 10, I am somehow to be labelled a homeless death is, to me, profoundly wrong.</p><p>We need to find a new language to describe this because they are not homeless.  As per the Focus Ireland submission, the perception is that they are all deaths on the street when they are not.  We need to be very careful with the language we use around this because it is profoundly misleading.  The same is true with some of the headlines we see about homeless deaths.  They are associated with tents and rough sleeping.  We know the November count in Dublin was too high, but it was 137.  No other capital city in Europe has such a low number of rough sleepers and we need to bear that in mind as well.</p></speech>

Does Ms Leahy want to answer the question on the vaccine roll-out for staff in services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.590" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alice Leahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#P00300"><p>Yes, but first of all I compliment Professor O'Sullivan on the point he has made on the deaths of people who are homeless.  It is a very important issue.</p> <p>  Like everybody else in this country, we are wondering when we are going to get the vaccine.  There are problems throughout Europe with the drug companies and political debates are taking place.  We are very fortunate that we have been able to stay open, thanks to my colleagues, even if we are dealing with a smaller number of people.  One of our directors is a pharmacist and we are keeping a very close eye on when the vaccine will become available to front-line workers.  Like everybody else, we are just going from day to day and monitoring the situation very carefully.  We are trying to stay safe and make sure that all those who use our services and work here stay safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una Burns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#P00400"><p>I echo what Ms Leahy said.  Like everybody else, we are waiting for the vaccine.  We do not have any timeline yet, but we are working closely with the DRHE, the HSE and Dr. Austin O&rsquo;Carroll to ensure our services are prioritised.  In many respects, the homeless services are a victim of their own success because they have done so well in keeping the case numbers low and keeping transmission of the virus low in services that may not be prioritised in the same way as other residential settings that have suffered to a greater extent.  One service in Limerick with an ageing population that has significant comorbidity issues is akin to a nursing home and we advocate that it be prioritised ahead of the rest of our services.  We are just waiting like everybody else and keeping our infection control measures as tight as possible until that time comes.</p></speech>

We probably do not have time for an answer now, but could Mr. Kenny indicate if the figures and information are included in the quarterly or monthly reports?  Could we request that the committee be furnished with those reports as well?</p></speech>

It is 50:50 at the moment.  Of the 3,000 beds in the homeless hostel facilities in the city, about 50% are managed by NGOs and the other 50% are managed by the private sector.  We will publish the terms of reference for the private companies as well.  That is no problem.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Kenny.  I take it from his previous answer on the national quality standards framework, NQFS, that they do not currently apply to private providers.  Why are private providers exempt?  Who made the decision that the standards would not apply to them?  The DRHE website states they will apply to all providers, including private providers.  When will the new standards for private providers be published?  Why will the NQFS not apply to private providers?  When inspections take place, if there are no standards for private providers, what standards are they inspected against?  Could Mr. Kenny address those questions first please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.597" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#P01000"><p>There was never a decision made not to have the NQFS apply to private providers.  The standards framework was done at a time when most of the accommodation in the city was managed by NGOs.  We are in the process of simply transferring the standards to suit the private emergency accommodation.  The same kind of standards will apply.  We inspect private accommodation on a regular basis.  We respond to complaints very quickly.  The inspections focus on the physical standards of the accommodation and issues such as fire safety.  If we get complaints, we respond very quickly.</p><p>However, as I said earlier we are going to put this on a more professional footing now by getting an outside company to do it for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.599" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#Q00200"><p>I do not understand why there would be a separate set of standards for private providers than for the NGOs and not-for-profit groups.  It sounds to me as if there is a two-tier system being set up on this.  There are a number of issues about the private hostels.  There have, for example, been reports of a no chatting rule being implemented in a number of them whereby the residents are told they cannot talk to each other, which is an incredible breach of human rights.  Is the DHRE aware of this?  Does Mr. Kenny have a view on those sorts of rules?  Are they acceptable in hostels funded by the DHRE or has the executive taken action on that?</p> <p>  How many single people who are in private hostels funded by the DHRE have a support plan in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#Q00300"><p>We are not aware of any no talking rules like that.  There is no such thing as far as we are concerned and if somebody hears of something like that they should just let us know and we will deal with it very quickly.</p> <p>  On the last issue about the support, that is the main difference between the NGOs and the private operators.  The NGOs would have more of a support or welfare type service for the people living there.  We have addressed that in more recent times.  We took on 25 housing support officers recently.  We recruited them for the first time.  They did really good work with families.  That is one of the reasons there are fewer families in emergency accommodation.  I think we now have five of those housing support officers working full time with single people who are in private accommodation and they are already making a difference out there.  We will continue with that.</p></speech>

Very few of them would have a support plan.  That is what we are working on now.  I think our support workers have dealt with 700 of them in the last couple of months.</p></speech>

The report says that the DHRE makes dedicated beds available to the rough sleeper outreach team for people it encounters rough sleeping regardless of whether they are from the Dublin region.  Am I to understand that if the outreach team meets people who are sleeping rough and cannot prove a local connection, it is able to place those people in accommodation?  Is it the case that if the central placement service or the freefone worker has said the person is ineligible, the outreach team is still able to place those individuals in accommodation?</p></speech>

We have an unprecedented level of empty beds.  On Sunday night we had 116 empty beds throughout the city.  It means that for the first time in years we have a choice.  If somebody who had a bad experience in a hostel wants to go somewhere else, we are now able to facilitate that.  There is a diversity of accommodation throughout the city.</p></speech>

It is probably important to point out that while this item has been on our work plan for some time, the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme that was aired recently has focused the minds of the public on it.  The stories of Joe, Natalie and Dan show the complexity with which Ms Leahy, Dr. Burns and many others in the homeless sector have been dealing for a long time.  There is complexity and there are those with varying capacities to negotiate what is a very difficult process.</p><p>I echo Senator Moynihan's comments on having worked with Mr. Kenny and on all those in the homeless services.  Mr. Kenny should note I was a little taken aback by the conversation I heard between Joe Nolan and the operator on the &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme because it did not reflect my general experience.  I noted the words that were said.  It is important to reflect on this.  Joe Nolan started the call by stating his name and that he was looking for a bed for the night.  A number of short questions, which were not broadcast, were asked and then Joe asked what the story was with getting somewhere for the night.  The operator started his response with, &quot;Wow, I can't book you anywhere here tonight.&quot;  &quot;Wow&quot; is an extraordinary word to start a sentence with.  Then Joe went on to say he was 59, pushing 60, and the operator responded, &ldquo;Hang on a minute now.  Excuse me, in fairness, you haven't rung here before.  Exactly that&rsquo;s the problem.  I don&rsquo;t need your story because, you know, you can ring the system any time.&quot;  Joe then said, &quot;You don&rsquo;t need my story.&quot;  The operator replied, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">You have registered in Carlow so you should interact with them.  Now that you are in Dublin we can&rsquo;t do anything for you.</font>&quot;  &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; then indicated that the operator ended the call by hanging up.  &quot;We can&rsquo;t do anything for you&quot; does not reflect my experience of how the DRHE finishes a phone call.  I am surprised by it.  It is important that Mr. Kenny comment on it because people must have confidence in the service.</p></speech>

It has certainly put a spotlight on the whole complex issue and the issue of tents in the city, so we welcome that.</p> <p>  With regard to the telephone call, our people take over 200 calls a day.  The one in question did not come up to the standard that would normally apply to the vast majority of calls.  Only part of the call was played on the RT&Eacute; programme.  There was another bit in which the person was given a phone number for outreach.  Regardless of that, it was just not good enough.  We have apologised for that.  We apologise again for it.  It will not happen again.  It is a very complex issue.  It is not just about people coming from another part of the country; it is a tricky one.  It is about eligibility and about the lockdown, in that people are not supposed to be travelling over 5 km.  The bottom line is that even before the incident, or long before it, if people were genuinely homeless and we needed to do an assessment, we waited to do the assessment the next day, the following day or three days afterwards, and we would give accommodation.  We did not get the balance right in a small number of cases, which we regret, but anybody who is in need of accommodation at the moment can get accommodation because we have beds.  There was a very difficult time two or three years ago &ndash; I remember it well &ndash; when we did not have beds at all and when dozens of people were turned away every night regardless of where they were from.  This year is different but Covid has really had a major bearing on the work we do.  The call was just not good enough and we have to learn from that and make sure it never happens again.</p></speech>

The one-beds units are crucial to resolving this issue.  All of us know that.  We are aware of very successful cases in which homeless people have been placed in senior citizen complexes, particularly in the Dublin City Council area.  Will the city council use the new single-stage approval process, for up to &euro;6 million, to provide single-bed, senior citizen-type accommodation, particularly aimed at homeless people but also for the sector more broadly?</p> <p>  On the second issue, Dr. Burns might be able to comment.  Half a billion euro is being spent on the housing assistance payment, HAP.</p><p>It is amazing that the people we use to negotiate that procurement are the most vulnerable in our society - the people with least capacity.  I am taken aback that the State, the local authorities and some of the agencies have not come together to use HAP as a vehicle to fund more permanent accommodation.  Has that been explored?  I appreciate that HAP is not a solution and needs to be phased out.  As a way of immediately funding the development of homeless accommodation it would be an available tool.</p></speech>

The vast bulk of local authority accommodation are three-bedroom and two-bedroom units for families.  We need more of that.  We need more Housing First.  The figures in the report I gave show that 1,006 single individuals exited emergency accommodation in 2020 and 90 of those went to Housing First.  We are making a difference.  We need more of that.  Stage 1 approval will help.  There has been significant reliance on HAP which has been very successful.  It is not a case of moving the money from HAP.  There is also money to build houses; it is just that the process has been very slow.  HAP needs to continue until we get the supply and then we can reduce the reliance on HAP.  HAP has been very successful, particularly homeless HAP.</p></speech>

These are people who are in recovery and are concerned that everyone is being mixed together in emergency accommodation.  They are concerned about the risk of going back into addiction.  Both in Cork and nationally, we need specific wrap-around services for those in addiction and recovery, those with mental health issues, women and young people to help them out of homelessness.</p> <p>  Dr. Burns touched on something earlier.  There is no emergency HAP outside Dublin.  In Cork because the HAP rates are too low and the rents are too high, people are prevented from getting out of homelessness and into accommodation.</p> <p>  I have one question for Dr. Burns and one for Ms Leahy.  Does Dr. Burns believe that people working with homeless people and families should have specialist training in trauma to support people who may be traumatised by their experience of being homeless?  Should that training be expanded to people working in local authorities and the Department of Social Protection?</p> <p>  Does Ms Leahy believe the Government is doing enough to end homelessness, especially for those sleeping on the street in the long term?  What can be done to help those people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.623" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una Burns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#S00600"><p>I agree that front-line staff, social care workers and social workers should be trained in trauma-informed care.  It is a vital intervention to acknowledge the trauma faced by the people we work with and recognise that the consequence of that trauma is how they act.  Their challenging behaviour is not specifically targeted at anybody and they are not trying to be difficult.  It is actually a natural response to significant trauma they have experienced their whole life.  It is often a protection element.</p> <p>  Novas is a trauma-care training organisation.  All our staff from our CEO to our kitchen staff are trained in trauma-informed care.  Anybody who has interaction received enhanced training to support people who have had significant trauma and who come into our services.  We have done some single site research on this which has proved that it has significantly reduced the number of serious incidents in our services so that staff are able to de-escalate incidents more quickly and support people to get into safe space, which is really important.  It would be really helpful if that trauma-informed care approach were broadened out to the ancillary services that homeless people access.</p><p>For example, if someone is going from residential services to addiction services, mental health services or, as Deputy Gould said, social welfare, the local council or accessing housing, it is really helpful if they get the same treatment across the board.  What is helpful for the clients is empowering for the staff because it gives them a sense of ability to do the job in a better way to support people.</p><p> In tandem with that, we need practical responses to support people and prevent unnecessary deaths in homeless services.  As Professor O'Sullivan said, more deaths are occurring in homeless services than on the streets.  We need naloxone to be rolled out to all homeless services, including low-, high- and medium-threshold services, so that we can prevent more people from dying from overdoses.</p><p> Given the significant increase this year in the number of people in our services who were self-harming, who had suicidal ideation and who were attempting suicide, we had to implement ligature training among our staff.  Our staff members and front-line workers have ligature knives in the small first aid kits around their necks that they carry everywhere.  They have had to use them and have had to cut people down.  We need a broad spectrum of supports and they need to go across private service providers and emergency service providers.  I will come back to the point on addiction.</p><p> I will leave it there because I am conscious of the time.  I am sorry because I seem to have missed the email to submit my paper in advance.  In any event, Deputy Gould is absolutely right.  We need more targeted interventions and supports for people who come out of addiction treatment centres.  If they have worked hard to recover and then go back into low threshold emergency accommodation, the risk to sobriety is serious.  There is no progression for them and the risk of overdose is really high because the tolerance of drugs will have diminished in that period.  We need more targeted services for people.  We need small, integrated services that are attached to the treatment service for people who come out of treatment.  This can give them a sense of progression and a chance to maintain sobriety and exit homelessness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alice Leahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#T00200"><p>It is good to hear from Deputy Gould in the real capital.  Deputy Duffy mentioned mental health issues.  I did not have a chance to address that matter.  Our mental health services are not properly resourced.  They never were, but they have to be.  We have to look outside the medical model.</p> <p>  It goes without saying that staff working with people who are vulnerable need support.  That is precisely why the title of my opening statement was, "Wasting Time with People?"  We have to give time to staff to enable them to work with complex people.  We owe it to the staff but we also owe it to the people who need to use the services.  We had a training day in conjunction with Dublin City Council some years ago.  It was effective in helping people to understand how we deal with someone who is different.  Perhaps a person was not as complex as the Deputy had in mind.  Anyway, we can only do that if we have training and support.  We have guidelines for all our staff.  We all work very much as a team.  This is one of the issues in the whole area of homelessness.  We need people with experience of life and living, people who have gone through the university of life, as well as the young people who are bright, caring and efficient.  They can support each other to help the most vulnerable.  Apart from the points made by the members, it requires going back to basics and working from that level.  That is something all public representatives at any level can do, because they have contact with the people in the community.  It is a problem of our times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.626" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#T00300"><p>My thanks for the presentations that have been made this morning and the comprehensive answers that have been given as well.  I am not going to sit here and pretend.  It would be silly to say that we do not have a housing and homelessness crisis, but it is important that we acknowledge the progress that has been made on the issue, not only in Dublin but also in other urban centres.</p><p>We need to learn from the solutions that are working in other parts of our country.  Unfortunately, the Opposition and elements of the media sometimes focus focused on the negatives around homelessness, without giving sufficient acknowledgement of or coverage to the positives.  I have heard <i>ad nauseam </i>that, by every metric, the figures of homelessness are higher than every before.  I tend to tear out the little bit of hair I have left on my head out because such assertions are simply not true.  Last night, I read the figures that were presented by the DRHE very carefully last night.  It was stated that at the end of December the number of families availing of temporary accommodation was at its lowest level since December 2015 and that the number of families living in hotels was at its lowest monthly level since 2014.<br/><br/>We are making progress and that is reflected in Waterford where I come from.  Waterford City and County Council has been able to reduce the number of families in emergency accommodation by 93% in the period between 2017 and 2020 and the individual homeless figures by 55%.  This was despite the fact that the number presentations effectively doubled in the same period.  I am firmly of the belief that if that can be done in an urban centre like Waterford, then it can also be done in other urban centres.  It would be useful to delve into how that has occurred.  Professor O'Sullivan did not really have the time to go into great detail at the start of the meeting when he said that the figures for the south east had decreased dramatically.  The reason that has happened is due to a combination of factors and a commitment to a collaborative and integrated approach to homelessness by the local authority, the HSE, NGOs and approved housing bodies and a focus on preventing homelessness, early intervention, tenancy sustainment and the place finder service.  As mentioned by previous speakers, the homeless HAP uplift is an invaluable tool.  However, the 20% uplift is not sufficient for single people and a more targeted approach with a 50% uplift would be more appropriate.  It has really been the collaboration of all of the parties in an integrated homeless hub in Waterford that has prevented people from falling between the cracks.  Do the witnesses agree that the time for operating in silos is at an end and that we need a collaborative approach whereby everyone is sitting in the same room?<br/><br/>Obviously, the elephant in the room is supply.  We cannot achieve anything in the absence of supply.  It is my opinion that the approved housing bodies and local authorities have to think outside the box in the context of delivering units.  We cannot continue to have the utopian view that the only way to proceed is by means of direct builds, which are not a quick delivery method.  The repair-and-lease scheme in County Waterford has been transformational in the delivery of one- and two-bed units.  I am sure everyone involved in homeless services would agree that such delivery is key to addressing the homeless figures.  In that context, 44% of the one- and two-bed units delivered by Waterford City and County Council in recent years were delivered through the scheme to which I refer.  It is a crying shame that a scheme that has been proven to work is not being utilised to the full extent by other local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It should not be the case that 45% of all repair-and-lease units in the country have been delivered in Waterford.  There is a correlation between the use of the scheme, an increase in the number of one- and two-bed units in Waterford and a drastic reduction in the number of homeless people in emergency accommodation.  Do our guests agree that county targets should be placed on local authorities and approved housing bodies for the use of the repair-and-lease scheme, particularly when, as I have just outlined, it is clearly working in Waterford?</p></speech>

It should be a shining light for other local authorities.  It is amazing.  </p> <p>  On the Senator's comment regarding collaboration, collaboration between the DRHE, local authorities, the HSE and the voluntary bodies that provide homeless accommodation and ancillary services such as Safetynet, has been second to none during Covid-19.  It has yielded excellent results in terms of containing Covid numbers in services and, in particular, moving people and families into secure tenancies during the pandemic.  When we reflect on Covid-19 thus far, it has presented huge challenges for all of us but it has taught us many lessons.  Working in collaboration has yielded better outcomes for our clients.  We are all coming from different perspectives but first and foremost, our perspective is to provide better outcomes and shorter stays in homeless accommodation for people experiencing homelessness.  The Covid-19 pandemic has helped us achieve that.</p></speech>

While he is doing so, I would like to put a number of questions to Professor O'Sullivan.  In his concluding remarks, Professor O'Sullivan said that homelessness can be ended by large-scale provision of State-funded social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  I ask him to comment on the housing policies over the past couple of years that he thinks have been most successful in that regard and on what policies he would concentrate.  Professor O'Sullivan also referenced the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin in an international context.  I ask him to elaborate on that point as I did not fully understand it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eoin O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012900002#V00900"><p>In regard to the number of rough sleepers, the most recent count was over a week in Dublin in November.  Some 137 people were numerated in that week.  The weekly count is a new methodology: previously, it was a one-night count.  Based on the quarterly performance reports from Dublin, approximately 700 people sleep rough over a period of the quarter but the majority are in and out of shelters so it is not that they are exclusively rough sleeping.  Despite some of the comments that people do not go into shelters, the vast majority of people who rough sleep also use shelters.</p> <p>  In regard to my concluding comment, it is very clear from the data relating to the number of people who entered emergency accommodation and exited it that the most successful and sustainable route out of homelessness is social housing tenancies.  There is no doubt about that.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is very useful in helping to get people out of homelessness.  There is no doubt about that but we know also that the private rented sector, because of the legal ability of landlords to terminate tenancies for a number of reasons that are provided for under legislation, is the biggest source of new entries into emergency accommodation.  If we are serious about providing secure tenancies, we need to do it through the local authorities and approved housing bodies and utilising existing stock.  An excellent report produced two years ago by Professor Michelle Norris and Dr. Aideen Hayden refers to the use of local authority stock and the disincentives that exist for local authorities to make maximum utilisation of stock.  Homelessness is not that complex.  There are a small number of individuals who have complex needs, but in terms of our response, it is not particularly complex.</p><p>We know the answers and we know what works for prevention.  We know, from the majority of people who enter homelessness it is the provision of a secure tenancy that will resolve their issues.  They do not need a huge amount of support.  There is a small group that do need that support and we know Housing First works there.  All of the things that we need to end homelessness are there.</p><p> On the overall numbers, our numbers are comparatively low.  There is no other city like us that I am aware of in Europe even with different methodologies for counting.  In England during Covid last March, they had to put 50,000 people into hotels from rough sleeping.  This gives an indication of the scale of rough sleeping in England versus our numbers here.  We have had the trade-off.  We have had a massive increase in the numbers of shelter beds in Dublin but it has had the impact of massively reducing the necessity to sleep rough that we see in other European cities.</p></speech>

We were able to get nearly 100 self-contained apartments very quickly after the first surge of Covid.  These are still in use and this allowed us to take families with children out of hotels and put them into far more suitable accommodation.  We would like to buy them or have a long-term lease.  Currently we have a 12-month contract on the properties, which is the most we could get.  We will expect to be able to extend that but we would certainly like to buy.  All during 2019 and 2020 we were doing 200 homeless HAP tenancies every month but from October, November, December and even into January this has gone up to 300 every month.  This would make a difference out there also.  It has made a difference.  While it has not resulted in us actually acquiring additional properties, it certainly has helped in respect of the short-term and the HAP tenancies.</p></speech>

Where people have been committed to give an enormous amount of time to help people to move on it works.  We must be prepared to accept the fact that there are people who have complex needs and people are required to support and help them, very often over a long time.  I am reminded of the quote from the Scottish poet Andrew Lang of over 100 years ago.  When asked for a definition of a statistic he said "He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp-posts ... for support rather than illumination.&rdquo;  Behind every statistic is a human being, and people have complex needs.  It is really much more about the kind of society we are living in.  In homelessness we end up seeing people who do not feel part of that society and who must be encouraged to get back into it.  This takes time.  Services must be supported to give people that time.</p></speech>

It is really quite remarkable.  People are cared for in the State due to the extraordinary work that is ongoing.</p> <p>  Early this morning the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network ran a forum on sexual abuse and trauma.  One of the contributors there spoke about the inextricable link between trauma and homelessness.  Picking up on Ms Leahy's comments about young people and the need for wraparound services, support and time, I was involved in a very early Foyer project in Dublin with Mr. Brendan Kenny, who was incredibly supportive.</p><p>The project is for young people coming out of care and is now run by Depaul.  I wonder about the amount of that supported sheltered housing, involving independent living with wraparound services, that is available.  Are we seeing those sort of developments coming through and what part will they play?</p><p> My second question is on Airbnb.  With the lack of tourism and availability, those sort of properties have come back onto the market.  Is there any indication of the percentages of those that are being used for the increased numbers of people exiting homelessness and moving into secure accommodation?  I would be keen to know how we would support that in terms of a strengthening of rules and building on what the previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, put in place.</p><p> I very much understand the logic of the DRHE in having the local connection.  When the homeless agency was first started around 2000, we all visited Vienna where we spoke to people in its homeless services.  We heard how they put people who arrive in Vienna who are not from Vienna on trains and send them home because they are better dealt with locally where they have family supports.  I have two questions arising from that.  First, what if somebody genuinely wants to come to Dublin because, for a variety of complex reasons, he or she may need to get away from the place he or she is coming from?  How do we support that and allow someone to do so in a situation where there will not be a local connection?  I appreciate that the rules are suspended during the pandemic but post Covid we need to know that someone who is homeless has a right to change city or town in our country and that we have a pathway to provide for that.  My memory of the service in Vienna is that a person was given a pack, his or her train fare was paid and he or she was given supports to get home.  People were not just told "No".  I am keen to hear about what is in place, if anything, in Dublin.</p></speech>

This issue was brought up by Deputy Gould earlier.  The DRHE is nearly the last resort now for accommodation.  For a prisoner coming out of Mountjoy Prison or somebody coming out of hospital, it is not a great solution that he or she would go straight into a hostel.  Putting a young lad who has come up from the country and is getting into drugs straight into a hostel in Dublin city is not the best thing to do either.  We have to be conscious of that.  If somebody wants to come up from the country, it is difficult.  There is a local connection in the housing system.  Anybody who is in our hostels at the moment and has got emergency accommodation does not qualify for homeless HAP or to be on the housing list.  The only way they can qualify for homeless HAP or to be on the housing lists is if they go back to their own local authority which can look after them.  There is no doubt that if somebody just wants to come to Dublin that is a difficult one, and it is very difficult to get accommodation.</p> <p>  The Foyer project the Senator mentioned is a very good concept.  We would certainly like to see more of that.  I have forgotten the last question.</p></speech>

We get accused of turning people away but we are actually engaging in prevention.  We are trying to prevent people going into emergency accommodation because if they go into emergency accommodation, particularly in Dublin, they could be stuck.  We try to coax them to go back to their own area.  If they refuse to go back they will get accommodation but we do our level best to get them back to where they have the social services and a family.</p></speech>

Initially we got 100 self-contained apartments in the city that were formerly Airbnb.  We are still using them.  That allowed us to move families and children out of hotels.  We are doing an average of 300 homeless HAP tenancies every month where previously we were struggling to make 200.

Why is the DRHE choosing to use a private company for the inspections rather than an independent body such as HIQA?  Will those inspections be of all emergency accommodation, public and private?</p> <p>  I completely agree with Professor O'Sullivan's comments on deaths of people experiencing homelessness.  The concern of many of us is that there is a small cohort of people who live at the intersection of homelessness, mental ill health and addiction.  The numbers of those people who have died in the last year is twice what it was the previous year, based on the data we have.  Is that a concern and what do we need to do to address that?</p></speech>

It does not have that role at the moment.  It would be a matter for the Government to decide to give it that role.  We will be advertising for expressions of interest so if there is another agency, possibly one that is not a private company, which is prepared to do that, we will consider it.</p></speech>

We know that the ultimate solution is Housing First, which is being rolled out.  The protocols Mr. Kenny has put in place with Dr. Austin O'Carroll for reviewing these deaths could be done on a national basis.  However, rather than focusing on the conditions people are in at the moment, we know how we exit those people from homelessness and into secure tenancies.</p></speech>

The double payment of social welfare, which thankfully has ceased, was a significant issue for people in addiction because they were using incredible amounts in the first week which led to an increase in the number of overdoses.  For example, in McGarry House in Limerick during the first lockdown, the number of times we administered naloxone more than doubled compared with 2019 because of the number of overdoses due to the double payment.  That was a significant issue and probably increased the number of deaths this year.</p> <p>  It is difficult to see what we can do about a second problem we have.  We are encouraging clients to socially distance and stay in their rooms on their own to prevent the spread of Covid but that leads to people using on their own and overdosing on their own.</p><p>It is counter-intuitive sometimes to try to separate people.  They might be safer in their own community.  Notwithstanding all the addiction, mental health and dual diagnosis issues that homeless people face every year, this year there were things that were felt more acutely because of Covid.  When we come out of it, hopefully we will see a decline in such issues.  Those are some observations from the ground.</p></speech>

Muna bhfuil bunleibh&eacute;al leagtha s&iacute;os againn, n&iacute; bheidh a fhios ag an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras n&aacute; ag an bpobal i gcoitinne cad &eacute; an bunleibh&eacute;al a bhfuil muid ag s&uacute;il leis.</p> <p>  Tuigim go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it chun na caighde&aacute;in nua a bheidh ag teacht isteach a leagan amach ag pointe &eacute;igin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag caint faoi chaighde&aacute;in &aacute;irithe a leagan amach do gach uile ph&aacute;irt den st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Sna caighde&aacute;in sin, beidh air a r&aacute; c&eacute;n seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a bheidh ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  Agus muid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le hearca&iacute;ocht chuig an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus le st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh agus searbh&oacute;nta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, caithfear tuiscint c&eacute;n leibh&eacute;al Gaeilge at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il uathu.  Bh&iacute; Breannd&aacute;n &Oacute; Beagla&iacute;och ag caint faoin gceist sin i rith na seachtaine agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; maith go leor muna bhfuil duine in ann ach "f&aacute;n n&oacute;im&eacute;ad" a r&aacute;.  N&iacute; leibh&eacute;al cu&iacute; Gaeilge &eacute; sin.  M&aacute; th&eacute;im go dt&iacute; an Fhrainc, n&iacute; ligeann mise orm go bhfuil an Fhraincis agam.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom ach bunch&oacute;mhr&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh sa teanga sin.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla focal de agam.  Is m&oacute;r an trua dom n&aacute;r fhoghlaim m&eacute; i gceart &eacute; ar scoil, in ainneoin iarrachta&iacute; Tony Gregory agus m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; Fraincise eile a bh&iacute; agam.</p><p>D'fhoghlaim a l&aacute;n daoine eile sa rang liom Fraincis ar leibh&eacute;al i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; agamsa.  N&iacute;or ghlac mise an cur chuige ceart n&oacute; b'fh&eacute;idir nach raibh m&eacute; d&iacute;rithe uirthi i gceart ag an am sin.</p><p> T&aacute; mise den tuairim seo, agus t&aacute; a l&aacute;n daoine eile a bh&iacute; ag f&eacute;achaint isteach ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an l&aacute; faoi dheireadh den tuairim c&eacute;anna.  Spreag an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a l&aacute;n daoine r&iacute;omhphost a chur chugam ar aon chaoi.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuair daoine eile iad chomh maith, n&iacute; d&iacute;reach ar an &aacute;bhar seo ach ar &aacute;bhair eile freisin.  Beidh muid in ann iad sin a lua diaidh ar ndiaidh.  Chomh maith leis sin, fuair muid n&oacute;ta eile &oacute;n dream in Ollscoil Mh&aacute; Nuad at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh iarracht a leagan amach an cur chuige at&aacute; acu maidir leis an gcaighde&aacute;n B2 a bh&iacute; luaite agamsa.  T&aacute; siadsan ag d&eacute;anamh an leagan amach sin agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh leaganacha difri&uacute;la ar leibh&eacute;il difri&uacute;la m&aacute;s sa treo sin at&aacute; an Rialtas ag dul, ach ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; ann go bhfuil leibh&eacute;al &aacute;irithe i gceist.</p><p> Nuair a buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t, bh&iacute; s&eacute; le tuiscint go mbeadh leibh&eacute;al &aacute;irithe ann.  Rinneadh iarracht le tamall de bhlianta go mbeadh Gaeilge ag na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh, na garda&iacute; san &aacute;ireamh.  Ba rud m&oacute;r &eacute; do lucht na Gaeltachta go raibh poist ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh toisc go raibh siad chun tosaigh &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Ba &iacute; an Ghaeilge an teanga dh&uacute;chais a bh&iacute; acu agus b'fh&eacute;idir gur sin an f&aacute;th go raibh an oiread sin daoine &oacute; na Gaeltachta&iacute; sa Gharda agus sa st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Nuair a baineadh na riachtanais sin, tharla teip.  N&iacute;or tharla an teip sin sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras amh&aacute;in, a bh&iacute; teipthe air ar aon chaoi, toisc nach raibh daoine ag comhl&iacute;onadh na riachtanais sin, ach tharla teip &oacute; thaobh m&uacute;inteoireachta de agus &oacute; thaobh &aacute;bhair m&uacute;inteoireachta de chomh maith c&eacute;anna.  T&aacute; an teip ar fud an ch&oacute;rais toisc gur tharraing an St&aacute;t siar &oacute; na dualgais a bh&iacute; air maidir leis an riachtanas sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  N&iacute;limid ach ag d&eacute;anamh iarracht bogadh p&iacute;osa amh&aacute;in ar ais i dtreo riachtanais a bheith ann ionas go mbeidh caighde&aacute;n &aacute;irithe i gceist.</p></speech>

Faoin gcaighde&aacute;n sin, bheadh dualgas ar an St&aacute;t na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il.

N&iacute; rud nua &eacute; seo.  T&aacute; an-taith&iacute; acu.  Is d&oacute;cha nach iad sin an t-aon dream amh&aacute;in at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis an gceist seo ach t&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht leis an litir seo chun an rud a chur i gcomhth&eacute;acs.  Leanann an litir mar seo a leanas:</p> <blockquote> 	T&aacute; forbairt d&eacute;anta ar a leith&eacute;id de ch&oacute;ras le haghaidh fhormh&oacute;r na dteangacha eile san Eoraip cheana.

Mar shampla, leis an mBille seo agus leis na caighde&aacute;in a bheidh ag teacht isteach faoi, t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh aghaidh a thabhairt ar chaighde&aacute;n na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge do mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi l&aacute;thair mar &aacute;bhar pr&aacute;inneach.

Don chuid is m&oacute; d&iacute;obh seo is cumas labhartha sa Ghaeilge an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; seachas cumas scr&iacute;ofa.

Mar chuid de sin, chaithfid&iacute;s a bheith faofa go neamhsple&aacute;ch ar an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  D&aacute; mbeadh Gaeilgeoir&iacute; fairsing n&oacute; d&aacute; mbeadh Gaeilge ag chuile dhuine sa t&iacute;r seo, is ar &eacute;igean go mbeadh muid istigh anseo le Bille teanga &aacute; phl&eacute; ar chor ar bith.

T&aacute; thart ar 80,000 d&oacute;ibh sa St&aacute;t.  T&aacute; gas&uacute;ir ina measc sin chomh maith le daoine san earn&aacute;il phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach agus daoine at&aacute; ar a bpinsin.  T&aacute; an tobar de dhaoine at&aacute; thar a bheith inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge teoranta.  Ba cheart cur leis sin go staid&eacute;arach, ach n&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; thar o&iacute;che.</p> <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair ag daoine nuair at&aacute; siad f&aacute;sta suas an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os &eacute;asca ag leana&iacute; agus na&iacute;on&aacute;in.  Feictear &eacute; sin.  M&aacute; thosa&iacute;tear ag labhairt Gaeilge le gas&uacute;ir, labhr&oacute;idh siad ar ais i nGaeilge.  M&aacute; thosa&iacute;tear ag labhairt leo sa tS&iacute;nis, labhr&oacute;idh siad ar ais sa tS&iacute;nis.  De r&eacute;ir mar a fh&aacute;sann daoine an&iacute;os, &eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; n&iacute;os deacra.  D&eacute;anann daoine &eacute; agus is sampla&iacute; iontacha iad roinnt de na daoine at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair sa Teach seo inniu ach n&iacute; h&eacute; an gn&aacute;thrud a tharla&iacute;onn, is cuma c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad rang Gaeilge a chuirtear ar bun.  Tabharfaidh m&eacute; an m&eacute;id seo mar shampla.  D&aacute; mbeadh caighde&aacute;n ann agus d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; leagtha amach sa gcaighde&aacute;n sin go mbeadh Gaeilge bhun&uacute;sach ag chuile fh&aacute;ilteoir i ngach uile comhlacht poibl&iacute; ionas go mbeadh an ch&eacute;ad duine a chastar leis agus daoine ag dul isteach i ndoras in ann f&aacute;ilte a chur rompu, teachtaireachta&iacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il go raibh siad ag lorg duine &aacute;irithe, uimhreacha a th&oacute;g&aacute;il s&iacute;os agus ruda&iacute; simpl&iacute; eile mar sin, b'iontach an dul chun cinn &eacute; sin.  Ach d&aacute; mbeif&iacute; ag iarraidh gn&aacute;thghn&oacute; an lae n&oacute; gn&oacute; an St&aacute;it a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, teasta&iacute;tear caighde&aacute;n Gaeilge difri&uacute;il ar fad.</p> <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, d&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go raibh cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chasacha Gaeilge fairsing chuile &aacute;it, leagfa&iacute; amach go gcaithfeadh duine de na daoine sin a bheith ag chuile oifig fh&aacute;ilte sa t&iacute;r, ach n&iacute; chreidim go bhfuil an sol&aacute;thar ann faoi l&aacute;thair agus n&iacute; bheidh go ceann scata fada.  Bheadh an Rialtas ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na daoine sin a fh&aacute;il chun na poist sin a l&iacute;onadh.  Bheadh s&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go mbeadh s&eacute; in ann na daoine a fh&aacute;il do na bunjabanna a dh&eacute;anamh &aacute;it a bhfuil &eacute;ileamh ar an nGaeilge agus gn&oacute; an lae a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, rud nach bhfuil ar f&aacute;il i l&aacute;thair na huaire.

I nGaeltacht Chonamara, an ceann is l&aacute;idre sa t&iacute;r, t&aacute; daoine a th&eacute;ann &oacute; theach go teach ar an talamh, oifigigh leasa sh&oacute;isialaigh agus feidhmeanna na comhairle contae, at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis an bpobal.  N&iacute;lim ag caint faoi na daoine nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n pl&eacute; leis an bpobal acu ach faoi si&uacute;d a bh&iacute;onn ag pl&eacute; leis chuile l&aacute;.  Is sampla eile &eacute; an fhoireann innealt&oacute;ireachta.  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; air sin.  Caithfimid na caighde&aacute;in agus na poist a leagan s&iacute;os.  Aonta&iacute;m leis sin ach, m&aacute; t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag iarraidh rud eile a dh&eacute;anamh agus gan caighde&aacute;n chomh hard sin Gaeilge a thabhairt isteach, ba cheart go mbeadh caighde&aacute;n ann ina leagtar amach poist na ndaoine sin.  Sa bhealach sin, beimid in ann dul ar aghaidh &oacute;n &aacute;it ina bhfuil muid go c&eacute;imni&uacute;il mar is &aacute;it s&aacute;ch dona &eacute;.</p><p>Is &eacute; an rud nach maith liomsa faoin leagan amach at&aacute; air seo n&aacute; an "f&eacute;adfaidh", is &eacute; sin nach bhfuil aon gh&aacute; ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Iarraim ar an Aire St&aacute;it breathn&uacute; air sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&oacute;lag, r&oacute;-&eacute;iginnte agus r&oacute;scaoilte.  An gcaithfear caighde&aacute;n a leagan s&iacute;os?  D'fh&eacute;adfaimis ansin dul isteach sna ceisteanna cigilteacha.  C&eacute;n poist a leagfa&iacute; amach do na caighde&aacute;in is airde?  C&eacute; mh&eacute;ad duine at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il?  An ceart go mbeadh caighde&aacute;in eile ann do phoist &aacute;irithe nach bhfuil riachtanas don chaighde&aacute;n sin Gaeilge iontu?  Is ceist i bhfad n&iacute;os casta agus ceist do l&aacute; eile &eacute; sin, ach ba cheart go mbeadh na caighde&aacute;in ann agus go mbeadh an tAire St&aacute;it in ann iad a shainord&uacute; le haghaidh poist &aacute;irithe.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l g&aacute; leis an bhfor&aacute;il seo seachas chun bac a chur ar an Aire cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh chun cearta teanga a chosaint.  Mhol Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n an leas&uacute; seo freisin ina thuarasc&aacute;il in 2018.</p></speech>

T&aacute; mise s&aacute;sta glacadh leis sin, ach b&iacute;onn fadhbanna agam i gc&oacute;na&iacute; leis na focail &ldquo;a luaithe is f&eacute;idir&rdquo;.  Sin bealach &eacute;alaithe do gach rud agus cinnte is bealach &eacute;alaithe &eacute; gan aon rud a dh&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.

Bhain m&eacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id as an gc&aacute;ip&eacute;is a l&eacute;igh m&eacute; ar&eacute;ir maidir leis an bplean do chathair na Gaillimhe.  Is cinnte go bhfuil easpa i gceist ansin mar nach bhfuil aon duine ann chun br&uacute; a chur ar an gc&oacute;ras agus a r&aacute; nach f&eacute;idir an tuarasc&aacute;il seo a fhoilsi&uacute; i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; s&eacute; go mbeadh duine amh&aacute;in, coiste, n&oacute; cib&eacute; c&eacute;n rud &eacute; ann chun aitheantas a thabhairt do dhaoine sa chomhlacht poibl&iacute; sin go bhfuil dh&aacute; theanga oifigi&uacute;la againne.  T&aacute; dualgais orainne agus ar an gcomhlacht poibl&iacute;.</p> <p>  Nuair a smaoin&iacute;m ar an bplean forbartha do chathair na Gaillimhe, smaoin&iacute;m ar Ghaillimh 2020 freisin agus athsmaoineamh a bh&iacute; i gceist.  Togra iontach dearfach a bh&iacute; ann agus bh&iacute; f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; ann go mbeadh s&eacute; ina thogra dearfach, ach athsmaoineamh a bh&iacute; i gceist ann maidir le duine le Gaeilge.  Nuair a ceapadh duine le Gaeilge, tugadh an teideal oifigeach Gaeilge ar an duine.  Athsmaoineamh a bh&iacute; ann i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire agus ansin r&oacute;l srianta seachas duine le Gaeilge a bheith ann &oacute;n t&uacute;s chun an togra iontach sin a chur chun cinn ar bhealach d&aacute;theangach.  Is &eacute; sin an dara sampla don Aire St&aacute;it, m&aacute;s mian leis smaoineamh air sin.</p> <p>  Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, eagra&iacute;ocht iontach agus moladh &oacute; cheithre hairde na sp&eacute;ire tugtha di &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; fosta&iacute;ochta de agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s do na Gaeltachta&iacute; uilig.

De r&eacute;ir an m&eacute;id at&aacute; feicthe agam, agus t&aacute; mo thaith&iacute; srianta go leor, cuireadh b&eacute;im ar an bhfosta&iacute;ocht, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  Gan fhosta&iacute;ocht, n&iacute; bheidh aon bheocht sa Ghaeltacht.  N&iacute; raibh an aird ch&eacute;anna ar an teanga &oacute; thaobh na heagra&iacute;ochta sin de.  N&iacute;lim ag f&aacute;il lochta ach is &eacute; an rud at&aacute; &aacute; l&eacute;iri&uacute; agam n&aacute; gan duine a bheith i gceannas i ngach comhlacht agus i ngach Roinn freisin, gan duine le f&iacute;s, le heolas agus le r&oacute;l a bheith aige n&oacute; aici an teanga a chur chun cinn ar bhonn cearta, beimid th&iacute;os.</p> <p>  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; fi&uacute;ntas ag baint leis na leasuithe seo.  T&aacute; siad t&aacute;bhachtach, agus molaim an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh as an leas&uacute; seo a chur os comhair an choiste.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Michael Kingston and Mr. Ciaran McCarthy.  I thank them and the members for participating in this meeting at such short notice.  I wish to make Mr. Kingston aware that his additional briefing was received yesterday evening.  I refer not to the review of the Bill itself but the actual briefing note.  The committee has considered the briefing note and has agreed to accept Mr. Kingston's documentation but with two passages, namely. paragraphs 3.82, 3.83 and 3.84, as well as 3.12.1, redacted due to their content.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I also remind members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard I also ask all members, prior to making their contributions to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  For the information of anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chairman, and the staff essential to the running to the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances of Covid and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.  When people are not speaking, I ask them to mute their microphones.  It benefits the broadcasting enormously.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Kingston to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee secretariat for its enormously hard organisational work and for affording me such courtesy and assistance amid the difficulties of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I deeply commend the committee members on the earnest manner in which they are continuing the business of Ireland on behalf of Irish society.  The fact that we are here today is symptomatic of that work and that desire to ensure that our citizens are afforded the opportunity to be heard in the development of important legislation.  The committee has read my correspondence dated 4 January 2021 and, I hope, had a chance to look at some of the briefing note.  I am accompanied today by barrister Ciaran McCarthy.</p> <p>  We come here with solutions in order to help the committee and indeed the Government, through the Department of Transport, to get this legislation right.  The Department must take a step back and listen in order that collaboratively, we learn from the mistakes of the past and work together for a better future that will save lives in the maritime community - our merchant seafarers, pleasure craft users, fishers and emergency services - and protect the environment and save millions in wasted resources surrounding unnecessary tragedies.  I wish to make it clear that, although at this stage I have quite a lot of experience working with multiple world governments, international organisations and the United Nations' International Maritime Organization, as I set out in my letter, I appear here today in my personal capacity.</p><p>I also come here with a very heavy burden on my shoulders, one that I did not ask to carry, but that has become my life's work, given the circumstances I evolved into, following my own father's tragic death in the Whiddy Island disaster in 1979.  This led to many people contacting me to help them, people from all over Ireland, from all constituencies, who have lost beloved relatives or been involved in accidents, and who have not got to the bottom of what happened or were confused by the investigative process.  They have heard me explain continually the importance of implementing maritime safety regulation correctly in Ireland, including the issue that is before us today.  Mr. Ciaran McCarthy has echoed those sentiments.</p><p> I have also been contacted by a multitude of Department officials, MCIB investigators, former MCIB investigators, and former Department surveyors, who have deep reservations about the current system and its shortcomings.  The EU judgment of 9 May 2020 has affirmed what was being said.  I pay tribute to their bravery in putting their trust in me, and I would like the committee to know that they, like me, appreciate its engagement and vest their faith in it, in our democracy.  Until the committee acted, there had been a very serious democratic deficit in the manner in which the Department of Transport has pursued maritime casualty investigations.  That includes the unwitting misleading of this very committee and the Oireachtas by successive well-intentioned Ministers and MCIB chairpersons, regarding the independence of the MCIB, now confirmed by the EU judgment and more recently the findings of that judgment in respect of impartiality.</p><p> This legislation must be fit for purpose, given the very serious consequences in the past of the Department's determination to ignore international best practice and, as we know, ultimately, ignore mandatory international law, first the United Nation's 2008 Casualty Investigation Code and then the 2009 EU directive, resulting in the EU judgment.  The Department knew this to be wrong, and despite clear direction to rectify it by the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, in 2009, it was not brought to the attention of the incoming Minister in 2011, who unwittingly signed off on the incorrect transposition into Irish law of the EU directive in July 2011.  How this happened is a very serious matter for the Oireachtas, given the consequences for Irish citizens, and not least the faith we as a society place in public officials and the standard of ethics expected of them.</p><p> The simple fact is that the MCIB was doomed from the start, because, despite the 1998 Report of the Investigation of Marine Casualties Policy Review Group, initiated by the then Minister, Se&aacute;n Barrett, in 1996, which analysed international best practice and recommended that it was imperative that the MCIB be independent, it then went against its own findings in its conclusions to say that, "because we are a small country" we can ignore international best practice, and it accordingly advised that the chief surveyor and the Secretary General or her or his nominee should be on the board.  We now know that international best practice has finally caught up with the Department through our membership of the European Union.  The 1998 report also set out the required competence investigators should have in seafaring, engineering and naval architecture, and that of the MCIB chairperson in maritime experience, and it set out that investigators must have adequate resources, including technical and financial.  That has not happened.  So many other findings of the 1998 report have not been implemented and now is our chance to rectify this.</p><p> For reasons that I have explained in my briefing note to the committee, the proposed Act does not address these issues sufficiently and, in particular, among several other issues set out, we need an independent investigative unit headed by a full-time principal investigator, with full-time assistance from qualified maritime professionals, in line with the aviation and rail sectors, in an office independent from the Department of Transport, finally decoupling the investigator from the regulator and bringing us in line with international best practice.</p><p> I, with the advice of Mr. Ciaran McCarthy, am here to discuss all these issues and elaborate on further detail as per my briefing note, and any other issues the committee wishes to raise, to the best of our ability.  We are all proud of Ireland and want to help our nation to get things right.  Now is our chance, with the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, if he so wishes, for the maritime community, and for that we are indebted to the committee for this opportunity.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Kingston for his submission and the huge amount of work he has put into this issue.  Given the limited time, I want to give him the floor and an opportunity to expand on the points he has made.  Will he address the point that many of the issues he raises are not specifically relevant to this legislation?  They are more broadly relevant, and it is suggested that they will be dealt with at a later stage.  What is Mr. Kingston's specific ask of the committee as it relates to this legislation?  Is it the wrong legislation?  Should it be expanded and why so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.789" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kingston" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke.  I think the issues I have raised do relate to this Bill, which is amending the legislation that was put in place in 2000 following the findings of the review group in 1998.  The Secretary General's nominee and the chief surveyor have been removed from the board, but the whole problem surrounding the failures also needs to be addressed.  I refer to the mere fact that this is a part-time board with panel investigators and the whole mechanics of the MCIB are failing.  Now is the opportunity to change that.  For example, as I set out in my briefing note, we have a part-time board and part-time investigators with investigators appointed to a panel on a short-term basis with minimal support, co-operation or training.  By the very nature of their work, they are also mainly compromised.  The quality of reports has been poor, the recommendations poorly thought out and, on the whole, are regarded by the maritime industry as poor.  This is to be expected where there is no investment or motivation to set high standards.  The proposed Act will effectively be a continuation of the current system.</p> <p>  In 2019 we spent &euro;27,000 on investigators in the field on ten incidents, including six deaths, which is &euro;2,700 per death.  If we compare this with investigators in the field in the aviation and rail industries, there are investigative units with a full-time investigator.  A total of &euro;750,000 was spent on aviation, where there were no deaths, and &euro;350,000 was spent on rail.  That is the amount spent on investigators in the field, leaving aside the clerical staff.  That is the problem.  This Act is just continuing the same board structure of part-time investigators.  It is not fair to them.  They are not getting proper resources or training.  It is not fair to the chair to have to run all of this.  We need an independent investigative unit.  That is what this Act should be doing.  The Bill is amending the previous system but it is just a continuation of a failed system.</p></speech>

It is most helpful.  We are not always experts in various aspects of our work and it is really helpful when we have somebody of Mr. Kingston's background and knowledge to provide information to us.  Like Deputy O'Rourke, I am more interested in hearing to the broadest extent possible how we might proceed from here because there is a concern that we are in effective breach of a European law because of the structure of the committee.  I ask Mr. Kingston to respond to that point.  Resignations have taken place and it is not possible to appoint others until the Bill passes.</p><p>From Mr. Kingston's knowledge and experience of the landscape of investigations that are out there, or potential investigations in the event of any accidents in the interim, are we creating a lacuna where an investigation might fall or might fail to be heard because we have not effectively filled the board, albeit with the limitations it currently has?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.792" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kingston" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Dooley for his question.  I have addressed this in my briefing note in paragraph 2.1.  It is very important that it is understood that although the chief surveyor and Secretary General, or his or her nominee, have had to resign from the board, that does not mean it cannot technically function in the interim while this legislation is being dealt with.  A rush, therefore, will only create another mess, which I have just explained to Deputy O'Rourke.  To assist the committee, I refer to section 16 of the current Act where "The Board may, from time to time, engage such consultants, advisers and investigators ... as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions".  I suggest, and obviously funding needs to be made available by the Minister, that we second an experienced investigator to assist the board, which is under enormous pressure in fairness to the chairperson and the other two board members, and ensure that in the event of the incapacitation for any reason of another member of the board, the Minister would, under his powers, immediately appoint someone else.  We would continue as is in the interim while we sort out this legislation.</p> <p>  On this proposed legislation, I am aware that the Department has suggested in the documents that there will be a review after the legislation.  We have, however, already had reviews.  There is the 1998 review and we know exactly what we need to do.  It is quite clear.  We need an independent unit with a principal investigator and two assistants who are competent: a master mariner, a chief engineer and a naval architect.  They would have the ability under the legislation to draw on any other expertise that is necessary, depending on the incident.  That is not difficult legislation to put together and it should not take that long.  Now is the time to fix this.  On the Senator's question, the lacuna can be dealt with under section 16 of the Act.</p></speech>

I recognise Mr. Kingston as an international expert in the field.  I thank him for his interaction with the committee in recent weeks and for his submission today.</p> <p>  In the short time available to me I want to discuss two issues.  The independence of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, is of critical importance.  Perhaps Mr. Kingston will explain why. The other issue is the importance of having a special investigation unit within the curtilage of the MCIB.  From an international perspective, is this what other jurisdictions do?  Do they have a principal investigator and the different personnel around them?  Is that the way it is in maritime affairs in other jurisdictions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kingston" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#E00500"><p>I thank Deputy Carey for his assistance on the committee.  The simple answer to that question is that it is a legal obligation.  It must be independent of the Department.  That is what the European judgment has adjudicated on.  It is based on an International Maritime Organization code of 2008.</p><p>Not only must the Marine Casualty Investigation Board be independent, but it must also be competent.  We did not ratify that particular international regulation but we had no choice but to address it when the EU issued a directive in 2009.  We then transposed it into Irish law in 2011, incorrectly as I mentioned in my opening statement, when we left the chief surveyor and the Secretary General's nominee on the board.  That is the legal position.  It has been recognised international practice for decades.  The 1998 report I referred to in my briefing note established this and said that this was the international best practice.  They cited several examples, the leading example being that of the United Kingdom's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, MAIB, which was established following the sinking of the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i>at Zeebrugge, which many of the members will remember.  Following that ferry tragedy, the judicial findings of the inquiry cited the obviousness of the fact that investigations need to be separate from the regulator or else one is analysing one's own regulations.  The Department sets the regulations.  In any accident, it needs to analyse whether the regulations were correct, were fit for purpose and were enforced correctly.  Effectively we would be investigating ourselves.  That is recognised international practice.  Unfortunately, the review group contradicted itself and went against its own findings in the draft legislation.  That is inexplicable.  I do not know why that happened.  The 1998 report that gave rise to this Act found that the MAIB physically moved its inspection unit from London to Southampton so there was a physical divide.  This is why it is so important.  We are dealing here with the investigation of the regulatory framework.  The ideal position would be to have a chief inspector with a team independent from Leeson Lane.  This is the internationally recognised best practice.  It is precisely the position in Iceland, which is a much smaller country. </p></speech>

Now is the time to deal with this in legislation and to bed it down.  Is there anything beyond this that Mr. Kingston wants to add?  I now have in my head everything that is necessary.  Obviously, Mr. Kingston's information has been quite detailed, but are there any questions we need to put to the Minister for Transport who will be at the next session?</p></speech>

That is it in a nutshell.  There are other issues under this proposed legislation.  Mr. McCarthy and I have provided comments on those under the heads of the Bill.  There are other issues surrounding some of the draft legislation, for example where it says there should be a 60:40 gender split.  This is unrealistic in the maritime world.  Most of the students coming out from the National Maritime College of Ireland currently are male.  Across most of the members of the maritime community, there is a heavy weight towards male at the moment.  That is not to say it is not being addressed, but we cannot have a provision like that in the Act at the moment because it would preclude most of the experience.  This is something the whole maritime community is working on.</p><p>It is also being worked on by the International Maritime Organization.  I have involved the head of academics at the National Maritime College of Ireland, Captain Sin&eacute;ad Reen, in those discussions.  Anyway, it is unrealistic to preclude a provision like that in the Act.  It should be left to a bottom-up approach so that we can change it to the other way around rather than what is in the Act.  This is because it could have an adverse consequence.</p><p> There is also a provision in the legislation to the effect that members of the Department should be precluded from being a part of the board or investigation unit, as hopefully it will be, having heard the evidence today.  That is fine for current members but the legislation also refers to ex-members.  That is not a sensible approach because there are excellent individuals who are well-qualified in the Department of Transport.  When they leave, they are entitled to seek and earn a livelihood.  Not only would it be perhaps unconstitutional to prevent them from being able to earn a livelihood, but it would be shooting ourselves in the foot in terms of great maritime experience.  I suggest that be changed.</p><p> There are several other specific issues in the commentary.  There is something that I may discuss further with other members, if asked.  However, we must remember that proper regulation saves lives, as does a proper implementation of regulation.  I set out examples of that in my briefing note.  That that is what these changes, if they are done correctly, will achieve.  We need to focus on the proper implementation of regulation in Ireland, starting with this legislation, to set the analysis of the regulatory framework for when accidents arise.</p></speech>

I was struck by the lack of parity in money invested in marine accident investigation with the figure of &euro;2,700 per death.  It is an awful thing to quantify.  At the heart of everything that the Marine Casualty Investigation Board works on is marine accidents, which leave bereaved families wanting answers.  They want to know that measures will be put in place after an accident to ensure others do not lose loved ones at sea or on the water.  It is alarming to see the figure of &euro;2,700 compared to &euro;750,000 for aviation accident investigations.</p> <p>  I will conclude my remarks because I want to hear from Mr. Kingston.  I looked up the EU Directive 2009/18/EC.  Page 2 sets out the requirement for independence of marine investigations throughout EU member states: "Such investigations should therefore be carried out by qualified investigators under the control of an independent body or entity endowed with the necessary powers in order to avoid any conflict of interest".  The Department of Transport is telling us that this is procedural and we need to tighten up a loophole so that the work of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board can continue.  Mr. Kingston is saying that the structure of the board, despite all the flaws that he has identified, can continue its work in the short to mid-term.  Can he clarify that further for the committee?</p></speech>

He has identified the pertinent points in the legislation.  It is good that they are on record from the directive.  It is a matter for each member but the committee will agree unanimously with him that &euro;2,700 for the field work in an investigation into someone's death is a staggering failure when we compare it with aviation and rail.  We can see the figures set out in my briefing note.</p><p>The figures speak for themselves.  One need only analyse the rail set-up and the aviation set-up.  They are professional and, therefore, they are preventing death.  Then we get to the marine sector.  It is a little like what the review group found in 1998 and 2000.  The view was that we should have international best practice and that was what should be established.  They spent a great deal of taxpayers' money flying all over the world.  Then, at the end of the report, the view was that, given Ireland is a small country and the maritime community is a small part of it, we should forget about all of that and simply have a different system here.  That is not good enough.  Iceland is a far smaller country but those involved work properly.  We must remember that our maritime sector is extremely important at the moment in the context of Brexit.  Moreover, with renewable energy, the footprint of Ireland is ten times the size of our landmass.  It is critical that we invest in this area.</p><p> In the meantime, to answer the question from Deputy Crowe about the current system, the set-up is part time, amateur and not good enough.  We can provide funding to get an experienced investigator to help the board in the meantime.  That is not difficult.  They are out there.  We could second an official from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom or from another European nation.  That would keep the show on the road for the time being.</p></speech>

The work can continue.  We do not want a lacuna, as others have suggested.  The work can continue but a comprehensive root-and-branch scrutiny of how the board functions has to be undertaken given the extraordinary shortcomings identified by Mr. Kingston.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

She has innocently found herself in the middle of these difficulties.  I am sure they are doing the best they can in the circumstances in which they find themselves.  They are decent people trying to do their best in the circumstances.  However, the circumstances they find themselves in are not good enough.  We need to get a case of money to get someone to work alongside the board.  Then, on each occasion there is an incident we should give that person the ability to bring some assistance in, depending on the type of incident.  It is not the most difficult plan to come up with and it would deal with the situation while we amend the legislation.</p> <p>  I reiterate that the amendments to this legislation are straightforward.  We should have an independent principal investigator with assistance in an independent unit.  These amendments are not difficult.  There should be proper resourcing, not only for the board but also for the Marine Survey Office and the safety side of the board.  We are spending &euro;50 million on the Coast Guard and &euro;4 million-----</p></speech>

Everything that has been asked has been answered by Mr. Kingston.  He certainly spoke about the issue of transparency and safety.</p> <p>  What would failure to hold this meeting result in exactly?  In the context of marine accident investigation, if Mr. Kingston had a wish list of what we should say to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, in three points, what would be on it?</p> <p>  Building upon the report by Captain Forde, we have an issue around investigation, impartiality and transparency.  To the person listening in or watching us, this is the overarching message.  This is an important matter.  We must have confidence and safety.  We must recognise the mistakes of the past and we must have impartiality regarding investigations and the issue around merchant shipping.</p> <p>  My last comment relates to the Title of the Bill.  The expression used is "investigation of marine casualties".  This has a profound impact on people, as we know, and on the lives of people and industry.</p><p>It is important that everything we do is underpinned by transparency, safety and legal certainty.  We must also ensure that we do the right thing.  I thank Mr. Kingston and Mr. McCarthy for being here and for their work in this area.  I am glad that we were able to hold this meeting and Mr. Kingston's presentation has been most interesting.</p></speech>

The first thing I would say is that we do not need another review.  We already have the 1998 review, which was clear in its recommendations on what is needed.  We need an independent investigative unit with competence.  For whatever reason, the end of the 1998 report went against itself.  It was clear following the <i>Betelgeuse</i>tragedy in 1979 that we needed to decouple the regulator from the investigation system.  We were not as advanced then as we are now as a nation-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.813" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kingston" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#J00400"><p>Yes.  We all know that we need to have an investigative structure that is separate from the system or institution being investigated.  That is common practice across all disciplines and all nations and the same applies here.  People need to understand that we cannot have the regulators, in fairness to them as well, investigating their own work.  That just does not work.</p> <p>  We have great opportunities as a nation in so many maritime areas but the foundation stone for our maritime progress in things like offshore energy and so forth, is the regulatory framework.  We must have proper regulation in place.  I would say to the Minister, who is a member of the Green Party, that having proper regulations in place will protect the environment.  It will prevent pollution and promote the environmental agenda of the Irish nation in terms of renewable energy projects.  The investigative unit to which I refer will contribute to that by making sure that we always have proper regulation.  I would urge the Minister to provide funding for this investigative unit.  The amount involved is minimal, at approximately &euro;300,000 to &euro;350,000 per year.  It would prevent helicopters being called out, massive Garda searches which cost millions and so forth.</p> <p>  I wish to defer to Mr. McCarthy on this question if there is time because the codification of all Irish maritime regulation is extremely important.  The Bill attempts to amend the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS.  The 1998 report argued that we must codify Irish maritime regulation because it was haphazard and all over the place.  That was 23 years ago and we still have not done it.  The Minister should provide funding to the Department to help it to draft codified legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.815" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#J00600"><p>Mr. Kingston referred to the need for codification.  If one looks at the draft heads of the Bill, one sees references to the Merchant Shipping Acts 1894 to 2020.  That in itself is absolutely unacceptable.  The fact that we have legislation on our Statute Book from a different country, dating from before this State was formed when the merchant shipping fleet would have been largely sailing ships, not even steam ships, not to mention the diesel or nuclear ships that we have today, is very stark.</p><p>The effect of the lack of codification over such a lengthy period is that the area is deeply complex and opaque.  It is very difficult, even for lawyers like me, to untangle the web and find out what is required of regulators and what actors within the industry can achieve when we are advising them.  The area is crying out for codification.  In particular, Mr. Kingston referred to the SOLAS convention, which is basically shipping 101.  It is the single most important merchant shipping safety legislation and it dates back to the time of the <i>Titanic</i>.  We are on the fourth iteration of the convention now but our implementation of SOLAS, which is a particular interest of mine, is absolutely appalling.  We have implemented this convention through a series of Acts and secondary legislation which amend and correct each other.  It is absolutely opaque and really difficult for anybody to actually understand what is required under the convention.<br/><br/>In this post-Brexit era, we are so dependent on shipping.  The fact that we are an island means that everything has to be shipped here.  Almost everything got here on a ship, including the clothes I am wearing, the car that I drove in today or if I had cycled in, the steel used to manufacture my bicycle.  Everything had to be shipped to this country and this is especially important post Brexit-----</p></speech>

I thank the two gentlemen for their attendance.  They have been very informative and interesting and have given us a clear view of what we need to address with the Minister.  Our current system has obviously failed.  There is a lot of dissatisfaction out there, particularly among those who have been affected by it.  Many questions have been left unanswered and this has caused grief and distress for many people.  The key message is that we have to have independence.  It is not satisfactory, going forward, to have the regulator involved in any way in the investigative process.  Mr. Kingston referred to the importance of the regulatory framework.  I ask him to elaborate on that.  What should we be focusing on in terms of regulation?  Mr. Kingston proposed a special investigation unit independent of the MCIB, the need for which is obvious.  I ask him to outline the level of resources required to ensure that such a unit is effective, impartial and can do its job properly.</p></speech>

I will deal with the last issue first.  The marine area deserves at least the same funding as rail, although I do not think it would cost as much as &euro;750,000.  My figures are approximate.  I do not have precise figures but basically we are talking about a principal investigator with two full-time assistants, which would cost approximately &euro;300,000, plus administration costs.  In this new era, I am sure there are Government buildings that could be used in places such as Clonakilty in Cork, for example, or in Deputy Lowry's constituency - somewhere that is separate from the Department.  That is the level of funding required but there is another issue of funding that relates to the Deputy's first question.  He asked about the regulatory implementation needed.</p><p>This has highlighted how we have failed to implement international regulation.  It is unfortunate that we are here today, but in a very positive way we can turn a negative into a massive positive, which is what I believe we are doing.<br/><br/>As Mr. McCarthy mentioned, we cannot continue to not take international regulation seriously in the maritime sector.  I am currently working with the Government of Iceland on the guidelines for the implementation of the Cape Town Agreement on fishing vessel safety.  This nation has not ratified that.  Officials flew to South Africa and signed it in 2012.  It is for international fishing vessels.  It will prevent our emergency services having to fly 250 miles to the west of Ireland to an injury on a fishing vessel if we step up to the mark and help other nations by playing our role to get that implemented.  We have not implemented it.  We have not implemented the ballast water convention, the removal of wrecks convention or the amendments to SOLAS discussed by Mr. McCarthy for ships carrying hazardous substances that could have major environmental impacts in Ireland, as well as additional requirements for international passenger vessels.  It does not give us the legal ability to inspect these vessels properly.  That requires resources.<br/><br/>In fairness to the Marine Survey Office which is working on these, it is under-resourced.  The same Department spent &euro;7 million, as reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, on a garden in Dublin Port and we spent &euro;200,000 commissioning a song for christening a foreign vessel that was not even Irish flagged.  That is money that could have been put to getting these regulations implemented and also on enhancing safety and our society.  There must be a radical rethink of the importance of maritime regulation in Ireland.  There is &euro;50 million for the Coast Guard and &euro;3 million for the Marine Survey Office.  We are paying for the reaction instead of the prevention.  Prevention is better than cure.  We must examine this, review our regulation and get our house in order.  It is critical for modern Ireland.</p></speech>

One should read, in particular, paragraphs 3.28 and 3.29 of the 1998 review.  The example of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch, MAIB, in the United Kingdom is what we need in Ireland.  The review group knew that, but, for whatever reason, it went against itself in the eleventh hour of the finalisation of the report and we did not have what we should have had in the current Act.</p></speech>

It is perfect sense that it should apply to the marine as well.  Could a fully constituted board pursue that matter or would it be a matter for the board?</p></speech>

It is a matter for the Department to establish an independent unit through legislation.  I am sure there is legislation that governs the aviation unit and the rail unit.  Potentially, it would be a cut and paste, tweak job that would take half a day.  It is as straightforward as that.  The board must be disbanded.  That is no disrespect to the members of the board or any previous members of the board who have served.  They have done their best within the system in which they operated.  However, as a nation, we did not put an appropriate system in place.  That is not fair to them or to the investigators who have done their best, but if they are getting &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 per investigation, they cannot do a great job.  It is inadequate.  Also, they must be full-time to build up corporate knowledge, and training has been a big issue.  This nation has not attended the Marine Accident Investigators International Forum since 2008, even though the review group in 1998 recommended that it was essential.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question with a point, after going the long way around, the board cannot do this.  The board must be disbanded and we need a principal investigator with two assistants.</p></speech>

The maritime community is a small community.  DG MOVE, the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, not marine or energy, interacts with our officials.  There is a body known as the European Maritime Safety Agency -  we have to report what we are doing to Europe - and it was well aware that this was happening.  Everyone in the community could see the failures and, therefore, it wrote to Ireland in July 2015, half a decade ago, and asked Ireland, knowing this, how it was implementing the directive.</p><p>Instead of putting our hands up at that point and sorting out the matter, we as a nation fought that position, which was an indefensible one, and arrived at the judgment we have arrived at.  I do not know how much that cost but it was money that would have been well spent on what I have just discussed with Deputy Lowry.</p></speech>

Finally, in the context of the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union being abided by and the legislation being amended, can the board function at the moment with only three members?  Has it a huge body of work in place such that it is imperative that its membership be increased to five in the context of this pre-legislative scrutiny?  I am trying to find a way in which we can move this forward so I ask Mr. Kingston to deal with those matters.  First, we will take it that the witnesses will submit to us a one-page outline of what is required.  Second, will Mr. Kingston address the aspect of the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling?  Can the board operate at the moment with only three members?  How heavy is the workload of the board?  Is there a practical measure that this legislation has to go through as currently put forward by the Minister?</p></speech>

Clearly, it is not the final step in the process of reviewing the legislative and structural framework governing marine casualty investigation in Ireland.  The Bill seeks to ensure the continued functioning of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in the immediate term.</p> <p>  The Merchant Shipping Act 1894 provided the framework for marine accident investigation until the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 was enacted to establish the Marine Casualty Investigation Board and implement key recommendations of the investigation of marine casualties policy review group, which reported to the then Minister in 1998.  The MCIB, in accordance with the 2000 Act, is composed of a five-person board, comprising three members appointed by the Minister and two other persons who, until recently, were the chief surveyor of the Department and a nominee of the Secretary General.  Under 2011 regulations, the MCIB is also designated as the investigation body for the purposes of Directive 2009/18/EC, and this applies to a subset of the marine casualties that come within the remit of the MCIB.</p> <p>  In recent years, a formal process was undertaken with the EU Commission relating to the implementation of the directive and the independence of the MCIB in the context of Article 8.  My Department engaged with the Commission at all stages, and when the Commission lodged a case with the Court of Justice of the European Union, it was defended with the approval of the Government and having regard to legal advice.</p> <p>  The CJEU judgment on 9 July 2020 declared that, by failing to provide for an investigative body which is independent in its organisation and decision-making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to it, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 8.1 of the directive.  The issue was the presence of two Department officials on the board who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the MCIB.  There was no court finding of wrongdoing on the part of any members of the board.  Following the CJEU ruling, legal advice was received on legislative and administrative options to address the findings.  To address the immediate issue regarding board membership, the two board members of concern were requested to resign from the board and did so on 30 July last year.</p> <p>  I made amending regulations in October 2020 to address the infringement findings and to provide for a revised board structure and operation whereby the chief surveyor and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport or his or her nominee are no longer board members for the purpose of investigations that fall within the scope of the directive.  My Department wrote to the EU Commission regarding the actions taken to address this and the proposed Bill to amend the 2000 Act.</p> <p>  The strict requirement of independence on which the judgment is based does not apply outside Directive 2009/18/EC, and the court ruling only relates to the organisation of the board in the context of marine casualties that come within the scope of the directive.  However, on the grounds of consistency, it is necessary to progress a further legislative revision of the board structure to encompass the broader spectrum of investigations that come within the remit of the MCIB under the 2000 Act.</p> <p>  On 8 December 2020, the Government approved the urgent drafting of a Bill along the lines of the general scheme that is now before the committee this afternoon.  The objective of the proposal is to amend the 2000 Act to facilitate the appointment of new members to the MCIB and to revise some operational provisions in the interest of the continued and consistent functioning of the MCIB as the investigative body in the State.</p> <p>  Through a substitution of section 9 of the 2000 Act, as proposed in head 3, a revised board composition is proposed, consisting of a minimum of five members and a maximum of seven members, who will be appointed by the Minister for Transport, having regard to a list of desired skill sets.  This facilitates the addition of further expertise to the board, including the membership, and confirms that serving or former officers of the Department will not be eligible for appointment.</p><p>By including the skill set requirement in legislation, the current practice and approach through the Public Appointments Service recruitment system will be formalised.</p><p> The general scheme proposes amendments to sections of the 2000 Act that relate to the general operation and functioning of the board.  I am conscious of time and so I will not go into the detail but my full statement will be published on the committee website.  However, I would like to mention some details.</p><p> Head 7 amends section 18 to facilitate the engagement of additional expertise by the board and removes all references to investigators nominated by the chief surveyor from the Marine Survey Office.  This confirms the current situation.</p><p> Head 10 amends section 28 to confirm a specific requirement for persons to notify the MCIB of information regarding the marine casualty.  Head 12 amends section 34 so that the board will endeavour to publish all investigation reports within 12 months of the occurrence of the marine casualty.  Head 13 ensures that the Marine Survey Office will be aware of marine casualties in view of possible safety implications or compliance issues that may need to be addressed.  Head 15 facilitates the transposition into Irish secondary legislation of recent amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.</p><p> I again emphasise that the primary objective of the proposed Bill is to ensure the continued independent functioning of the MCIB in the immediate term.  I am keen for the Bill to progress as quickly as possible to facilitate the appointment of new members to the MCIB as there are risks associated with the current reduced board.</p><p> I am aware of the correspondence that has been received by the commission regarding the operation of the MCIB.  I reiterate that the MCIB acts independently of me and my Department and, for that reason, it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual incidents, MCIB reports and recommendations, or allegations and statements made.  These issues are separate to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the current general scheme.</p><p> As outlined in my letter of 19 January 2021, I consider that the time is now opportune to undertake a fundamental review of the structures in place for marine accident investigations.  This review will be carried out by an independent expert and concluded over the coming months.  This is by no means a criticism of the MCIB board and its members past and present, its secretariat or its investigators and the valuable work they have undertaken.  However, circumstances have changed since the 1998 report of the policy review group and the enactment of the 2000 Act.  In light of the CJEU judgment, I consider it to be an opportune time to have such a review.</p><p> The review will look at how maritime accident investigation is structured overseas and how other modes are treated in Ireland.  Therefore, this Bill is a transitional measure and not a permanent legislative framework for marine accident investigation.  Further legislation may be required following completion of the review.  Pending the outcome of the review, it is imperative that the State continues to have a functioning marine investigation body in place.  This requires the amendment of the 2000 Act.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for taking the time to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill and I look forward to hearing the views of committee members on the matter.</p></speech>

I confirm that I am in the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  The Minister likely heard the powerful testimony from Mr. Kingston in the previous hour.  There were some fundamental criticisms in respect of many aspects of the Bill and of its entire premise.  There were criticisms in respect of Ireland not following best practice and international examples, including some nearby, in terms of how we might approach these matters in a more comprehensive and independent manner.</p> <p>  There is a need to decouple the regulator from the investigation unit and establish an independent full-time and permanent investigation unit.  There is a need to resource it adequately.  The point is that this legislation is the time to do all of this.  There is no need for an additional review and the 1998 review set things out clearly.</p> <p>  I appreciate the opening comments of the Minister.  Is he committed to addressing the issues that Mr. Kingston outlined in his comments in the past hour?  Does the Minister accept those points?</p><p>Will he outline how he will address them if he is committed to that?  Will he do it in this legislation and grasp the opportunity, as Mr. Kingston outlined and as the Minister acknowledged?  Will he take that opportunity in this legislative measure?</p></speech>

If the committee wishes to share it, that could further inform the review we intend to make, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, as would engagement with other stakeholders and relevant parties who would be interested in that.  It is timely and important to have that review.  It will take a certain amount of time, but I hope not an excessive amount.  It would be several months rather than longer.  I want that to take place.  Any such issues are best addressed within that review.</p> <p>  More immediately, we need the Bill before the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, with a view to it going to the House.  In that interim period, and legislation takes time to draft and reviews take time for all views to be heard and so forth, I do not want to run the risk that we might not have a sufficient number of board members for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, as it is currently constituted, to be able to do its work.  That is a risk I do not believe we can take over any period.  For that reason, I wish to proceed with this relatively simple measure within the context of all the questions raised.  It is important legislation to ensure we are not at that risk, and in order that we can proceed quickly to appoint new members so we will not fall short under any circumstances should there be a need for the investigation unit.  There is always an ongoing need.  This is an ongoing risk to which I do not wish to leave us exposed.  By all means, I look forward to seeing the committee's correspondence and to include that in the consideration by an independent reviewer, but that is not the purpose of this legislation.  This legislation has an immediate, urgent purpose - to reduce the risk of us not having an effective board in the meantime.</p></speech>

Before the Minister joined the meeting, we heard from Mr. Michael Kingston.  He put a number of points to us and outlined concerns relating to the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  As I understand it, the board has jurisdiction over investigating accidents at sea and on water, reporting back to the Department and, arising from that, making recommendations for action so such accidents, one hopes, would not recur.  It is the latter part on which I wish to focus.  I understand what the Minister is saying.  He is talking about a relatively small legislative measure for the continuity that is required.  What Mr. Kingston outlined this morning, and what we need to hear from the Minister, is what express actions can be taken parallel to that to ensure that concerns can be addressed.</p> <p>  In terms of follow-up and actions, that is a key part of what the Marine Casualty Investigation Board does.  In 2016, there was an accident in my county in which a volunteer member of the Irish Coast Guard, Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas, tragically lost her life off the coast of Kilkee.  I will not go into that incident.  However, arising from that, investigations occur.  We have heard of many instances from Mr. Michael Kingston in recent days.  An investigation gets under way and recommendations are brought forward to the Department.  The fact is that in Kilkee there is still a 7.5 m Delta rigid inflatable boat, RIB.  It is a perfect vessel and can take to the sea at any time.  It is fully serviced, but it cannot take to the sea because the volunteer members of the Coast Guard are not fully trained.  That recommendation was made to the Department in 2018 when all this was investigated.</p> <p>  We need to look at what Mr. Kingston said.  The accident happens and it is a tragedy for a family.  An investigation gets under way, it comes before the Department and an action should arise thereafter, but there are still too many units of the Coast Guard dotted around the country that have vessels which its personnel are not fully trained to take to sea, or if they take the vessel to sea they can only go 50 or 60 metres away from the harbour.  They cannot go out to the outer waters.</p><p>I respect what the Minister says about the minor details that this legislation requires, but we are all really hoping for some assurances that the Minister can take or promise actions that will deal with some of the concerns Mr. Kingston has outlined and also deal with the example I have given today, where there are still shortcomings in terms of recommended actions being followed up in the Department.</p></speech>

That is important for the reason the Deputy mentioned, that if there are recommendations that require the Department to take action, it must have that independence.  That, in effect, was the underlying direction in Article 8.1 of the European directive, which is to require that independence.  That is what we are addressing in this legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to the concerns in that case and other issues in respect of previous investigations, the European court decision did not relate to individual places or individual actions that had or had not been taken as a result of a report.  That is something we should take into account as part of this review.  It is to examine the wider process, and the review process will be the opportune time.  It is more than 20 years since 1998 so it is timely for us to do it.  The court decision and the need for changes to the board prompted the review, but it is only prompted from the issue of independence.  The review allows us to look at a range of different issues with regard to the functioning of the board that can then be addressed in legislation.  Indeed, if within that process we see that there are actions that need to be taken more immediately by the Department or others, I commit fully to making sure those actions are taken.</p></speech>

An investigation gets under way, but that family and the nation wait to see what remedial actions happen.  That is the litmus test for how successful the investigation board and the Department are.  That is the detail we would love to return to at a future meeting.</p></speech>

I will not take up all that time because everything has been encapsulated.  What we are trying to achieve collectively is to restore confidence in the independence and greater transparency of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  Many people who have suffered the trauma of losing loved ones are unhappy.  The European Commission referral of Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to uphold European law on impartial investigations of marine incidents is raising concerns.  We heard from Mr. Kingston and from other people who have given their testimony to us individually or to the committee today.  I join other members in asking for that review and that independence be required to be achieved.  It is important that we understand the rawness of this for many people.  It is equally critical that we, as legislators, and the Minister - to be fair, his engagement with us has been positive - look at the entire operation in a manner that is timely and proactive, and that we ensure the concerns expressed to us are examined and that the Marine Casualty Investigation Board is fit for purpose.  I hope we can do that together.  Mr. Kingston made a fine presentation to the committee and we have heard him on other platforms as well.  I am heartened by the Minister's contribution this afternoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.869" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#S00600"><p>I take it from what the Minister has said that he is open to listening to and possibly addressing Mr. Kingston's difficulties as regards independence and the necessity for an investigative unit that is fit for purpose.</p><p>This will be dealt with in the review to which he is committed.  If I may, I will deviate in the question I will ask, given the set of circumstances in which we find ourselves with regard to tougher travel guidelines and restrictions being put in place, which we all support. It is possible that this all may go further into the future given the difficulty around variant strains and so on.  We have all been lobbied by the aviation sector on securing the rehabilitation of a viable aviation sector beyond this.  This is a very important issue for the committee.  The necessity of connectivity is a huge factor in our economy.  What interaction has the Government had with airlines, with airports, with workers and with other stakeholders in respect of any necessary supports, given the situation in which we find ourselves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.871" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#T00200"><p>I will be honest that most of the interaction with airports and airlines in recent weeks has been in relation to the management of the immediate crisis situation.  I first wish to thank the airlines and the ferry companies.  They have had a huge role.  The Deputy referred to the airlines in particular, and one of the more immediate issues is that following the announcement of the UK variant on 19 or 20 December, we immediately introduced a ban on travel from the UK.  That left a situation where nearly 1,500 Irish citizens, for a variety of reasons, found themselves in the UK and having to get home when we had stopped all air and ferry travel.  For example, there was a mother who had gone to London to bury her son.  I commend the airlines and the ferry companies on the support they gave to the State at that time.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus especially set on a series of flights whereby the Department of Foreign Affairs was able to repatriate Irish citizens who were in difficult circumstances.</p> <p>  In the last ten days with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test requirement, where all passengers coming to the island of Ireland must have a current negative PCR test, again we must work very closely with the airlines and the ferry companies to make sure they were carrying checks on passengers before they boarded to make sure they did have that negative test so as to minimise the chances of people arriving here without one.  The airlines and ferry companies were very supportive of that and I thank them formally for the proactive co-operation they gave in managing this real crisis.</p> <p>  Before the Christmas period we had engaged more widely on the issue of supports, not just for airlines and the ferry companies but also for the airports, and in particular announced additional measures coming from the Covid emergency fund for Cork, Shannon and other airports.  There has also been ongoing engagement with the airlines around lending supports and other mechanisms to help them.  We agreed at the time that this was not just a fixed support and that we might have to come back to it.  I will be honest that the immediate priority is getting through the necessary new legislation to introduce mandatory quarantine systems for those people coming from certain countries or who have not undertaken the PCR test, as well as the other statutory instruments that manage how we police our efforts.  I hate to put it in those terms but the Deputy is aware that we now have new Garda checkpoints on approaches to airports because we do not want people flying.  We want to minimise flying at this time.  That is the more immediate priority, while recognising it has significant consequences for people in the travel and tourism industries, and others, and that we must provide ongoing support for those industries because they will have a difficult next few months, like the rest of the country, but particularly because they bear the brunt of a dramatic reduction in travel.</p></speech>

I welcome that the Minister said there will be ongoing engagement and that future supports will be needed, some of them possibly fairly soon.  I would appreciate it were the committee to be updated on that level of engagement.</p> <p>  I add my voice to the call that if the Minister is committed to the review of the MCIB, it should happen relatively quickly and that the Minister would give an opportunity to deal with the issues that have been put in front of the committee today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.873" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#U00100"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and for his engagement with us.  Many of us have no expertise in this area, an area on which we depend to a great extent, and it is no different from the expertise the State has through its investigation units for air and rail accidents.  We should be looking at the solution to the problem by putting in place a permanent investigation unit of a similar standard.</p> <p>  I recognise and respect the Minister's point on the review, but those of us who have had the honour and privilege to serve around these Houses for a number of years are well used to departmental speak.  I am not accusing the Minister of it at all; he is new to this Department.  Departmental speak when it relates to a review is, effectively, the long finger and to move on.  In his written and oral presentation, Mr. Kingston has said that now is the time.  The focus of the Oireachtas is on marine casualty and accident investigations.  It is not a hot topic.  It probably will not make it to the stocks any time soon again.  Here is an opportunity to have a comprehensive solution and resolution to the problem.  Yes, there is the issue that arose from the European perspective, and the issue of the independence of the board will be resolved, but Mr. Kingston has also highlighted the issue of the patchwork of investigations that do not necessarily have that common thread, and the haphazard approach to investigations, which are subcontracted out to individuals on a casual basis.  This does not in any way cast anything other than respect for the people who do these investigations, but bringing together a unit that would develop and build corporate knowledge over time is something we should strive for.</p> <p>  Mr. Kingston referred to the funds spent by the State per death, which he said was a rather crude way to do it but it is factual, versus the cost to the State of investigations of accidents in any other way.  Based on all the information that is available I suspect that we do not need a long review.  We do this with the Air Accident Investigation Unit and with the Railway Accident Investigation Unit.  I am aware that in recent years the State has really upped its role in the investigation of road accidents, which the Minister will be familiar with.  At one time it was the case that after a road accident, even one ending in a fatality, the road would be cleared and swept by the fire brigade within an hour or two of the accident taking place and the cars would be moved.  That does not take place any more because we have recognised there is much learning from every accident that takes place, which builds our ability to react and prevent future accidents.  Obviously, the same should apply to our Marine Casualty Investigation Board.</p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to what Mr. Kingston has put forward.  He does so with a vast amount of experience and I am sure he would be prepared to work with the Department if there was a view that it could be advanced quickly enough to form part of this legislation.</p></speech>

I recall that the original legislation in 2000 was preceded by the review in 1998, two years previously.  In my general experience, and the Senator has had a very similar experience in the way the State operates, if we could implement a similar timeline to carry out a review, it does take time to draft appropriately because it needs to be right and one must listen to the various stakeholders.  If we were able to carry out that review and introduce broader legislation on the back of it within one or two years, that would be the State operating in a way that is in line with what we have done in the past, which is appropriate.</p><p>In the meantime though, we have a risk in not having a quorum for the existing board and that is not a risk we can afford to take.  One of the benefits hopefully of good investigations is that one learns lessons and one reduces and manages risk, as well as trying to provide answers for families who are the heart of this, who might have lost someone.  Managing and reducing risk is what good investigation systems are about.  One of the risks we need to immediately manage is the risk of us not having an effective board should we, for whatever reason, lose one of the three existing board members.  Therefore, just on a risk management basis, it is right to put through this legislation, enhance the board, maintain its independence and then carry out a review and introduce legislation to address some of the wider issues.</p></speech>

Perhaps he would write to the committee, which would be helpful to us.  I accept he has given oral testimony, but it would help the committee if we have his commitment in writing, as to how he sees the situation proceeding.  That is important.  What we have all learnt here would indicate that we are seriously out of line with reasonable practice, let alone best practice, across the developed world.</p></speech>

If any further commitment is required, I will have to give it, but the opening statement gives a very clear sense of direction and intent for me and the Department.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

We had an international expert before the committee.  He made a written submission and a very strong verbal submission to the committee today.  He has outlined the flaws that brought the country to the ECJ and resulted in a ruling.  The Government had to act on that.  I accept the Minister's fear is that the board might not function properly, but section 16 of the Act enables us to deal with that.  Outside experts can be brought in to take on that role.  Now is the time to deal with the issue.  It is a long time since 1998.  Since then, we have been operating in a space where the board was not independent.  We had a situation where people from the Department were investigating themselves and setting down criteria.  That is not best international practice.</p> <p>  We have an internationally renowned witness before the committee today, Michael Kingston.  He advises other jurisdictions.  He has pointed out to us the flaws in our current regime.  These flaws have a direct impact on families on the ground.  They have resulted in delays in reports and recommendations not being followed.  Mr. Kingston is making a personal plea today based on his impeccable credentials and his personal involvement.  He told the committee that his own dad was lost in a marine tragedy.  He has a vested interest in the matter.  He comes across as very genuine.  I strongly believe that now is the time to address this situation.  There is a means whereby we can fill the gap on the board currently and deal with the legislation now.</p><p>My fear is that this issue will be pushed aside and will not be addressed and people will lose out as a result.</p></speech>

The risk would still remain that the board would not be quorate and that is the real risk that this legislation is seeking to prevent.  I do not rule out the introduction of other measures and bringing in technical and other expertise, but we do need to sort one element of the risk to the board's structure.  After we minimise the risk, we can deal with a variety of issues that a wider review will allow us to address.  As I indicated to Senator Dooley, we will commit to doing that and be open to all the reports or other analysis the committee might forward on or share.</p></speech>

This is pre-legislative scrutiny and it would be right and proper that that would happen.  Will the Chairman ask the Minister to allow that to happen?</p></speech>

I do not believe the review process should delay the introduction of the legislation, which is a very specific legislative task that we have.  We will engage with the committee on the wider task.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-29a.885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012900002#W00600"><p>It is the first time I have addressed the Minister since his elevation.  I thank him for agreeing to come before the committee for today&rsquo;s discussion.  I am always wary when I hear that somebody wants to get legislation through without pre-legislative scrutiny because that is what leads to many of the problems that arise.  When legislation is bad, it takes forever to correct it.  I appreciate the Minister taking the time to listen to what has been said.  I hope he will take it on board.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Cathal Crowe, referred to the tragic accident in Kilkee in 2018 in which the life of a volunteer member of the Irish Coast Guard was lost.  He made the point that as part of the outcome, a need for training was identified.  In 2017, we had the loss of Rescue 116.  It is three years on from 2017 but there is not a word about a final report or even an interim report.  I consider it to be the role of the board to expedite the investigation as quickly as possible and to issue a report.  I seek the Minister's view on that.  I realise we are living in an extremely litigious country but air accident investigations take place all over the world and nothing stops the report being brought out in a timely way.  A medical surgeon told me one time that if the same procedures were applied in a hospital theatre as are applied to air accident investigations, and hopefully marine accident investigations, there would be very few deaths in operating theatres.  Does the Minister agree that immediately after the investigation, when the report is issued, leaving aside the sensitivities, there should be a plan of action statutorily built into the process to force the actions highlighted by the investigation board to be implemented and a timeline put on the implementation of any recommendations?  That could then be subject to a review by an inspector appointed by the Department.</p><p>It could possibly report back to the Oireachtas but it should certainly report back to the board.</p><p> We must learn from the mistakes and the accidents of the past.  Putting a board in place to carry out an investigation and stopping at that stage would be a pointless exercise.  There must be a complete series of events that will minimise the chances of a repeat of the accidents being investigated.</p></speech>

First, the R116 investigation is obviously an air accident investigation rather than a marine investigation even though the accident occurred in the marine environment.  It is the responsibility of the air accident investigation unit.  Mr. Pat McCann, a barrister, is carrying out a specific review of one aspect of that which is provided for under the due process system.  I have encouraged the Department and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the investigation is really swift and thorough.  I agree with Senator Craughwell and a number of other Deputies who have referred to the human aspect of this in terms of the need for families to receive detailed and fair reports quickly.  As part of this review, we should look at the history of implementing recommendations.  The purpose is to give answers to questions for families but also to reduce the risk of similar accidents occurring in the future.  In that context, it is vital that recommendations are followed through.  I agree with Senator Craughwell that this should form part of our review.  We should look at the record so far in terms of implementing specific recommendations.  If there is any gap there in terms of follow through, we should avail of the opportunity to tighten things up.</p></speech>

He will understand that I used the R116 accident investigation as a glaring example of something that has dragged on in perpetuity.  Very little can be learned from that accident until the report is finalised.  I understand that there are difficulties with that but I was merely using it as an analogy.</p></speech>

We discussed the legislation with witnesses at an earlier session.  I will confine my questions to the legislation before us.  I asked the witnesses if they agreed that this legislation addresses the European Court of Justice's ruling or decision and if it would give the MCIB the independence it requires in terms of composition and they were broadly in agreement with that.  I also put the point in the Minister's statement to them that this Bill is not the final step in the process of reviewing marine investigations but the witnesses were of the opinion that we do not need another review and that further investigation is not required.  They pointed out that a report was produced in 1998 and the recommendations therein would still stand.  They argued that any review should be based on that report.  I made a commitment to the witnesses that I would recommend to the Minister that his Department look at that report.</p> <p>  We discussed the issue of an accident investigation unit and the requirement for a separation between those who investigate and those who regulate.  We already have a railway accident investigation unit and an air accident investigation unit.  It makes sense, therefore, to consider setting up a marine accident investigation unit.  Part of the remit of such investigation units is to consider near misses.  When we consider near misses, we can often look at structures or process that can prevent accidents.  That is an important part of any investigation unit.  One hopes that these units are never busy but one likes to know that they exist.</p></speech>

The core purpose of this legislation is to address the European Court of Justice finding that a separation between investigation and regulation is needed.  I do not believe we can rely on the 1998 review.  We should look at what has happened in the intervening period.</p><p>Our understanding of investigation structures, regulatory systems and the separation of same is an immediate issue in the air area at the moment, as we separate our air regulator into two distinct functions.  This is an example of how this area continues to change and it is why I do not believe we can just rely on the 1998 review.</p><p> Senator Craughwell spoke about looking at recent cases and the follow-through on recommendations and, in that context, it is appropriate for us to conduct a further review.  Even in terms of what Mr. Kingston is saying, some elements may relate to the period prior to 1998 but others relate to the period since then.  Therefore, it is appropriate to conduct a review which we will commence shortly.  We will include input from this committee in that review.</p></speech>

Mr. Kingston appeared before us earlier today and I must say that he was a knowledgeable and compelling witness.  He is an expert in the area and obviously also has a personal interest, given the effect of the Whiddy Island accident on his family.  His knowledge of the issues was absolutely on point.  There appears to be a general acceptance that there is a need for an overall change to the MCIB, but the question is how we get there.  Mr. Kingston is of the view that the 1998 review is still relevant.  He believes that there is a need to structure the new board in a way that is similar to the board in the UK and that there is a need for particular expertise in the investigations unit.  His concern is that a review will long-finger the issue and delay the legislation.  We will forward Mr. Kingston's comprehensive documentation to the Department.</p> <p>  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, would the Minister consider amending the legislation to take into account some of the substantive elements of the 1998 review, accepting that it must be updated?  Following on from that, what is the timeframe envisaged for the review and for bringing forward the legislation?  The issue is not just the review but also the legislative measures that are required to make the necessary changes.</p> <p>  It is accepted by the Department, the Minister, Mr. Kingston and Mr. McCarthy that there is a need to reform the MCIB.  The only question is how we get there.</p></speech>

That Act was, in a sense, the legislative response to the 1998 review.  I do not believe that the 1998 review is sufficient, particularly now that we are seeking to amend the legislation that resulted from that review.  As I said to Senator Dooley, my intention is to initiate a review within months and not put it off.  While I do not want to pre-empt the review, if there is a need for further legislation, I would hope it would be delivered in the same sort of timeframe as the 1998 review and the subsequent 2000 Act.  To a certain extent, that will depend on the workload within the Department, the workload of this committee and the legislative timetable of the D&aacute;il, but that is the sort of approach that I think we should take.</p></speech>

Does the Minister see a situation where the Government, particularly his Department, will be providing further State support to airlines such as Aer Lingus?  Many people are extremely worried about their livelihoods and work.  Does the Minister see the State providing further funding, or State support, to ensure airlines like Aer Lingus and Ryanair can come through this unfolding situation of what is an effective ban on foreign air travel outside of essential travel?</p></speech>

I think the T&aacute;naiste was correct, although some people criticised him, to be honest about concerns around the variants and the fact that this is not going to be immediately resolved.  I hope the arrival of the vaccine and its widespread uptake and distribution, not just here but in other jurisdictions and other countries, will lead to a much safer environment.  We will continue to learn about this virus and see how we can manage it.  However, I do not think we should give any false promise or timeline as to how that would happen.  Hopefully, it will be sooner rather than later.  We are working collectively towards that goal.</p> <p>  It is not just in respect of the aviation industry.  There are huge consequences for the tourism industry, hospitality and a whole variety of different sectors that are particularly badly hit.  I listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and we have made provision for some of the contingencies we will have to cover.  That will include, in all likelihood, extending the periods for PUP, EWSS or other CRSS payments, many of which are benefitting the aviation, hospitality and tourism industries.  However, there is a real challenge here.  The fiscal capability of continuing to offer supports is going to be really tested but to date the Government has shown clear intent.  We manage this by providing sufficient supports and by not leaving industries completely unprotected but we do not know the scale, timeline or nature of it and I cannot commit to it today.</p></speech>

The committee, in its aviation report, recommended that there would be fast-tracking of research on the use of antigen testing.  What role does the Minister see for antigen testing for essential workers in air travel?  What is the up-to-date position of the Government on quarantine, mandatory testing and PCR testing?  When does the Minister expect the legislation will come through to put those particular measures into effect and how long does he anticipate they will last?</p></speech>

It is mandatory for anyone coming into the country.  Many European countries and the UK have done something similar, so in effect there is mandatory testing, particularly on international air travel.  We have also introduced antigen testing and not just in the hospitals.  Yesterday was the first day of the introduction of antigen testing on truckers and hauliers going from Ireland to France.  I know that for hauliers this is a further imposition in difficult times with Brexit and all the complications that it brings but one upside may be that it gives us exactly what the Chairman is suggesting.</p><p>It gives us a clear model and example of how it is working, the timelines, the cost, the success and the pick-up rate.  What we will see in part of the solution we are going to move towards is increasing testing like that.  It is not foolproof and I would not give false confidence that it is going to catch every single thing.  There will be false negatives-----</p></speech>

He is talking about quarantine, isolation and mandatory quarantine.  When does the Minister think he will be at a point when legislation will be published to provide absolute certainty on what is going to be put in place?  It is only one of the elements in dealing with the virus.  However, it is an element the public are very tuned into and interested in.  I ask for certainty and full clarification on what measures will be brought in and when they will be brought in and when the legislation will be introduced.</p></speech>

We need primary legislation for Irish citizens and people living in the EEA.  I would imagine that legislation will be turned around in record time, although this is subject to the Whips agreeing to it, what D&aacute;il time we can get and the Attorney General being able to draft and proceed with the legislation.  I would imagine also the Cabinet will be discussing the legislation next week.  I do not know whether it will come to the transport committee.  Such legislation relates to the health Act.  It will be probably the health committee that will have responsibility for bringing it through what will have to be a rapid pre-legislative scrutiny.  I do not know if we could even call it pre-legislative scrutiny when the timelines are going to be so tight.</p></speech>

Surely we could have taken over one or two hotels in Dublin and bused people straight to the hotel similar to what is being done in Australia.

It is very busy, unfortunately, because of the rate of incidence in the community.  It will be mandatory to quarantine at home and the garda&iacute; will have the ability to follow up and check if people are where they have said they will be for their period of isolation.  That is a significant change.  I remember talking to NPHET, the health advisers.  That was one of the things they really wanted, namely, to strengthen the regulatory powers we have to check people are following the guidance.  That, combined with quarantine in a hotel for those coming from certain jurisdictions and without a PCR test, is the key component in tightening up, which we need to do.</p></speech>
