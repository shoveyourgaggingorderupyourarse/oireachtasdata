He is joined by Ms Mairead Leyden, senior auditor.  No apologies have been received in respect of today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before we get into the normal business of the meeting, I want to say that members of the committee received an email at 8.27 a.m. providing the Committee of Public Accounts with an eight page report from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Secretary General, on the purchase of the Komori printing press and related matters.  I just received it in the last few moments and I propose that we go into private session for 20 minutes so members of the committee can read the report.  We will then resume in public session to deal with our normal business.</p></speech>

There is correspondence from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Clerk of the D&aacute;il and Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, on the report on the purchase of the printing facilities.  We will deal with it in due course as part of correspondence.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting on 21 November 2019.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Nothing arises from the minutes that will not come up in the normal course of today's meeting. </p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  There are three categories, the first being category A, comprising No. 2572A and No. 2580A, from the Revenue Commissioners.  They are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next items are correspondence from Accounting Officers and their Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.  The first item is No. 2563B, from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive, National Transport Authority, NTA.  It follows on from a query from the committee on 22 October.  Her letter is dated 19 November 2019.  We raised a number of issues.  We asked for a note of clarification on what is meant by "value for money" in regard to future projects or investments, including clarification of how it is measured and calculated, in addition to the inputs and outputs and whether carbon emissions are taken into account when calculating it.  There is a detailed response to that question covering a few pages.  Examples are given of the typical costs and benefits of a project.  They are well established.  We will publish them today.</p> <p>  We also sought a note on fines for breaches of carbon targets, to include whether this is a factor in the medium and long-term planning of the NTA.  It is stated the carbon targets are a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It would not be for the NTA to deal with them.</p> <p>  Third, we sought a note on reports carried out or commissioned by the NTA in relation to an environmental value-for-money calculation.  Ms Graham states no environmental value-for-money calculation has been specifically carried out but it is stated there are three headings under which the NTA examines all matters: social value, economic value and environmental value.  One combined report is produced covering the three areas, not three separate reports.</p> <p>  We asked for an outline of the models used in calculating future demand for transport.  The response provides various graphs showing how the NTA forecasts future transport demand.</p> <p>  We asked for a note on the assumptions of behaviour used when modelling projected demand, with particular reference to the regional cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  There was a short response to that but the matter is dealt with substantially under note 4.  </p> <p>  Last, we asked for a note clarifying whether the NTA employs an environmental economist.  The response states the NTA does not directly employ an environmental economist.  However, through the consultancy framework agreements that the NTA has made, it has access to economists specialising in the assessment of environmental issues.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2565B, from the clerk to the Joint Committee on Health, dated 20 November 2019, acknowledges receipt of our document sent to that committee in respect of public-private partnerships in the health centres.  The committee noted the correspondence that we received from the HSE regarding the operation of public-private partnerships for health centres.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2566B is from the private secretary to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality and is dated 22 November 2019.  It provides details requested by the committee regarding the numbers of applications for asylum and international protection for the period from 2005 to 21 November 2019.  This information was included in our periodic report.  I acknowledge and thank all the members and the staff who participated and thank them for attending at the launch of the report last Tuesday.  The information provided was one of the final pieces of information.  We were very pleased to be able to include it in the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#E00300"><p>I agree with the Chairman.  I welcomed the letter and did so at the launch of the report.  I welcome the clarification on the period 2005 to 2019.  I urge members to read the documentation to have accurate information when there is talk of a surge in the numbers.  There has not been a surge, as the graph illustrates.  There is not much difference between numbers in the period from 2005 until 2019.  There have been four years with a number higher than that in 2018.  It is important to keep this in perspective in view of the narrative that goes out from certain quarters.</p> <p>  The total number, 87,838, in the period is very small by comparison with that for other countries.  When put in perspective, the number should be managed easily in a proper way, given value for money and given our remit.  We should not have problems in dealing with that number of people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#E00400"><p>I have an ancillary point.  This is happening at a time when there is very serious pressure on other countries, particularly given what has been happening in the Mediterranean over the past few years.  We have got to see this backdrop also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#E00500"><p>Absolutely.  We referred to that clearly in our report.  Figures from several years before 2015 were much higher than on previous occasions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General produced several reports on the costs of accommodation and acquiring hotels.  Some hotels did not come into use.  A previous Committee of Public Accounts discussed accommodation that was not utilised when required.  There is a long history.  This is not a recent phenomenon.  That is the essential point being made.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 2567B is from Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and provides a link to CSO releases regarding environmental air emissions accounts.  The detail is available.  We raised the issue and Mr. Dalton has given us the link to the various CSO releases.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2569B, from Ms Rachel Downes, CEO of Caranua, dated 22 November 2019, is responding to information requested by the committee regarding eligibility criteria.  At our meeting on 14 November, it was agreed to request an information note from Caranua to ascertain whether there are other options open to an individual who has not already received an award or settlement from the redress board or a court.  Caranua does not appear to have answered the question and I propose to request that it address this specific point.  It refers to the legislation, stating the person had to have received the award or a settlement.  We shall ask Caranua to clarify the exact point.  It seems to answer it but I would like absolute clarification on the specifics we referred to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#E00600"><p>On a related matter, since we had the meeting I received correspondence from a number of survivors who had work done in their homes.  The works were carried out by a company, which I will not name, and they were raised in the context of the discussion we had with Caranua.  Obviously, works varied from house to house but questions were certainly raised in regard to the cost of the works.  I refer to the cost to Caranua and the money that was paid to whatever company was doing the work, in addition to the costs of the materials and the equipment that would have been provided to the homes.  I have a query about the financial controls that were in place.  Was there tendering for the company?  If company A is given the job of doing certain works in a home and provides an invoice, what auditing and controls are in place to ensure the costs are appropriate?  From what I have seen, I have concerns.  I forwarded a receipt in regard to one of the emails I received to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</p></speech>

I am not sure I received the receipt from the Deputy.</p></speech>

If it was not sent, I will forward it.  I believe it was sent.  I would like us to consider this matter again, initially through correspondence with Caranua.  What companies were engaged by Caranua?  What financial controls had it in place?  I will consider the information received.</p><p>I am being careful of what I say as there are companies involved and I am not alleging any wrongdoing by anybody.  I just want to see what financial control is in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#F00200"><p>My essential understanding of the arrangement with Caranua is that the individual had the contractual arrangement with the contractor.  Caranua was not engaged directly in most cases because it wanted to maintain the person's privacy and dignity rather than going to a contractor and stating Caranua would pay.</p></speech>

We will happily send on that letter to Caranua for clarification.  We will note and published the letter received today.</p><p>Correspondence No. 2570 was received from Ms Carol Hanney, chief executive of City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, dated 22 November.  It provides a further comprehensive note regarding the processes and procedures in SUSI for grant application cases involving difficult family situations.  We will note and publish it.</p><p>For absolute clarification, we received a previous note and we were not happy with some particular aspects of how sensitive cases are dealt with.  This letter clarifies for the information of the committee that CDETB &quot;is the statutorily appointed national grant awarding authority designated by the Minister for Education and Skills to administer student grants.  SUSI is an administrative unit of CDETB&quot;.  Some people think SUSI is part of the Department or an independent body but in fact the City of Dublin Education and Training Board is the designated statutory authority to deal with grants and SUSI is a division within that organisation.</p><p>With regard to the point I raised regarding the correspondence note we received, and Deputy Connolly also made the same point, we asked for information on how SUSI deals with sensitive issues.  We explained that in cases of family break up some students have immense difficulties getting information from both parents; that it is often not possible for them to get the information; that grant applications are not being approved in these situations; and, that people are losing out because of sensitive family situations.  The note mentioned the issue of barring orders.  We were very alarmed to hear SUSI might be looking for details of barring orders because that would affect third parties.  They come from the family law courts and are not meant to be in public.  It would probably be a breach of a court order to provide the information.</p><p>I will now read from the letter from the chief executive of CDETB:</p> <blockquote> 	In particular arising from your letter of 7 November, I wish to clarify that barring orders and decisions of the Family Law Courts are neither specifically requested nor required by SUSI in any case.  However, and based on experience in practice of the documents that can and have been provided to SUSI to date where it has been necessary to evidence relevant family circumstances in order to determine grant eligibility, barring orders are currently included in the indicative list of documents that is provided for the information and guidance of students in such cases.  </blockquote> <p>The letter states barring orders are not specifically requested but they are included in an indicative list the applicant can provide.  This is important.  The Committee of Public Accounts has achieved something.  The next sentence states:</p> <blockquote> 	Having regard to the views and concerns expressed by the Committee, the reference to barring orders will be removed from the indicative list of documents for the future. </blockquote> <p>We have been on the case and SUSI took on board what we said.  I wanted to make this point as people often ask whether we achieve anything here and this is something.  It is a small but important point.  We will note and publish this information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#F00500"><p>I welcome this.  I do not know how it ever included barring orders on an indicative list.  Certainly if it has learned that much it is to be welcome.  I welcome that barring orders have been removed.  In the letter Ms Hanney states, "I wish to clarify that barring orders and decisions of the Family Law Courts are neither specifically requested nor required by SUSI".  The letter then makes the point about barring orders being removed from the list.  I presume it is the same for judicial separations but I do not know.  It is a bit disingenuous.  Perhaps SUSI does not intentionally mean to be disingenuous.  It has taken out barring orders but has it taken out judicial separation orders and divorce?  I do not know.</p></speech>

There was a meeting in October and the OPW is following up some matters.  I propose we request a further update of matters not yet concluded.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2575 B and No. 2578 B are from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General of Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  We will hold these until we come to dealing with No. 2581, which is the letter we received this morning.  We will note and publish them.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2579B is from Mr. Colum Walsh, deputy commissioner at the Data Protection Commission, providing the commission's view on the Department of Finance and other public bodies providing details of fees paid to barristers.  This is a very comprehensive and useful response to the matter raised and it appears that the Data Protection Commission shares the committee's view that the need to provide transparency overrides privacy concerns about fees paid to individual barristers.  I want to refer to this letter because it is a very important issue.  I acknowledge this arises from issues raised by the Vice Chairman, Deputy Alan Kelly, who raised this matter through parliamentary questions and brought it to the committee, resulting in the committee making a recommendation in our interim report last week.  For the benefit of the public, and especially for the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance whose view we received in the last letter on this, Mr. Walsh's letter states the practice of disclosing the names of barristers along with fees paid to them by Government Departments and public bodies is long standing.</p><p>Such disclosures have arisen, for example, under the Freedom of Information Act and parliamentary questions.  The voluntary disclosure of certain payments is part of the public service reform plan.  The commission is stating that it is not clear what precipitated the apparent recent change in practice on the part of certain Government bodies and that it is not required under GDPR rules specifically.  The letter goes on to mention that there is a legitimate interest to be transparent and accountable financially as a public body funded by the Exchequer.  It said that when the commission is processing information, it must be conscious of the processing of the data subject, namely, the individual concerned, where such processing would represent a disproportionate interference with the subject's rights.  The letter goes on to talk about how the commission believes the balance is in favour of public disclosure and accountability.  The letter then states that the commission noted that during the course of its deliberations, the Committee of Public Accounts suggested that a recommendation be made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that tenderers for publicly-funded contracts should be told that their fees and costs will be disclosed as part of the process and that the commission supports that recommendation.  It is very clear that people should be informed of it at the very beginning of the process.  That should deal with the issue.  The letters says the commission supports our view on the matter.  The matter is not yet closed.  I think we will send this letter to the Department of Finance and ask it to study it and respond accordingly.  Deputies MacSharry and Cullinane have indicated they wish to speak.</p></speech>

I thank the Vice Chairman, whose parliamentary questions did us a service in terms of raising this issue.  The letter from the deputy commissioner is unequivocal on this matter.  I and indeed others made a proposal some weeks ago, which is in our report, that all public contracts include this.  It is a point made regularly by Deputy Connolly.  The belief that the public must be protected from the truth is wrong.  It subverts democracy.  If I am tendering for a State contract, I am sure that I would be happy to win a contract and get paid and that I would not be worried about the argument about something being commercially sensitive, which is often used in here.  The more that prices and fees are out in the public domain, the more pressure and momentum can be built to achieve value for money for us and perhaps bring prices down.  I described the Department's explanation as to why these fees would not be released as political opportunism at best.  The unequivocal response from the deputy commissioner bears that out absolutely.  I thank the deputy commissioner for his response and Deputy Kelly for bringing it to our attention.  I very much hope that the Department moves swiftly to implement the committee's recommendation that all future public tenders inform tenderers that this information will go into the public domain and that the public is entitled to no less.</p></speech>

It was correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding his last visit here.  I posed a number of questions to him regarding JobPath and its overall cost, which I think has been over &euro;70 million.  I asked specific questions about referrals.  I asked whether it was possible for somebody to be referred a third time and he said "No".  I think he said it was almost impossible for somebody to be referred a third time.  My colleague put down a parliamentary question only to find out that not only were people referred a third time, some people had been referred a fourth time.  There is a cost involved every time somebody is referred.  Can we go back and get a breakdown from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as to how many people have been referred once, how many have been referred a second, third and fourth time, the total cost and why?  We are spending significant amounts of money on this and if it is the case that somebody is being placed for a third or fourth time, something is not working.  I would like that clarified.  Although the Accounting Officer may not have known, he was certainly very clear.  I think he said that it was almost impossible for somebody to be referred a third time.  In some cases, it was for a fourth time.</p></speech>

I am proposing to hold over category C - correspondence from private individuals to next week's meeting.</p><p>I will return to No. 2581 B from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General, Houses of the Oireachtas Service, which incorporates No. 2575 B and 2578 B.No. 2581 B is the report received this morning from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Clerk of the D&aacute;il and Secretary General, Houses of the Oireachtas Service entitled, &quot;Report on the purchase of the Komori printing press and related matters for the Committee of Public Accounts&quot;.  This report was only received this morning so I will ask the secretariat to make arrangements so that within the hour of us concluding this matter, the report will be published on the committee website.  Because members do not have access to it, I ask them to bear with me for a few moments so that people watching understand what is in the report before we start our discussion.  They will understand our discussion better if we put the contents of the report on the record.  </p><p>It is an eight-page report.  Do not worry; I will not read it all.  It outlines the print facility and the background.  The print facility has operated since 2007 and is used extensively by Members and to a small extent by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service for some of its work.  The average number of documents printed per year is 2,357.  This is an average of ten per Member or thereabouts.  The report states that the annual expenditure in recent years for the print facility for ongoing services has averaged between &euro;550,000 and &euro;600,000, plus staffing costs for 2018 of approximately &euro;610,000.  The report states the facility can only be used by Members with regard to their parliamentary duties.  It cannot be used for any other matters and it has standards in place to ensure Members do not print anything unconnected with their parliamentary duties.  The report also states the porters will deliver the finished print jobs to a Member's car or Members may pick them up directly from the print facility.  I also wish to add that major print jobs such as newsletters are collected by arrangement with a Member, who will pay for a van to collect them directly from the print facility.  Not everything will fit in the boot of a single car.  Most of the large items are collected by couriers and transported to wherever a Member has requested.  There is a print users' council comprising four Members - two Deputies and two Senators - and four members of staff.  One print manager and eight print staff are employed and the print facility is located in the basement of Kildare House across the road from the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House.  </p><p>The project to upgrade the printing equipment began in 2017.  It was approved by the management board and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The report states that the original equipment, which was 12 years old, was fully depreciated and expensive to maintain.  Provision was made in the 2018 Estimates of &euro;1.5 million to cover the expected costs, which included decommissioning of the existing equipment.  It was expected that the new printing press would cost approximately &euro;850,000, excluding VAT.  It was expected that there would be savings due to not having to service the existing machines, the machines having trade-in value, spare parts costing less and a movement to a greener production facility rather than the old machine, which was over 12 years of age.  The report also stated that it would facilitate the printing of a new range of printed products for Members and staff, i.e., A5 booklets, which could not be printed on the original printer.  I ask members to bear with me.  I want them to understand the system.  </p><p>The dates involving the procurement process were: 15 August 2017, when market soundings meetings took place on the Leinster House campus; 5 March 2018, when the request for tender was published on eTenders and in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, OJEU; 21 March 2018, when there was a site visit for interested parties; 29 March 2018, which was the deadline for receipt of clarifications of information; 5 April 2018, which was the closing date for receipt of tenders; 12 April 2018, which was the date for the evaluation of tenders received; 19 April 2018, which was the date of the post-closing clarification meeting; 27 April 2018, which was the date of consideration by the Oireachtas contracts committee; 27 April 2018, when contracts were awarded; 31 May 2018, when contracts were signed; and 18 June 2018, when the contract award notice was published on eTenders and in the OJEU.</p><p>It is stated that when they took the market soundings in 2017, three suppliers attended in Leinster House and subsequently, it was decided that to facilitate open access by SMEs that the tender would be split into five separate lots.  I will spell out the different lots.  The big one was lot 2, the Komori printer, which was the main item.  On that, it is stated that as part of the visit, the company which visited asked about clearance and the response provided was that there was a false ceiling and there was another 35 cm, approximately 12 or 13 inches, of room.<br/><br/>On lot 2, the main printer, the head room from the Press, it was stated, was limited.  They subsequently sent a number of documents, email dated 25 April, including a one-page drawing which showed the existing ceiling height of 2.5 m and the recommended ceiling height of 3.16 m.  &quot;However, at the time of writing this Report&quot;, Mr. Peter Finnegan states, &quot;I have yet to establish how ... this information was processed within the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.&quot;.  Therefore, the Komori company highlighted this issue and Mr. Finnegan is not yet clear how that was processed within the system at this stage.<br/><br/>The contract was signed on 31 May 2018.  A drawing of the machine and a sketch of the proposed location was provided at that stage.  On 30 May 2018, they contacted the Office of Public Works.<br/><br/>Mr. Finnegan goes on to state:</p><blockquote>	In an email dated the 15th August 2018, the OPW Architect stated that having carried out a review of the specifications an issue regarding the head room had been identified.<br /><br />The initial consideration of the brief by architects and engineers concluded that the proposed location in Print Room 1 would not be advisable. </blockquote><p>Then it was agreed to locate the printer, which they had intended to go into print room 1, in print room 2.  The OPW had structural engineers involved and a survey was concluded in January 2019.  The letter states, &quot;Following the survey, it was confirmed that print room 2 was feasible for the loading required&quot; but the OPW also took the opportunity to carry out additional works on the fabric of the building to include replacement of obsolete air conditioning.<br/><br/>The final plans for the layout of the room were signed off in June 2019 and a key aspect was to ensure that the existing printing facilities would continue in operation during the installation works.  A work programme was agreed with the contractors and suppliers, the main works commenced in August 2019 and the print machine was delivered on 28 September 2019.<br/><br/>The printing equipment is now installed and commissioned.  Training has yet to take place as the Houses of the Oireachtas Service and SIPTU are in discussion to address concerns raised by the print facility staff.<br/><br/>On the money aspect of this, as we mentioned already, the job was broken into five separate lots.  The five separate lots came to a total of &euro;1.369 million, including VAT.  It was broken down as follows: The plate making device was &euro;105,000 plus VAT; lot 2, the main printer, was &euro;848,000 plus VAT less trade-in valued at &euro;40,000 for the old equipment; the folding machines were &euro;100,000, excluding VAT; the guillotines were &euro;63,500; and the pile turner was &euro;37,000.  That adds up to &euro;1.369 million, including VAT.  Then the works carried out were &euro;229,000 plus the construction rate of VAT, that is &euro;260,000, giving a cost of &euro;1.625 million to date on that work.  The OPW carry out additional work on the ventilation at a cost, including VAT, of approximately &euro;220,000 to date.<br/><br/>The Secretary General stated that this matter was referred to in the Appropriation Accounts 2018.  He mentions that there was a prepayment of costs totalling &euro;1.793 million, which is greater than the figure I mentioned but includes laptops which were purchased that have not yet been brought into commission.  With the Comptroller and Auditor General, as part of the audit, it was agreed that these could not be included in fixed assets because they were not in operation.  They had been paid for, they were sitting here but were not in operation and the Comptroller and Auditor General stated they cannot come into fixed assets.  This prepayment of &euro;1.793 million was mentioned in the accounts.<br/><br/>In the conclusions - I am at the last page now - Mr. Finnegan stated that there is a large number of documents printed every year and, of course, any national parliament should have its own printing facility.  I do not think people disagree with that.<br/><br/>Mr. Finnegan goes on to state:</p><blockquote>	However, the requirements of the building and other regulations in relation to 'head height' were neither understood nor examined during the critical early stages of the project.  A project of this scale and complexity requires specialist expertise (particularly architectural and engineering) on the project team at all stages and this must be a consideration in all future projects. </blockquote><p>Mr. Finnegan is clear in what he is saying there.  He states:</p><blockquote>	Given the printing requirements in the Houses of the Oireachtas as expressed in the Request for Tender Document, it is my opinion that significant structural adaptations would have been necessary in any event. </blockquote><p>That is the conclusion of Mr. Finnegan's report.<br/><br/>I will take comments.  Deputy Cullinane is first up and will be followed by Deputies MacSharry, Munster, Catherine Murphy and Connolly.  That is the sequence.  We will try to have a brief discussion.  It goes without saying we have some of the information here today and we have not heard from the OPW, which carried out all the work, or its contractors and tenders.  We have some of the information today but we want to hear from the OPW separately as well.<br/><br/>We will try to keep the debate brief.  I am sorry for taking so much time to read the report but people have not seen this published, bar somebody leaking a copy of it this morning.  I want people to understand the context of this discussion.</p></speech>

It is a seven-page report.  We would not have this report had it not been for a freedom of information, FOI, request by a journalist of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  That is the first, and obvious, point to make.</p><p>Mr. Finnegan was before this committee for the first time on 11 July of this year.  I asked him specific questions in relation to one of the broad headings in the Appropriation Account which was office equipment and ICT expenditure.  There was an overspend of approximately &euro;9.5 million and Mr. Finnegan's response at the time was that there was a three-year cycle, money had to be spent at the end of that three-year cycle and, as the Chairman referenced, there was a contract that was brought forward to replace laptops which nobody had a difficulty with.  Mr. Finnegan mentioned the printer unit and the &euro;1.3 million cost.  What he did not mention was all of the other issues contained in this seven-page report, including the reference to the lack of understanding and not proper examination in the critical early stages of the project in relation to requirements.</p><p>The report essentially states that the initial contract - I suppose, the initial intention - was to locate this printer in printer room 1 and then that was not possible because of sizes, maybe because of mistakes in measurements or whatever happened.  We still do not know.  It is not clear from this report.  It is clear mistakes were made but it is not clear in this report who exactly made the mistakes.  When Mr. Finnegan refers to a lack of expertise, exactly what is he talking about?</p><p>In his report, when Mr. Finnegan is giving the costs, it is VAT inclusive when it comes to the machine itself and VAT exclusive when it comes to the adaption works that had to be done.  What is the total cost?</p></speech>

That brings the cost, excluding the works on the ventilation system, to &euro;1.629 million.</p></speech>

Mr. Finnegan states that there was no attempt on his part or the part of anyone else in the Houses of the Oireachtas to withhold any information.  None of us is accusing him of withholding information, but he was here and he was made aware of and knew about the difficulties in locating the printer in the room for which it was intended; as he states himself, there were difficulties in "the critical early stages of the project.".</p><p>This is a printer that cost significantly more than it should have because, it seems, mistakes were made.  We know from the freedom of information, FOI, request that a memo was sent to the Clerk at the D&aacute;il in December 2018 outlining all of these difficulties and challenges.  I am also aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General would have been aware as well of some of the issues, problems or challenges with the fit-out.  The Comptroller and Auditor General knew about the challenges.  Mr. Finnegan knew.  We had a discussion about the accounts.  I specifically asked about that broad heading and the printer was mentioned, but we were not made aware of it.</p><p> When Mr. Finnegan states that there was no lack of candour or no withholding of information, there certainly was not a volunteering of information.  While it is the case that we may have come to know about it when we looked at the accounts for next year or the year after the fit-out costs were mentioned, we expect Accounting Officers to give us all the information.  It is not credible for Mr. Finnegan to say that that was the case when he appeared before us.  He is a civil servant of long standing and someone I have a high regard for, but when Accounting Officers are here, they need to account fully for all of the issues.  When specific questions were asked on this overspend, and the questions we were asking were quite clear in relation to the overspend, at the very least we should been made aware of the challenges that were in play here as to the additional costs, and we were not.  Now we are, and have a seven-page report.  We still do not have the full costs.  There may be more costs.  I have spoken to some of the staff as well so there are no HR issues with the staff.  Let us very clear about that.  There are no HR issues with the operation of this printer.  There are training issues.  It is a printer that is twice the size of any printer the staff have ever used before.  They need to use a forklift in a very tight space to load up the paper.  It has to be done in the turn machine, that turns the paper.  It has to be brought in in a forklift, loaded up, printed on one side, and then the forklift brought back out again to a different room and brought back in again.  There was no consultation with the staff - none whatsoever.  Training has not taken place yet.</p><p> This was a mess from start to finish that has cost us more money.  Yet despite all of that, we were not informed when the Accounting Officer was here.  For me that is not good enough.  Mr. Finnegan has to appear before us again to account properly for all of this.  Yes, we have his report, but it is our job to hold him to account fairly and give him the opportunity to respond.  He has given his opinion.  I am giving my opinion.  Other members of the committee will have their opinion.  My opinion is very clear: this was a mess, Mr. Finnegan was not as forthcoming as he should have been, and as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am not happy with that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#J00300"><p>There are a number of issues and I will try to add to what has been said, as opposed to going over old ground.  At the end of the report it is stated, "A project of this scale and complexity requires specialist expertise".  I find that comment insulting, and it takes members of the public for fools, not least the members of this committee.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane on the lack of candour.  These are the kind of things that should be brought to our attention.  If it is a small note in the accounts, it can be easily missed given the volume of stuff we are dealing with.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has a good reputation for doing its business well, particularly when costs had to be cut during the time of austerity and the crash.</p> <p>  A couple of questions arise.  First, and I think the public is entitled to know this, was the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission apprised of this and what role did it play in taking the decision in the first instance as to why new printers were required, the cost etc.?  It may well have been, but I believe the public is anxious to know why we are spending &euro;1 million or thereabouts on a new printer in the first place.  Second, what is the Oireachtas contracts committee, who is on it, and would this committee like to talk to us?  I never heard of it and I am interested to know who is on it and what role it played.  Third, there is the print users council.  As a former member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and of that council itself, I want to know if it had any role.  My understanding from the short period I was on it is that its role is oversight in terms of the eligibility of content requested for printing, in order that it is not overly political.  Was this council involved in this process?  Those are three groups that I am interested in hearing from: the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which includes Members of the Oireachtas, the print users council, and the contracts committee.</p> <p>  I find the phrase "A project of this scale and complexity" insulting because what we have done here is to have applied the children's hospital approach to public procurement.  Let us buy it and stuff it in.  Another sentence reads, "I have yet to establish how or if this information was processed within the Houses of the Oireachtas Service".  That is Mr. Finnegan's reference to the lack of understanding of the headroom.  In the tender document it said that it must be able to fit in the room.  The report tells us that there were site visits and further liaisons.  That is a basic requirement.  If it does not fit in the room, how does an applicant win the tender?  If an applicant did win the tender and it did not fit in the room, how did the applicant get paid?  There is a reference to there being a lack of understanding.  Sixty-six more centimetres were needed, they would get 31 once the false ceiling was removed, but they were still 30 plus centimetres short.  The printer did not fit.  That was another problem.  They brought in the OPW then, and for all its wonderful expertise, it had no structural engineers.  They had to bring in external consultants.  This has been a total pig's ear.</p> <p>  As always happens at this committee when matters like this emerge, and there are a few at least every year that capture the media's attention in a major way, and I have said this many times here before, there are no tangible sanctions when we have blatant incompetence.  It can be dressed up as being very complex, but there was correspondence today from the chairman of the Office of Public Works about the disaster that is Miesian Plaza.  I am still laughing about the day when I asked at this committee if there was a disciplinary process on foot of it, and I was told it was not a disciplinary matter.  When I asked who was to blame, the OPW witness said he probably shared some of the blame because he signed off on it.</p> <p>  Would such people last the rest of the day in the private sector?  They certainly would not be there after a month.  In this instance, people are entitled to look for a head.  We cannot have a level of autopilot that leads to waste and a loss of money that is down to pure incompetence.  There is nothing complex about this at all.  It is basic cop-on.  No university degree, masters or PhD qualification is required, just simple cop-on.  The seven-page report may as well be thrown into the nearest shredder as far as I am concerned.  It is an utter disgrace and it is going on in every aspect of Departments and State agencies.  We blame it on systemic failure in a very complex process, where very specialised people are required to advise us on this.  Either we are populated as a State by a bunch of incompetents, ourselves politically included, or people start accounting for their actions and their responsibilities.  That is how the world operates in the private sector, and it needs to begin in here.</p> <p>  I know enough about how this happened.  There are people in responsible roles in command.  Let someone tell us now who is responsible and what disciplinary action is going to be required.  In another room in the Houses of the Oireachtas at the moment, there is a hearing of committee to consider tangible action for wrongdoing, and rightly so.  It is about time our public services and individuals who are paid high salaries, ourselves as politicians included, had to answer and face tangible sanction for blatant incompetence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#J00400"><p>I was flicking through the report that we received at 8.27 this morning, at the 11th hour, to say the least.  On page 7 in the report, in the last paragraph, Mr. Finnegan states that: "I was advised that the estimated cost was &euro;230,000",  but he does not say when he was advised of that.  Did he know about this when he was before the committee on 11 July?</p><p>In the next sentence, Mr. Finnegan states: "As you will be aware no discussion arose on the cost of the works in the course of my appearance."  Is he saying that because questions were not asked about refurbishment works which we had not been informed of, he was under no obligation to answer on that, even though he knew the committee was not aware of it?  The information came out only through the freedom of information request.  Alternatively, is he saying he did not have to answer on that because the refurbishment costs were not strictly in the 2018 budget?  Mr. Finnegan would know full well that the focus of this committee is on the systems, practices and procedures that underpin public expenditure.  He would not need us to tell him that.  It appears he omitted to give that information knowing that it related to an overrun.  This amounts to a breakdown in the process that has caused an overspend of upwards of &euro;500,000.  There are some serious questions to ask.</p><p> I read the Official Report of the meeting on 11 July and in response to a question by my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, about an increase of &euro;9.7 million, Mr. Finnegan said: "To answer the Deputy's last question first, the increase of &euro;9.7 million resulted from a strategic decision that we did because there was funding available in the final year of our three-year budgetary cycle."  The next sentence seems very casual on reading back: "The service basically recommended to the commission that we bring forward ICT expenditure."  The casual way he says let us blow this on ICT expenditure hints that this was a rushed job and that would most definitely explain the complete and utter hames that has been made of it.  There are lots of questions and Mr. Finnegan should be invited to appear before the committee. </p></speech>

They were 12 years old and cost in the region of &euro;150,000 annually in repairs and maintenance.  Printers have a lifespan.  We also have to question the extent of the printing.  There does not seem to be a forum that deals with that and that is a very obvious gap at a point where we communicate very differently now, using social media and other platforms.  Even if we are not dealing with its detail we should be identifying the thinking about the requirements for the future as a point of oversight.  It appears to be an extraordinary amount of printing and it is only when we see it captured in the report that its full import is obvious.  My understanding is that some of this expenditure extended over two years and that is part of the reason we did not see it.  We need to have it categorically stated that it is likely to be in two sets of accounts. </p></speech>

The cheque was written in 2018, the works were done in 2019 and, as we speak at the end of 2019, the machine is not yet in operation.  It may well be 2020 before it is in operation.</p></speech>

We need to know the job titles of those involved.  I do not imagine the Clerk of the D&aacute;il would be micromanaging this.  We need to see where the problems arose in the decision making.  We are seeing some of that in the procurement process in respect of the head of communications.  One of the dates that jumped out at me reading this report is that the contract was signed on 31 May 2018.  The day before that, 30 May 2018, the facilities unit in the Houses of the Oireachtas service contacted the OPW.  At the same time it was known that there was a headroom issue.  Why was the headroom issue not brought to the OPW's attention from the time that the procurement process opened?  That is the critical timeline.  I understand that there may have been a fire safety issue and we need to know if that is the case, and if that was ancillary work done at the same time.  We do not want Kildare House to go on fire.  Has there been any outsourcing in the interim when one machine had to be moved out to fit another one in?  Is it costing more?  That is an obvious question we should ask.</p> <p>  I do not know how we quite capture the issue on the extent of the printing but I absolutely want that captured.  I do not think the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is the person who will deal with that.  That is a political issue.  We need to find a way to decide what the requirements are, even though this machine has been purchased.  It may be possible to print some of the material that is necessary in the Houses and goes out for printing.  There is another contract with Cahills for the day to day material.  It may be possible to achieve some cost savings if the machine has sufficient capacity.</p></speech>

I am putting the matter in context and saying we should not demonise one sector and sanctify another whose mistakes to date I and all other taxpayers are paying for.</p><p>Doing so is much more difficult for some than it is for me. </p><p> I welcome this eight page report, which was put together very quickly.  Unfortunately, it is only the first step.  For me, the key part of the report is the fact that the person writing it says he does not know all the details.  Previous speakers also referred to this.  The report notes that Komori highlighted the problem.  The author of the report states: "However, at the time of writing this Report I have yet to establish how or if this information was processed within the Houses of the Oireachtas Service."  Perhaps he needs more time to look at that.  The issue was raised but not dealt with.  That is the process we need to look at.  Week after week, we hear about processes that are theoretically in place but that in practice are not actually working.</p><p> A business case for this purchase went before the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which presumably approved it.  We are always talking about the lack of business cases at this committee, but in this instance, one was made.  Two pages of this report give us the background, which is very welcome in a democracy where Deputies and Senators are benefiting from a printer in the interest of democracy.  Those two pages are necessary but I would have preferred two pages on what happened with the process failure.  Perhaps there was not enough time to look into that but I would like to go back and get a report on the processes.</p><p> My colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, raised outsourcing, which is mentioned in the report and must be clarified.  It is stated that a contract is in place, and that the facility will outsource jobs and so on.  It is not clear to me whether the service has already availed of external printing, given the problems with this machine.  Is that just for the future?  It is not clear to me whether there are additional costs involved.</p><p> I welcome the list but it is extremely basic.  More than one site visit took place, as Deputy MacSharry noted.  I agree with him on that.  Issues were raised by Komori, the Office of Public Works and the architects.  They raised issues, yet nothing was done and no review of the matter was undertaken.</p><p> On the storage price-----</p></speech>

One thing I have learned from this case is that this committee is only as good as the questions we ask and our attendance rate.  However, one would expect candour from a body that comes before us to give us information.  That should not be dependent on our questions.  Given the price and the importance of the printing, it should have been explained to us that problems had arisen, what those problems were and that the printer was in storage.  That would have fostered trust and accountability.  Mistakes are made on occasion, but it is how we deal with them that gives me the greatest cause for grief week after week in this committee.</p></speech>

However, I do not want my contribution to be misrepresented to suggest that I was sanctifying the private sector while rubbishing the public sector.  I started by praising the Oireachtas Commission, as a former member of it.  I was one of the people who prevented it from establishing a CEO of the Oireachtas, in order to ensure we had a Clerk of the calibre of Mr. Peter Finnegan.  That said, my point was that in the private sector an employer cannot afford to tolerate this sort of incompetence, or the company would go out of business.  That is the point I am making.</p></speech>

The amount of money needed to make the room ready for the printer would build a significant four-bedroom house in Mullingar.  It is a huge sum of money.  There is great public interest in this issue because of the figures involved.  We need to get to the bottom of it, and procedure must also take its course.</p></speech>

It is a comedy of errors.  This is taxpayers' money.  No one seems to worry, be held accountable or take the rap when taxpayers' money is being spent.  An eight page report is written and then it is forgotten about.  I do not think it should be forgotten about.  Lessons should be learned here.  This was a simple thing but it all went wrong.  Two old printers were decommissioned because they were decrepit and we decided to buy a new, modern printer, which is a simple thing.  One does not need a master's degree to go into a room, get the dimensions of the new printer and figure out how to get it in the front door and place it.  It is a simple thing, yet it went all wrong.  It has cost hundreds of thousands of euro of extra money.  Someone must be accountable for this because someone is responsible for it.  The public is right and as my colleague, Deputy Connolly noted, despite the crises in housing and health, money can be wasted like this and no one seems to care or be responsible for it.  It is our job to ensure proper accountability when public money is being spent.  This needs to be accounted for and someone needs to stand up and take the rap for it.</p></speech>

We should come to an understanding of where we want to take this because it is a much broader issue.  Deputy Connolly made a point about the processes, on which we need to agree.</p> <p>  Pictures of Mr. Peter Finnegan have been splashed across all the newspapers in the last few days, as he is the Accounting Officer, but a much deeper analysis is required beyond such a simplification of the issue.  Point 2 of the analysis and conclusions stands out for me, where Mr. Finnegan says: "the requirements of the building and other regulations in relation to 'head height' were neither understood nor examined during the critical early stages of the project."  The key question is to whom that lack of understanding refers.  The OPW came in waving a red flag on 15 August.  It is right and proper to raise a debacle such as Miesian Plaza and the money lost in that case because there was no acceptance of guilt from the OPW when we discussed the matter at this committee.  The simple focus of the OPW in that project was that its job was to deliver X, which it did, and it did not anticipate the HR problems that would result in it being in cold storage for a long time.  As Deputy Burke said, that cost us &euro;20 million.  That seems to be the accepted practice.  We have to ask where the buck stops with such projects.  We cannot let processes go on in those circumstances, because here it is repeating itself again today.</p> <p>  According to the timeline in the report, a valuation of tenders was received on 12 April 2018, which the Oireachtas contracts committee considered on 27 April.</p><p>However, it was flagged in an email on 25 April that there were problems pertaining to the height issue.  The committee should formally ask, by email, whether that issue was on the table at the meeting.  I do not accept that the issue was flagged on 25 April but the report states: &quot;However, at the time of writing this Report I have yet to establish how or if this information was processed within the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.&quot;  An email must go to someone.  We can simply establish to whom it was sent.  We could find out this morning to whom the email was sent and the action that was taken.  It may have been forwarded to someone else.  If so, the electronic system would have recorded that.  These are simple questions which would not involve a detailed process of investigation.  We should establish whether the email was considered at the meeting on 25 April.<br/><br/>I wish to know what expertise is on the contracts committee in light of the report stating that the requirements of the building had not been anticipated.  I have walked the floor of the print room many times.  When I started out as a student journalist some 25 years ago, I visited the former print facility of <i>The Irish Times</i>on D'Olier Street.  When the <i>Meath Chronicle</i>required a new printing press, it was obvious that the confines of the old print room were unsuitable, so it built a new printing facility.  The printing facility in Kildare House is very tight on space.  It is extremely limited in terms of height requirement.  I wonder what discussions took place with the people who operate the facility.  They have the expertise in terms of knowing how to operate a print facility.  I have been there several times.  The limited space in the room should have been a basic consideration in the evaluation of the contracts.  <br/><br/>We should establish whether the email flagging the issue was discussed at the meeting on 25 April, ascertain the expertise of the committee and identify who was engaged to analyse that.</p></speech>

It is clear we need to send a transcript of this session to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  The points made will be well enumerated in the transcript and will enable him to respond.</p> <p>  We should write directly to the OPW regarding its role, tendering process and advice, as well as clarifying when it became involved.  Reference was made to the issue of head height and that it transpired the room had to be changed entirely.  I do not know why the head height in the room into which the machine was subsequently put was not identified in the first place.  We need to know the reason for changing rooms.  I will ask the OPW to supply that information as well as further detail on the cost of its work, the tendering process and the designs and processes it had in place.  We need to know whether the figure supplied is final and when the Oireachtas will receive the final bill.</p> <p>  It is worth noting an issue that has arisen in other instances dealt with by the committee.  The job was separated into five lots related to the various aspects of the machine.  One tender was received in respect of each of the five lots.  One would think there would have been more than one expression of interest in a printing contract of this scale at a European level.  Three companies visited the premises initially and the contract was then broken down.  Three companies successfully tendered to provide various parts but it seems that only one response was received in respect of each of the five lots.  Although it went through a competitive process, the market did not produce any price competition.  The Oireachtas only got one submission for each lot.  We will get clarification on that issue.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Finnegan for presenting such a comprehensive report within a short time.  It does not answer all the questions on the matter.  This is stage one, but it is a very good start given that the issue only came to light in recent days.  He acknowledges there are some unanswered questions.  He has not had time to answer every question in the few days he had to prepare the report.  We wish to give him time to so do and to respond to the points that have been raised at this meeting.  Similarly, we will write directly to the OPW for its full input regarding tendering, costs and its role and advice on the matter.  I will give Mr. Finnegan and the OPW until 10 December to respond because the last meeting of the committee in 2019 will be on 12 December.  I am not saying it will be necessary for the parties to appear before the committee, but we need this matter fully closed off before our last meeting of the year, which is on 12 December.  We want both organisations to have submitted a report to us by 10 December.  When we see the responses to the questions, we can then decide what to do next.  We are still gathering facts and information, which is very important.</p></speech>

The account records receipts of taxes and duties remitted by Revenue to the Exchequer, and receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies.  In 2018, the net receipts of taxes and duties amounted to a total of &euro;54.6 billion, an increase of &euro;4 billion or 8% when compared to 2017.  At the level of tax headings, the most significant change related to corporation tax receipts, which increased by &euro;2.2 billion, or 27% year-on-year.  Receipts related to VAT, income tax and corporation tax together accounted for 84% of net tax receipts.  Net receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies increased by 14.6% year-on-year, from &euro;12.3 billion in 2017 to &euro;14.1 billion in 2018.  Pay related social insurance contributions continue to account for the majority, nearly 80%, of such receipts.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that there was a change in the treatment of local property tax receipts in 2018.  Up to 2017, such receipts were treated as an Exchequer receipt but since 1 January 2018, local property tax receipts are remitted by Revenue directly to the Local Government Fund.  The amount received in 2018 was &euro;488 million, up marginally from the &euro;482 million received in 2017.</p> <p>  Revenue's administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The appropriation account shows that the total spent by Revenue in 2018 was &euro;425 million.  This was up 3.4% from &euro;411 million in 2017.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;72 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;353 million.  The surrender for the year was &euro;3.7 million.  In my report on the appropriation account, I draw attention to instances of non-compliance by Revenue with procurement rules.  The nature of this and how it is being addressed is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p> <p>  I will turn now to chapter 17, which is on tax compliance interventions.  Chapter 17 outlines Revenue's approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance.  The report reviews controls over compliance interventions and the agreement and collection of tax settlements.  The examination found that Revenue's compliance work is well-targeted.  Just over 460,000 specific interventions were recorded as completed in 2018.  These ranged from low-intensity interventions such as customs checks, checks of information available to Revenue and inquiries with taxpayers, to more intensive on-site audits and investigations.  These can result in identification of a yield amount, that is, additional tax, interest and in some cases, penalties due.  Out of 456,000 non-audit interventions completed in 2018, one in four resulted in identification of yield, amounting to &euro;316 million.  A total of 4,700 audit interventions were also completed in 2018, with almost two thirds of those resulting in a yield.  The average yield per case for completed audits was approximately &euro;84,500.</p> <p>  The review also examined 50 settlement cases closed formally by Revenue in 2018, with a combined yield of &euro;92.7 million.  For most of the cases reviewed, the examination found that the liability had been calculated by Revenue as required under its procedures, or Revenue had validated calculations by a taxpayer's agent, and interest and penalties had been applied in accordance with legislation.  A number of the settlement cases examined have been outlined in the chapter, and illustrate the protracted nature of many compliance and settlement cases.</p> <p>  Case study A involved liabilities of a taxpayer under four aspects of PAYE and PRSI.  While Revenue had issued a notice of estimation of amounts due in one of those areas in 2015 in the amount of &euro;205 million, a settlement offer of &euro;29.1 million was accepted in August 2018.  The reasons for the change in Revenue's view on the liability are documented in the case file and appear reasonable.</p> <p>  In case study B, Revenue accepted a settlement just days before a Tax Appeals Commissioner hearing was due in April 2017.  While Revenue had assessed the tax due at &euro;113 million, it ultimately accepted a settlement offer of &euro;10 million on foot of legal advice to settle, among other reasons, due to the passage of time in the case.</p> <p>  The chapter also looked at the collection of settlements agreed with taxpayers.  In general, Revenue does not pursue intervention yield amounts which it deems uneconomic to pursue.  There is no set threshold for non-pursuit: each amount is judged on a case-by-case basis.  Revenue published information about a total of 554 settlements with taxpayers in quarterly listings in 2017 and 2018, with a combined value totalling &euro;97 million.  Of this amount, 59% had been collected by Revenue by the end of May 2019.  The rate of outstanding liabilities varied, with the highest percentages of yield outstanding for quarter 2 and quarter 3 of 2017.</p> <p>  The chapter made two recommendations around the area of data recording and performance measurement.  The first suggests that Revenue should distinguish in its performance information between interventions prompted by taxpayers and those commenced by Revenue as a result of its own planning or systems.  The second recommendation is that Revenue should consider reporting the differences between the amount of tax assessed as due from compliance activity, the tax settlement amount and the tax actually collected, and the reasons for any variances.</p> <p>  I will turn now to chapter 18, which deals with tax relief on film production.  Tax relief for investment in films, generally referred to as film relief, was first introduced in Ireland in the 1980s.  The administration of film relief involves both the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Revenue Commissioners.  The regulations underpinning the scheme were revised in 2015.  In order for a film production company to qualify for film relief, the project proposal must be authorised by the Department as a qualifying audiovisual project, based on satisfying certain criteria.  A special-purpose production company must be set up for each project.  The company may claim corporation tax relief in advance, based on the projected expenditure on a qualifying project, through the mechanism of a payable tax credit.  This typically results in a payment to the company and does not depend on the amount of tax previously paid.  This is effectively a grant scheme operated through the taxation system.  Under the 2015 scheme, 337 projects were granted a total of &euro;273 million of film relief in the period 2015 to 2018, which is an average of approximately &euro;810,000 per project.</p> <p>  The examination reviewed a sample of 35 film relief applications submitted to the Department between 2015 and 2018.  Three applications were refused on the basis that they were for categories of film not eligible for certification.  All of the remaining 32 projects were approved on the basis that they passed the Department's cultural test.  This means that they met at least three of eight broadly-defined cultural criteria as assessed by the Department.</p><p>While seven of the eight criteria are amenable to quantification or objective testing, one is very broadly stated.  It was noted that almost all of the approved projects were deemed to have met this criterion.</p><p> The Department also operates an alternative employment test for projects that are proposed for film relief.  To qualify under this test, the Minister must be satisfied that the project can act as a stimulus to the making of audiovisual projects in Ireland through the provision of quality employment, training and skills development opportunities.  However, there is no definition of what constitutes quality employment.  The chapter recommends that the Department establish criteria to establish the employment aspects of proposals for film relief.</p><p> Under the 2015 scheme, Revenue was responsible for approving the value of the film relief.  A sample of 15 Revenue files processed under the scheme was examined to check that the prescribed pre-production and post-production checks were undertaken on the projects.  These included checks on the legal structure of the production companies, the budget for the project and the expenditure outturn.  The examination identified no issues of concern from those reviews.</p><p> Revised regulations for film relief were implemented with effect from March 2019.  This included moving the relief to a self-assessment basis, similar to that used for most other tax reliefs.  When the chapter was being finalised, Revenue was still in public consultation with the film sector on draft guidelines on the operation of the credit under the new system.  Revenue stated that planning was underway for an appropriate compliance testing regime for film relief.  The recommendations in the chapter were addressed to the Department, rather than to Revenue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#P00200"><p>I understand that today&rsquo;s meeting is to focus on the Revenue Vote, the account of the receipt of Revenue for 2018 and two chapters of the 2018 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in September.  Those are chapter 17 - tax compliance interventions, and chapter 18 - tax relief on film production.</p> <p>  I am accompanied today by Ms Kathleen Redmond and Mr. Padraigh Donnelly, compliance policy, planning division and Ms Angela O&rsquo;Gorman, Comptroller and Auditor General and committee liaison.</p> <p>  In the context of today&rsquo;s discussions, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.</p> <p>  Revenue's role is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Our aim is to protect Exchequer funds by ensuring that there is compliance with the various tax and duty obligations set down in the laws enacted by the Oireachtas.  We support voluntary compliance by making it as easy as possible for taxpayers to understand and meet their tax and duty obligations and we prioritise the protection of Exchequer funds and support to compliant taxpayers by identifying, targeting and tackling non-compliance on a risk basis.  Revenue responds to non-compliance in all its forms, from non-filing of tax returns to complex tax-avoidance schemes, criminal tax evasion and excise fraud.  Our response is risk-based, proportionate and responsive to taxpayer behaviour.</p> <p>  In 2018, Revenue collected total gross Exchequer receipts of &euro;77.27 billion, including &euro;14.1 billion in non-Exchequer receipts collected on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies.  The net Exchequer receipts were &euro;54.6 billion which was an increase of &euro;4.04 billion, or 8%, over 2017 figures.  The net Exchequer receipts for corporation tax were &euro;11.4 billion, up 26.7%, income tax receipts were &euro;23.5 billion, up 6.6%, and VAT receipts were &euro;19.3 billion, up 7%.  To the end of October this year, the net Exchequer receipts were over &euro;44 billion, some &euro;3 billion more than the same period last year.</p> <p>  In chapter 17, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews tax compliance interventions.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s self-assessment tax system, returns filed by taxpayers are the basis for calculating tax liabilities and Revenue promotes voluntary tax compliance by making it as easy as possible to file those returns and pay the right amount of tax at the right time.  Our success in this regard is clearly evidenced by the consistently high timely compliance rates being achieved year on year.  For example, the timely compliance rates in 2018 were above 90% across all taxes, with the majority of taxpayers paying the right amount on time.  These compliance rates were, a month after the timely deadline, 99% and 98% for our largest and medium-sized cases, respectively.</p> <p>  Revenue compliance interventions are designed to protect the Exchequer, to assure ourselves as to the accuracy of self-assessment returns, to influence compliance behaviour and to provide a level playing field for all taxpayers.  We have a clear risk focus to our compliance intervention approach.  In 2018, we completed over 580,000 risk-based interventions which yielded &euro;572 million.  To the end of October 2019, we have completed almost 388,000 interventions yielding almost &euro;409 million.  These interventions include almost 2,600 audits and investigations.</p> <p>  The examination of tax compliance interventions in chapter 17 is a follow-on from chapter 27 on tax settlements in the 2012 Comptroller and Auditor General annual report.  The chapter, in 2012, contained six recommendations, all of which have been implemented.  The findings and the recommendations in that report informed improvements in how we manage, record and report our compliance interventions.  Some of the actions taken include ICT developments, such as the introduction of our real-time case working system, revenue case management, RCM, in 2015.  The introduction of RCM delivered improvements in the quality and effectiveness of interventions through more targeted case selection and case management.</p> <p>  As part of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2018 report, 50 cases were reviewed.  These included five assurance checks and 45 cases with tax settlements that were achieved through Revenue interventions.  The 45 interventions included aspect queries, profile interviews, audits and investigations with a total yield of &euro;97.2 million.  The examination covers the timeliness and classification of interventions, calculation of the tax liability, application of interest and penalties, authorisation and approval of settlements and collection.  The report sets out four case studies in detail.  In three of the case studies, the intervention followed contact from the taxpayer and, in two cases, that contact dates back to before the 2012 Comptroller and Auditor General examination took place.  This leads to the first recommendation on recording and analysing the origin of interventions.  The second recommendation relates to reporting the differences between tax assessed, tax settled and tax collected and both recommendations are agreed by Revenue.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2020-2022 and our corporate priorities for next year were finalised recently.  Our priorities include enhancing our risk-focused approach to compliance activity and we will consider how best to implement the recommendations in this context.  We have prioritised a review of our current compliance intervention models to ensure our continued effectiveness in improving voluntary compliance.  We will also explore options for closer integration of collection and debt management with other compliance activity.</p> <p>  Chapter 18 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report deals with tax relief on film production and examines the administration of the scheme between 2015 and 2018.  During this period, 337 projects were approved by Revenue, granting a total &euro;273 million in corporation tax relief.  There are no recommendations in the chapter for Revenue.</p> <p>  This relief is administered by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the cultural and employment aspects, and by Revenue in relation to the value of credit available.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's examination coincided with a significant change in Revenue's administration of the relief.  Following commencement of section 26 of the Finance Act 2018, on 27 March 2019, applications for relief were moved to full self-assessment, bringing the administration of the scheme in line with the rest of the tax code and operating on the same basis as other tax reliefs.  Film relief is now managed through Revenue&rsquo;s suite of risk-based compliance interventions in the same manner as other reliefs and, as already mentioned, the type of intervention deployed is determined by taxpayer behaviour.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s guidelines on film relief were issued in October 2019 following an intensive consultation process and provide comprehensive information on the operation of the relief.  A link to the published guidelines was included in the briefing provided to the committee secretariat. </p> <p>  Our effectiveness in all our activities depends on our people and continued investment in the ICT systems to support our work.</p><p>Pay and associated costs accounted for &euro;303 million of the total &euro;425.4 million expenditure in 2018.  There were approximately 6,250 staff serving at the end of 2018.  This figure included 145 temporary staff.  The committee might be interested to note that the full-time equivalent figure at 31 October was 6,752, which included 103 temporary clerical officers.  ICT was the second largest item of expenditure at &euro;56.8 million.</p><p> I note that the committee is currently reviewing non-compliance with public procurement guidelines.  In this context, we included a note in the briefing document that we sent to the committee secretariat last Friday setting out details in respect of expenditure of &euro;4.4 million in 2018 that was non-compliant with the guidelines.  Some &euro;1.2 million of that related to issues with the unavailability of contracts under the Office of Government Procurement frameworks.  Contracts in compliance with the guidelines are now in place for all of those contracts.</p><p> Given the inclusion in chapter 17 of some case studies involving interventions that we carried out on taxpayers, I will again draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I will answer questions from the committee.</p></speech>

I compliment them on the transparent way in which they give us information, which allows us to do our duty as Members of the Oireachtas.  That information is helpful.  By and large, Revenue does its job well and effectively.</p> <p>  Christmas is approaching and flat rate expenses are being debated in the media.  Depending on who one listens to, this matter could affect anywhere between 80,000 and 600,000 employees, including 75,000 shop assistants and 8,000 journalists.  These are not highly paid individuals.  It is published and stated policy that, in theory, flat rate expenses could be withdrawn from 1 January 2020.  We are effectively moments away from the first or second week in January when people will be getting amended tax credit certificates through the post.  What is the state of play currently?  I do not want to accuse Mr. Cody of being the Christmas Grinch who stole these expenses.</p></speech>

As he knows, we discussed this matter when I was before the committee this time last year.  We are carrying out a comprehensive review of the range of flat rate expenses in order to ensure that they are in accordance with legislation and changes in employment practices.  This time last year, we had planned to amend flat rate expenses as we carried out our reviews across particular categories.  In the context of last year's budget and Finance Bill discussions, though, we recognised that there were concerns.  We are proposing a postponement of the implementation of the review for any sector until we have completed the review of all sectors.  The subject has been under discussion on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  The Minister wrote to me two or so weeks ago to ask for a full report of where we were with our review.  The review is nearly complete, but there are a number of categories where we still have to complete our communications.  Last Friday, I sent a reply to the Minister's request.  He has that reply.  I am aware that he has been away this week.  I am awaiting his reply.  Yesterday, a parliamentary question was answered in which the Minister outlined that his officials were studying my reply.

This matter and public representatives' concerns about it were raised during the debate on the Finance Bill.  As a legislator, I am conscious that budget 2020 was an income tax neutral budget.  Some of these flat rate expenses date back a significant period, but a massive cost does not attach to them by and large.  They give lower paid workers a break and are in most cases wholly and exclusively for the purpose of those workers' employment.  We know from advertisements this week that many reliefs go unclaimed.  We are trying to increase that.  If people are to get small and reasonable amounts, I would not like to see the online process that will be embarked upon next year being made too difficult.</p></speech>

When we commenced our review, it was clear to us that, due to the passage of time, changes in employment law and the introduction of health and safety legislation, some of them were not being incurred anymore and were out of date.  I reviewed some of this recently.  In 2015, there was a series of parliamentary questions about the differences in flat rate expenses.  Some were provided on a gender basis.  For example, a male in one category of worker had a higher flat rate expense than the female.  One of the Deputy's colleagues asked a parliamentary question and I remember seeing the answer and thinking that what it described looked odd and did not reflect a modern economy.  It is also the case that flat rate expenses apply to sectors that are well represented, but a whole range of people have not had that facility to negotiate such expenses.</p> <p>  We have comprehensively reviewed the basis and the submissions.  We will have a detailed report, which we will publish, but as regards-----</p></speech>

At that stage, Mr. Cody stated: "Our statistics do not bear out that the process has slowed down, but there are varying degrees of complexity in requests for correspondence, and it depends on what the issue is."  In the next response, Mr. Cody stated that it was timely that I asked the question because Revenue - the Collector General - was conducting a review or talking about MyEnquiries in terms of Revenue's internal procedures.  I will take it back to where I come from.</p> <p>  If one looks at relevant contracts tax, RCT, section 530P governs the fact that if a subcontractor has tax deducted the surplus becomes available for offset against other liabilities.  As I mentioned in 2017, once, all it took was a five-minute phone call whereby someone could contact their local district tax office and state that his or her client had a surplus in RCT and that he or she wanted to offset it against another tax head.  I will provide an example from earlier this year.  Mr. Cody will bear in mind that my initial inquiry was in 2017.  An individual practitioner had a query from a client who had &euro;5,000 of RCT and wanted to allocate &euro;1,000 against his PAYE return.  The person had a liability with the Revenue for &euro;1,000 and he also has &euro;5,000 on account with the Revenue under RCT.  It was a quarterly P30.  It could be a VAT3 or anything in any event because P30s are gone now.  It was a quarterly P30 or a quarterly VAT3.  Be that as it may, it was due on 23 May last.  It was due after the period end, on 23 April.  There is nothing new there.  Essentially, on 12 April, the practitioner logged on to MyEnquiries.  He submitted a request to have &euro;1,000 taken from the RCT and allocated against his VAT in order to discharge that liability.  This was on 12 April and it was not due until 23 April.  On 22 May, the Revenue issued a demand to that client for collection and payment.  The client knew that he had &euro;5,000 on account with Revenue.  The first thing he did was to contact the practitioner and ask, "Are you doing your job at all, lads?".  He was extremely frustrated.  The practitioner had to provide him with a paper trail in terms of what had been done on his behalf.  Next, the practitioner went back to MyEnquiries - bear in mind, one is talking about 20 or 25 days of a turnaround - to try and sort out the matters relating to the demand.  The demand was reissued.</p> <p>  Let us return to the point where the frustrated practitioner called the Collector General.  He picked up the phone to the Collector General and the member of staff of the Collector General's office stated that she could see on the screen in front of her that the &euro;5,000 was there and that &euro;1,000 needed to be allocated but that she could do it.  That is what the practitioner was told.  Bear in mind where we live.  In terms of the advances in the IT available to the Revenue Commissioners, I would have thought this is a basic enough matter.  The lady in the Collector-General's office stated that she could not put a stop on the demand going out.  The practitioner went back to the RCT section, which was dealing with the inquiries.  The official stated, "Yes, I understand where you are coming from".  The practitioner asked, "Can I put a complaint in in relation to it?".  The practitioner asked if the official point him to where he could submit a complaint on the website.  It was not possible to get a complaint through in connection with it.  Ultimately, the individual said that maybe the practitioner should talk to his local Deputy in connection with the matter.  That is the process as people are experiencing it on MyEnquiries.  All it used to take was a five-minute phone call whereby a person could contact someone in the local tax office and ask if he or she would not mind doing what I have outlined.  This is not a complex issue but we are turning it into a 25 or 50-day process.  The accountant in question asked me to imagine what will happen when the next quarterly P30 or VAT3 return is due.  The process will start all over again.  I would be grateful if Mr. Cody could comment on that.</p></speech>

MyEnquiries is a global issue.  It is something I get correspondence from practitioners on regularly.  It is the same with tax clearance that we had previously.  In a case where a company could require tax clearance for doing a job urgently, there was a time where one could ring up the office stated there is an instalment arrangement here, one will have it in place by X date and the Revenue, based on heads of agreement, would issue the tax clearance.  MyEnquiries lengths that process.  Specifically, on my P30 and VAT3 query, how do we deal with that delay?</p></speech>

I remember our previous discussion.  What we have done in the meantime is we set up a tax administration liaison committee with the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies in Ireland, the Irish Tax Institute and the Law Society about looking at particular problems and aspects.  Actually, there was a meeting of the sub-committee this week at which the areas of concern were identified.</p> <p>  What we try and do with our systems is to provide for as much as possible but it takes an IT development for automatic off-set of withholding taxes, such as RCT, against declared liabilities.  Recently, we launched a facility for VAT repayments where one could automatically do it oneself because we would like to provide the facility for the practitioner to be able to do it.</p></speech>

It is frustrating for our staff who have to deal with things that do not work perfectly and we are working on making it seamless.</p> <p>  I want to talk a little about tax clearance.  Tax clearance is available automatically online without any intervention.  We also held a recent experiment around the use of robotics to automatically deal with the tax clearance query because most of it is a step-by-step process.  We are constantly trying to innovate to improve the service provision.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about what we would do before when one could ring up if a company had some temporary difficulty, and which would stop the issue of the tax clearance which would stop them getting the contract which would lead to a spiral of issues.  In the introduction of our new debt management system which was launched at the end of last year, there is an online system to enter into an instalment arrangement.  Once it fits the criteria, we automatically allow the instalment arrangement which would free-up the tax clearance certificate.  These initiatives come from that engagement with the practitioners.</p></speech>

The Deputy can see from our figures that we have ongoing information technology development, maintenance and enhancement.  There is a very complex and complicated information technology framework.  Changes take planning and implementation.  When I was before this committee on one occasion the Chairman was surprised that I knew about one of the parliamentary questions he submitted on a case.  I pay much attention to issues of that nature.  This is how we learn about real world matters.  We also carry out regular surveys of both businesses and agents of their experience of interaction with us.  The results of those are very positive.  Helping people to comply is a core pillar of how we work.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Cody speak about Revenue Online Service, ROS, and what happened coming up to the deadline?  It was extended to 6 p.m. on 13 November but there were further technical issues and it was down on the Wednesday morning.  The next extension brought the deadline to midnight on 17 November.  The Revenue Commissioners were very clear that a surcharge would not apply to any returns filed in that week.  What happened?  Were the Revenue Commissioners initially slow to extend the deadline?  Was extending it to the following day a case of not seeing the bigger picture in trying to respond to the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112800002#S00500"><p>The ROS difficulties on 12 November were one of the first instances of us having those issues.  It happened on 12 November, which was the extended deadline for pay and file processes.  We were very sorry as we knew the impact it had.  It is a big day in the agents' world.  Many people were very frustrated that afternoon.  We had difficulties on 12 November because of a database server problem that happened at 11.50 a.m.  It was identified very quickly and various people worked on solving that problem.  Like with every information technology system, people tried what had been done before to fix the problem and the expectation was that it would be fully operational in an hour.  Unfortunately, previously tried approaches did not work and the system was effectively operating at partial capacity until approximately 5 p.m.  From 9 a.m. to noon on 12 November, 11,000 returns were filed, whereas from noon until 5 p.m., only 2,500 returns were filed.  At all times there was a trickle of returns.  The system returned to being fully operational at 5 p.m. and from then until midnight, there were 33,000 returns filed.</p> <p>  When we identified the problem and knew we had the solution, we extended the deadline until 6 p.m. or the end of the following working day, which should have been adequate to deal with the expected 60,000 or so returns.  Unfortunately, on the morning of 13 November, it transpired that we had missed one element of the non-application of the surcharge to a small category of cases that came through a particular challenge, with 300 of those cases getting notification of a surcharge.  We were monitoring what agents were saying and we said there was a problem on one particular "pipe".  It was purely human error and it had been missed in the extension of the deadline.  We fixed that in what would have been a normal process - we would not have seen it as a big fix - but because it happened when the returns were coming in, it slowed the overall process.  One can imagine our response.  We said we would just extend the deadline until midnight on the Sunday.</p> <p>  I realise this is not in the chapter but I expected us to be discussing the issue.  On the Wednesday we got 17,500 returns and by the end of the week we had 536,769 income tax returns filed through ROS, which is an increase of 6.1% on last year's filing deadline.  On the Sunday, there were 4,692 returns filed.  I know people pay attention to what I say here and we are really sorry about the disruption we caused people.  We had a board meeting on the Thursday to review what happened and although we cannot ever say for definite that we will not have problems in future, we will not have these problems in future.</p></speech>

I know all this is not specifically within the chapter but I hope it is relevant to what is a very big Vote.  I thank the witnesses for responding in the way they have.</p> <p>  I have two very quick questions.  I am coming from the position of small businesses and their use of the PAYE any time application.  A small farmer may have one employee and the accounts cost &euro;1,000 if they are done by an agent.  With the PAYE process, he or she must input a weekly payment.  It could be another small business, such as a shop.  No matter who the accountant is, he or she could charge &euro;20 per week for this.  That means it costs &euro;1,000 for this individual with one employee, meaning accountancy fees have doubled.  If a business only has two employees, could this be done monthly?  It would save inputting for very small businesses.  I know the Revenue Commissioners are trying to get real-time and live information but how is this affecting the small guy?</p> <p>  I have a more global question on corporation tax and the mood music from the OECD, including proposals on treatment of multinational digital companies and how they are taxed.  This is the minimum effective rate of corporation tax on all companies in all jurisdictions.  Have the Revenue Commissioners carried out any calculations on how that would affect the corporation tax yield?</p></speech>

The positive reaction to this has been really interesting.  Small businesses have moved to payroll software and this is a really competitive sector.  Some of the providers do this for free.  I know one that does it if there are fewer than two employees in a company, for example.</p><p>We have also provided a facility for the really small companies which do not use any payroll software to enter the amounts themselves through the ROS system.  The costs that people anticipated this time last year have not really been borne out.  I am aware that some agents have got out of that work because of the burden it imposes, while others have decided to get more into it.  When we looked at PAYE modernisation one of the aspects that is often neglected in the debate is that there are obligations on employers with regard to payslips under employment law.  All we have done is to capture the submission of that detail.  Sometimes I have seen representations being made by various bodies and commentators who seem to ignore the fact that an employee has entitlements and rights.  All we are doing is capturing the reporting of that.</p><p> This time last year one of my big worries was how PAYE modernisation would have worked, but it has been a phenomenal success.  It has provided a basis for improved policy making.  We will publish a detailed report next April on what we have learned.  I am aware that the Central Statistics Office is quite excited about what it can do with it.  I believe it has been a hugely positive development for employees.  Reference was made to trying to ensure people get the right credits.  The facility people will have in January to review their tax affairs with no need to ring us or contact us will be one of the transformational change programmes.</p><p> On the corporation tax-----</p></speech>

It also opens up all sorts of opportunities, in time, for us to review in-year claims, such as health expenses, and how we integrate real-time claims.  This may require some legislative change.  My Department of Finance colleagues might be saying "He should stop talking about things like that", but it does open up opportunities.</p> <p>  On corporation tax, proposals are under way at OECD level.  Pilar 1 is around the nature of where the taxation applied.  Pillar 2 is around a potential minimum effective rate.  These proposals are at varying degrees of development.  The OECD has just recently completed a consultation on Pillar 1, and a consultation on Pillar 2 is ongoing.  At the finance committee we have highlighted potential range with some elements of it, but it is very hard, or nearly impossible, to have estimates on Pillar 2 because nobody knows yet what policy decisions will be taken or the timing of that.  When we do know this I am sure the finance committee will be talking to us and we will talk about it again at this committee also.</p></speech>

It was a touch of class this morning to wake up and hear that interview.  Well done on that, and well done on the audit.  Revenue has got a clean audit.  There are, however, just a number of issues around procurement.  Of course, Revenue is sorting that out, but does this mean that this time next year there will be no issues around procurement at the scale they are?</p></speech>

Case study B looks at the "delay in case due to complex issue".  I believe it was an inordinate delay, and it is set out on page 283.  While there were no specific recommendations in the conclusion relating to that case, issues were highlighted in the chapter on that case.  A significant sum of money is involved - &euro;113 million as the assessment and &euro;10 million was the settlement.  The case went from 2009 to 2018.  In February 2012 "Revenue wrote to the company", and again in April 2012, which was not too long of a delay.  The next letters, however, were in October 2012 and June 2014.  There is a huge gap there.  I am not cribbing over a month or two but the correspondence gap then goes from October 2012 to June 2014.  There was also a change of case worker.  I read the chapter.  What processes has Revenue put in place to ensure this will not happen or how will it be minimised?</p></speech>

That has all the documentation in it.  In that period when the delay took place, there was significant engagement with counsel to seek a legal opinion.  This was a highly technical issue.</p></speech>

The 2012 report highlighted a number of these recommendations and we have improved it.  One of the positive things from the review by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General that I found reassuring is that most of the cases would have been reviewed in the last three to four years and the report was clear about the cases that were reviewed and about the documentation involved in the process.

Table 13 in the annual report on page 88 is interesting.  It is entitled: "Audit and Compliance Intervention Activity".  It details that the number of interventions are down but the yield is up.  Talk me through that.</p></speech>

Our systems are based on risk so we are constantly evolving our risk analysis system, our risk evaluation analysis and profiling, REAP, system and the various other subsets of REAP.  We are trying to identify cases where there are errors, mistakes and evasion so that we target our resources on those cases.  It is interesting that our overall numbers are down, as the Deputy rightly says, and the average yield is up, which we find reassuring in that it suggests our targeting is improving.  The last time I was here we were talking about the realignment of the organisation and we talked about high wealth individuals.  We are trying to realign the organisation to increase the resources dedicated to dealing with larger, more complex and wealthier cases, which take a lot longer to settle and deal with because they are more complicated.  Last Friday, there was an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>reporting on a Tax Appeals Commission determination of a case that was essentially ongoing since 2005.  The determination by the Tax Appeals Commission was published on its website.  It is 95 pages long.  We have spoken before about the Tax Appeals Commission and the information covered in the Tax Appeals Commission determinations involve some of the most positive and important developments in tax administration.  It would be positive if people could read and try to understand the complexity of some of the stuff we are dealing with.  As we go on, the numbers of interventions will probably continue to go down.  We would like to get to a stage, although we never will get there, that the yield would start to go down as well because that would suggest voluntary compliance is correct but I am not na&iuml;ve enough to think we will ever get to that stage.</p></speech>

I have some questions on corporation tax receipts.  I am sure Mr. Cody noted the report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council published earlier.  Before I turn to that, I wish to re-examine chapter 17 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report that dealt with tax compliance interventions.  It refers to an overview of compliance interventions, an effective compliance regime and how that is essential to the integrity of the tax system, which is based on the principle of "Trust but test".  It outlines self-assessment compliance in some areas and what that regime involves.  How important is compliance to the tax system?</p></speech>

That is the structure of a self-assessment system, with an obligation on taxpayers to file and pay their returns on time.  There is a great onus on us to make it as simple as possible, provide as much information as possible and build in safeguards to ensure that the right tax is paid at the right time.  We have two pillars, namely, a service to support compliance and another to deal with non-compliance.  We make it as easy as possible to pay and we have a risk-based system to review what is paid.  We have a suite of interventions to review and try to ensure that taxpayers pay the right tax at the right time.</p></speech>

I do not want to blame the OGP for not having a framework in place if it did for this contract.  The framework expired on 31 January 2018.  The contract went to tender in November 2017.  There was a delay in the OGP framework being put in place.  We could not pull down the contract because there was no contract in place.  This accounted for some of the delay.  When the OGP framework is put in place, we draw down from it.  I am aware of recent commentary on this issue.  In some cases, the OGP framework is not in place such that a temporary interim measure has to be put in place to deal with that.</p></speech>

What we are hearing today is that in some cases where there is non-compliance it is because the OGP does not have the frameworks in place in time for Revenue to be able to avail of them.  In other instances, mistakes are made or there is a lack of planning on behalf of, say, Revenue, or a particular Department.  This is not a huge issue.  In the context of Revenue's overall spend, by and large, its compliance with public procurement rules is strong.  That said-----</p></speech>

Of all of the Departments, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is the most important in terms of full compliance with procurement rules.

Mistakes were made in the past leading up to the collapse of the economy and during the Celtic tiger era.  There were also problems in the banking system that led to fiscal problems, in response to which adjustments had to be made.  Another one of the ingredients of the collapse was an overdependence on consumption taxes.  There were a number of different factors to it.  We hope that lessons were learned.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has raised the concern that much of the spending now is based on unsustainable corporation tax receipts and that we are essentially exposed in some respects, in that a small number of companies pay almost half of the corporation taxes.  Does Revenue have a role in terms of having an eye to the sustainability of tax or is that a matter for others?  One of the critiques of the State organisations as a consequence of the crash, be that the Department of Finance, economists or watchdogs, as well as Revenue or the Central Bank of Ireland, was that organisations were asleep at the wheel.  I am assuming that Revenue is not asleep at the wheel and that it has an eye to this issue but does it have a remit in this area or is a matter for others?  Does Revenue review the overall tax receipts from a sustainability perspective?</p></speech>

It is one of the main news items today because it is something on which people now put more focus because of what happened in the crash.  All I am saying is that, if the council is warning that there is a danger in basing spending on tax receipts which may be unsustainable, surely Revenue has to have some view on whether this revenue is sustainable or not.  That is what I am asking.  We do not want to see something, either foreseen or unforeseen depending on how one looks at it, happening, such as some of these corporations leaving for whatever reason, resulting in reduced corporation tax receipts and adjustments having to be made.  We do not want it to be the case that nobody is to blame because nobody had a role.  Surely Revenue has to have some opinion as to whether these receipts are sustainable.</p></speech>

A really concentrated level of corporation tax is paid by a small number of companies.  Some 77% of corporation tax receipts were paid by foreign-owned multinationals.  It is concentrated and, as we discussed earlier, there are significant international developments with regard to multinational tax.  That will play out over the coming years.  There have been significant changes with regard to base erosion and profit shifting.  It is a volatile figure.  I would certainly be very careful if I was in a position different from my own.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Cody for his response.  With regard to corporation tax receipts he is essentially saying that, when Revenue puts out this information, it shows that tax received is concentrated in a small number of companies.  That speaks for itself.  It speaks volumes.  With regard to companies which do not pay corporation tax, how many companies pay zero corporation tax?  If he has the figures, could Mr. Cody provide the committee with a breakdown of the total number of companies that are eligible to pay corporation tax and how much they pay, perhaps divided into bands from &euro;1 million upwards?  That has already been-----</p></speech>

In November 2015 I wrote to the Minister to highlight our analysis of the situation at that stage.  We followed that up with the first of our reviews of corporation tax receipts for 2015, which we published in April 2016.  We have continued to publish such reports.  That is this report Deputy Cullinane and I discussed, which tries to analyse the figures.  The challenge is that the corporation tax returns for 2018 are filed in 2019.  The payments we receive in 2018 mostly relate to preliminary tax, and until we get the returns we cannot do the detailed analysis.  This report profiles CT payments in 2018.  The main feature of CT payments in 2018 was that CT receipts from large corporates increased by &euro;1.9 billion.</p></speech>

Receipts from financial and insurance services, which was the largest sector in 2017, fell during 2018 despite the overall increase in receipts.  Over 55,000 companies paid CT in 2018 and the number of net payers increased by 5,000.  The total trading profits in 2017 were &euro;159 billion, which was an increase of &euro;238 million on the previous year.  Around 25,000 companies used losses in 2017.  A certain amount of companies which have used up their losses and did not pay the previous year are paying now.  The report is on the screen and the detail is in that report.  On 30 April next year we will be publishing the updated report on those figures as well as any other reports we have ready.

While the representatives from the Department are here, I wish to ask them about the film industry.  The alternative employment test is one of the tests that satisfies whether or not there is a qualification.  I appreciate that the film industry brings other benefits besides employment, such as showcasing the country and encouraging spending in the country.  If that is one of the criteria, how can one apply that test if there is no definition of what constitutes quality employment?  Is the Department fully taking on board such a definition is required and, if so, when will it be in place?</p></speech>

Substantial changes have been made to the regulations in 2019 in the context of quality employment.  Members are probably aware of discussions taking place in the Oireachtas more generally.  We have set a standard around compliance with all employment legislation.  We have also significantly upgraded the training regime to a skills development and training regime.  For larger projects, that is done in consultation with Screen Skills Ireland, which is the skills development branch of Screen Ireland.  There have been significant changes.</p></speech>

We capture data at the application stage on each role, the number of days and so on.  All that information is gathered.  The issue was raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to data generally.  In the first quarter of next year the European Audiovisual Observatory will hold a workshop on these matters at a European level, in which we intend to participate.

I know legislation is before the Houses on the whole gaming and gambling sector.  Unfortunately, it is an area that, because legislation has not been updated and modernised, people seem to think that Revenue is the sole regulator of the sector but we have a limited role in relation to licensing.

I welcome the Chairman, as always.  Earlier, he stated on flat rate allowances that because the Minister had written to Mr. Cody and Mr. Cody responded, and that the Revenue was leaving the matter awaiting a further response.  The Minister put on the record of the D&aacute;il that he had written to Revenue during questions to the Minister for Finance two weeks ago.  He went further by stating why he had done so.  He said he was simply seeking first, the number of employees impacted, second, the cost to Revenue and third, the benefit to each employee group so that he could have &quot;a clearer understanding of the scale of [the] change that may ensue&quot;.  He did not have to go to that bother as the <i>Irish Independent</i>had published a two-page special this time last year, breaking down exactly the number of employees by sector, using colourful graphs and the costs involved.  This made me wonder why the Minister, who was at pains to say it was done at his arm's length and was purely Revenue's baby, is simultaneously writing to Revenue seeking information that the <i>Irish Independent</i>has published in graphic form.  From a political perspective, I would suggest the Minister is trying to look as though he is concerned so he wrote to Mr. Cody.  I cannot expect Mr. Cody to comment on the inference I have drawn from what I perceive to be a charade, I can ask him to comment on the Taoiseach's position, who was surprisingly blunt in his view when I questioned him in the D&aacute;il on 17 September.  I put it to him that there had been a backing away from the issue this time last year because of the intense media coverage.  The Taoiseach responded: </p> <blockquote> 	This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, not the Government.  However, I would be very happy if the [Revenue] just left matters as they stand. </blockquote> <p>That is some statement from the Head of Government saying that he would like the Revenue Commissioners to leave things as they are, while at the same time saying that he has nothing to do with it.  Will the Chairman comment?</p></speech>

Some of my colleagues wonder do I work on Thursday mornings at all.  The Chairman talks about the things on which the witnesses are not supposed to comment.</p><p>I regularly watch, and everybody seems to forget this happens at the start.  What I said earlier is that I have replied to the Minister and set out the details.  The Deputy spoke about independently provided data.  That was data provided in replies to parliamentary questions via the Minister.  It does not have the full breakdown because we do not have the full breakdown of each category.  What is on the public record for 2017 is that the estimated number of taxpayers who availed of flat rate allowances was just over 606,000.  There were gross claims in the region of &euro;160 million, equating to a tax cost of somewhere around &euro;48 million.  It is dependent on whether people are taxable or not and whether they are taxable at 20% or 40%.  Part of the reason the Minister has written to us is that we have tried to improve the information we will capture from tax returns for 2018.  That will not be available until we process those returns next year.  We will have more granular detail.</p><p> There are a number of items in the review.  Some categories will get an increase, admittedly a smaller number than those that will get a reduction.  In some cases it would seem to us that sectors are no longer entitled to a flat rate expense.  We have identified a number of areas.  A number of issues were the subject of discussion on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, for example, relief on trade union expenses, which was in place until 2010, and relief on professional fees, which was restricted in 2010.  Many tax credits were reduced in 2010.</p><p> I have written back providing more comprehensive data to the Minister.  It is now part of a correspondence and it would be wrong of me to discuss it as it is now the Minister's letter.  I expect I will receive a reply early next week and I will then review where we are with it.  We will then be very clear.</p><p> One thing we said this time last year is that we do not operate in a vacuum.  Revenue operates within the community.  We live within the community.  We are very conscious of how to operate a system based on voluntary compliance and self assessment.  Some people are probably entitled to more than the flat rate expense because they have probably spent more.  A global figure is always difficult because sometimes it involves averaging.  It is very important.  Sometimes when I am before this committee I think about the fact that if people do not have the expenditure and do not spend money we cannot allow a credit.  They may be engaged in some type of work where they would have had to incur that expenditure previously.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General decided this was an area worth examining I would imagine, as accounting officer, that if credit was being given where it should not I would be dealing with a different issue.  What we did undertake publicly was not to implement the change until we finalised the review of everybody.  We did this for reasons of fairness.  What we will do, as we always do, is reflect on what we receive from the Minister.  We will make our decision and we will publish it and make it available.</p></speech>

It was analysed by Dr. Brian Keegan in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>on 3 November under the headline &quot;Taxing times ahead at TDs' clinics&quot;.  I am sure Mr. Cody read it.  On the point of quantifying the figure, again on the record, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister said it is not possible to quantify accurately the anticipated increase in tax revenue arising out of any abolition or reduction.</p><p>I will skip to an individual issue pertaining to this because of how it is being addressed.  Revenue is looking at a broad range of sectors that are impacted and I have read through the list of items being taken into consideration for flat rate allowances.  I am interested in a particular sector, which is the mining sector.  Only one mine is impacted by this, which is Tara Mines in my home town of Navan.  It the largest zinc mine in Europe and employs 620 people.  It is a primary industry.  On the list, the mining industry has the second-highest allowance, second only to the RT&Eacute; orchestras.  It has been in operation for more than 40 years.</p><p>In his earlier statement, Mr. Cody said these allowances have been in place for a number of years.  I have copies of correspondence going back to 1990 on all of the reviews that have taken place.  The frustration is that going back over these 30 years the allowance was increased through engagement with Revenue and the mines but now there is genuine fear it could possibly be gone.  I was interested to hear Mr. Cody say there could be increases within the review.  As was raised earlier, I know the workers are due a wage increase in 2020 but this would be eroded if the allowance goes.  The allowance for the mining industry is &euro;1,312.  Will Mr. Cody comment on this?</p><p>What is the process of the review?  Mr Cody said the report to be published will be comprehensive.  Earlier, he touched on the public consultation.  I want to ask about this engagement with the unions.  Mr. Cody and Mr. Tom Kiely in particular were very kind when I raised this matter last year.  I have a letter from the Revenue to SIPTU pertaining to the miners.  It is dated 26 January 2018 and sets out the nature of the allowance.  Was anything beyond a desktop study done in respect of the review?</p></speech>

We then review it.  The Deputy is right that over a period of time various reviews led to increases in particular sectors.  This time last year, we spoke about the mining allowance.  The initial stage of the review, as we would expect in tax administration, was based on the higher amounts.  This is the normal approach we take to a review of any sector.  The representative body provides the documentation to support the claim and we review it, having regard to the legislation and subject to discussions and meetings with the various bodies.  Changes would probably have been effected with regard to mining if we had proceeded last year because it was in one of the earlier reviews but no change will commence until it applies to everybody.</p><p>An issue that the Department and the Minister may wish to consider is that there are particular sectors in which the nature of the employment may be such that it is a policy determination whether a specific sector should be entitled to a particular credit, having regard to the nature of the activity it is engaged in.  I am sure the Minister will reflect on this as a policy matter.</p></speech>

During my interaction with the Minister on Question Time in the D&aacute;il Chamber two weeks ago, I asked about the desktop study for a very specific reason.  Obviously, it is a very hot topic.  The largest zinc mine in Europe, which employs 620 people, is in my home town.  I told the Minister that I had travelled to the bottom of the mine to better inform myself and to be able to appreciate the concerns that are being raised.  I was not being facetious in any respect when I invited the Minister to visit the mine.  I extended the same invitation to Mr. Cody.</p></speech>

It is okay.  I issued that invitation to the Minister and to Mr. Cody in the context of my query about whether this was a desktop study or whether those involved had actually been to this location.  When a person who is doing a desktop study sees the list of allowances that are being claimed for, he or she might ask whether the conditions being faced by the workers warrant these types of claims.  I am 41 years of age.  I grew up right beside the mine.  Until I went down into the mine, I had no appreciation of what the workers face and how it equates to what they are looking for.  It takes an hour to go down to the deepest part of the mine, which is 900 m under the surface.  It is the deepest underground spot in Ireland.  The guys who are on shift work do not see daylight at this time of year.  They go in when it is dark and they come out when it is dark.  They have allowable claims for vitamin tablets, etc.  They work in extremely hazardous conditions.  There are escape pods at every point.  If there is a collapse or a fire, the workers sit in the escape pods in the dark for 12 hours until someone comes to rescue them.  The air down there is very thin.  I knew when I came out of the mine that I had been through a harrowing experience.  If there was something wrong with the mine from an employment perspective, there would be a line of politicians outside the gates speaking to the RT&Eacute; cameras.  It is quite proper from my point of view for me to pose an invitation to the Minister and to Mr. Cody.  I make no apology for it.  If the allowances available to the workers in the largest zinc mine in Europe are going to be changed, those involved in making that change should go to see the mine.</p></speech>

We have to look at matters like this from the perspective of what is provided for in legislation.  The legislation provides that employees may claim expenses where they are wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in the fulfilment of their duties.  There is a significant body of case law.  The question of hazardous conditions may well form the basis for a policy review of this issue.  The case law under the "wholly, necessarily and exclusively" provision is very clear.</p></speech>

We had the Charities Regulator in here last week and I wish to ask Mr. Cody about its relationship with Revenue, insofar as that is possible.  We heard evidence last week that Revenue removed 579 people from the register of charities because they were inactive.  Could he explain "inactive"?  Is the removal from the register due to there being no activity on the account or is there any inference that there was anything untoward about their activities?</p> <p>  We heard evidence that a number of charities or groups have money in a Davy investment account, but some of the entities within the group no longer have charitable status.  The fund is a historic one that pays a twice yearly dividend.  I wonder about the tax status.  Is there any way of retrospectively changing the status of groups in the fund?  The understanding is that money was collected by a charity and the fact is that a dividend is paid.  If charitable status no longer applies then perhaps there should be some change.  Could Mr. Cody speak to that and inform me of the position?</p></speech>

Many of those charities advised Revenue that they were no longer active or had merged with other bodies.  In such cases, we would withdraw their charitable tax exemptions.  I believe the Charities Regulator set out how the process worked.  The entities that had charitable tax exemption when the Charities Regulator was established were moved across.</p></speech>

It is not actually registered as a charity.  A formal complaint has been made to the Charities Regulator.  I was caught by something last week.  If an organisation is purporting to be a charity and collecting money under that heading but it is not a registered charity, the Charities Regulator does not seem to be able to do anything.  What is Revenue's role in that regard?  If there is a rogue charity, for want of a better term, I assume that Revenue's role in terms of tax exemption is the same.  It does not just assume that a body is a charity.  Would the body be dealt with in the same way as an ordinary company?</p></speech>

One cannot get charitable tax exemption now unless one is registered as a charity.  That was the fundamental change with the introduction of the Charities Regulator.  Since it regulates the sector, a charity must first register with it and then apply to us for a tax exemption.  In the question put by the Deputy, the entity could not avail of the exemption.  It would then be down to the nature of the body.  For example, is it a company or a person portraying himself or herself in a certain way?  The entity would have tax liabilities like anyone else.  If someone has an income from criminal activity, he or she is liable to tax.  The challenge is knowing who he or she is.  It is a risk-based system and we are always interested in information about entities, for example, which the underlying person or company operating it is.</p></speech>

Deputy Burke spoke about historical allowances and tax credits.  With a view to tidying up the system, has Revenue considered moving the goalposts in terms of what is advancement of religion or education?  If there are organisations whose reason for having a tax exemption is the advancement of religion, how much of that is interrogated?  Some religions are very wealthy.  Surely there is a great deal of revenue that could be gathered.</p></speech>

In the childcare sector some cr&egrave;ches are established under community schemes for charitable purposes and in general if they apply, they will be granted tax exemption.  These bodies will be in receipt of the early childhood and care scheme for the children being cared for and this does not impact the charitable status in any way.  Other cr&egrave;ches are established for non-charitable purposes and are actually trading entities which have been established for profit.  These would not be eligible for charitable tax exemption because there is no charitable purpose and funds are not applied to any charitable purpose.  These bodies too could be, and most likely are, in receipt of ECCE.</p> <p>  The next question that I think the Deputy was asking last week is: is the tax exemption for charities affecting businesses providing similar services?</p></speech>

An area that this would have arisen in a good number of years ago, and in which I was personally involved, was the whole area of charitable sporting bodies and private members' clubs.  Particularly when golf took off, there was a lot of development of private courses.  It was a sport and was primarily members only, but then there had to be provisions brought in under VAT legislation to allow income from some elements of the members' club to be taxable because of the competitive process.</p> <p>  Where one has a sector where the funding model is partially State, partially public and partially private, certainly it is a policy area that covers the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, a whole range of areas-----</p></speech>

I always welcome a Kilkenny man to Dublin.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about discrepancies in value added tax, VAT.  I was approached by an individual whom I will not name.  He said there are discrepancies in how VAT is being applied, particularly in co-operatives.  He brought his case to Europe about three or four years ago.  Mr. Cody might know the case.  I think he won his case in the European Court of Justice and was referred back to the Revenue but nothing has happened since.</p> <p>  Regarding the farmer co-operative arrangements, are they an advantage to co-ops when it comes to VAT refund?  I am talking about a level playing field or equal treatment.  This man seems to think that he was unfairly treated and he lost his business.  He was trying to compete against people who had an advantage.  I just want a general opinion.  I am not talking about an individual case.  I want to ask generally about the way VAT is being applied.

I am not 100% certain of this but I think it would have come up in the context of the Finance Bill, and he acknowledged that he had received the report from us.

Now we have this provision, which will allow us do that study of other sectors.  The challenge is for us to know what is going on because this has all to do with the pricing models, the price of food, the feedstuffs and all of the rest of it.  It is not really in the tax system.

Another reason I am asking this is because of the present situation with beef and the feedlots.  We have been talking about poultry up to now, but the feedlots, which are mostly owned by factory owners and processors, have an advantage in that they buy off the farmer and can upset the market by having all these cattle in reserve, which they can use to fix prices if they want to because they have the cattle to do it and can supply their own beef.  Would this VAT thing that we are talking about have an implication for that sector, if it is not changed, by giving an advantage to processors, in particular?  That is really what I want to get at, that this could be giving beef processors an advantage against an ordinary farmer who is trying to fatten cattle, like I do myself, and trying to supply from hoof to factory.  These processors could have an advantage through this VAT thing.  That is what I want to ask the witnesses.  Are these processors at an advantage there, and should the loophole be closed if they are?</p></speech>

We are very open to information on practices in the sector because, ultimately, we find out things that are happening after the event because that is the way the tax system works.  Tax returns follow the activity, the period for things to be returned.  Often the earliest we will be aware of something could well be when it is two years in place.  What we have said in reply to parliamentary questions is that we have no evidence to date.  I hope that we are not stupid and that if we know it is happening in a sector, we will be keeping an eye on it.</p></speech>

Basically, the flat-rate system works by an addition of a percentage to the price paid by the registered purchaser, which is 5.8%.  So, if an unregistered farmer sells his cattle, he gets an additional 5.8% on the price.  What that is meant to do is to compensate the farmer for the VAT on the inputs-----</p></speech>

I am glad that Mr. Cody gave me those few answers.  Mr. Cody spoke about corporation tax this morning.  I refer to the &euro;10 billion that was brought in and then &euro;6 billion from ten companies.  Is he worried that this is a temporary tax?  A sum of &euro;6 billion is a lot of money.  Could it disappear next year?  Could the figure reduce to &euro;2 billion next year and zero the year after?  Is he worried because this is a lot of money and could upset our tax returns for any given year over the next five or six years?  When we are speaking about billions, it is serious stuff.</p><p>Is Mr. Cody, as chairman of Revenue, worried?  Does he expect the income to be temporary or will we continue to receive, say, &euro;6 billion from the large companies?  They are probably foreign direct investment companies based here.  Is Mr. Cody of the view we will become, or are, dependent on them in the same way we became dependent on the construction industry before we went bust?  I acknowledge he has commented on it but I would like to hear more.</p></speech>

There will also be concern around the idea of international tax, given that that debate has been of significance for the past five years, and many developments are taking place internationally.  There is no doubt that over the past couple of years, some of the changes in international tax have been to the benefit of Ireland's corporation tax receipts.  The Minister stated he will be careful and cautious.  There is a great deal of interest in the matter.  Certainly, the figures so far this year suggest we will be ahead of target again.  As a country, we have to be careful about it.</p></speech>

Who knows where it will be in three years?  The figures we have published over the past number of years show that the top ten have paid between 37% and 45% of the total corporation tax every year, and that has been fairly consistent for a long time.  Many of the companies have deep roots in Ireland and employ many people.  Some of the challenges over the next number of years may well have an impact on attracting new companies, and the challenge will always be there.</p> <p>  I have figures on farmers, although the figures are a bit wider than just farmers because they are dependent on NACE codes.   The figure for VAT registration by the agri, forestry and fishery sector in 2018 was 12,078.  That figure has been fairly consistent, going back to when I was dealing with VAT full time. </p></speech>

A caller complained about the cost of calling Revenue.  If I type "Revenue phone number" into my iPhone, as Mr. Cody will be aware, the results include the Revenue phone number and a number for help information.  When I select the latter result, it states that to contact Revenue, it costs &euro;2.95 per minute from an Eir landline.  It states a 1590 number for the revenue collector division and numbers for general inquiries in the Dublin region, the western region, the east, the Border and the midlands.  The lady on the radio the other day said she was in new employment and could not get her tax credits.  She went straight to Google and found the Revenue phone number, which she called, but after ten minutes the line cut off, as is noted on the website.  When she received her phone bill, it stated that two phone calls, of &euro;28 a piece, cost her &euro;56, which was probably more than she earned from her part-time job at the weekend.  What will Revenue do about that?  I now know that it is not Revenue's website but people listening to the radio programme may have a different impression.  The lady called what she thought was the Revenue phone number.  When I google the number, the first result claims to be the Revenue phone number.  Revenue has to do something about that because it is bad for its business.</p></speech>

On the issue around the phoneline, the challenge is that commercial operations pay for their location on search engines to be the first item that shows.</p><p>If anybody looked up the Revenue website, he or she would find a lo-call number.  We used to have an 1890 number but, because of concerns around the bundles offered by telecoms companies, we reintroduced an 01 number last year as most people can call such numbers for free within their bundles.  We issued a press release and publicised this number.  When the promo for "Liveline" came on last week, we sent the producers a copy of that press release.  I believe some of it was read out on the programme.  It is a real concern.  One can ring Revenue for nothing but commercial companies, some of whom are not even established in Ireland, have put themselves into this space.  When we had our 1890 number, which was a lo-call number - we were probably among the first in the country to use one - the mobile companies did not include calls to lo-call numbers in their bundles.  We made representations to ComReg, which carried out a consultation on the issue.  I know it has taken a long time for changes to come about in that sector but we moved to an 01 number ourselves.</p></speech>

The 01 number is generally free under people's phone packages.

In a way the advantage of the "Liveline" programme is that it gives us an opportunity to have this discussion today and to advertise again.  We will be issuing our bulk issue in the coming weeks.  For the first time in more than ten years, we are going to issue a letter to everyone who is registered for PAYE because of the fact that there will be no P60s under the new PAYE system.  We are going to write to everybody.  It will be done electronically for those who have myAccount but we will also be issuing more than 1 million ordinary letters, for the first time in a long time, in order to explain the new provisions and that the easiest way to do things online.

I have aired that point.  It is important because we are all talking about contacting Revenue and there is a scam going on in that regard.  The poor person making the phone call is the one who pays for it.</p><p>Paragraph 6.3, at the bottom of page 18, has a small but interesting point in regard to compensation and legal costs.  Under the heading "Claims by members of the public", there have been 25 claims and Revenue's legal costs were &euro;33,000, which is an average of &euro;1,320.  The legal costs awarded, presumably from the other side, were &euro;166,000, giving an average of &euro;6,640.   The amount of compensation awarded was &euro;86,000 in the 25 cases, an average of &euro;3,440.  Therefore, the legal costs averaged &euro;7,960 and the compensation awards were &euro;3,440.  This means 30% of the total cost of &euro;285,000 was compensation and 70% was legal costs.  We know who is the winner there, simple as that, although somebody must have had some sort of fall or slip.  What is the nature of this?  It really puts this into focus that, in the entire year, out of the total payments in respect of compensation and legal costs, 70% was legal costs and only 30% compensation, although I am not blaming Revenue's solicitor.  It would almost pay Revenue to tell them to go away when they send in a letter, although I say that flippantly, and I know it has to fight the case.</p></speech>

Our claims are handled by the State Claims Agency.  We are very fortunate that the claims are small in number and they tend to be small.  They often involve somebody having an accident coming into one of our premises, for example, slips and so on.  I spoke to Deputy Cullinane earlier about fuel cards.  A small number of cases are traffic accidents involving Revenue vehicles.  The figures speak for themselves.  There are a couple of bigger cases that did not happen to get paid out in the year that are being dealt with.</p></speech>

I want to move to page 78 of the accounts, where I find one set of figures interesting, although we are not talking about billions.  It is in regard to non-Exchequer receipts collected on the behalf of other Departments, agencies or EU member states.  I found a few figures of interest.  I have three questions.  Revenue collected &euro;2.6 million on the health levy, which was abolished in 2011.  Seven years on, how is it that money is still being collected?  I know the money is due but how is it out there for seven years without being collected?  I presume Revenue collected some money on it this year as well.</p></speech>

I have several questions in a similar vein.  Under note 3, the local property tax, LPT, collection figure of &euro;488 million is broken down.  For example, there is &euro;25 million for the household charge, which was &euro;100 and which is from seven years ago, and the LPT arrears for 2012 to 2017.  Why, six years later, are we collecting LPT that was not collected in 2012?  How was it left outstanding for six years?  Mr. Cody is going to give us a breakdown in writing of the &euro;25 million between arrears of local property tax for each of the years, and I do not expect him to have the detail now.  I want to know how much of that &euro;25 million was for the household charge.  What I do know is that when people come to sell their property, there is a letter asking whether they have paid their household charge, and I believe &euro;7,000 is the figure they have to cough up if they never paid it.  Mr. Cody might send us a note.  I have heard of people being caught for a figure like &euro;7,000.  Mr. Cody might remember there was a big rush and there were major penalties if people did not pay it.  Revenue is probably just collecting it on the basis of property being sold where there is a query from the solicitor as to whether the household charge was paid, and it can be up to &euro;7,000.  Am I right in that?</p></speech>

We took responsibility for collecting uncollected household charges for the two years that the household charge was in place and, to date, we have collected just over &euro;71 million in household charge arrears.  We picked it up sometimes when houses were sold and sometimes when we tidied up the register, given there was no household register.  There is a small percentage of houses to be sorted in the register and there were also all sorts of exemptions for unfinished estates.  When LPT came in, the unfinished estates were a smaller footprint.  People decided they had the household charge exemption because they had not been liable to LPT but they did not have that exemption.  Therefore, every year, we collect a small element of arrears.  If we are collecting arrears of LPT, what tends to happen is that we are collecting it from the start.</p> <p>  The other piece is that there are a whole range of deferrals, and there are people who have opted for the deferral, and they then decide they are in a better position - perhaps they have a new job - and they pay the arrears of the deferral.  When we took on the job of LPT, we anticipated that we would have got &euro;60 million in the household charge to bring it up to date, but we have actually got &euro;71 million.  There was a provision, in whatever year it was, in which we said that if the household charge was not paid by the date, it doubled.  We took a lot of innovative approaches to ensure people paid their LPT.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody can send us a note because we have touched on a couple of different issues.  It is historic but it is interesting that it is still rolling through.  A final question is on tobacco excise receipts of &euro;167 million.  Will Mr. Cody explain what that is for?  I understand it goes directly to the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Rather, it is treated as payable.  We discussed this two years ago.  Prior to the Finance Act 2010, the name of a defaulter could not be published if he or she did not pay.  For the name of a defaulter to be published, it was required that there be a settlement with tax, interest and penalties above 15% and that the amount had been paid.  That was fine while the economy was going well as we generally got our money.  After the economic crash, a number of people met the tax, interest and penalty thresholds but were unable to pay any of the debt.  Their names could not be published but those of persons who paid their debts could.  The Finance Act 2010 changed that.  Thereafter, we published the names of defaulters who could not pay.  The process was further changed in 2016 such that we now identify within the list those who did not pay.  From 2010 until 2016, the names of defaulters were published and everybody thought all debts were paid.</p></speech>

That was not mentioned in the notes.  We have not previously addressed that topic.</p><p>Page 34 of the annual report contains reference to e-audit.  I am sure Mr. Cody will tell me this paragraph is included every year, but I have only just noticed it.  The report states:</p> <blockquote> 	During 2018, we collected almost &euro;69 million in yield from e-audits.  This represents almost 28% of yield collected through our audit programmes.  In 2018, the average audit yield from e-audits was &euro;65,816, higher than the average audit yield of &euro;49,896 when traditional auditing methods are used. </blockquote> <p>I ask Mr. Cody to outline the e-audit process.  How may e-audits were carried out?  Is the number increasing?  Obviously, a desktop approach is taken.  Would it be possible to do more e-audits?  If Revenue officials can collect more money through e-audits while sitting at their desk, so much the better.</p></speech>

As the committee is aware, most businesses of scale now keep electronic records.  We use IDEA software which comprises a commercial e-audit package which is also used by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  An e-audit does not take place solely in our office; it also involves an interview.  The opening interview with the taxpayer and his or her agent, if applicable, and the opportunity to make disclosures and so on are a core part of the audit process.  If one is a retailer with electronic records of purchases, sales and cash, we will download those records and apply our audit techniques and software to that process.  An e-audit is not appropriate in cases such as those involving complex accounts.  If the business in question is a multiple, e-audit may encounter difficulty regarding its VAT system and the proper rates being charged on products.  The e-audit process allows us to carry out 100% analysis of the data as compared with traditional paper-based auditing which involves taking representative samples and extrapolating from them.  We have engaged in e-audit to varying extents for 20 years.  It has been introduced through various processes.  Its usage is far more routine than was previously the case.  Our annual report in a couple of years' time may not contain a paragraph explaining e-audit because we will use e-audit techniques for appropriate cases.  It is becoming more the norm.  The cases will tend to be bigger.  It could have been noted in the paragraph in question that the audit yield was higher because e-audit tends to involve bigger cases.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody mentioned this in passing.  The report states: </p> <blockquote> 	...in 2018, matched third-party data was used to drive a wide range of ongoing projects including work on medical locums, providers of short-term accommodation, and Irish residents in receipt of income from foreign assets.  In addition, we began a review of unmatched data to identify possible evidence of shadow economy activity. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Cody referred to medical locums.  Providers of short-term accommodation include AirBnB hosts.</p><p>The next paragraph states that the data gathered in third-party returns is used to &quot;support voluntary compliance, for example, information on agricultural subsidy payments provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine was used to prepopulate 78,000 income-tax returns.&quot;</p><p>That is interesting.  Anyone using ROS knows now is the time one gets the pre-populated tax return.  Mr. Cody is telling me Revenue has information from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and not just from the employers to pre-populate part of the form.  It would be great if Revenue could get that information from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in due course.  I know I am probably disturbing a hornet's nest here but we have all encountered several cases in the past of, for example, somebody in receipt of a social welfare payment who might have taken up employment again or who might have been overpaid in social welfare.  It takes a minimum of two years before the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection tells Revenue and then the person either gets a tax bill because he or she had not declared a social welfare payment or as the case may be, the person might owe money to the Department because he or she got a job.  One would have hoped the lines of communication between Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would be closely aligned because it is the biggest Department in the country for payments, such that if somebody on a social welfare payment takes up employment it is immediately matched.  It takes years for that to happen in some cases and <i>vice versa</i>, if somebody in employment gets a social welfare payment for some other reason, it is taxable.  Sometimes it takes two years for that to happen and then people are upset that they are getting this bill afterwards.  They wonder why somebody did not tell them at the time.  We know people should know themselves but it causes a lot of upset.  That is down to what I would call the delay in transferring information between Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It causes a lot of hardship for a lot of people.  I would have said the exact same thing to the Accounting Officer from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection here a few weeks ago.</p></speech>

Within the self-assessed income tax form 12, we pre-populate it.  When we see the figures in the new year, the form 12 is pre-populated with some of the data for some of the schemes.  With others, the information is dependent on how the feed comes across so in some of the fields for some of the smaller schemes, we give a pop-up information box to say how much people are in receipt of.  I do not want to name a scheme because if I do it off the top of my head I will probably name the wrong one.  This year's form 12 for next year will have pre-population of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection information.  We pre-populate the form 12 for most of the schemes now.  Where we cannot put in the figure but we know people are in receipt of funds, we give them a reminder.  When we redesigned our PAYE services and the jobs and pension process, we pulled in as much of the information as possible, including the information on where we have it and where we have matched it.  The good thing about the information we get from the Department is it is matched because the PPS number drives the whole process.  Most of what the Chairman would like us to do, we are doing already.</p></speech>

There was a consultation process and a tax strategy group and then the Minister brought forward the proposal to put them at 13.5%, apart from those that actually qualify for 0% VAT as they are approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019112800002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe.  I also welcome viewers on the Oireachtas website and on Oireachtas TV.  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the ongoing concerns and issues with the recruitment and retention of personnel in the Defence Forces.  In October, a delegation from this committee visited the Defence Forces training school in the Curragh.  We thank the Department and the Defence Forces, in particular, Brigadier General Dignam, for organising and facilitating this worthwhile visit.  We were afforded full and open access to the facilities and to personnel from all ranks.  We received a tour of the accommodation in the Curragh where, as the Brigadier General stated, he showed us "the good, the bad and the ugly".  The general officer commanding, GOC, outlined his ambitious plans for the Curragh.  The delegation got the opportunity to see accommodation that has been refurbished and to see some of the accommodation that requires major and urgent upgrading.  I could go as far as saying that some of the accommodation for recruits was not fit for purpose, with a severe lack of facilities and poor to bad sanitary conditions.  Due to a shortfall in expert personnel and the challenges the GOC faces retaining those with relevant skills and experience, it is difficult to see how and when these plans to improve the standard of accommodation will become a reality.</p> <p>  The delegation was also given the opportunity to have open and frank discussions with enlisted personnel and all other ranks right up to commissioned officers.  We heard from all personnel that all areas are affected by the current shortfall in personnel.  The engineering corps, paramedics and military police are especially affected by the lack of recruitment and the loss of key personnel.  Some of the very positive suggestions we heard from those present to encourage greater recruitment and retention included: first, the engagement of external experts to report on recruitment and retention; second, to carry out a full Defence Forces audit of accommodation, focusing on the condition of the accommodation and; third, a call for a specific pay review board for the Defence Forces.  However, the main concern and driver in this regard is the low level of pay.  The delegation heard clearly, as we were told repeatedly, of the private sector offering far better remuneration and conditions of employment to the excellently trained and committed women and men of the Defence Forces.  Personnel also commented that it is nearly impossible for enlisted members of the Defence Forces to consider applying for a mortgage or to save a deposit for a home.</p> <p>  Pay and allowances must be addressed and a plan put in place to get it to a level where it demonstrates to Defence Forces personnel that the State appreciates their vital role.  The sense of enormous pride within the group in being a member of the Irish Defence Forces was heartening.  It was very clear that not one of the enlisted personnel at this meeting wanted to leave the Defence Forces.  They wanted to further their careers but they are left with very little choice in many instances.  I say all that, not alone on the basis of the visit of our delegation to the Curragh, but from all of the engagement we have had with the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps when the same problems and concerns were raised.  We look forward to hearing the Minister of State's opening statement and his plans for dealing with these real issues.  This committee will continue to pursue these matters and ensure that detailed and direct engagement is continued with the Defence Forces.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement, after which we will have questions and engagement from committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.743" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019112800002#B00500"><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to set out some facts and give a summary of the actions the Government is taking with regard to recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  The current difficulties facing the Defence Forces have attracted significant political interest.  They have led to calls for increased pay for personnel in the Defence Forces and an accusation that the Government is in some way neglecting or treating the members of the Defence Forces unfairly.  That is untrue and is a gross distortion of the facts.  The requirement to reduce pay and numbers across the public service was a necessary response to the economic downturn and to ensure that the State was living within its means.  I remind members that the situation that led to the economic downturn and the perilous state of the public finances was not of the Government's making.  However, the Government was faced with hard decisions to get the country back on track.  The reality is that pay cuts were applied across the public sector, including the Defence Forces, because there was no choice but to do so.  The cuts are now being reversed through pay agreements, to which the Defence Forces representative associations are parties.  Other sectoral savings were also achieved, including in the defence sector, and the Defence Forces were not singled out for such savings.</p> <p>  The Government is aware of the difficulties the Defence Forces are experiencing in respect of the recruitment and retention of personnel, in particular certain specialists.  As members will be aware, this has impacted certain operational outputs in the Naval Service and Air Corps.  There is a range of factors contributing to this, which are not solely related to pay.  As committee members are aware, the mechanisms to consider pay in the public service are currently framed by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  As part of this agreement, all parties agreed that the independent Public Service Pay Commission would examine recruitment and retention issues, where these occurred.  Following the first report of the pay commission and, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government tasked the commission with prioritising a comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.</p><p>The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces undertook significant work in preparing statistical information for consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission.  The report of the independent Public Service Pay Commission was published and accepted by Government in July this year.  It contains a broad range of recommendations aimed at improving recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.  In recognition of the many factors contributing to recruitment and retention issues, its recommendations include financial and non-financial aspects.  In accepting the report of the Public Service Pay Commission, the Government also approved a plan &ldquo;Strengthening Our Defence Forces - Phase 1&rdquo; to implement the recommendations in the report.  The plan provides for a number of specific projects which are being progressed by civil and military personnel.  </p><p> I am pleased to say that the Permanent Defence Force representative associations accepted the immediate recommendations which provide for increases in certain Defence Forces allowances.  This includes: a 10% increase in military service allowance; the restoration in the rates of certain duties allowance that were reduced under the Haddington Road Agreement; and premium rates of certain allowances for duties performed at weekends are also being reinstated.  The payments and any back money due have been made.  The increases in military service allowance and the restoration of the rates of the other allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission are in addition to measures relating to core pay which are in the current public service stability agreement.  </p><p>  In recognition of a specific issue regarding the retention of Air Corps pilots, the Public Service Pay Commission recommended the restoration of the service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots which was discontinued in 2010.  Broadly speaking, the scheme foresees the following in return for a service commitment, which can vary between five and eight years: an annual payment of just over &euro;22,000 to flying officers holding the ranks of captain, commandant or lieutenant colonel; the annual payment will attract the 5% restoration of cuts to allowances that applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, FEMPI, scheduled for 1 October 2020.  Following this, the annual payment and terminal bonus will be subject to the prevailing public service pay policy over the remaining period of the commitment.  In addition, depending on the details of the commitment to service to be given by each eligible flying officer, these pilots may also receive a terminal bonus, once off, of between approximately &euro;14,800 and &euro;37,000.  A flying officer of captain, commandant or lieutenant colonel rank who gives a full eight-year commitment from the start could earn just over &euro;200,000 under the scheme.  </p><p> It is also important to note that the plan provides for further measures in the pay and non-pay areas.  A review of pay structures in the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the next pay agreement is provided for.  The plan also provides for the identification of incentivisation measures for certain specialists, which will be also be considered in the context of the next pay agreement.  A review of technical pay arrangements is ongoing and an initial report is under consideration.  A range of other non-pay measures are also being progressed. </p><p> Aside from the immediate recommendations arising from the Public Service Pay Commission, there were a number of outstanding adjudication findings which could not be implemented, having regard to the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 to 2015.  This applies across the public service and is not just specific to the Defence Forces. </p><p> Following discussions I had with my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, on this matter, we agreed to prioritise the outstanding adjudications in respect of the Defence Forces.  The effect of these measures is: an increase of around &euro;50 per week in the Army Ranger Wing allowance; cooks with the relevant qualifications will go from Tech Pay 2 to Tech Pay 3, which is an increase from &euro;26.90 to &euro;40.42 per week; non-commissioned officers appointed as account holders to administer, manage certain barrack services accounts and who are not currently not in receipt of the account holder allowance will each receive the allowance of &euro;65.80 per week; and recruits and apprentices will no longer be charged for rations and accommodation, current charge &euro;43.63 per week.  The abolition of this charge for this cohort of personnel will be of significant benefit to these personnel who are the lowest paid in the Defence Forces.   </p><p> The Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, accepted this offer and the revised rates are currently being implemented.  These awards are paid with effect from 1 October 2018. </p><p> I was also pleased that the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform agreed to the introduction of a special tax credit for seagoing members of the Naval Service in the Finance Bill.  The tax credit is based on the design of the existing fishers&rsquo; tax credit, which was introduced in 2017, for the purpose of incentivising the sea-fishing industry.  It is the result of constructive engagement within the Government, by my officials and Defence Forces management, including those within the Naval Service.  This is something that both military management and PDFORRA have sought.  This is another positive step that builds on this Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the challenges in the Defence Forces. </p><p>Although fixed period promotion for special services officers in the Defence Forces was not specifically recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission, its consideration was included in the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan.  The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, was particularly concerned that the withdrawal of such promotions was adversely affecting retention of special service officers.  I directed that the restoration of this initiative be prioritised.  Department officials are engaging with RACO on this subject with a view to arranging for a smooth implementation of the scheme.  </p><p> There is perhaps an unhealthy focus on headline turnover rates.  With a turnover rate of 8.1 % in 2018, this is not significantly at variance with other military forces internationally.  However, it is the underlying figures that are important, including the extent to which personnel can be replaced, particularly where there are long lead times for training.  The goal is to have sustainable and healthy turnover, which is necessary to allow personnel to develop and progress through the ranks.  </p><p> As with many other areas of the public service, difficulties in the recruitment and retention of personnel have arisen in a buoyant economy, with many personnel, including pilots, air traffic control staff and Naval Service technicians, having scarce and highly marketable skills.  This is also being experienced by many military forces internationally. </p><p> There are a variety of reasons people choose to leave their employment.  While pay is obviously an issue, what should be noted is that some 50% of Defence Forces personnel who leave have accrued a pension entitlement.  This can add to the attractiveness of another employment, where the Defence Forces pension is paid in addition to the wages the individual receives from the non-public service employer. </p><p> The Permanent Defence Force continues to offer excellent career opportunities for serving personnel and for new entrants.  There are significant opportunities for career progression and development within the Defence Forces.  There were over 800 promotions in the Permanent Defence Force in 2018.  Earlier this year, 24 enlisted personnel completed a potential officers course and were commissioned as officers.  Under my direction, further potential officers courses will be undertaken in 2021 and 2024.  </p><p> While I acknowledge that there are retention issues, there are many in the Defence Forces who choose to stay and indeed want to continue to serve and further their career.  This year I approved measures to be put in place which would allow privates and corporals who were enlisted post 1994, to remain in service to the end of 2022, or age 50 years, whichever comes first, subject to meeting certain specified criteria including fitness and medical standards.  This is to provide the space for the completion of a comprehensive examination of age profiles and mandatory retirement in the Defence Forces is completed. I also announced at the PDFORRA annual delegate conference last month that I had directed my officials to enter into discussions with PDFORRA with a view to allowing sergeants continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.  </p><p> I have mentioned previously that the Government intends to implement the provisions of the Organisation of the Working Time Act 1997, for an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  This matter as it pertains to the Defence Forces is being progressed with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  My Department remains in close contact with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which is the lead Department for the legislation relating to working time. </p><p> In order to balance personnel turnover there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and there have been 576 inductions into the Defence Forces so far this year.</p><p>To enhance recruitment efforts further, I instructed that a working group be established to examine recruitment processes in the Defence Forces.  This group is chaired by an external human resources expert who will bring many years of experience to bear and advise on any potential modifications to current processes that could improve and further streamline current recruitment methods.  The working group has incorporated the appropriate recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission report into its terms of reference.  It is progressing its work as a project under the high-level implementation plan, Strengthening our Defence Forces.</p><p> The issue of specialist vacancies throughout the Permanent Defence Force is being addressed with training of personnel internally as well as a range of recruitment methods, including direct entry competitions for specialist positions.  The scope to expand direct entry further is being considered.  A new initiative to allow former Permanent Defence Force officers with appropriate skill sets to re-enter the Defence Forces has seen in recent weeks two former pilots being recommissioned in the Air Corps.</p><p> The Government is committed to reaching a strength level of 9,500 personnel.  It recognises that achieving this strength is a key challenge for the Chief of Staff and the Defence Forces.  I am confident all the measures contained in the Government&rsquo;s high-level plan, coupled with pay benefits being delivered by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, will address recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force.  This combination of short, medium and longer-term initiatives is intended to address fully recruitment and retention difficulties in the Permanent Defence Force.  The full impact of these measures will take time to achieve.  It must also be recognised there are also a range of external variables that impact on recruitment and retention and that can change.  The capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake the tasks assigned by the Government will continue to be monitored carefully having regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the pay commission and other actions that are under way.</p></speech>

I would never interrupt Deputy Chambers.  I know the Minister of State appreciates the Defence Forces had to make hard decisions in the past.  We are now, however, reversing financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  I have said before that the Public Service Pay Commission is not suitable for the Defence Forces, however.  The nature of the job that they do, combined with the prohibition on strikes and union membership, sets the members of the Defence Forces apart, as does their passion and commitment to the State.  Any decisions made about their terms and conditions should not be made in the same light as other sectors.  That is why I have asked the Minister of State to consider an independent review board for the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to recruitment and the working group.  It might be a good idea to examine recruitment.  However, a higher priority is retention.  We invest much money in training recruits but then we lose them because they have to make a choice that best suits them.  The Defence Forces provide a good profession.  All its members are committed and passionate about what they do.  They choose that profession because of their commitment and passion about the country.  Its members will say that they love the job and want to stay in it.  We need to give them a reason to stay.</p> <p>  The committee&rsquo;s visit to the Curragh Camp has been referred to already where we met the General Officer Commanding, GOC, Brigadier General Dignam.  He was gracious and showed us the good, the bad and the ugly.  It was of benefit to many of us who had never seen it before.  Many of us already knew the conditions under which soldiers are living and their commitment.  These conditions are not suitable for anybody.  Between six and ten new recruits can share a room with no provisions, rotten floors, mould on the walls, no proper showers along with bathrooms that could not be used.  I have a son in second year in college.  If I had to leave my child in those conditions, my heart would be broken.  That is not good enough for any recruit who commits himself to the State.  I urge the Minister of State and his officials to look at the capital expenditure for the Defence Forces.  The GOC explained that they cannot get people to maintain the facilities because they cannot pay them properly like they pay in the private sector.  That needs to be examined.  There are other excellent facilities in the Curragh Camp that the GOC pointed out.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State look at an independent review board for the Defence Forces?  We should not be making politics out of the situation.  We all want the best for the Defence Forces, the Minister of State included.  I thank him for his time.</p></speech>

When I came into government, all public sector pay was reduced because of the country&rsquo;s financial situation at the time.  There were significant cutbacks in all Departments.  It was because of the economic situation in which we found ourselves.  It took quite a number of years to rebuild the economy and to give the lower paid of the public service something back into their pockets, as well as built infrastructure.  I recognise that there were severe cutbacks.  It was not the space in which I wanted to be, but there was an economic situation with which we had to deal.</p> <p>  One reason we can give Defence Forces members to stay is the restoration of pay and allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission and accepted by the Government, PDFORRA and RACO, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers.  Weekend duty and 24-hour duty allowances have been restored.  There will be further restoration under FEMPI before the public service stability agreement concludes.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to an independent review body.  Public service pay determination is conducted through central negotiations.  The Defence Forces representative associations were afforded equal status to other public service unions and associations during these negotiations.</p><p>Defence Forces personnel have received the benefits of collective agreements in the past and it is intended that future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this process.  There are no plans to create a separate pay determination process for the Defence Forces as to do so would lead to the dismantling of collective negotiation and each sector having a right to individual pay determination.</p><p> RACO held an event at which military personnel from the United Kingdom spoke about a separate pay determination.  The UK, which is consistently used as a comparator, has a different method of determining rates of public sector pay, with independent pay review bodies for all sectors, be they health, education and police and military services.  We do not have such a system.</p><p> The UK armed forces do not have representative associations such as PDFORRA and RACO to represent them or to negotiate on their behalf, unlike here where PDFORRA and RACO meet the Minister numerous times annually and on an agreed basis with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They interact with public servants in the Department of Defence and also with military management.  The UK armed forces also do not have a conciliation and arbitration scheme.  There are benefits to a separate pay determination but there are negatives as well.</p><p> Acceptance by PDFORRA and RACO of the independent pay commission recommendations is a positive step.  I have spoken to members of both associations, and non-members, who have told me they have received immediate benefits arising from implementation of the pay commission recommendations.</p><p> I acknowledge that we face many challenges, but we are trying to meet them, including through the independent pay commission.  Next year, there will be a further round of public sector pay talks.  Within the high-level implementation plan there is scope to prepare for that process.  Military management, officials from my Department and the representative associations can feed into that process.  It is important that we have the scope to do that.  The previous round of public sector pay talks was focused on giving back to personnel what had been taken from them.  The next round will be different.  I hope that there will be further scope for pay increases.</p><p> On the Curragh Camp, it would be remiss of me not to outline some of the projects that are under way there.  I welcome that the committee, led by the Chairman, had an opportunity to visit the barracks.  It is only right and proper that it would have the opportunity to visit the barracks or overseas missions.  I have always encouraged members of the committee to see at first hand the barracks from which our Defence Forces are operating.  I welcome that the committee undertook a detailed tour of the accommodation in the Curragh, which along with other areas has received significant investment and is now of good standard, and that which remains in need of significant investment.</p><p> The portfolio of the Defence Forces' properties includes many that are old and require significant levels of investment.  This is evident as one drives through the Curragh Camp.  It would take millions of euros to complete all of the work needed there.  A significant amount of work has been done.  The same is true of all of barracks across the country.  We are catching up.  There was no investment in the barracks from 2008 to 2012 owing to the lack of money.  As the country returned to a better fiscal space there has been significant investment over recent years in the Curragh Camp, but as I said, more is needed.  Between 2016 and 2018, we spent &euro;17 million on capital projects, including blocks B and D in Pearse barracks.  This year, we are investing &euro;3.5 million on maintenance and improvements in the Curragh Camp, a &euro;2 million project in Plunkett Block 7, an upgrade and extension of the mission preparations centre of the cadet school headquarters at a cost of &euro;2 million, which will commence in 2020, and a &euro;2.4 million upgrade in quarter 2 of 2020 of electrical target range.</p><p> The Ranger wing is located in old stable blocks.  Some members have stated that it has no running water and no appropriate ablution facilities, but my understanding is that the committee did not visit the Ranger wing of the Curragh Camp.  The General Officer Commanding, GOC, in the Curragh is working with the support of the Department's property management plan to continue efforts to improve the built infrastructure in the camp.  I expect to sign-off on a multi-annual plan for the Defence Forces in the coming weeks.</p><p> If we poured all of our resources into the Curragh Camp, Defence Forces personnel, including Naval Service personnel, in Kilkenny, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Athlone and Dublin would be disappointed.  The Department is working with military management to address all of the problems and to construct new infrastructure and proper accommodation for members of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

It appears as though the Department is trying to wind down core operations.  When will the aeromedical service be reinstated and when will docked vessels be returned to sea?  I am asking very specific questions because I am conscious of time.</p> <p>  A year ago, it was recommended that an independent chair be appointed to be conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Has a candidate been selected?  If so, what is his or her name and when will the appointment be made?</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to an unhealthy focus on turnover at 8.1%, which is above norm.  Does that 8.1% represent turnover for last year or this year and has turnover improved or worsened between last year and this year?  The Minister of State has sought to deflect and undermine the focus on turnover by people in the media and the political system.  We have a responsibility to focus on turnover and the Minister of State's failure both to halt the exodus of personnel from the Defence Forces and to encourage new recruits to remain.  On what we area direct our focus is none of his business.  I am sure the Minister of State will respond that the 8.1% figure provided today is in respect of turnover for last year because turnover is above 10% this year.</p><p>It is worsening under this Minister of State's tenure and it is why we are seeing these collapsing structures.  Will the Minister of State indicate how many people have agreed to join the pilot retention scheme?  Will that address the ongoing retention crisis?</p><p> When will we see the aeromedical service back at full operational capacity?  What aircraft has specifically replaced the aeromedical service?  Has the Department received any communication from Health Service Executive hospitals about the appropriateness of that aircraft?</p><p> Will there be a commission on the future of defence?  Will the Minister of State provide a specific number for the pilots who have returned?  What is the target retention rate and when is it envisaged that this will be achieved?  The Department of the Taoiseach provided the high-level implementation plan and it appears the Minister of State's Department has taken over that plan.  What is the governance around the implementation of the plan and have all the timelines been matched?  Has the Department received any communication about a risk that a third or fourth ship will be tied up?  Have any delays been communicated to the Minister of State on the use of the Garda helicopter because it could not be crewed on time?</p><p> In his statement, the Minister of State indicates that a newly qualified three-star private gets over &euro;28,000 in gross pay and he has tried to compare this to other levels in the public service.  Does the Minister of State agree it is an indisputable fact that pay within the Defence Forces is the worst across the public services?  The Minister of State selectively commented on a salary of &euro;28,255 while ignoring the starting rates for an apprentice and a recruit, which at &euro;14,726 and &euro;20,746, respectively, are well below the figure mentioned by him.  He has sought to misrepresent entry pay rates to try to deflect from the ongoing recruitment difficulties that the Defence Forces are having.  Why did he overstate the figure?</p><p> I am surprised that the Minister of State seems to have dismissed the data from the Public Service Pay Commission report.  He states people seem to be leaving because they have accrued a pension entitlement but we must be absolutely clear that 84.5% of those people leaving are citing pay issues, according to the report, with 73.6% citing collapsing staffing levels.  They also leave citing pressure around commuting time, poor training and promotion opportunities and a high level of demands and burnout.  The Minister of State has decided to pick the pension as a means to deflect from his failure to address core issues around defence policy.  It demonstrates that he has his head in the sand that the Minister of State is picking out pensions as a reason for the exodus.  He really does not have this.</p><p> In what year will the figure of 9,500 personnel be achieved?  Will we be closer to it some time next year than we are this year?  Will he provide an update on the projected turnover rates within the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

I would have liked to have included much more in my opening statement but it would have gone on for at least 20 minutes or even a half hour if I included everything.  The Deputy mentioned the air ambulance.  I made everybody aware that there is a challenge in the Air Corps with pilot retention.  I announced a number of initiatives in and around this area, including the pilot retention scheme suggested by the independent pay commission.  It is one of the projects that has been implemented.  The closing date for that is tomorrow and we will have to wait to see how many people have applied.  I will not say how many have or have not before that.  The closing date is tomorrow and I will be able to answer the question after the closing date.  There have been negotiations and some further questions have been put by people interested in joining the pilot retention scheme.  A number of those queries were answered by my Department earlier this week and my officials have been in discussions with the general officer commanding, GOC, on the matter.</p> <p>  It came to my attention in late September or October that there would be a challenge with the air ambulance service.  It also came to my attention last year that there would be a challenge but we were able to keep the service going.  A proposal came from military management and the GOC Air Corps that if we were able to take this specific air ambulance helicopter out of service for four days in November, December, January and February, it would be able to restore the ongoing service after that.  When that came to my attention, one of my first actions was to contact the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  I spoke to the Minister at length about this and my officials in the Department of Defence were in contact with officials in the Department of Health.  We had a specific meeting about this and we decided that we would contact people in the community helicopter service sector, who stated they would be able to provide a service for the four days in November, December, January and February.</p> <p>  We selected the four-day period in November, December, January and February because of daylight hours and it is the time of least numbers of call-outs.  This may result from fog and bad weather, for example.  We selected this time instead of June, July, August and September, for example, as we considered when this would have the least impact.  It was decided that the four winter months would see the least impact in that regard.  I reassure the Deputy and this committee, as well as anybody listening today, that the service will be up and running on 1 March 2020.  I am delighted that we have the backup of the Coast Guard as well and this was always in the agreement originally signed by the Government.</p> <p>  The air ambulance had been sought for years and in the very lean period in 2011 we were able to introduce the service and it was put on a permanent basis in 2015.  I disagree with the Deputy on this issue, as this was sought before-----</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about the commission on the future of defence and we have the White Paper on defence.  I will bring that to the Government next week.  The Deputy will have heard what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il when Deputy Burton asked about his plans about that.</p> <p>  We have two pilots who returned under the re-entry programme and who were former pilots in the Air Corps.  I was delighted to be able to recommission them a number of weeks ago.  I understand a number of inquiries have been received from other people who would like to return to service.</p><p>On the high-level implementation plan which I spoke about on strengthening our Defence Forces, it includes the Department of the Taoiseach, my Department, military management and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A civil-military team has been set up under my direction in the Department of Defence.  It is going through all the projects at present.  A huge body of work is ongoing in this regard and it will continue.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the Garda helicopter.  Nobody, including the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has come to me about delays in respect of the Garda helicopter being taken on.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about the three-star privates and apprentices.  When a person comes into recruit class, he or she is not fully qualified until he or she does the three months' training.  Then the person starts on &euro;28,000.  There might be a weekend duties allowance and other allowances due if the person gets overseas within a short number of years.  An accountant does not start on a full salary the minute he or she starts to work.  One must do one's training.  That is part of it, just as it is for apprentices.  I never distorted the figures.  I have always stated that a fully trained, three-star private starts on &euro;28,000 after three months.  I was delighted to announce last July that a person in training will receive an extra &euro;40 because now the person does not have to pay the rations that had to be paid previously, so a three-star private in training is getting an increase following the announcement.</p><p> As to when I expect to get back to the complement of 9,500, it is difficult.  First, we are fully funded for 9,500 personnel after negotiations between my Department's officials and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will not put a date on when-----</p></speech>

We are competing with a buoyant economy.  One can see from the last 20 or 30 years that when the Defence Forces are competing with a buoyant economy, their numbers fall.  In 2011, the Defence Forces was the only organisation that had ongoing recruitment, at a time when Members of the Opposition said there should not be ongoing recruitment.  However, there was ongoing recruitment during those lean, difficult years.</p></speech>

I will not give a "Yes" or "No" answer.  There are specific reasons as to why I am giving an answer.  He asked me about the appointment of the chair of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I do not have the name of the independent chairman as there are still some outstanding issues with the representative associations, but I am happy that I will have those issues resolved in a short while.  Both associations want this independent chairman appointed.  I carried out a review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, which I was asked about in 2016.  It was the first thing I did.  I am content that we will have one.  I can absolutely assure the Deputy that it is not my office or the Department holding up the appointment of an independent chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019112800002#G03100"><p>My first question is about the Lariam drug.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, removed the licence for Lariam in 2016, yet it is still in use in the Defence Forces.  Why is that?  How many legal cases have been lodged against the Department of Defence and the State with respect to the side effects soldiers were experiencing from the use of Lariam?  Will the Minister of State make each of the service personnel concerned fight the case through the courts or does he intend to set up an informal redress scheme to deal with these issues?  Is the State going to look after service personnel who are suffering the side effects of Lariam within the Defence Forces family?  Will the Minister of State make specialist care available to members of the Defence Forces who have lodged claims with regard to Lariam?  Due to the nature of Lariam, will the Minister of State invite the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to examine the debacle of Lariam?  Those are my questions on Lariam.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State accept that the recruitment policies are failing?  I see no embarrassment from him or the Department with respect to the failure in recruitment.  It is an outrage that 140 recruits left the Defence Forces during training and did not complete their training.  There is a net overall loss of approximately 200, given the number who left and the number who joined.</p><p>Yesterday, the Minister of State issued a press release to <i>The Irish Times</i>which compared apples and oranges.  It refers to the salary of &euro;24,000 or &euro;25,000 that is paid to a clerical officer in a local authority and indicated that a three star private receives a salary of &euro;28,255.  How many members of the public service are told on their way out the gate after spending a day on duty that they are needed for several days to tackle a forest fire in Donegal?  Soldiers are not ordinary public servants.  They are available to the State 365 days of the year and 24 hours a day.  The Minister of State cannot compare apples and oranges and it is disingenuous to do so.<br/><br/>With respect to the Naval Service, the Minister of State talked about the tax break that was given to sailors.  Is it not true that fishermen have had the tax break for many years?  Is it not true that sailors receive a seagoing allowance that is four times less than that paid to staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  Why is there a differential in seagoing allowances when public servants on land can all receive the same travel and subsistence allowances?<br/><br/>With respect to the Air Corps, the Minister of State has told us that two pilots returned and have been recommissioned.  Is it true that the two pilots who have been recommissioned both hold the rank of lieutenant colonel?  Will they be flying?  Will the allowances be paid to commandants and lieutenants colonel who are flying, particularly in the area of the air ambulance service?<br/><br/>The Minister of State gave a guarantee in the Seanad and again today that the air ambulance service will be up and running on 1 March 2020.  I understand that the air ambulance service needs ten crews and we have two crews.  If one or two pilots leave before 1 March, we will not be able to operate an emergency air ambulance service from Athlone.  Will the Minister of State explain precisely how he can guarantee that there will be an air ambulance service?<br/><br/>The Minister of State referred to an increased allowance of up to &euro;200,000 that will available to pilots who sign up for eight years.  That was a lovely piece to put into <i>The Irish Times</i>article but he did not state that there were three options, namely, a three-year, five-year and eight-year option.  He has constantly harped on about the private sector taking away our pilots.  Michael O'Leary, the head of Ryanair, had to create special retention measures to keep his pilots.  It was utterly disingenuous to refer only to the eight-year option.  The Minister of State also referred to a stream of pilots who want to return.  Nobody knows who they are.  Perhaps he will tell us precisely the number of people who have made inquiries about returning to the Air Corps.<br/><br/>On the allowances that are paid to retain pilots, what about areas such as engineering, ordnance, bomb disposal and cybersecurity where we have two empty seats in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I ask the Minister of State to admit today that he has single-handedly-----</p></speech>

I ask for the same respect that he demands.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, rather than the Minister for Defence, the Taoiseach, appears before this committee.  The buck should stop with the Taoiseach but it stops with the Minister of State because he has responsibility for defence.  His policies have been a total failure.  He has failed the Defence Forces and its serving members.  He has lost the respect of all ranks.</p></speech>

He is absolutely wrong about that.  Any statements made by my party are based on factual figures.  We do not need a history lesson about the recession.  The Fine Gael Party has been in government for nine years.  It is up to the Minister of State and his colleagues to take charge and introduce affirmative action for the members of the Defence Forces.  I will never apologise for standing up for the men and women who serve our country and whose interests I represent.</p><p>I thank the Chairman for leading the delegation who visited the Curragh and thank Brigadier General David Dignam for his welcome.  The engagement that we had on all sides was very welcome.  We had a very open and frank discussion with serving members of all ranks.  What was very clear was the sense of pride and commitment in the men and women who are members of the Defence Forces but also complete frustration, anger and despair at the situation in which they find themselves.  Many will never be able to apply for a mortgage.  I was shocked by the standard of living they and their families have but I do not have time to go into the details.</p><p>In terms of the infrastructure in the Curragh, we visited the former stables.  It was appalling to see the conditions that some of our soldiers experience, both those who live there permanently and those who visit for training purposes.  I acknowledge the good work that has been done to refurbish some of the accommodation and it was evident that good use was made of the moneys made available for refurbishment.  I find it appalling that servants of the State must live in such conditions or, in the case of those who travel daily to the Curragh, endure them.  I completely understand the frustration concerning the &euro;23 million that was handed back last year.  The money could have been invested in the Curragh, which is the heart of the Defence Forces, and in other places, as has been mentioned. </p><p>Yesterday, in a timely article published in <i>The Irish Times,</i>the Department of Defence stated that pay rates for serving personnel &quot;were competitive when compared to other areas within the public service and private sector.&quot;  If that were the case, why have 706 personnel already left so far this year?</p><p>It is appalling that the outstanding claims lodged some time ago by the Army Ranger Wing have not been agreed to at this point.</p><p>The Minister of State is the junior Minister so perhaps he is not to blame.  Does he believe there should be a full Cabinet position for a Minister for Defence?  My party believes such a post should be created because there might be more commitment and recognition given to our Defence Forces.</p><p>I note that Senator Colm Burke has committed to a pay review.  That is the correct approach.  Are some in the Fine Gael Party taking contradictory positions?</p><p>Does the Minister of State plan to extend the service commitment scheme to other categories of specialist personnel experiencing retention challenges such as air traffic control, marine, electrical engineering and cyberdefence?  When will these critical measures be delivered?  As we heard on our visit to the Curragh, Defence Forces personnel are double and triple jobbing.  They do not have any more to give.</p><p>A year ago, a commitment was given that the Curragh secondary school would get a new building and the school would consider supporting pupils from Newbridge and Kildare.  We met the Minister of State on this matter some time ago but nothing has happened.  I ask him for an update on the position.</p><p>The Minister of State should make no mistake, the Defence Forces are in crisis and Fine Gael, without a shadow of a doubt, has let down members of the Defence Forces and their families.</p></speech>

I would like him to assure me, members of the public and, most important, the men and women of the Defence Forces that he has an understanding of what is happening, is listening and accepts that the situation in the Defence Forces has reached crisis stage.</p> <p>  I have a list of questions and comments that have been collated by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  All we seek are "Yes" or "No" answers.  We do not need to hear long stories.  Is the Minister of State aware that members of the explosive ordnance disposal unit must often work a 70-hour shift?</p><p>Is it true that the food budget of the Defence Forces equates to &euro;4.35 per person per day while the budget for a prisoner is &euro;6.25?  Is the Minister of State aware that it is reported that soldiers regularly sleep in their cars because there is no room in the barracks, they cannot afford to commute and they need to save their money?  Is the Minister of State aware that last month a member of the Naval Service worked ten 24-hour shift duties in a single month?  This was reported to my colleague, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh.  The person could not say no.  This was on top of the person's daily duties.  For the extra hours worked all this individual came out with after tax was &euro;275.  Does the Minister of State think this is fair?  Does he accept the State is taking advantage of this individual and others, including military personnel who put in six, seven or eight 24-hour shifts a month in Government Buildings on top of their daily barracks duties?  Does the Minister of State accept he would not get away with this type of worker abuse in any other sector because trade unions and the workers themselves would not allow it?</p><p> I know we are pushed for time but I have one more question for the Minister of State.  Does he take any responsibility for the failure to show that, given the nature of the job, a special case should always be made to pay soldiers properly for their service?  They do not get overtime but they work it.  They take orders and do extended double, triple or quadruple shifts.  They are on call morning, noon and night and their work is not comparable with that of any other pay sector.  They have no union rights.  They are not covered by the working time directive.  They cannot strike.  Their loyalty is being taken for granted.  Does the Minister of State accept this is the case?</p></speech>

I have a number of specific questions but I must leave at noon.  One of the recommendations of the pay commission was to review recruitment.  Will the Minister of State provide an update on this review?  What is the timescale?  How long will it take?  The Minister of State has established a strategic HR group that will help the organisation in the long run.  Will he give an update on these questions.</p> <p>  Many measures have been taken to increase the earnings of members of the Defence Forces and we have discussed them at length this morning.  They include pay agreement increases, pay commission recommendations and the implementation of outstanding adjudications.  What is the total cost of this?  Perhaps the Minister of State is in a position to give some details.  Something that has been highlighted, and I do not want to repeat it, is the starting pay of a three star private, which is the starting rank in the Defence Forces.  It has been criticised as very low.  Will the Minister of State outline how much he envisages these increases being in the current year and how much they were in recent years?</p></speech>

There are a number of them and some of them overlap.  Senator Craughwell asked about the Lariam issue.  The first case heard in the High Court was on 3 November 2017 and the matter was settled on 30 November 2017 without admission or liability.  The next Lariam case was listed for hearing on 15 March 2019 and the case was settled and struck out with no admission of liability.  The reason for settlement was very specific in that particular case.  A further case commenced on 21 June 2019 and on 3 July 2019 that case was withdrawn by the plaintiffs.  It was struck out with no order.  No further Lariam cases are listed for hearing this year.</p> <p>  As the committee knows, a working group on Lariam was set up and has reviewed developments in the context of the Defence Forces' use of malarial chemoprophylaxis.  The working group obtained advice from leading national and international medical experts.  The working group's report was submitted to the Minister and the report was produced in the context of current potential litigation, which is legally privileged as I hope the committee understands.  The report made a total of 12 recommendations, which are intended to ensure the Defence Forces' medical policies and practice continue to develop in light of best practice.  Many of the recommendations focus on planning, training, education and training for information sharing as well as the establishment of the medical advisory group.  I have accepted the recommendations of the working group and established an implementation group.  The work is ongoing.  Given that litigation is pending, it would be totally inappropriate of me to comment further on this issue other than to say that the medical advice from the military is that Lariam is used where appropriate.  That is decided by the medical people in the Department, not me.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the fisherman's tax credit.  I believe it was introduced in 2017 but I stand to be corrected and if I am incorrect, I will come back on the issue.  The tax credit for members of the Naval Service who spend more than 80 days at sea is a positive step forward.  It does not address all of the issues and challenges we have but it is part of addressing them.  We cannot touch core pay because of the public service stability agreement but pay will be reviewed in 2020.  The tax credit is something I was asked about by PDFORRA and military management.  The Department worked closely with PDFORRA and military management in putting together a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Last week, I was delighted that the Minister for Finance brought a-----</p></speech>

This has been going on for the past 12 to 18 months and I am delighted it has been done now.  Military management and the representative association looked for this.  This came to my attention in the past 18 months.</p> <p>  Two pilots have returned and more pilots are to return.  Regarding the allowances specifically for people in the Air Corps, this is going through conciliation and arbitration at present.  It would be wrong of me to comment further on it.  It has to do with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because it has to do with core pay and allowances.  I do not make decisions on allowances.  I have been given the advice by military management and the General Officer Commanding, GOC, that the air ambulance service will be back up and running from 1 March 2020.  It came to my attention earlier this year that we had challenges and we agreed we would take it out of service four days per month.  I have been given an absolute commitment by the GOC and military management that if we were able to take it out of service for four days in November, December, January and February, the service would get back up and running.</p></speech>

The public service pay agreements do not allow for a cost increase in claims.  Instead of introducing a new allowance, it was agreed through conciliation and arbitration to pay the pilots the equivalent of the security duty allowance, SDA, for this duty.  In 2019, RACO submitted a claim for the allowance to be extended to commandants and lieutenants colonel tasked to perform duties.</p><p>SDA is normally paid to officers at commandant rank and above.  Payments of SDA to commandants ceased in October 1990 arising from recommendations in the report of the Gleeson commission.  A limited number of commandants are paid SDA where their appointment is brigadier or equivalent duty.  An offer was made to RACO to pay the equivalent SDA to commandants.  As stated, the matter is still ongoing through the CNA scheme.</p><p> I mentioned the tax credit.  The loss of recruits is a long-term issue.  On average, 22% do not complete training but this goes back years and it is not a new phenomenon of the past two, three or four years.  People come into the Army and they often do not get what they expect.  For anybody who goes into a job, whether in the Garda, the Army or elsewhere, while pay might be an issue, I do not believe it is the biggest issue.  I am sure that everybody going into a new job looks at the pay scales and at what they are going to get after one year, when their training is completed, or after year two, three or four, and at what are the possibilities of remaining and what they can get out of it.  I do not believe pay is the biggest issue when a person leaves during training.</p><p> It is an issue I ask commanding officers about all of the time and they tell me they believe military life is not suitable for all people and some may not be able for the robustness of it.  Training can be very robust and some people just do not like it.  If it is not suitable for them, it is better that we lose them during training, rather than training them and then having them leave three or four months after training.  If we lose them during training, most of the time, we are able to get somebody else in to replace them.</p><p> I stated in the D&aacute;il seven or eight months ago that I wanted a review of recruitment.  It was one of the recommendations in the high-level implementation plan and the independent pay commission.  I had already stated I was going to have a review and Mr. P&aacute;draig Love has been appointed to that.  There is a process going through, although I will not give the committee a definitive time as to when I expect that report.</p><p> With regard to the specialties, the technician pay review is under way and it is in the high-level implementation plan.  The provision for identifying further incentivised measures will be linked to the next pay agreement and it is also in the high-level implementation plan.  We are putting a plan in place so when we go to the next phase of the public service pay talks, we will have a good case to make in and around the recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces.</p><p> The Deputy knows I cannot change core pay, which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in the mid-life of the public service stability agreement, changes core pay, the Deputy will be the first to ask why teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; do not get the same.  The public service stability agreement concludes in 2020.  There will be a renegotiation of the plan and I very much look forward to that.</p><p> We have a big job of work to do in putting a very strong case together for members of the Defence Forces so we get the best outcome from that.  Whatever that outcome, I feel everybody needs to put their shoulder to the wheel.  Anybody will know about the challenges, which are out there in the media.  I have never hidden the challenges we have within the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

However, I can reassure her that the quality of food in barracks across the country is of top standard and I do not believe there are any cutbacks in that area.  There was a multimillion investment this year in the dining hall for members of the Defence Forces in Athlone. </p> <p>  I hear this thing about members of the Defence Forces having to sleep in their cars on a regular basis.  No one has ever come to me on this.  I have asked for these people to be brought to me, if they have to sleep in their cars.  I want to hear from them; I want to talk to them.  I have said that for three years and no one has come to me and said they have to sleep in their car every night because they are unable to do X, Y or Z.  It is something I read on social media but I do not believe everything on social media.</p> <p>  In the context of members of the Naval Service, personnel on ships have time off.  This may be a mistake.  When people are out at sea, they are on shift or off shift, so even though they are on ships, they are not working on a full-time basis.</p><p>That is why we want to reflect the tax allowance I mentioned last week.  This is to reflect the commitment that members of the Naval Service give, and I will continue to do that.  The State is not taking advantage of any members of the Defence Forces.  I want to be able to do more but I do not have full responsibility for pay.  All this work - the high-level implementation plan, the independent pay commission, looking after the lower-paid, the restoration of allowances - is to reflect the commitment of members of the Defence Forces.  Absolutely nobody is taking advantage of members of the Defence Forces.</p><p> To respond to Deputy McLoughlin, who has left the meeting, regarding the pay commission, the review of recruitment is ongoing.

I am pleased to be here this morning for the committee's consideration of a technical Supplementary Estimate for Vote 28 for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>As committee members will be aware, a technical or token Supplementary Estimate does not involve additional Exchequer funding for the Vote, other than a technical increase of &euro;1,000.  This is because corresponding additional passport fee income fully covers the additional expenditure required.  The Department is seeking an increase of &euro;14 million which is offset by additional passport fee income of &euro;14 million.  The increased expenditure is being sought for Ireland&rsquo;s increased mandatory contributions to two international organisations under programme C.3, an additional &euro;11 million to the UN and an extra &euro;0.76 million which is required to the Council of Europe.  An additional &euro;2 million under programme E.3, information services, towards the cost of the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign and towards passport service public information campaigns in respect of online applications is also sought.  These increases are fully offset by increased passport fee income of &euro;14 million. </p><p>The sum of &euro;12 million is for contributions to international organisations.  These are Ireland's contributions to these organisations from Departments across the Government which daily interact with, and benefit from, Ireland&rsquo;s membership of these valuable global organisations.  The mandatory contributions from Ireland and from all other member states of international organisations are based on scales of assessments, which can vary.  The largest cause of increased expenditure relates to Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the UN, accounting for almost &euro;11 million.  The largest element of this consists of mandatory contributions to the UN regular budget, UN peacekeeping budget and UN tribunals.  Ireland&rsquo;s total UN contributions in 2019 will be &euro;39 million.  The original 2019 Estimates were finalised before draft UN budgets were presented at the UN in New York, which made it difficult to accurately estimate Ireland's mandatory contributions when our budget was set.</p><p>UN member states' contributions are based on a formula, called the scale of assessments, which is reviewed at three year intervals.  In December 2018 a new scale of assessment was approved for the 2019-21 period, with Ireland's rate set at 0.371%.  This is a 10% increase on its contributions for 2015-18 and reflects the growth in Irish gross national income.  It is worth recording that the last time a Minister from my Department was before this committee seeking a similar technical Supplementary Estimate for Vote 28 was three years ago in 2016, which coincided with the start of the previous UN funding cycle and, as today, the largest element of the increased expenditure related to additional UN contributions.</p><p>The challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is never an easy one.  The period for UN peacekeeping budgets runs from 1 July to 30 June, which means the UN financial year for peacekeeping overlaps for just six months of our financial year.  Estimating UN peacekeeping payments can be particularly challenging, as we have to wait for the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council to take decisions on each of the 14 peacekeeping operations under way.  The level of the budget depends on the volume of UN peacekeeping activity around the world.  This is influenced by both the number of conflicts and the size and complexity of the UN operations which the Security Council decides to put on the ground.  It is difficult to estimate this in advance, as an existing peacekeeping operation might be increased or decreased depending on the circumstances or a new one might be established.</p><p>The increase relating to payments to the UN in 2019 has been caused by three major factors: an unanticipated increase in the UN's regular budget; a 10% increase in Ireland&rsquo;s proportionate contribution to UN budgets; delays in invoicing for peacekeeping budgets in late 2018, which were not received until 2019.  As I speak, 40 high level visitors from New York, including the President of the UN Assembly, the Under Secretary General for UN Peace Operations and UN permanent representatives from troop contributing and troop receiving countries are arriving at Dublin airport to attend a conference here on peacekeeping and peace building.  I look forward to engaging with them during their visit.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s increased contribution of almost &euro;760,000 to the Council of Europe for 2019, which as in the case of the UN was only confirmed after the publication of the 2019 Revised Estimates, is mainly a result of the serious financial challenges which the Council of Europe faced from 2017 to June 2019.  Ireland&rsquo;s revised total contribution to the Council of Europe in 2019 will be almost &euro;4 million, with almost &euro;3.4 million coming from Vote 28 and the balance from other Government Departments.  First, and most challenging, Russia withheld its budget contribution for some of 2017, all of 2018 and half of 2019 in response to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s, PACE, decision to suspend Russian voting rights after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Turkey also reverted from its status of major to standard contributor, in effect cutting its annual budget contribution by almost &euro;20 million.  Russia has now delivered most of the outstanding balance due from the 2017-19 budgets.  Nonetheless, this issue put considerable strain on the Council of Europe's budgetary situation.  In addition, the budget contributions of member states at the Council of Europe are calculated using a combination of population and GDP <i>per capita</i>.  Ireland&rsquo;s population and GDP <i>per capita</i>continue to rise, which has added to our increased contribution to the Council of Europe budget.</p><p>Regarding the Brexit preparedness campaign, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade bears responsibility for the total cost of the whole-of-Government public information campaign relating to Brexit preparedness.  The Department works in partnership with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments and agencies on this whole-of-Government public information campaign which has been under way during most of this year, with a targeted increase as we approached the October deadline.  The request for supplementary funding for 2019 relates to the significant expansion of the campaign in 2019, for which provision was not made in the 2019 Revised Estimates.  This was necessitated by the real threat of a no-deal Brexit scenario following the failure by the UK Government to ratify the original withdrawal agreement.  The campaign must continue due to the decision at the October European Council to extend the Article 50 period deadline to the end of January 2020.  After ratification of the withdrawal agreement, negotiations would then follow on the nature of the future relationship.  Given the ongoing uncertainty, it continues to be necessary to prepare for all scenarios.</p><p>The objective of the Government's Brexit preparedness public information campaign is to ensure that all the key audiences, especially small and medium sized businesses, are aware of the potential impact of Brexit and, in particular, of a no-deal Brexit.  The communications campaign informs them of the mitigation measures they can take, the supports that are available from Government and directs them to the <i>gov.ie/Brexit</i>website for further information, including detailed analysis of all Brexit related issues.  The cost of the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign is approximately &euro;1.5 million in 2019.  The campaign will continue pending the outcome of the general election in the United Kingdom and subsequent political developments and decisions.</p><p>Some of the additional funding will go towards the cost of passport service information campaigns, which to a large degree are Brexit related and reflect a significant increase in passport applications from Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p><p>This time last year, the Department expanded the Passport Online service to allow for online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, a wider cohort of adult passports and a passport card for children.  This expanded service means that all Irish citizens can now renew their passports online 24-7 from anywhere in the world.</p><p> Throughout 2019, the Department ran several national public information campaigns, including through advertisements on social media platforms and via print and radio channels, to highlight Passport Online as a fast and secure way for adults and children to renew their passports.  The success of these campaigns has led to a significant increase in online renewal applications and we expect that trend to continue.  The Department plans to run a similar public information campaign in 2020 to highlight the expansion of Passport Online to first-time applicants, .</p><p> I am pleased to record that the hard-working and very innovative team in the Passport Service which has focused on improving customer experience through a dedicated customer care hub handling up to 10,000 queries per week recently won "Team of the Year" and &ldquo;Impact in Digital&rdquo; honours at the 2019 CX Impact Awards.</p><p> I trust I have adequately explained the purpose for which my Department is seeking this technical Supplementary Estimate.  Of course, I will seek to answer any questions members may have.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh as ucht teacht um mhaidin agus an deis a thabhairt domsa na ceisteanna seo a phl&eacute; libh.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister of State on the improvement in the Passport Service.  The marked improvement should be publicly acknowledged.  For a couple of years, members of the public seeking to renew their passport or avail of the passport application service experienced significant frustration.  The online platform has brought the service forward to a great extent.  There is an excellent facility whereby people can apply before midday for an appointment on the following day.  I ask that more capacity be made available within that aspect of the service.</p></speech>

To follow on from the points made by Deputy Collins, I wish to compliment the staff of the Passport Office on the work that has been done in recent times.  There has been a significant increase in demand for passports due to Brexit and other issues.  The online service is a wonderful initiative.  What percentage of business is done online rather than through the systems that were in place previously?</p> <p>  The Minister of State is seeking an increase &euro;14 million.  I note he stated it is is offset by additional passport fee income.  Does that income result from increased demand or an increase in passport fees?</p></speech>

I have visited the staff at its office in Balbriggan.  Every day, they face a significant administrative and technical challenge in terms of the numbers of applications with which they must deal.  They do so under pressure at times.  The online opportunity and the way the service has used technology to actively engage with and support the public in offering this service is an exemplar for all other Departments.  The online passport service has received numerous awards.</p> <p>  It is also an exemplar internationally.  I have spoken to colleagues around the world regarding their passport services.  Many of them are seeking to emulate how Ireland has approached this issue.  As Ireland continues to pitch itself internationally as a digital island at the cutting edge of the development and use of technology, it is important that we continue to innovate in terms of our interaction with and the excellent service we provide to the public.</p> <p>  On emergency appointments, I will revert to the people at the helm of that service to see whether additional capacity can be put in.  They always endeavour to facilitate people as best they can, particularly those in particularly challenging circumstances whose passport may have been mislaid or gone out of date and who urgently need to travel.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy McLoughlin for sharing his sentiments and complimenting the Passport Service.  The share of applications made online is moving towards 60%.  We hope online applications will ultimately encompass the remaining 40% as far as possible.</p> <p>  As I made clear in my opening statement, a significant part of the challenge is making people aware that the opportunity exists to renew one's passport from anywhere in the world within a few minutes, whether one is sitting on one's sofa in Singapore or in Shannon, using one's smartphone, laptop or tablet.  It is an example of what can be done when people are innovative and ambitious in providing the best possible service to the public.</p> <p>  The additional &euro;14 million in income accrued solely from additional applications.</p></speech>

Throughout the year, Deputies and their offices persecute the Passport Service regarding various passport applications.  I also compliment the officials in the office of an T&aacute;naiste on the ongoing help they provide to Deputies in dealing with such cases.  I get many representations regarding passports from within and outside my constituency.  I represent the two southern Ulster counties and many of my constituents seem to have relations in Northern Ireland.  I receive many calls from people in Fermanagh or Tyrone who claim their cousin is a supporter of mine.</p></speech>

Of course, I am glad to help all those who contact me.  I have received a remarkable number of queries in recent years regarding passport applications by constituents' relatives in Northern Ireland as, I am sure, has Deputy McLoughlin.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to additional public information campaigns.  I ask that the Passport Office and the Department consider using local broadcast media and provincial newspapers-----</p></speech>

They should be used in the advertising campaigns.  That campaign should be under way from early January because people are careless about checking whether their passport is in date.</p> <p>  The committee previously raised the question of whether the Passport Office could devise a system whereby a text message could be issued six months in advance of a passport being due for renewal, for example.  Reminders are issued by motor tax offices and other statutory agencies.  I acknowledge it is a person's own responsibility to keep his or her passport up to date, but many people do not regard it as a priority.  A reminder system would be very helpful and eliminate some of the necessary work that arises when people apply at the last minute.</p> <p>  The additional funding for the Brexit-ready campaign is very important.  Since the British general election campaign got under way, Brexit has featured far less frequently in our vocabulary than was previously the case.  It was previously mentioned every hour of the day.  We want businesses and communities to remain alert and aware that the issues have not gone away.  Even if Britain leaves at the end of January, there will be a transition phase and negotiation of the trade agreement, future relationships and so on.</p><p>Regarding that public campaign and asking businesses to prepare for all eventualities, it is important that that message is kept out there and that every support is still given to businesses and enterprises, particularly in the Border region, to prepare for the worst-case scenario as well.  Of course, we hope the worst-case scenario will not arise and that Britain will negotiate a good deal with the European Union in the best interests of the remaining 27 member states and Britain.  It is particularly important for all our island.  I therefore ask that the Brexit campaign to which the Minister of State referred be continued with the best momentum possible until the whole issue is off the agenda and finalised.</p></speech>

In my constituency, for example, Galway Bay FM is the second most listened to radio station after RT&Eacute; Radio 1 in the whole of County Galway so it is an exceptionally effective tool for communicating with people.  I heard an interview with the director of the passport service on Galway Bay FM.  I think this is part of a sustained campaign.  The director has been undertaking interviews across the entire local radio network for the last couple of months and will continue into early in the new year.  There is an acknowledgement that this is an exceptionally important part of the communication options available to the Department and in the context of the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign and the online passport option.</p> <p>  The passport printing and recording system is due to be upgraded over the next 18 to 24 months.  A very important suggestion was made that people receive a reminder text as the expiry date of their passport approaches.  It is hoped that that will now be incorporated into the new system.  It is not possible to do that with the current system but it will be completely redesigned over the next 18 to 24 months.  The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign "hasn't gone away, you know".  There is ongoing engagement through Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, across the country.  I know from speaking to one SME owner in my constituency that they are exceptionally happy with the support they are receiving.  It is a matter of making the public, particularly the SME community and the farming community, aware of that kind of support and what exactly they need to do to survive, as well as the challenges that will no doubt arise during and after Brexit.  We will continue to engage actively with those communities in every way possible.</p></speech>

All mobile phones should be switched off as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p> <p>  Today's meeting has been convened to consider a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  The motion was referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 19 November.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending and for sending us the briefing material in advance of the meeting, which has been circulated to members.</p> <p>  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Orders, the discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate.  I ask the Minister of State to make his opening contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.897" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019112800002#AA00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present for its consideration the 2019 Supplementary Estimate on the Army pensions Vote.  The Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.  The 2019 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;249.1 million for the Vote.  However, gross outturn this year is expected to be &euro;251 million, which leaves a shortfall of &euro;1.9 million.  The additional amount needed is less than 1% of the original gross Estimate.</p> <p>  I will now set out the position regarding the relevant subheads of the Vote.  Subhead A2 is the largest subhead of the Vote.  It covers spending on all pension benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It accounts for 96% of all military pensions spending, including retirement lump sums.  It is demand driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of some &euro;239.5 million for the subhead will not be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  In the circumstances, the shortfall is estimated at &euro;2.65 million.  The main reason for the shortfall is the number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to increase during the past year and, at end-October 2019, there were 12,640 military pensioners of all categories.  This is a net increase of approximately 600 since the end of 2014.  Based on available information, it is projected that 400 military personnel will retire with a pension and lump sum in 2019.  Overall, this turnover rate during the year was greater than the 350 provided for in the original Estimate, with new retirees going on pension continuing to outnumber deceased pensioners by a ratio of about 2:1 on average.</p> <p>  In other areas of the public service, most people leave at a standard retirement age and their numbers and timing of departure can generally be predicted well in advance.  However, the Permanent Defence Force is different, as the vast majority of military personnel who retire on pension do so voluntarily, that is, before reaching mandatory retirement age and at a time of their choosing.  As these voluntary early retirements are not known in advance, this can contribute to greater than expected expenditure on military retirement benefits in any given year.</p> <p>  During 2018, some 75% of military personnel who retired on pension did so voluntarily and the picture is similar for 2019.  In addition, many retirees qualified for the maximum retirement benefits, which also contributes to the ongoing increased expenditure.  In any given year, forecasting of Defence Forces pensions expenditure and the exact numbers of retirements is difficult.  The shortfall of &euro;2.65 million under subhead A2 will be partly offset by expected savings of &euro;750,000 on subheads A3, A4, A5 and A6.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to seek additional funding of &euro;2.65 million for subhead A2 and reallocate savings of &euro;750,000 on subheads A3, A4, A5 and A6 into that subhead.  This leaves a net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;1.9 million.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware from previous Estimates debates, it has been my intention to seek additional funding for the Army pensions Vote as part of the overall budgetary negotiations.  I am again pleased to report that solid progress continues to be made on funding.</p> <p>  As announced in budget 2020, an additional &euro;10 million has been allocated in the 2020 Estimates for the Vote, which is a 4% increase.  The higher 2020 allocation builds on the steady progress made over recent years in securing additional funding for Vote 35, with an increase of &euro;6 million in the 2017 Estimates, an additional &euro;9.5 million in 2018 and an additional &euro;10 million in 2019.  At the same time, the funding of Supplementary Estimates required for the Vote has fallen from &euro;11 million in 2016 to an estimated &euro;1.9 million in 2019, that is, 0.8% of the original Estimate.</p> <p>  As stated in the pensions briefing material provided to the committee for the debate, the level of funding needed by Vote 35 in the Estimates process each year, will be dictated by circumstances and the demand-led drivers that I have outlined.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.  I will be happy to take any questions regarding the Vote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.898" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019112800002#AA00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his statement.  He mentioned demand-led drivers and one of the submission documents states there is a natural rate of turnover.  Is the current rate of turnover a natural rate of turnover?  Will he clarify what he meant by this?  Is he satisfied that turnover is at the appropriate and natural rate or is it too high?  He stated it is driven by natural turnover annually.  We know the rate of turnover at present is above 10%, which is double what it was a number of years ago.  If that is the new natural rate of turnover for the Minister of State and the Department, then they are accepting the rate of turnover, which is of serious concern.  I ask him to clarify this point in his submission.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate is about paying for the exodus.  He can talk about demand-led drivers and the pension process but this is the Department having to account for its failure to keep people in the Defence Forces and the dysfunctional approach to having a serious retention policy.  This is paying for many people who would like to stay in the Defence Forces but who are forced to leave because of the collapsing structures.  When we look again at the Public Service Pay Commission report and examine people's reasons, drivers and triggers for leaving it is very predictable that this Vote will increase year on year because of the failure to retain staff.</p> <p>  It is surprising that the Minister of State said it varies from year to year and it is not predictable.  The turnover rate was 5.12% in 2013; 5.18% in 2014; 6.25% in 2015; 7.44% in 2016; 8.09% in 2017; 8.16% in 2018; and we know that this year it is above 10%.  What is directly proportional to the rate of turnover is the centrality within the Department.  Does the Minister of State now consider this turnover rate as acceptable?</p> <p>  He seemed to say the pension entitlement is a motivator or an incentive for people to leave and I would like him to clarify this.  He is telling the men and women of the Defence Forces that they are better off getting out when they get their pension than they would be working on.  This is a concerning message from the leader of the Department.</p> <p>  On a broader point on budgetary allocation, every year there is manipulation of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.  Extra is needed to fund the exodus.</p><p>This is funding the Department's continuing failure to promote a retention policy.  Given that it cannot meet the 9,500 personnel level, it is also reapportioning amounts that are specifically focused on pay to other areas, for example, capital requirements.  What other public service provider uses pay savings to fund equipment and capital allocations?  It is highly unusual.  Are there examples in the HSE or elsewhere?  Perhaps the national children's hospital project is an example, with the Government failing to recruit to the health service because of the mess it has made of procurement.  There is a diversion every year and the Government cannot meet the 9,500 figure.  I would like the Minister of State to answer some of my questions.</p></speech>

At the start of the year, we look at how many people have to retire on age grounds or whatever and try to predict an average figure for how many others might retire.  Since it varies from year to year, we cannot put a definitive number on how many will retire.  Of course this is disappointing.  I would be the first to say I was disappointed to see this number retiring.  I would like to see it being lower.  I addressed some of the issues relating to recruitment and retention in my earlier meeting.  Included in the figure for those who are leaving are people who might only have spent five hours in the Defence Forces, those who come in for their first day and say that it is not for them or not what they expected it to be.  Their number distorts the overall exit figure.</p> <p>  There is a natural turnover of people who we know will retire and we must predict an average figure for the number we think might retire.  The latter has been higher in recent years, but not everyone who leaves does so on a pension.  Only a specific number do that.  Some people tell me that they have been offered jobs in the private sector and they will leave the Defence Forces because they have their pensions.  That is attractive for some; there is no use in saying otherwise.  Some people join the Defence Forces knowing that they will not spend all of their lives there.  They do not want to, and it would be wrong of me to say that we want them to.  Some people join, get the experience for 12, 15 or 20 years - officers spend 12, 13 or 15 years there and enlisted personnel spend 21 years or whatever - and can then leave on their pensions and do something else in their lives.  We see the same in the private sector, with people moving from job to job.  The Defence Forces are no different from any other organisation and have people who want to take a different direction in their lives.</p> <p>  I would love to see fewer people exiting, but we are in a strong and buoyant economy.  People have greater opportunities now to move from employer to employer or career to career than they did back when fewer were leaving the Defence Forces.  They get fabulous training and educational opportunities within the Defence Forces.  That is a part of life in the Defence Forces.  They are able to build careers for themselves and acquire the necessary skill sets to leave for the private sector.  Naysayers talk about why they left, but they often forget that the Defence Forces equipped them with what they needed to join the private sector.</p> <p>  I have increased the budgetary allocation for pensions under Vote 35.  If members check the record of my 2016 appearance before this committee, they will see that I stated that I wanted to correct the shortfall in that budget, as it would have been wrong of me to just keep going back to the Exchequer year on year looking for large amounts of money.  I have delivered significant increases under Vote 35 in recent years.  That is why we are now seeking just 0.8% for this year.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to pay savings.  I will make no apologies for using the pay savings for investing.  We are facing a large challenge.  We do not have the 9,500 personnel that we should, but we have the budget for that number.  Does the Deputy want me to revert to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and hand back a pay saving of X%?</p></speech>

To address Deputy Chambers's specific comments, I will not hand back pay savings to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  Nor will I tell him at the start of next year that, since we will not be able to use up our full allocation for 9,500 personnel, we will not need it.  Maybe the Deputy wants to do that, and that is okay.  His party signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 when it commenced.  Is the Deputy shaking his head to say it did not?  It did, though.  The Deputy can check the record.  His party has agreed fully with the public service stability agreement.  He and his party should know that I do not have responsibility for changing core pay.</p><p>That is a matter for the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We cannot, in the mid-life of the public service stability agreement, change core pay in one area.  If we do it for the Defence Forces, Deputy Chambers and his party's spokespersons would be the first to say we must make the same change for all public servants, including teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.  It is not open to any group of public servants to receive increased pay as a result of savings arising from lower payroll costs which occur because there are vacancies or, in the case of the Army, numbers are below the establishment of 9,500.  This applies across the public service, as the Deputy should know.  I have communicated to him on numerous occasions that it is not within my remit to do what he is requesting that I do.  The Deputy can shake his head but what I am saying is a fact and it was agreed to by his party when it signed up to the public service stability agreement in 2016.</p></speech>

It is a difficult issue for any Minister and his or her departmental officials to manage changes in personnel numbers, the costs involved and so on.  It might be helpful if we had an opportunity at a future meeting to discuss the overall policy in regard to the obligations that apply to persons entering the Defence Forces in terms to their service of the State and the basis on which they are entitled to withdraw that service.  We cannot do much about people who leave the service early but this is an issue that needs to be clarified.  It would be useful to have a clear statement of policy in this regard, specifically the period for which people are obliged to serve, the circumstances in which they may withdraw and their obligations to the State.</p> <p>  A role in the Defence Forces is not like an ordinary employee position.  We have a responsibility to ensure there are adequate numbers in the Defence Forces such that they are capable of carrying out the duties that must be fulfilled to ensure the security of the State.  Any changes can amount to a considerable sum of money, whether it is a plus or a minus, and we need a definite policy in this regard.  I may be out of order in raising this point but I would like to know what the obligation is for those joining the Defence Forces, their entitlements and their withdrawal obligations and responsibilities.  I am seeking guidance on this matter, either today or by way of a discussion on another day.</p></speech>

There are various service commitments that apply.  For example, if a person receives training and education and then leaves the service, he or she will have to buy out the associated costs.  The State has invested in that person and it is right and proper that there be such a commitment.  I am happy to seek out the full list of service commitments and the different schemes.  I could not outline them all today because I do not have the briefing material.  I will get that information for the committee as soon as I can.</p></speech>

It is important that we have the issues clear in our heads and understand the obligations on both sides.  We have a job to do in making certain there are sufficient personnel in the different areas to carry out the responsibilities that ultimately rest on our shoulders.  It would be useful to have a meeting to examine the responsibilities that apply and to ascertain members' views on whether any changes are necessary.  We must ensure the Defence Forces are ticking over properly and efficiently and that we have sufficient numbers of personnel in the right areas to carry out the obligations that apply.</p></speech>

Will he detail where those savings arise under subheads A3, A4, A5 and A6?  The Minister of State noted that the option that exists for people to leave or retire makes it difficult, at the beginning of the year, to estimate exactly what financial allocation is required.  Will he comment further on that?</p></speech>

This arises due to lower than expected numbers of new pension awards coming on stream in 2019.  Under subhead A4, payments to spouses of deceased veterans of the War of Independence, a saving of &euro;21,000 arose.  This is a consequence of the reducing number of widows of Old IRA veterans, with only 34 now in receipt of the pension.  There is a saving of &euro;150,000 in respect of compensation payments under subhead A5, which concern statutory lump sums for injury or death in UN service.  There were no payments during 2019.  We hope there will always be a saving under that subhead as denoting the absence of any death overseas on UN duty.  Subhead A6, medical appliances and travelling and incidental expenses, gives a saving of &euro;50,000.  The miscellaneous items relate mainly to people on disability pensions.</p> <p>  At the start of the year, departmental officials look at the number of people who will have to retire during the course of the year on age grounds and the average of the numbers, year on year, leaving the Defence Forces before retirement age, on the basis of which they try to make a prediction.  As I said, we have full employment.</p><p>There are many opportunities for people.  While I would like the figure to be lower, we are working towards the high-level implementation plan through the independent pay commission, specifically in and around retention.</p></speech>

I take Deputy McLoughlin's point.  I just want to correct an issue and that is why I interjected.  The Minister of State himself, in a response to Parliamentary Question No. 98 of 27 March 2019, outlined specifically the savings, gross and net.  My interpretation of that is clear.  It is the net surrender to the Exchequer.  In 2014, the gross savings were &euro;27.9 million.  The net surrender to the Exchequer was &euro;13.6 million.  In 2015, it was &euro;28.7 million gross and &euro;13.7 million net.  In 2016, it was &euro;31.1 million gross.  It was &euro;26.6 million net.  In 2017, it was &euro;20 million gross.  It was &euro;21.4 million net.  In 2018, it was &euro;29.4 million gross and it was &euro;17 million net.</p> <p>  On the net surrender to the Exchequer, according to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, "The Gross Savings and the Net [savings] in the Table include amounts used to meet the shortfalls in the Army Pensions Vote."  I just want to be clear that when I and others are asking a question about the net savings to the Exchequer and others, we are quoting to the Minister of State his record in the Official Report of the D&aacute;il.  If the Official Report of the D&aacute;il is incorrect and the details have been incorrectly supplied to the Department, the Minister of State should clarify that.  We can only deal with the information the Minister of State gives us.  For the record, that is important.  What one has here with the Army Pensions Vote is the Minister of State discussing and negotiating with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about funding the exodus.  That is the basis of this.</p> <p>  To respond to the Minister of State on the issue of Fianna F&aacute;il, the policy of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is to establish an independent pay review body.  It was something my colleague, Deputy Cowen, included in the negotiations with Deputy Donohoe as part of the recent budgetary negotiations.  It was dismissed absolutely by Deputy Donohoe.</p> <p>  It is interesting that Fine Gael seems to have a two-faced approach to this policy idea because in the D&aacute;il and at committee, the Minister of State is dismissing it but in an interview with a Cork newspaper, Senator Colm Burke was promoting the idea of an independent pay review body as something the Senator would fight for.  That seemed to be his commitment to the people of Cork North-Central.  Is there one policy in Cork and another in Dublin, one policy in the Department and another in Fine Gael, because there is a total contradiction around this issue?  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that.  Let me be clear that my party's commitment in terms of our policy - the Minister of State will not tell me my policy - is to establish an independent pay review body.  That is something we believe will end the exodus the Minister of State continues to preside over, end the difficulties around morale, end the necessity to fund a Supplementary Estimate for the Army pensions Vote every year because the numbers are rocketing out the door and will end the ongoing collapse we are seeing in the Naval Service, the Air Corps and Army.  That is our commitment.</p> <p>  Our role now is to hold the Minister of State to account on the ongoing difficulties of departmental policy.  When we are giving information, we are simply providing the information the Minister of State gave to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Our responsibility is to ensure that we have adequate numbers in the Defence Forces to carry out the duties and responsibilities required of us.  Given the times we live in, and, thankfully, there is more or less full employment, there will be greater strain on personnel leaving and vacancies occurring, but that is something we have to face up to.  We have to change our recruitment policy and those who join have an obligation to the State and to others in carrying out those duties.</p> <p>  I get a little confused as who is entitled to leave and on what basis were they taken on originally, for instance, or whether they are on a contract basis for a certain period.  What I would like at some future meeting is that we get a paper outlining the policy on recruitment to the Defence Forces and the responsibilities that we have to perform in terms of ensuring that we have adequate numbers of proper personnel to carry out the responsibilities that rest on our shoulders, as the people depend on us to ensure that the Defence Forces tick over efficiently.</p> <p>  There are so many higgledy-piggledy elements that have grown up over the years.  I refer to personnel leaving and all the rest of it.  If somebody joins up for a given period, in my opinion he or she has a moral responsibility, and a responsibility, to carry out his or her duties for that period of time.  One cannot run any organisation without people leaving easily or changes being made.  It is time - maybe I am wrong here - that we get a clear vision as to what are the responsibilities and the numbers that are required to carry out those responsibilities and that it is clear to everybody that if one joins up to the Defence Forces, one is obliged to do A, B, C, D and E, and for a certain period of time.  That is what I would like, with the Chairman's permission.  I would like that at a meeting in the near future to have a discussion about the overall situation in the Defence Forces, the obligations that are on personnel and how those obligations can or cannot be changed.</p></speech>

I have given that commitment.</p> <p>  Deputy Barrett spoke about the process in and around recruitment.  I asked for an independent review of recruitment to be put in place and that is ongoing.  That was also in the independent pay commission recommendations.</p></speech>

If one looks into it, the net surrender to the Exchequer includes the surplus of appropriations-in-aid.  It does not reflect the Vote 35 or Vote 36 that I, along with my officials, negotiate with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.  Appropriations-in-aid could be: UN receipts, receipts from the EU fishery protection costs, receipts from banks and other organisations, receipts from occupation and official quarters, receipts from rations on repayment, receipts of issues on repayment, receipts of aviation fuel, receipts of discharge by purchase; and for the sale of land or premises.</p><p>It also includes income from the sale of surplus stores, refunds in respect of services of seconded personnel, miscellaneous items and income from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  This has nothing to do with Votes 35 or 36.  Between 2014 and 2018, a total of &euro;4.2 million or 0.09% of Votes 35 and 36 was handed back to the Exchequer.  I make no excuse or apology for the fact that all pay savings have been reinvested for the benefit of the men and women of the Defence Forces, for example, to pay for equipment, built infrastructure, new ships and new aircraft.  I am not going to hand that money back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The budget for the Defence Forces has exceeded &euro;1 billion in the past two years under my stewardship.  I would describe that as a successful negotiation with the Minister for Finance on my part and on the part of my officials.</p></speech>

I welcome any money that is channelled through the Department of Defence to the Civil Defence because its members are unsung heroes.  They are volunteers who do a fantastic job week in and week out for communities, which benefit as a result.

We have our next joint committee meeting on 17 December.  Will the Minister of State send a letter clarifying the issue regarding expenditure, what is not drawn down and what is returned?

I am joined by my colleague, Professor Kieran McQuinn, who is head of economics at the ESRI.  I will start briefly by mentioning some new elements of the deal reached last month between the UK and European Union that were not factored into our more detailed pieces of analysis and then will give an overview of the work the ESRI has undertaken on the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy.</p> <p>  To set the scene, it is worth recalling that for the EU, trade is governed by free circulation of goods with mutual recognition of standards and a common external tariff.  It is worth distinguishing the two separate elements of this arrangement; the first is the customs union, which removed all tariffs and charges on goods circulating between EU member states.  Any tariffs applied to goods entering the EU from other countries are set at EU level and have no variation across member states.  Once a good enters any EU country it therefore pays the tariff due at this point, which can vary depending on the origin country and product in question, and can then be moved and sold on in any EU country.  However, this means that there is no possibility for EU countries to have an independent trade policy.  The second related but distinct element underpinning the free movement of goods is the Single Market, which entails common recognition of standards and broadens freedom of movement beyond goods to apply to services, capital and workers.  </p> <p>  Physical checks remain on the border between the EU and Turkey, which has a customs union but is not in the Single Market, and the borders of the EU and Switzerland or Norway, which are in the Single Market but are not part of the customs union.  This shows that completely frictionless trade flows require a very high degree of integration and alignment.  While either one of the Single Market or customs union can reduce trade costs, some restrictions remain unless both are in place.  Hence the dilemma facing negotiators of how to achieve an exit of the UK from both the customs union and Single Market without necessitating checks along the Irish Border.</p> <p>  A central element of the deal reached at the EU Council summit on 17 October is special status for Northern Ireland as a means of bridging this impasse.  Unlike the original backstop, which if put into effect would have treated Northern Ireland as entirely within the EU customs union and Single Market, the October 2019 deal includes some additional features that allow Northern Ireland firms to import goods from Great Britain without any tariffs provided they can demonstrate that these goods will not pass into the EU.  This allows Northern Ireland to avail of both the UK and EU trade arrangements in many ways, although the administrative cost of this somewhat complex system remains unclear, both for firms within Northern Ireland and firms in Ireland either trading directly with Northern Ireland or moving goods to Great Britain by way of Northern Ireland. </p> <p>  Assuming that it is passed in its current form by the next UK Government, the deal makes no change to the end date of the transition period, set as 31 December 2020, despite the delay in the intervening withdrawal negotiations.  This date puts reaching an agreement on a future relationship on a very tight timetable, although there is a clause allowing for an extension up until 2022.  Regarding the feasibility of this timescale, research by economists in the United States and Switzerland examining how long trade negotiations take has come up with varying estimates with one piece of research finding an average of 28 months to the time of signing a deal and others increasing the estimate to close to six years if time needed for ratification and implementation is factored in.  The shortest negotiation time in their examination of about 80 trade deals was seven months.  There has been a suggestion that starting from a position of perfect alignment as EU members should make this element of a free trade agreement more straightforward to negotiate than is commonly the case.  However, this is only the case if a commitment to continued alignment is made.</p> <p>  Moving on to ESRI research on the potential impacts of Brexit on the Irish economy, I first need to stress that there is no precedent of a country leaving a major trading bloc such as EU.  To some degree most of the research is therefore grounded on measures of the positive impact of EU membership and an assumption of symmetry whereby these gains would be largely lost on exit.  Second, most estimates apply to the long run; they compare a pre-Brexit trading world to a post-Brexit world with new trade arrangements in place.  Even if these estimates turn out to be extremely accurate, there is uncertainty about the adjustment path. </p> <p>  In our modelling of the macroeconomic effects of Brexit, our colleagues have found that GDP could be approximately 2.6% lower in the longer run in a scenario with a deal and 4.8% lower in a no-deal scenario compared to a situation where the United Kingdom stays in the European Union.  Although these are substantial relative reductions in the level of output in the long run, we should emphasise that the economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace.  While these are impacts over the longer run, much of the negative impact of Brexit would be likely to be felt in the first year or two, particularly in the more negative scenarios where no deal is in place.  Our estimate of the first year impact is that the level of real output in the economy could be approximately 0.6% lower in a scenario with a deal or 1.2% lower in a no-deal scenario.  Earlier this year, we also estimated a potential reduction of 2.4% lower growth in the event of a disorderly no-deal scenario, although the probability of this now seems to have receded considerably.</p> <p>  In addition to modelling the impacts of Brexit at this aggregate level, the distribution of the impact of Brexit across sectors and regions has also been the subject of much research at the ESRI.  As is now fairly well known, EU external tariffs can vary dramatically across products.  For most manufactured products the tariffs average around 4%, with higher rates of up to 8% on vehicles.  A very different pattern applies to agricultural and food products which account for almost all of the highest tariff bands.  The highest sectoral average is just under 50% for meat but behind this also lies considerable variation, with rates on some beef products reaching over 80%.</p><p>Our research has found that Ireland would be the most negatively impacted of any of the European Union 27 countries by post-Brexit tariffs because it trades more with the United Kingdom as a share of overall trade but also because the composition of that trade includes more of the agricultural and food products that would face higher than average tariffs if the United Kingdom mirrored the European Union tariff schedule for third countries.</p><p> In the absence of any alternative information on the matter, this work largely assumed that tariffs would be applied symmetrically, with the same basic rates applying for United Kingdom trade with the EU as the EU would charge on products originating in the United Kingdom.  Whereas the UK has submitted a maximum tariff schedule to the World Trade Organization, WTO, that mirrors that of the EU, the UK government also published details of a temporary tariff and quota schedule in the event of EU exit without a deal.  This can probably be taken as the most likely current baseline for tariffs the UK would charge if there is no trade agreement or extension in place by the end of the transition period.</p><p> This schedule would reduce tariffs to zero for 87% of UK-level imports from the EU as a whole with tariffs remaining on the other 13% of imports.  Although this may sound like a reduction in exposure for Irish firms trading with the UK, it merely changes the risks from direct tariff costs to less direct but potentially significant changes in competition, particularly in the food sector.  This is because the UK temporary tariff schedule applies not just to the EU countries to for all other countries as well.  This constitutes a fairly large reduction in tariffs for importing into the UK for many countries, which is likely to incentivise entry to the UK market.  As the reductions in tariffs are large for agrifood products, particularly for beef products, these sectors are especially vulnerable to the risk of increased competition from lower-cost producers from outside the EU.</p><p> An aspect of ESRI research on the cost of Brexit that has been significant is that direct tariff costs are just one element in which trade barriers can be imposed.  Even with a comprehensive free trade agreement being signed by the UK and EU to minimise tariffs, trade costs could still increase after Brexit if non-tariff barriers are put in place.  Non-tariff barriers are any measures that act to restrict or inhibit international trade flows such as technical requirements like licensing, labelling and standards, as well as sanitary and phytosanitary rules relating to food and plant health and the direct costs of customs inspections and documentation.  Some of these costs, such as customs procedures, have been shown to have a large negative effect on export participation, although relatively little on average trade values per firm.  This is because they operate as fixed costs, which imply larger impacts on smaller firms.  Although it is more difficult to estimate the impact of non-tariff barriers in advance, as many of the costs will depend on the extent to which regulatory standards diverge post Brexit, our work has shown that the distribution of the impact of tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to be similar in terms of the sectors that they affect.  This is driven mainly by the costs associated with validating standards of food products, which are where tariffs also fall most heavily.</p><p> Concerns about the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy have tended to focus on the challenges to exporting firms.  However, the UK is also a significant source of imports into the Irish economy and many imported products are used as intermediate inputs for further processing within Ireland, so increased cost could affect domestic competitiveness and the export performance of Irish firms.  Whereas foreign-owned firms are more dependent on imported inputs overall, Irish-owned firms are more dependent on the UK as the source of imports.  Over half of total imports used by Irish-owned firms are sourced in the UK and of these, approximately 20% are either completely or very highly reliant on products coming from the UK.</p><p> Also on the import side, we have examined the potential for the imposition of tariffs or other increases in trading costs to pass through to increased prices for Irish consumers.  Absent any change in consumer behaviour, our approach generates an estimate of potential increases in the level of consumer price index of between 2% and 3.1%.  In the estimated scenarios, these increases are the equivalent of between &euro;892 and &euro;1,360 in the annual cost of its consumption basket for the average household.  As I said, this assumes that there is no switching or change in expenditure patterns in response to the cost increases, so this should be thought of as an upper bound to the cost increase effects.  Perhaps more significantly, we also find that these effects are unevenly distributed across households.  Households with lower income levels face considerably higher percentage increases as they tend to consume a higher share of products, most particularly groceries, that would be most affected by increases in tariffs and trade costs.</p><p> To end on a slightly more positive note, one potential offsetting factor to the negative impact of Brexit on Ireland through the trade channel that we have examined is the potential for an increase in foreign direct investment, FDI.  Foreign direct investment that might otherwise have been destined for the United Kingdom may get diverted to other EU countries, including Ireland, if access to the broader EU market is one of the factors being considered by investors, particularly by those from outside the EU.  The existing literature suggests that EU membership increases FDI from outside the EU by 28% and our work suggests that this would result in a reduction in the negative impact of Brexit on Ireland, although one that is not nearly large enough to offset the negatives of the trade reductions.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and my colleague and I are delighted to take any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I thank the witness for presenting to the committee.  There is not much of a silver lining when we are coming at Brexit and the tables in the presentation are quite clear in that respect.  I was trying to see a positive indicator in any of the data but they are all negative or neutral.  Is it the view of the ESRI that a deal scenario is the most likely outcome, which would mean there would be an orderly Brexit with a free trade agreement following the end of the transition period?  Is that the best position from which the Government should forecast its budgets?</p></speech>

It is probably now the case that a deal and transition agreement to negotiate a free trade agreement is the most likely scenario.  The transition period as currently instituted, which is to conclude at the end of 2020, is extremely tight for the negotiation of a free trade agreement.  I foresee considerable pressure to extend that arising over the next year.  Having less than a year is an extremely short period in which to negotiate a free trade agreement.  To what extent the risk shifts to another no-deal scenario at the end of 2020 if a free trade agreement is not in place will depend on how those negotiations go over the next year.</p> <p>  Much has changed with respect to the budget because of the October deal.  At the time of the budget forecasts being formulated, the size of the risk meant it was sensible or prudent to base the budgetary forecasts on those formulations.  Fortunately, that risk of a very disorderly no-deal scenario that everybody was concerned about at the end of October seems to have receded considerably.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the possibility of securing a free trade agreement in the period announced just does not seem to be entirely credible.  It is very unlikely that this time next year there will be a full free trade agreement in place.  This again gives rise to the spectre of the uncertainty arising from a potential no-deal crash-out Brexit this time next year.</p> <p>  The people in the institute have looked at the short-term consequences as, logically, most analysis tends to look over a longer term and seeing the impact of Brexit ten years down the track.  What is apparent when considering the implications of Brexit for the here and now is that it has already had a negative impact.  It has had that negative impact through a variety of channels, including consumer and investor sentiment and the exchange rate effect, for example.  That has happened even before Brexit has occurred.  We used to have a consumer sentiment indicator.</p><p>It is notable how that indicator simply fell off a cliff from November of last year.  One of the issues is that the underlying economy has been performing relatively strongly, so the impact tends not to be seen, although it is there.  Therefore, as we move into the new year and there is further scope for uncertainty, that will continue to have a negative impact on the economy.</p></speech>

We visited a number of businesses and could clearly see that major contracts had been lost.  Other businesses had to secure premises on the other side of the Border at considerable expense in the event of a no-deal scenario.  The lack of consumer confidence in smaller businesses meant they were not willing to take a risk because they did not know what the product would look like when it was delivered to them in a number of months.  There has already been a genuine impact.</p></speech>

I agree that the most likely outcome is a deal scenario, although one should never second-guess what can happen across the water and how they may approach things in the future.  Let us look at the deal scenario.  There is no good news story in a deal scenario other than that it is significantly better than the alternative cases.  The most severe impact after two years will be on the gross value added traded sector, with a predicted 0.9% reduction in a deal scenario compared with a 2.1% reduction under a no-deal scenario and a 3.9% reduction in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  Will our guests expand on the impact that would have on certain regions, if that information is available to them?  Will particular sectors be hit?  Do our guests have a view as to supports that could be offered by the Government and policymakers, such as ourselves, to offset that impact on the traded sector?</p></speech>

It is the sector most likely to be impacted, whether the UK imposes tariffs or opts for a low-tariff regime but one which lowers tariffs to countries across the board.  There is big exposure for the food sector in that context.  To that extent, the sectoral impact will land quite heavily on agrifood.</p> <p>  The most affected types of firms will be smaller Irish firms.  Most of our analysis would suggest that the multinational sector, which accounts for most of our overall exports, would be relatively unaffected, or affected only to a very small degree, because those multinationals are not so reliant on the UK as a market.  Many service sectors would not be particularly affected in a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  Accepting that the agrifood sector will be mainly affected moves us on to a regional impact assessment, which suggests that the impact will be spread according to where these sectors are located.  That will mean a more negative impact on rural counties that are heavily dependent on agriculture and food processing.  We have not specifically mapped that out in detail but that is a logical conclusion.</p></speech>

We speak about the clear impact on agriculture, and one would instinctively think of Border counties and parts of the north west, but there are other anomalies.  For instance, north Cork, where I am from, has a considerable reliance on agrifood and agricultural activity.  There is quite a regional spread, albeit outside of urban areas, as to where Brexit will have an impact.</p> <p>  My colleagues from Teagasc have looked at this and would be able to comment in far greater detail, but there serious and obvious implications for certain key sectors of the agricultural economy.  The beef sector, which is facing challenges aside from Brexit anyway, is particularly vulnerable, especially if free trade measures are introduced in the UK and more cheap beef and meat produce come into the UK market.  The figures show that the Irish beef sector is struggling to be profitable and viable outside of the support payments it gets as things stand, so the prospect of a substantial reduction in the price the sector could get from the UK market compounds the difficulties the sector is already facing.</p></speech>

It looked at a no-deal scenario, examined Brexit contingency and mitigation measures, and made significant funding available.  We are discussing a deal scenario as opposed to a no-deal scenario and a deal is probably the best-case scenario for this State aside from reversing Brexit.  Our guests are clearly outlining that these sectors and particular rural regions will be seriously affected.  Is it the view of our guests that there will be a requirement for mitigation in a deal scenario?  Our guests are clearly outlining that there will be significant impacts on investment and trade that will be concentrated, to a certain degree, in particular sectors that would require State intervention.</p></speech>

We stated in our most recent commentary that framing budget 2020 was difficult and complex, given the uncertainty that prevailed at the time.  In general, we supported the measures that were announced from a broad, macro perspective.  On the one hand, funds were put aside, as the Deputy said, to address certain sectors that would be particularly hit by a no-deal scenario, but on the tax side, few changes were made and we, broadly speaking, welcomed that as the most prudent outcome.</p> <p>  As to the appropriate budget strategy for 2020, if the economy continues to perform strongly into the new year, and it is on course to record a significant growth rate this year, and the UK leaves the EU with a deal of some sort, it is debatable if Ireland should be spending those funds in an aggregate sense.  The beef sector will be particularly impacted by Brexit, but it has underlying issues that need to be addressed and discussed separately from Brexit anyway.  We must be careful about spending the pot of cash, the money that has been set aside, outside a no-deal scenario and if the economy continues to perform strongly.</p> <p>  Our assessment was that, outside a no-deal scenario and if the economy continued to perform strongly, the best outcome of the budgetary package would be neutral or contractionary.  We felt that some heat should be taken out of the economy because it is performing very strongly and there is a good possibility that it will continue to perform strongly in 2020 in a deal scenario.</p> <p>  The Deputy has asked a difficult question.  It would be a balancing act under a no-deal Brexit and the impacts it would have, or even the uncertainty around a no-deal even if it does not happen, because the impacts would still have to be quantified.  In general, under a deal scenario, the economy is likely to continue to perform very strongly in the short term, in 2020, and as such it is debatable as to whether it would be prudent to spend the sums that have been set aside for the no-deal scenario.</p></speech>

There will be a significant impact on imports and exports to and from the North if Brexit is followed by deviations between the British and Irish markets.</p><p>Will this result in a shift in the trading and economic relationships between the North and Britain and between the North and the South?  How could policy responses from us help northern businesses to adjust to this change?  While there is special status, as has been mentioned, there will be a significant barrier that will have a cost implication for east-west trade.  I have seen some of the research done by the ESRI on the integration between the northern economy and Britain that was interesting and it probably dispels some of the myths about east-west trade being far more integrated than North-South trade.  How do we deal with that?  I come from a Border county and a place such as Derry or Strabane that is not functioning or has higher unemployment affects Donegal and <i>vice versa</i>, and as someone who believes in a united Ireland, I want the economy of Ireland to be thriving anyway.  Does the ESRI have any view on that impact as a result of what is seen as the border in the Irish Sea and what could be done to help businesses to adjust to the changes that may be coming down the line?</p></speech>

If they are sold on, the tariffs have to be paid, and if they are not, either the tariffs can be claimed back or paid later.  At this point, it is unclear what level of documentation and checking will be required and to what extent that will be a burden on businesses.  It is certainly an increase in cost for businesses.</p> <p>  Looking at the types of firms that trade in Northern Ireland, and we have done some work on this with InterTradeIreland, it is typically the larger firms in Northern Ireland that do most of the trade with Britain and the smaller firms that do a lot of cross-Border trade, which tends to be regular and frequent transactions of quite a low value.  The administrative burden being on the sea border would probably largely impact the larger firms.  They make up more of Northern Ireland's overall exports but it tends to be more concentrated in the larger exporters, whereas the smaller exporters, such as firms with fewer than 20 employees, tend to export only to Ireland.  More of that administrative burden, therefore,will fall on the larger firms that are probably more able to cope with it and the smaller firms will be kept out of that loop.</p> <p>  It very much depends on how the documentation checks are put into place, however.  It seemed there was even some confusion in the days after the deal was made on whether the checks would operate in both directions on the Irish Sea or just on goods coming from Britain to Northern Ireland.  There is still a lot of uncertainty on exactly how they will be put in place.</p></speech>

If the UK were to have a free trade agreement and, as a result, substantial amounts of cheaper products were to come into the UK, that would have huge ramifications for the agricultural sector in the North.  The political economy issue that struck me from my previous time in Teagasc is that agriculture in the context of the UK is nowhere near as important as what it is for us in Ireland.  Consequently, in any future negotiations that take place between the UK and North American countries or wherever, agriculture will not have the same kind of importance and significance attached to it that it does when Northern Ireland is part of the European Union in those trade negotiations.  That is a relevant point.  We know Brexit has been more of an English phenomenon than anything and, consequently, it is a political likelihood that, in any negotiations, it will be issues that are of particular interest to the English economy that will predominate in any discussions and negotiations.  That could have far-reaching consequences for the agricultural sector across the UK, particularly in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The ESRI looked at the modelling and found GDP could be approximately 2% lower in the long-run and 4.8% lower in a no-deal scenario.  The first-year impact would be that the level of real input into the Irish economy could be approximately 0.6% lower in a deal scenario.  I am surprised in one sense that the margin between a deal scenario and no-deal scenario is relatively small.  It is 0.6% or 1.2% depending on whether there is a deal, but I thought the margin would be higher and that in a no-deal scenario the reduction would be exponentially higher.  I am surprised it is only double.  I would have expected that in a no-deal scenario there would be a far larger drop.  Dr. Lawless also said that, "if these estimates turn out to be extremely accurate, there is uncertainty about the adjustment path".  The witnesses might expand on that.  They may have already dealt with what they anticipate to be the likely outcome of Brexit with the deal that is before the British Parliament at the moment.  Do the witnesses believe there will be a free trade deal between the UK and the EU?  I wanted to make that technical point because I am surprised the difference in margin is not higher.</p></speech>

It looks out over a ten to 15-year horizon to capture the full implications of Brexit.  That work is robust and is done to high standards.  The subsequent work Dr. Lawless has been associated with revolves around that.</p> <p>  Tracing through the more short-term implications is particularly hazardous and difficult.  Our colleagues who work in the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and others who do short-term forecasts would all say that.  It is particularly hazardous to do that work because we are essentially trying to trace through the long-term trade implications through the short-term.  By definition, we are potentially not taking into account distortions that are hard to envisage, namely, the unknown unknowns such as, for example, financial sector meltdown, congestion at the ports and large-scale disruption of that sort.  In that situation, the implications will be much more significant.</p> <p>  In our last commentary, we did a forecast for 2020 to the effect that the economy would grow in the region of 3.5%, and if a no-deal Brexit came to pass somehow in 2020, that growth rate could be down to less than 1%.  Given there are large confidence intervals around those forecasts, it is not inconceivable the economy could contract next year if there is a no-deal Brexit.  It is fair to say that modelling and charting through the short-term implications of Brexit is particularly hazardous and those models come with large confidence intervals.  If anything, we tend to be a little bit on the optimistic side in our forecasts on the short-term implications, but if we were to factor in the unknown unknowns, there could be a significant downside effect.</p> <p>  The second question was on the adjustment path.  Again, it is the issue of trying to deal with the long-term whereas it is more focused on the trade implications and then looking at the short-term.  If there is a no-deal Brexit, the implications of that would be at their most adverse in the short term, and as we move out over the adjustment period, the impact would be less and less each year.</p><p>We assume a linear progression such that the effects would become less and less in the future.  It all revolves around trying to map and take from the longer run back to the shorter run the issue of the magnitude of the impact.  It is quite difficult to capture the short-term impacts in a really precise manner.  </p></speech>

What percentage of the exports of indigenous Irish export firms go to, and what percentage of the imports to Ireland come from, the UK?  I have a view that the indigenous sector is far more exposed to the potential impact of Brexit than the much larger multinational companies.  Dr. McQuinn referred to the FDIs.  If there was a no-deal Brexit, would many of those not relocate some of their operations to mainland UK, which is such an enormous market?  We have had a worry that some of our FDI sector would feel compelled to locate some of their operations in the UK.  There has been a lot of abstract discussion on this area.  The witnesses have done the detailed research and I would like to know how exposed the indigenous sector is.</p></speech>

That shows how much less the multinationals trade with the UK compared to the domestic Irish firms.  It shows that although the total GDP figure impacts may not be so enormous, the exposure on the type of firms is.</p></speech>

Therefore there is possibly more of an incentive for firms currently located in the UK, particularly in the financial sector, where access to the EU market would be very important, to relocate.  We have already seen a number of financial companies make announcements about relocation and setting up offices.  It is probably more likely that the multinational move would be into Ireland rather than outwards, apart from individual firms; we cannot rule them out.</p></speech>

In the first quarter of the year it was performing exceptionally strongly, we had employment growth year on year of over nearly 3.5% which is very strong.  As we moved into the second and third quarters it seemed to be softening slightly, some of the indicators were suggesting that, but some of the trade statistics for the third quarter have been very good, particularly on goods.  The two basic indicators that we tend to look at for the underlying performance of the economy are the tax take across the different headings and the labour market and both of those have been performing very strongly.  The tax take has been increasing across the different headings.  We know that the corporation tax issue is separate and that the strength of returns in that area does give rise to some concerns.  All the other headings, VAT, income tax, stamps etc., have been performing very strongly.  The unemployment rate is now down to less than 5% which is very low by historical standards.  Our expectation is that in the absence of a no-deal crash-out Brexit next year, the economy will continue to perform strongly into 2020.  There are other factors such as the perceived global slowdown and the moderation in growth rates of our major trading partners, which will undoubtedly have an impact.  We do not think the economy will grow as strongly next year as it has this year.</p> <p>  Housing is always the major issue or one of the big issues.  This year we expect to see in the region of 21,500 units but our estimates have consistently shown we need somewhere in the region of between 30,000 and 35,000 units to meet the underlying demand in the economy.  As long as there is that gap between supply and structural demand, we will continue to see strong pressures, particularly in the rental market, and we see rental rates continuing to increase very sharply.</p><p>We have done a lot of work looking at the affordability challenges and issues associated with it, and the amount of money people are spending on rent.  The amount of income people have left after they have paid for their rent is diminishing.  Those are the key challenges that need to be addressed.  In terms of the overall economy, our assessment is that it is likely to perform very strongly again into 2020.</p></speech>

To echo the points we made earlier, it is very difficult to see a free trade agreement being signed within 12 months.  As Dr. Lawless outlined in the opening statement, given the preponderance of trade deals of such magnitude that have been done, it is very difficult to see it.  As a result, given that there is likely to be a lot of difficulties in any trade negotiations which take place, uncertainty is going to be a continued feature in the Irish economic landscape going into 2020.  As we said earlier, even though the economy has performed very strongly over the last years, there is no doubt that uncertainty around the Brexit issue has impacted adversely on consumer sentiment, investor sentiment and so on.  If we continue to see that kind of uncertainty about the Brexit outcome, the danger is that it will continue to weigh down and have a negative impact on the economy.  As the economy slows down, as it inevitably will in the years to come because it cannot keep growing at the present rate, the negative impact of that uncertainty may become more apparent.  More generally, as others have discussed, if we have a free trade agreement or negotiations, the potential for disruptions across the European Union could be quite significant in terms of any negotiations with the UK.  There could be a scenario where countries are being pitted against each other in terms of the conditions and negotiations that take place.  There could also be tensions within countries.  For example, if there is a deal on the table that is well disposed towards our agricultural sector but not as well disposed towards, for instance, our fisher people, how are we going to react to that?  There is going to be a large amount of uncertainty in these negotiations.  Unfortunately, I think it is something that will run for quite some time.</p></speech>

The Single Market has developed and the barriers have been removed to trade.  My concern is that we have not been able to measure the complexity of the supply chains, economic relationships, or even the labour and the raw materials and components that are being used, in terms of it being counted.  It is much more complex than we are seeing.  How can we be sure of the integrity of the data?  How much is this being measured in such a way that we can rely on the forecasts and predictions we are making around the impact of Brexit?</p></speech>

We do know that there are a lot of movements, imports and exports within the same narrow sector, where firms appear to be moving things around at different stages of production.  We talked a little bit about the forecasts having quite a significant downside risk to them and how they are a little bit too optimistic.  We really cannot tell, if one item in a supply chain is disrupted, how it will knock on to the future stages.  There is a little bit of an "all for the want of a horseshoe nail" problem there.  Although we can see that all of the disruptions should be, on average, a particular amount, if one product from one sector is held up, the question is how will that have trickle-down effects.  We do not really know.  Our level of information on imports and exports from and to the UK is quite good.  Because statistical agencies and the Revenue Commissioners do not want to put undue burden on smaller firms, the amount of specific detail we get on precisely what smaller firms are importing and exporting is not as great.  We do not want to ask them to specify every single item they have brought in.  They usually just have to report totals.  There is extra information that we could have.  It is certainly the case that this gives rise to a more negative impact than we have estimated in the overall models.</p></speech>

We did some work looking at where some of the basic raw materials in the construction of a typical house came from.  A large proportion comes from the UK in terms of the standard materials that are used.  Some of the implications we may not have factored in totally are that if there disruptions in the trade relationship in the housing market, for instance, it will become much more difficult to source these materials and more costly to get them.  We know already that the cost of building a house in this country is very high.  People are constantly complaining about the cost of building a house and the knock-on implications for housing supply.  The danger is that it may become even more costly to do so in that situation.  There are many unforeseen consequences that we have not totally factored in to the overall macro, aggregate assessment but that could undoubtedly impact on people.</p></speech>

We did a piece in our commentary in the summary where we examined the impact of policy uncertainty generally.  There are now indicators of what they call policy uncertainty if governments announce different types of policies or there is a large degree of uncertainty about what they may do.  My colleague, Dr. Conor O'Toole, looked at this in the context of the different aggregate investment categories such as machinery and equipment, buildings, constructions and so on.  We found that there was a very negative impact between policy uncertainty in the US, for instance, and investment decisions here, which is not unsurprising given that a large amount of investment at an aggregate level is driven by multinationals, which are very conscious of what is going on in the US economy.  We have done that kind of work but, at an aggregate level, we have not really tried to quantify the impacts of Brexit on investment in particular.  We looked at it in the context of consumer sentiment, where we tried to model the impact of Brexit.  We saw the way in which consumer sentiment was falling off a cliff since last November and suggested that Brexit had to be the main reason for it as many of the underlying conditions that typically drive consumer sentiment, such as employment, unemployment rates and inflation, are all still very favourable.</p></speech>

That was earlier this year.  We found there seemed to be a fairly substantial gap between what we would expect firms to invest given the positive state of the economy and what they were actually investing.  We did not have Brexit in there as a specific question.  However, when we tried to drill down into it to see if it was being caused by problems with finance, uncertainty and so on, we largely found that uncertainty in a very general sense, or aversion to risk, seemed to be more important than some of the other factors we might expect such as raising finance in terms of having firms hold off on investment decisions.</p><p>We could not, however, link that specifically to concerns about Brexit.</p></speech>

We have done less work on how services might be affected.  When it came to goods, we had an explicit benchmark that we could use, that being, the EU tariff, which is published with the WTO and is listed product by product.  Hard data were available on that front.  On the services side, though, it is much more difficult to get an estimate.  Either one gets access and an agreement or one does not.  There is potentially more of an on-off market access element.  Some work we did suggested that being a member state of the EU increased trade in services by approximately 20% compared to the amount of trade in services the EU does with non-member states.  If we make the assumption that the UK leaving the EU loses that benefit, there could be something like a 20% reduction in trade in services.  Some services are more sensitive to that than others, financial services in particular.  Dr. McQuinn referenced this.  In free trade negotiations between the EU and the UK, one would expect financial services to be a high priority on the UK's side, given that they are such an important part of the UK's overall economy.  When it comes to various trade-offs and negotiations, a great deal of emphasis is likely to be put on continued services access, particularly financial services.</p></speech>

I believe the case went to the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  Ironically, given how the ECJ is perceived in the British media, it found in favour of London and stated that, as long as the UK was part of the EU, it could continue to deal and trade in these products.  That gives rise to the question of what the outcome will be if the UK leaves the EU and the case is brought again.  If the outcome is that trading houses are not able to deal, it will affect a substantial proportion of financial sector activity in the City of London.  The implications of that moving elsewhere will be huge.</p></speech>

We spoke about agriculture, which is in a frightening position.  I come from the west, and the beef situation in particular will have an impact on counties like Mayo.  Many of the small businesses I know at home and around the region are importing cars.  The UK motor industry has estimated that it will face &pound;40 billion in losses by 2024.  Here, it is estimated that 12,000 jobs could be lost just within the motor industry.  Connected with that is the question of what the Government will lose.  The figure cited was of &euro;231 million in tax losses.  What is being put in place to mitigate against that?  The impact of Brexit on the motor industry alone is scary.  Has the ESRI examined this issue?</p></speech>

It has been examined in quite some detail from the UK perspective, given concerns there that car parts and final cars attract a tariff of approximately 10%, which is one of the highest among all manufactured goods.  There are concerns in the UK that much of that business might relocate to mainland Europe, which would have a significant impact.</p> <p>  Since Ireland does not have domestic manufacturing of cars, we have not examined that matter.  I could see there being more of a re-orientation.  If car manufacturing is moving from the UK to mainland Europe, there probably will be much more direct purchasing in Ireland of cars from mainland Europe versus the UK.  That could involve an increase in costs, given that steering wheels would be on different sides and so on.  What is being manufactured on mainland Europe is not identical to what is being manufactured in the UK.  There is a potential knock-on in the form of increased costs for the Irish motor industry, but it is not one that we have examined in detail.  The exposure is not quite on the same scale as that of agrifood.</p></speech>

I will start with a question towards which Dr. McQuinn was pointing.  Let us say that Britain exits on the Johnson deal and opens negotiations for a free trade agreement with the US.  I was a member of the trade committee of the European Parliament.  We know the kind of trade agreement the US would seek to do.  It would have the outlines of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, but possibly worse because the US would be negotiating with a weaker partner.  Let us say included in that deal is a significant reduction in standards - sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, labour and environmental.  Let us focus on agriculture, which is a major offensive interest for the US in such trade negotiations.  It wants access for chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-fed beef and ractopamine-fed pork.</p><p>Let us say that a future, presumably Tory, Government negotiated such a deal.  How would that play out?  What impact would that have in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-28a.1084" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019112800002#J00200"><p>The initial impact would entail a substantial increase in imports of agricultural produce into the UK, particularly meat produce from the US.  That would have substantial implications for the domestic sector here.  There are no two ways about it.  I am drawing on my past experience and history with Teagasc, and many of my colleagues from Teagasc would be much better able to comment on this issue.  However, key sectors of the Irish agricultural sector, such as the beef sector or those at the commodity level, have had difficulties generating a sustainable income without structural aid payments from Brussels for a long time.  That was the case even when I was working in the area years ago.  Many beef producers use those structural payments not just as their profits but also to cover some of their costs.  That is the kind of structural difficulty being faced in the Irish market, and that is the premise from which we are starting.  If those farmers faced a sizeable reduction in the price of their products, which is inevitably what would happen as far as the UK economy is concerned, it would put even further difficulties and pressures on that sector.  All I can foresee are very negative implications for the sector over a long period of time, which would compound pre-existing difficulties in the sector.  As we know, the sector is facing many other pressures, but sizeable price reductions in what it gets from the UK market would be a huge pressure on a sector that is already struggling.</p></speech>

A political trade-off would need to be made on which one to prioritise.  If the UK agreed a free trade deal of the type described by the Deputy with the US, that in any way lowered standards - particularly on food - EU negotiators would put an increased burden on checks and requirements for goods entering the EU market.  While the UK Government claims to want both those free trade agreements, the types of policies and negotiations involved are quite strongly in conflict.  We spoke earlier about how long free trade agreements take to negotiate, and that not all free trade agreements actually come to an agreement.  The proposed deal between the EU and the US was never signed because of fundamental disagreements, particularly on food standards.  It is very difficult to imagine the EU being any more sympathetic to imports from the UK which might potentially risk lower standard products as part of its supply chain.</p></speech>

The EU has very much stood with Ireland and has taken a unified stance.  However, if the UK were to consider reducing standards, particularly when it comes to agricultural produce, that could potentially give rise to all sorts of tensions within the European Union.  For example, how might the French negotiators respond to that situation if there were a better deal on the table for German car manufacturers?  Many potential tensions within the European Union could be awoken if the UK were to follow that course of action, particularly as far as food and agriculture are concerned.</p></speech>

If Britain were to leave the EU on, say 1 January 2022, at that point in time standards between Britain and the EU would be quite similar.  However, they would diverge over the course of the next five or ten years.  What impact would that have on our borders over time?  I am referring to both the Border between the North and South of this island the border between Ireland and Britain.</p></speech>

At the moment, the Revenue Commissioners carry out checks on the basis of risk assessment, even for products coming into Ireland from outside the EU where there are some regulatory differences.  They do not open every single parcel that comes in from outside the EU.  They have trusted relationships with traders that import regularly, or they might check different products depending on where they are from.  On day one, assuming the UK does not sign a free trade agreement with other countries allowing products banned by the EU into the UK, there might only be light checks initially.  If standards then diverge, the risk assessment of different products not up to EU standards will increase, and the level and intensity of checks and documentation could evolve over time.  Much of that will depend on when the UK signs other free trade agreements that vary from EU arrangements.  The quickest and easiest way for a UK-EU trade deal to be done would be for the UK to agree to keep its current standards in place going forward.  That is somewhat unlikely given that the UK has explicitly said that part of its reason leaving the EU is so it can set its own standards, but it will not do that from day one.  There would be a time period during which the level of standards and risks might evolve.</p></speech>

However, one could argue that it would have even more profound implications for the agricultural sector in the North.  It would face much the same pressures as those faced by agricultural producers in the South, if not greater.  It would be interesting to see the reaction to that.  At the time of the BSE crisis, even Ian Paisley was quick to point out the clear blue water between Britain and Ireland when it came to the health of the beef herd.  If lower standards were introduced as part of the overall negotiations, I am sure most political representatives would be keen to ensure they were confined to the mainland and not brought to Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I do not know the figure off the top of my head but we could easily work it out.  We looked into the impact of Brexit on the public finances when it first arose a few years ago.  If one thinks of the fiscal space in simple terms, the Government is allowed to increase the fiscal space in line with the underlying growth rate of the economy, or the potential output growth rate of the economy.  That is the kind of metric used by the European Commission.  We pointed out that as Brexit will have a negative impact, not only on actual output but also on the potential Irish output over the medium term, it will consequently impact the fiscal space available to the Exchequer.  That was over two and a half years ago, but at that time we quantified that it could have an impact of up to &euro;600 million over three years.  Brexit operates in a variety of different ways, and through the public finances in particular.  If one considers it in terms of the metrics used, it could adversely impact the potential output growth rate, which would impact the fiscal space available to the Government and affect whatever expenditure plans it might have.</p></speech>

Similarly, 1.2 million workers on incomes of &euro;30,000 or less will be affected by that.  Certain groups of workers in the agricultural sector and other sectors will be hard particularly hit.  Are there policy measures that our guests consider should be implemented in order to mitigate the impact of Brexit on the less well paid and those in receipt of benefits to ensure that they do not pay for the price of Brexit?</p></speech>

It would not provide for people changing behaviour depending on the price increases.  It is probably very much an upper band and, with competition in the grocery sector, we would probably see a fair degree of switching behaviour, particularly on the side of the supermarkets with the sourcing of some products more directly from mainland Europe than via the UK market.  Therefore, the final impact would probably be somewhat lower than what we have stated in the presentation.</p></speech>

Our colleagues in the tax welfare benefit team have done quite a substantial amount of work in indicating the areas and policy measures which are most efficient in tackling those types of issues for people at the lower end of the scale with respect to identifying what policy measures would be the most impactive in terms of the scale and the number of people who would be impacted upon.  If we were to pinpoint policy measures, that type of work would be useful in identifying those measures.</p></speech>

It relates to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council&rsquo;s analysis a few days ago.  I apologise if somebody else has asked this question but I am curious about it based on the ESRI's analysis.  Effectively, the council examined consumer spending and employment and found the impacts of a no-deal Brexit or a disorderly exit would be in line with what the Government had said but it felt it might not even be as bad as that.  I note the ESRI's analysis with regard to a 4.8% figure in a no-deal scenario.  Do our guests have any comment on what the council reported versus the ESRI's analysis?</p></speech>

If we were to look at the measure when it comes in particularly through the trade channels, those of us who look more at the shorter-term aspects of it and try to map, through the short term, the longer-term implications of it, would hold up our hands and say there are very large confidence intervals about trying to measure the short-run impacts of Brexit.  In a sense, what we are doing in the short term is mapping through the trade channel effects but obviously there is a whole series of other effects which are very difficult to quantify.</p></speech>

I note in this paper the ESRI expects the impact of a more difficult Brexit to be borne more significantly by people on lower incomes than any other category in Ireland.  Does this mean that our guests anticipate that, unless there is some type of concession in terms of both budget and in other policies, the situation for very poor people in Ireland is likely to get a lot worse.</p></speech>

Our overall assessment of the budget was that, on the tax side in particular, we would have welcomed the fact there were not any significant changes made and, in fact, we would probably have welcomed a type of stealth increases because the tax bands were not indexed.  We felt the economy overall is not doing very well and, therefore, if anything, we needed the budget to be somewhat contractionary in terms of its impact.  However, on the other hand, because we had the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looming, we welcomed that it was a wise and prudent strategy to divert funds that could be used to tackle the various different sectors which may be impacted if we have a no-deal scenario.  In fairness, it was a very difficult budget to frame but, on balance, we probably would have felt it was a prudent budget but the one dissenting issue would probably have been that we would have advocated welfare bands be indexed to minimise the impact.</p></speech>

It noted that if tax bands, allowances and so on for people, particularly on lower incomes, had not increased, that would have been a tax hike on people on lower pay.</p></speech>

It was a very difficult budget to frame in the context of the challenges we faced.  In terms of our overall assessment, it would have been to keep the tax take relatively neutral or even mildly contractionary.  Within that one can argue as to where the increases should come about and we would broadly argue there should be less of an impact on those at the lower end of the scale.  However, in terms of the overall macro assessment, we would have been, broadly speaking, in support of it because, as I said, the other part of the strategy was to divert funds that could be used to tackle those areas and sectors of the economy which would be most adversely impacted by a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  In terms of the concession, and this touches on my response to Deputy Paul Murphy, if policy is to intervene in the context of a no-deal Brexit to mitigate the impacts on households that are likely to be impacted, the research our colleagues are doing on the carbon tax issue in examining the offsetting mechanisms that can be used to reduce the impact of carbon tax on lower income households is possibly a way to proceed.</p></speech>

I suppose Dr. Lawless would argue as well, in terms of quantifying the impacts on households, that is under the assumption that there is no substitution.  It is like an upper bound on the negative impact, but it certainly would have a very adverse impact on households at the lower income side of the distribution.</p></speech>

It was just said that it is going to be difficult to have an exit of the UK from the customs union and Single Market without necessitating checks along the Irish Border.  In the context of the extreme lawlessness we are all aware of along the Border region, with what happened to Mr. Kevin Lunney of Quinn Industrial Holdings, QIH, does the ESRI have any sense of what actions are likely to be taken?  I know many people in business, particularly in smaller businesses, which were referenced earlier, who are utterly confused.  The ESRI pointed that out.  Northern Ireland firms will be allowed to import goods from Great Britain without tariffs, as though they were still in the customs union and the Single Market, provided they can demonstrate that these goods will not pass into the EU.  Given the particular characteristics of the Border region - myself and the Chairman have backgrounds in accounting - how is that going to happen?  As I said, we have had an extraordinary education in recent months on what life along the Border can be like, and we all know there is significant smuggling in particular products.  There has been an attempt to crack down on it.  In terms of how successful it has been, it has probably reduced it somewhat.  Has the ESRI offered advice to the Government on how this might be addressed, particularly in relation to smaller businesses?  I refer to a pub operating 30 miles from the Border and the issue of supplies.  There are a string of towns ten to 15 miles from the Border.  Does the ESRI have any sense of how that might be done?</p></speech>

All we know at the moment is that the proposal is that EU tariffs would not need to be paid by Northern Ireland firms as goods enter Northern Ireland.  They would need to be declared at some point later.  In respect of the greater risk that the EU would see, the goods coming into Northern Ireland would pretty much all have to be up to EU regulations.  Even if some of them passed into the EU market, the loss would be purely the monetary cost of the tariff that was due, rather than the risk that products not up to EU standards would get into the EU.  From the EU perspective, that integrity of the Single Market is much more about standards, and in particular standards for food products, than it is about collecting tariff revenue.

Let us say one is in business in Sligo and one is extremely law-abiding, but there may be other operators and businesses in the town that are less picky.  What happens along the Border region is that the businesses that would like to be law-abiding are simply undercut to a very significant degree by the businesses that might not be so law-abiding in taxation terms.  Does the ESRI get any sense that there has been any kind of thinking around this?</p> <p>  No Brexit, followed by a customs union and a Single Market are these least worst things.  Although no Brexit is the best thing, but that does not look like it is likely to happen.  Does the ESRI have any sense of how there might be, if necessary but hopefully not necessary, some development of structures that would seek to protect the law-abiding traders on both sides of the Border?</p></speech>

Obviously, they are not in place.  Whether they are being considered, much will depend on the outcome of the UK election and if the agreement goes ahead.  Presumably at that stage, we will begin to see a lot more flesh on the bones in terms of how the arrangements will work out.  Then one would expect to see a response from policymakers about how to assist and aid people to deal with the various different complexities.  At this point in time, the agreement is by definition high-brow and high-level in nature, which is understandable as it is a political agreement devised by politicians.  In respect of the practicalities, from a trade perspective, we will have to see the details before one can begin to think about what the appropriate response should be and how the Government should try to aid small traders, in particular, and businesses located along the Border.  Clearly, it just goes back to the basic point that the imposition of a Border and a hard border introduces so many different frictions into people's trading activities.  Ultimately these all bring about substantial costs for people.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to get a good picture of how the sea border will look until we know how divergent the two entities will be after the free trade agreement or the second stage of the negotiations.  I am not sure how much work has gone into how to operationalise the current agreement, because so much of it is still contingent on the outcome of the next phase of negotiations.</p></speech>

Does the ESRI have any experience of how this kind of freeport arrangement would be likely to operate?  In other countries, it is viewed with quite a lot of trepidation because of not just its impact on trade but its broader implications.  I do not know if this would be a negotiating point, but he has already promised this right along the coastlines of the UK.  As I said, there have been references to three potential locations in the North.</p></speech>

Largely, they move trade to the location of the free port, where goods can come in, not have to pay further tariffs, and be further processed by firms in the region and re-exported.  For firms in that area, there is a potential benefit, given that they can take in their goods tariff free and re-export them without having to deal with tariffs.  That requires, however, an extreme level of checks around the free port to ensure that the goods being unloaded and processed tariff free within the location will not enter general circulation or be sold to firms not in the region.  The benefit is very much a distributional issue to firms within the location but it comes with a significant cost for the checks required to keep the free port activity separate from the rest.</p> <p>  Moreover, free ports are allowed in the EU and the policy could have been applied in any event.  Rotterdam is a free port, where goods come in and are reprocessed, put on separate ships and moved on-----</p></speech>

We have a minimum wage and there is something of a movement to the introduction of a living wage, for which we have structures.  Is Dr. Lawless concerned that that could be put under great pressure by the type of Brexit deal that has been discussed?  Some of the more recent discussions have been associated with a race to the bottom in respect of labour standards and matters such as money laundering.  Many free ports nowadays are associated with highly efficient money laundering from the drugs trade or oligarchs from various jurisdictions parking their money at such locations.</p></speech>

Divergence on a range of issues, including labour, environmental and food safety standards, are all aspects that the EU side is determined to protect.  That will put pressure on the UK side in regarding how much it is willing to compromise for market access, or whether it is willing to continue signing up to EU-level deals or whether it will be determined to sign global deals that will allow it to reduce standards.  The level playing field is an important feature of EU negotiations.  Many of the other free trade agreements the EU has signed in recent years contain clauses on environmental and labour standards.  While the traditional picture of a free trade agreement might be that people negotiate tariffs, recent free trade agreements, not least those negotiated by the EU, tend to go well beyond that in setting standards.</p></speech>

I listened to their comprehensive views, and while I had to step out of the meeting for a few moments to attend the Seanad, I heard the vast bulk of their and members' contributions.  Hardly a debate goes by in which Brexit is not mentioned, and it has become part of our being, our fibre and everything we do and think about, whether that is flights, roaming charges, exports or operations.  We all know people who work in multinationals and small businesses, and the revenue of the State will be affected one way or another by it.</p> <p>  Forecasts are forecasts and models are models, but will our guests give us some insight into how the modelling works?  What are the variables that produce the outputs?</p></speech>

We try to capture the various impacts on the headline indicators for the economy.  In our case, we did that through our use of COSMO, which is the standard model of the economy.  Crucially, we have had a close relationship over the years with the UK National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, which maintains a large suite of models that model the western world and its overall impacts.  From our perspective, it is important that we link into that framework, given that many of the impacts of Brexit will come through trade channels, as we have articulated.  To capture that, models of the EU and UK are needed and our macro model links in to that.  The analysis is mainly used to examine issues from a longer-term perspective, to consider the impact of Brexit in the next ten-year horizon.  It is interesting that the work we have done more recently has built on much of the sectoral, micro-level work that Dr. Lawless has done, tying it in with the overall, broader research.  In the latest analysis, we built a great deal on the trade work she has done.</p></speech>

We produce estimates of the extent to which trade, foreign direct investment and consumer prices will be affected.  The macro model takes all those inputs and feeds them through all the other channels through which they affect overall employment, other sectors of the economy and so on to give an overall, macro number.</p></speech>

I hold my hands up because I mainly work on short-term forecasting, but the longer-term work, in which Dr. Lawless has been involved, is comprehensive, robust and rigorous, and it will not get any better at predicting the impact on the economy.  The issue is when that is mapped through to the short run, that is, how a no-deal Brexit at the start of 2020 will impact the economy that year.  That is when we start getting into the realm of guesstimates, because it is a matter of mapping the longer-term trade implications onto the short term but nobody has a good quantification of the unknown unknowns.  We do not know what will happen if there is a complete meltdown of financial markets or severe tailgates at Dover and Calais, and subsequently at Irish ports disruptions of supply chains and so on.  It is difficult to assess the impact of that in the short run.  When it comes to estimating the short-term impacts, the forecasts come with sizeable confidence intervals.</p></speech>

It is not Brexit in the context of a global economic meltdown or of some other shock that might happen.  Nobody anticipated what happened in the period 2008 to 2010, inclusive.  While there may have been a few people and occasional naysayers - one might say a broken clock is right twice a day - nobody anticipated the scale and speed at which the slowdown happened, although not many people anticipated the robustness and speed of the recovery either.  The ESRI's figures are based on a relatively steady economy, all other things being equal.  Guests appearing before the committee in the past six months or year, including chief executives of some of the five main banks, stated we are closer to the next recession than we are to the previous one.  I acknowledge that Dr. McQuinn stated he expects the economy to be okay, and I do not think anybody wants it go any other way, but has the ESRI examined the impact of Brexit in the context of a slowing down of the economy, a recession, a trade war between China and the EU, or with the US, or whatever?</p></speech>

While we expect that the economy will continue to grow quite strongly next year, we do not think it will grow as strongly as it has this year because of some of the issues that have been touched on, including the global slowdown.  Some of our major trading partners are experiencing weaker growth than we would have expected six months ago.  Such factors are incorporated into our baseline assessment.  When one applies the impact of the Brexit scenario, it is applied with respect to that baseline.  When we outline our forecast under a no-deal Brexit scenario, by definition it incorporates the impact of Brexit but it also implicitly incorporates our assessment of how we think the global economy is likely to evolve in 2020.</p></speech>

There has been an increased discussion about the impact of a possible global slowdown or a potential recession in the US.  There are many indicators which suggest that we are not terribly far from such an eventuality.  At the same time, we have to weigh everything up and try to get a balanced view of what we think the most likely outcome for our economy will be in 2020.  There is no doubt that some of our major trading partners are confronted by structural issues.  Along with my colleague, Professor Karl Whelan of UCD, I have been looking for a long time at the growth prospects of the EU over the medium term.  Our assessment of how we see the economic performance of the EU evolving over the medium term is quite pessimistic.  Some of the difficulties in the EU economy are also witnessed in the US economy, the UK economy and the major western economies generally.  I refer to demographic issues such as population ageing, for example.  The slowdown in productivity that has been observed in many western economies is a puzzle that has been confounding macroeconomists for quite some time.  When these factors are put together, a slower growth trajectory across all of these major economies over the next ten, 15 or 20 years becomes evident.  We incorporate all of these factors when we are making our assessments.  In the main, we are still reasonably confident that the economy is likely to grow quite strongly and robustly in 2020.</p></speech>

Who provides the bulk of the services?  I know that just one of the big six insurance companies is indigenous.  The other five are owned by UK or German entities, in the main.  I presume that means they are providing services to us.  Are we providing many financial services or other services to the UK?  Does the balance of trade between the UK and Ireland, or the balance of services if we want to use that phrase, involve them selling more to us or us selling more to them?</p></speech>

I think we export more to the UK, in terms of services, than we import from the UK.  That is partly because our services imports depend heavily on royalties and intellectual property imports coming from the US into the multinational sector.  Pretty much all of the services trade between Ireland and our main trading partners comes largely from the multinational sector.</p></speech>

Equally, we are at the end of the supply chains of companies such as Tesco, Lidl and Aldi that operate in both jurisdictions.

I ask the witnesses not to misunderstand me because I am aware of the importance of our corporation tax rate as part of a suite of measures.  We have other disadvantages that mean we need our corporation tax rate.  Access to the Single Market means access to the 430 million people who will be living in the EU if the UK leaves the Union.  Surely it would be relatively unattractive for a company to leave the EU to go to the UK to avail of a lower rate of corporation tax, given that it would mean facing various barriers, tariffs and charges.  Is that a fair point?  Mr. Johnson and others have said that by cutting corporation tax, they will attract a great deal of industry to the UK from other European countries.  Do the witnesses envisage that this will happen?</p></speech>

One of our colleagues, Dr. Iulia Siedschlag, has done a great deal of work on what attracts foreign direct investment firms to locate in certain locations.  Market size and access to the EU market are very important factors when companies from outside Europe are deciding where to locate.</p><p>Within Europe, corporate tax rate might become an element but the fact that they come to the EU initially relates to market size.</p></speech>

If Malta, Poland or Portugal wants to go to a rate lower than Ireland, that is one issue but the big attraction is the Single Market and the customs union.  I thank Dr. Lawless for clarifying that in her opening statement, as many people are not that sure about the difference between the Single Market and the customs union and how Switzerland has one but not the other, as is the case with Turkey, and so on.</p></speech>

While corporation tax rate is certainly an important factor and its importance cannot be diminished, it is clear, thought, from some of the empirical work, particular that undertaken by Professor Ronald Davies, that there are many other aspects for firms locating here such as Ireland being English speaking, and the relative ease of doing business as well as the attractiveness of being in the EU, which is a huge factor.</p></speech>

We touched on that earlier in the potential implications for the financial services sector in London if the UK leaves the EU.  There was an important court ruling some years back where the European Central Bank tried to prevent London-based firms from dealing in euro denominated bonds because the UK was not in the euro area.  The European Court of Justice ironically ruled that they could continue to do so because the UK was in the EU.  If the UK leaves, it is likely that such a case will be brought again and that might have substantial implications.</p></speech>

People might be fearful that companies might leave Ireland to go to the UK because of corporation tax.  However, I have always felt that market access, the Single market and the customs union are very important.  That means that we must be competitive with the other 26 remaining countries in our general performance and competitiveness.</p> <p>  Brexit is a very fluid.  We all still hope that it was all a bad dream and we will wake up and it will not happen.  Unfortunately, it probably will but we hope that it will be the least worst of all the options.  I thank all the witnesses for their opening statements and contributions.  We have had a good attendance over the course of the morning and many members contributed.  </p></speech>

I especially thank the Minister and her officials for the briefing material which has been provided and circulated to the members of the committee.</p> <p>  Two sets of imeachta&iacute; have been circulated to members relating to the Revised Estimates for Vote 37, considered on 27 March 2019, and those relating to the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill considered on 21 November.  We have also circulated draft minutes of the meeting of 9 July which recommend that Deputy O'Dea's Bill, Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017, proceeds to Committee Stage.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I propose to invite the Minister to make an opening address to the committee in a moment and members will then have an opportunity to ask her a question.  Before that, I remind members that, in according with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate which are: administration pay; administration non-pay; non-contributory State pension; jobseeker's allowance; one-parent family payment; widow and widower's pension; basic supplementary welfare allowance; farm assist; exceptional and urgent needs; other working agency reports; the community employment, CE, programme; rural social programme; the T&uacute;s initiative; back-to-work enterprise allowance; youth employment support scheme; back to education; back-to-work family dividend; JobsPlus; disability allowance; carer's allowance; domiciliary care allowance; carer support grant; disability activation support; wage subsidy scheme; child benefit; working family payment; back-to-school clothing and footwear; school meals; rent supplement; telephone support allowance; household benefits package; fuel allowance; grant to the Citizens Information Board, CIB; miscellaneous and appropriations-in-aid.  I ask members to refer to those specific sub-headings when they are making contributions.</p> <p>  I neglected, at the start of the meeting, to acknowledge an apology from Deputy Brady who will not be here today.</p> <p>  The Minister should not look so happy.</p></speech>

The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is primarily to fund the Christmas bonus for Vote 37 social assistance recipients.  The Christmas bonus will be paid next week. </p><p>I was pleased that we could restore the Christmas bonus last year, and I was very happy to announce that, despite the current climate of uncertainty, the Christmas bonus will again be paid at a rate of 100% this December.  The payment recognises the needs of people who are long-term financially dependent on their social welfare payment for all or most of their income, such as pensioners, people with disabilities and carers.  It will benefit some 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients and is estimated to cost approximately &euro;279 million overall.  It is likely to be spent in local communities, contributing to local communities, towns and villages during what I hope will be a happy Christmas season.</p><p>This cost is broken down into nearly &euro;123 million for Vote 37 recipients and over &euro;156 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund is meeting the cost of the bonus being paid to people on contributory payments such as the contributory State pension, invalidity pension, and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on this Supplementary Estimate.<font color="#FF0000"></font></p><p>In contrast, the bonus that is paid to people in receipt of payments from voted schemes is met entirely by the Exchequer.  As the committee knows, the bonus is not included in the original Estimates for the Department and, unless savings are made that will meet the entire cost, a Supplementary Estimate is required each year in order to ensure that the bonus gets paid.</p><p>This year, I have again included an additional table, beginning at page<font color="#FF0000"> </font>3<font color="#FF0000"> </font>of the committee&rsquo;s brief, which provides the outturn position on the various schemes prior to the payment of the bonus.  The Chairman had previously suggested that this approach would be of assistance to the committee and I know it helped last year so we should continue in that vein every year.</p><p>Income from PRSI receipts during 2019 will result in Social Insurance Fund income of an estimated<font color="#FF0000"> </font>&euro;11.6 billion.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>This will be &euro;393 million, or 3.4%, ahead of the 2019 Revised Estimate and will be &euro;1 billion, or 9.5%, ahead of the position in 2018.  </p><p>Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is expected to cost approximately<font color="#FF0000"> </font>&euro;10 billion.  This is &euro;220.5 million, or 2.2%, above profile, of which &euro;156.5 million is due to payment of the Christmas bonus.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of income over expenditure in the fund in this calendar year is expected to be around &euro;1.6 billion.  This is due mainly to the higher PRSI receipts from increased numbers of people at work.  The accumulated surplus in the fund at the end of the year is estimated to reach &euro;3.9 billion. </p><p>While it is, of course, welcome to see the fund in a healthy surplus, it is worth remembering, particularly in these uncertain times, that this surplus can become a deficit very quickly.  A similar surplus was exhausted within two years when the recession had a significant impact on income to the fund.</p><p>Overall expenditure on the Department&rsquo;s schemes, services and administration in 2019 is expected to be &euro;20.8 billion.  This will be &euro;311.7 million, or 1.5%, more than provided for in the original 2019 Revised Estimates.  As I mentioned earlier, some &euro;279 million of this is due to payment of the Christmas bonus.</p><p>Total expenditure for the Department, which includes expenditure from the Vote and from the Social Insurance Fund, comprises overspends on some schemes and underspends on others.</p><p>On the social insurance side, there has been a higher than anticipated expenditure on the State pension (contributory) but a lower than estimated expenditure on illness benefit.  On the Vote, there has been a higher expenditure than profiled on illness, disability and carer's payments and lower than estimated expenditures on working age employment supports.  Taken together, and excluding the Christmas bonus, departmental expenditure on schemes and services is expected to be &euro;32.3 million ahead of the profile, which is less than 0.2% of its expenditure.</p><p> The live register is expected to average at approximately 192,200 in 2019, which is a reduction of more than 29,000 on the average for 2018.  While the live register is not designed to measure unemployment, this decline reflects the positive trends in the labour market generally.  The numbers in employment continue to grow and the number of people unemployed fell by 11% over the year to quarter 3.  The latest data shows the unemployment rate has fallen below 5%.  The live register is now under 180,000, the lowest since early 2008.  These positive trends are very welcome and in line with the Government's pathways to work objectives. </p><p> The 2019 Supplementary Estimate referred to the committee and the briefing provided to members lists the schemes for which additional sums are being sought, as well as the schemes that are behind profile.  The amount of the Supplementary Estimate is derived by estimating the outturn across all voted schemes, which includes underspends on some schemes and overspends on others, and adding in the cost of the Christmas bonus.  As the members are aware, almost all of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure is demand-led.  Changes in the economy, labour market and society, as well as the demographic make-up of the population at a particular point in time, all impact the expenditure across the Department.  An estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of the annual Revised Estimates programme.  The individual estimates are constructed on a scheme by scheme basis, using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant information that is available at the time the estimate is calculated.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, it is appropriate to note that the outturn position for the Department, in the absence of the payment of the Christmas bonus, would be &euro;20.5 billion, or 0.2% above the Estimate.  I am sure the committee will agree that this provides a great degree of assurance that the Estimates process in my Department works very well and provides insofar as is possible given the large number of variables involved a clear and accurate picture of projected expenditure.  Trends can and do change over the course of each year, however, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than provided for in the Estimate.  Actual expenditure on most schemes will never be precisely on target because of these factors.  The extent of any overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of the year when the outturn for the year has been confirmed.</p><p> I hope that my opening statement, together with the briefing material provided, has given the committee a clear overview of where we expect to be at the end of the year.  I look forward to members' questions and, hopefully, positive comments.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the changes previously made by the Minister's officials in regard to the insertion of an a third column to take account of the Christmas bonus because this makes the figures much easier to use.  The Minister mentioned that the Christmas bonus is not included in the original Estimates of the Department, which, perhaps, is a policy decision.  It is a pity it is not included because the beneficiaries of it are the people who are the most vulnerable and probably need to make sure they can plan for Christmas such that they do not have to engage the services of moneylenders and so forth.  It is not only the amount paid, but the certainty around it, that is important to people.  However, that is a political and policy position.</p> <p>  On the Social Insurance Fund, the Minister mentioned that the surplus is &euro;3.9 billion.  Does the Minister have a view on where that surplus should be spent over the next year or two?  I also have a technical question on the Social Insurance Fund in regard to subhead A.38, which is the household benefits package.  The sum of &euro;20 million of expenditure has been moved from the Vote to the Social Insurance Fund.  The rationale for this is a detailed analysis of claims.  However, there is no breakdown of the how the calculation was done.  There is a substantial change in percentages.  The spend decreased from &euro;89 million to &euro;69 million by way of the transfer of &euro;20 million of that spend to the Social Insurance Fund.  I accept the Minister may not have this information to hand today but perhaps she would undertake to forward to the committee a detailed note on the rationale for that process and how the calculation was done.</p></speech>

I tried to do it this year but because it is mentioned in so many plans etc. I could not do it.  There is also a Christmas payment but because nobody gets paid on Christmas people are given a double payment the previous week.  The Christmas bonus is not actually a bonus it is a payment that people need and rely on.  We need to change the terminology because it irks people who do not get it.  The people who do not receive it probably do not realise that the people who receive it do not get anything else other than it.  I think we should change the language around it.  I would also like to have certainty around it but that is a conversation that needs to be had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which I will do.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's question with regard to the Social Insurance Fund, I will have the details on the reason that &euro;20 million was moved to the fund circulated to him because it is too difficult to explain.  </p></speech>

I plan to release the documentation supporting the new total contributions model when I bring the memo to Cabinet.  If everything remains the same, that surplus will be diminished very quickly over the next number of years and we would rapidly end up in a negative that would have to be supported by the Exchequer other funds, notwithstanding any changes that we would make.  We will attempt to make changes in how we calculate the State pension (contributory) going forward, with regard to the number of contributions that are needed.  It is better than expected this year, which, I think, is related to more jobs having been created this year and thus increase social insurance contributions.  At some point in the future, we need to have a conversation about it.  There are payments which I believe should be met from the Social Insurance Fund but are not and people who are not paying into the Social Insurance Fund in the same way as others.  I want to ensure there is an equality of access to the Social Insurance Fund, which means an equality of input.  This, too, is a conversation we need to have.</p></speech>

The proposed model might not be the same at the end of the process as it was at the beginning of it.  The rationale for it has to be laid out to everybody.  I do not believe any data should be held back.  There should be transparency around what the Social Insurance Fund will look like in the next 30 to 40 years if we do nothing and what it will look like if we do X, Y or Z.  I do not believe there has ever been a piece of legislation put forward that has not been amended in some way, shape or form.  Members would not be able to put forward amendments without accurate information on what will happen in the future based on demographics, pension increases, work trends and so on.  I think all of the data has to be released.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for the Minister.  One of the reasons savings were made is because the Department operated at under the approved headcount for the last 12 months.  What is the approved headcount and how many posts were vacant?</p><p>There have been suggestions that not everyone is aware of the existence of the working family payment, formerly known as the family income supplement.  I note that the number of recipients of the family income supplement was 971 below the Department's estimate.  What is the total number of recipients of that payment?  Similarly, the number of recipients of the back to work family dividend is 791 below the estimate.  What percentage of the total does this represent?  On the other hand, the number of recipients of the disability allowance is 1,571 above the profile.  Again, how many people are in receipt of disability allowance?  On page 14 data is provided for the youth employment support scheme.  The spend was &euro;4.2 million lower than expected because the number of participants was 278 below profile.  Does the Minister have any idea why that was the case?  Is anything being done about it?  I note that disability activation supports are somewhat below profile, as per page 15.  Apparently part of the reason for this is that the number of claims was lower than anticipated.  There must be something wrong here because it is not plausible to suggest that we are doing enough or spending sufficient money on encouraging people with disabilities into the workforce.  Such a suggestion would be quickly contradicted.  What is the situation in that regard?  The data on page 16 is extraordinary.  How many schools are availing of the school meals programme?  The estimate is down by &euro;4 million due to the fact that there have been delays in the submission of applications by 70 schools while a further 71 schools that are eligible have not applied at all.  A total of 80 schools have applied and the Department has sought further information from them which has not been supplied.  This suggests that they are not too bothered about the situation which I find quite bizarre.  </p><p> Is it in order for me to ask a question on the contributory old age pension?</p></speech>

The first question was on the working family payment, formerly known as the family income supplement.  There are two reasons for the reduction there.  We spent a considerable amount of money on a publicity campaign this year.  That campaign was very well received which I took some comfort from because sometimes one can spend a lot of money on advertising and it totally misses the point.  Lots of people told me that they did not know about the payment.  They sent me messages on Facebook Messenger asking for more details and so on.  This means that the campaign did land and people did hear it, which was good.  At the same time, there were lots of people who were working and whose wages increased to such an extent that they were over the threshold for qualifying.  The numbers evened out to some extent.  Some of the extra 29,000 people who got jobs would have been in receipt of the working family payment.  Also, some of the people who were in receipt of the payment had salary increases which brought them over the threshold.  A number of new people are in receipt of the payment.  It would be interesting to find out at the end of the year how many people who were in receipt of the payment are no longer getting it because of an improvement in their financial position, how many got new jobs and how many are new recipients.  I will see if I can get that information at the end of year and if so, I will pass it on to the committee.  I believe the aforementioned advertising campaign was worthwhile.  Given the number of schemes that we operate, we should probably spend a little bit more on telling people exactly what is available.  Lots of people do not know about much of the stuff done by the Department.  It might be worthwhile to do that in the future.</p> <p>  On the back to work schemes, as I said already there are 29,000 new workers this year.  Some of those people would have been receiving the back to work family dividend but are now in better paid jobs.  There is nothing sinister here.  All that is happening is that people's circumstances are improving, which is borne out by the SILC data.  Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the latest figures from the CSO, published this morning.  Those figures show that what we are doing and the areas on which we are spending money is having an effect.  We are directing resources at the most vulnerable and that is having a positive impact.  People's boats are being lifted and buoyed by direct social transfers and changes in labour force participation. </p> <p>  Expenditure on disability allowance is going up because some people who were in receipt of other payments should have been in receipt of disability allowance or an invalidity payment instead.  We have become more conscious of that.  It is also something that the community and voluntary sector has been helping us with in the last while.  When we send people to community and voluntary bodies for labour force participation schemes or community employment schemes, they vet them to assess their suitability and come back to the Department with helpful advice.  This is one of the extra strings to the bow of the community and voluntary sector.  They come back and tell us that they do not think certain people should be on a jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's assistance payment but should be on some other payment.  We reclassify people on the back of their advice.  It is the case that more people are presenting with difficulties and struggles in life, which seems to be contradicted by the fact that we are spending less on activating people.  We need to do more in that space.  The launch of the Ability Programme took some of the money we were spending on the Vote but that programme is working really well.  We probably need to double the funding for that programme.  A lot of our funding last year went into the Social Innovation Fund.  I was happy to work with industry in the last couple of weeks to encourage it to invest in helping people with disabilities or added stresses in their daily lives but that does not mean that I do not have plans to spend money next year.  Obviously this is only compensating for an overspend in other areas.  </p> <p>  The youth employment support scheme needs to be refined.  The young adults recruited onto the scheme who were ready to be activated and put onto training and work experience schemes did really well out of it.  I must thank the participants and the employers who worked with us on the scheme over the last year.  An awful lot of the participants got jobs, which is great.  However, I must acknowledge my own ignorance in respect of this area because what I had not countenanced or understood was that a huge number of our young people are not ready to be trained or put into an employment environment when they sign up for the youth employment support scheme.  We are currently drafting a pre-youth employment support scheme training course.  I have done a number of youth employment support scheme recruitment days in the past year and have been struck by the number of young people attending who do not have an ounce of self confidence or self esteem.  They are just not ready to be put into an employment environment.  We need to do a two to four week pre-youth employment support scheme course with them.  Such a course is currently being devised at the moment to help them to realise their talents and skills and to build their self esteem so that they can walk into a work-ready environment.  That course will be rolled out at the beginning of next year.  I have no doubt that I will spend every penny next year on the youth employment support scheme.  I must honestly admit that I did not realise the difficulties being faced by young people.  I thought they would not have the same difficulties as people who have been out of the labour market for long periods but they do, unfortunately.  Now that we have realised that, we can address it.  </p> <p>  It is very easy to think that if we offer free school meals to schools that every one of them will jump at the chance.  However, it is not so easy for schools that do not have strong parent association supports or ancillary staff available.  We try to work with the schools to address their difficulties.  There is a will on the part of all of the schools to participate in school meals programmes, whether they are hot meals, cold meals, breakfast clubs or after-school clubs but some have additional issues which prevent them from being ready on day one when the money is available.  We are working with those schools to try to ensure that they take up the offer.  Some schools do not want to participate for whatever reason and we cannot force them to do so.  At the moment, outside of the pilot scheme for the hot school meals, the cold school meals programme only applies in DEIS schools.</p><p>There are plenty of non-DEIS schools that would have loved to have access to the programme but the Vote does not have sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do anything other than cover DEIS schools.</p></speech>

The Department made a saving of &euro;4 million.  As Deputy O'Dea said 70 schools participated.  There were delays in submitting applications.  Some 71 were eligible to participate but have not availed of the programme, and 80 applications were received, where further information is required.  Some &euro;53 million is being spent, and the question that Deputy O'Dea was asking was how many schools are within that figure and are benefiting from that scheme.</p></speech>

The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of meals to 1,580 schools and organisations, benefiting more than 250,000 children.  The objective of a scheme is to provide regular, nutritious meals, be it for breakfast, lunch, or after-school clubs.  It is not just DEIS schools that get it, nor do they get it just for lunches.  It is a wider programme that reaches a wider audience over and above the 858 schools.</p></speech>

There are some schools that are classified as nearly&ndash;DEIS.  The terminology is not mine.  The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for putting the schools in a hierarchy of need.  Every single DEIS school receives an application.  There are some schools that would potentially qualify for DEIS status notwithstanding that they do not have exactly the same criteria.  These are in the next group of categories.  A number of years ago, long before my time, the school meals programme was opened to that next category of schools.  They are not quite DEIS, but they would be so but for compliance possibly with one other condition.</p></speech>

We have 145,544 recipients on the disability allowance, 52,036 recipients on the working family payments scheme and 5,607 on the back to work family dividends scheme.  The State contributory pension is very close to the 34% of the indexation level that we would like it to be at.  We need to see how wages increase next year.  That would increase the State pension from the current &euro;243 by &euro;7 per week, to bring it up to 34%.  I do not have an answer to hand to the question as to why there was of 5.2% increase in the contributory pension this year, but I will come back to the committee with that answer.</p></speech>

I agree with her comments on changing the language around that particular payment and the need to have certainty for those people who really depend on it coming up to the Christmas period.  It gives a massive boost to the local economy, shops and service providers.  I welcome the positive trends in the live register figures which continue to fall and are below 5%, the lowest since early 2008.  Please God, those trends will continue.</p> <p>  The fact that the Department's expenditure on schemes and services is expected to be 2% ahead of profile is an endorsement of the Minister and her officials.

The figures are not significant but I am curious as to what is going on behind them than the actual numbers.  There is a grant of &euro;841,000 for the Citizens Information Board, CIB, and a saving of &euro;0.5 million on Abhaile due to the volume of vouchers not being redeemed as predicted.  Can the Minister put that in context?  How many vouchers were redeemed and how many were not?  Equally, when she talks about the Money Advice and Budgeting Bureau, another half a million euros is referred to as a reduction in the allocation to Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, companies for the dedicated mortgage arrears services.  These are small amounts of money but is it is surprising that demand is not there from the pressures that we anecdotally hear abouty.   I do not know if the Minister has numbers to hand on this.</p></speech>

The most recent review we did indicates that CIB does not need to draw down &euro;59.26 million.  It calculates that it will have savings of approximately &euro;1.2 million, &euro;500,000 of which is due to less than anticipated demand on vouchers.  This is the direct reason CIB intend to take on board their own in-house help as opposed to using voucher schemes.  That will probably cause some issues for those who are doing the work through this voucher system but we need to ensure that we are following through and giving the help to the people who are coming.  The simple fact of the matter is that people were receiving vouchers and were not using them.  We cannot make people use them but we have to ensure that we make available the resources that are needed.</p></speech>

It was not over and above the day-to-day business that it does.  It had specific projects that did not cost as much as it had anticipated at the beginning of the year.  Approximately &euro;100,000 of the &euro;1.1 million was due to a reduction in the allocation to a the number of  MABS companies.  As the committee will be aware -  it is a conversation that we have had a number of occasions in the past -  there were a couple of reasons the company streamlined the way it used to do business.  One was for governance and also to have better outputs.  A plus from its perspective happens to be a reduction in the cost of governance and the running of the businesses.  The was also &euro;100,000 of savings, even though it is not really savings, because it is due to a delay in the processing of the dedicated advocacy pilot scheme that we announced earlier on this year.   It is just late in starting.  Once it kicks in it will have a fund associated with it, which is why the &euro;100,000 has not been spent.</p><p>I will come back to the Chairman later on with exactly how many vouchers were issued, how many were redeemed and how many were not.</p></speech>

I have one final question.  On a different subhead, subhead A2, administration - non-pay, there was a variation but it was off-set by higher expenditure on agency services of &euro;3.55 million.  What was the total expenditure on agency services?  I could not exactly work it out easily.  What was planned and budgeted and what was the extra &euro;3.55 million?</p></speech>

The amount actually spent was &euro;132.050 million.  The extra is &euro;3.5 million.  It is not 100% allocated but the vast majority of it went to the renegotiating of our GP contracts.  That probably does not pop into the Chairman's head as an agency but we classify all of the doctors who do all of the certifications for us as agents.  As the Chairman will be aware from the lovely mess that we caused with the illness benefit changeover last year, we renegotiated the payments to our agency staff - our GP contractors.  It was increased significantly.  It is now &euro;50 per payment.  Although we had anticipated we would be giving them an increase, we did not anticipate how good, as negotiators, they would be.  They got a better than anticipated, but well-deserved, increase.</p></speech>
