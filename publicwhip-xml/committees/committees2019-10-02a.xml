Before introducing our witnesses and at the request of the broadcasting services, I ask that members and visitors in the Gallery ensure that for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane mode.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Mr. John Fogarty, chairperson of Templederry Community Wind Farm and Community Renewable Energy; and Mr. Paul Kenny, chief executive officer of the Tipperary Energy Agency; as well as to Dr. Paul McGowan, chairperson, Mr. John Melvin, director of energy markets and Ms Lisa Fahy, manager of retail markets, of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.</p><p>I advise the witnesses by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the joint committee.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fogarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100200002#E00200"><p>I am from Templederry.  Twenty years ago, when we set out to develop a community wind farm, we did not think it would take 12 years, and 20 years on we did not think ours would be the only community-owned wind farm in the country.  That is a testament to the fact that the system is geared against community generation projects.</p> <p>  My principal purpose is to outline the difficulty in accessing the grid.  This is our biggest problem.  If we set out in the morning to develop a 4 MW solar farm in our parish, we would set about making a grid application.  In our area there would be a queue of seven or eight in our node.  It takes ESB Networks 12 months to process any one of those.  Therefore, the earliest we could expect to have our grid application processed would be eight years, and that would be if nobody contested the grid offer received, so it could take anything between eight and 12 years.  Nobody can keep a community group active for that long, so the system is geared against us.  What are the obstacles?  The principal one is getting the grid applications processed.</p> <p>  In addition, the process has changed recently in that planning is now required before making a grid application.  This means making a commitment to spend between &euro;25,000 and &euro;100,000 just to take a punt on getting an affordable grid offer down the line.  It is the same for small-scale connection to the grid.  For a farmer in Germany who has solar panels on his or her farm buildings, exporting to the grid is part of and supplements his or her income.  We just cannot do that here.  We are allowed to export 6 kW from a domestic building and 11 kW from a commercial building.  That is a paltry amount, which would certainly not supplement an income.  For these reasons, it is almost impossible at present to get a community project off the ground.</p> <p>  We very much welcome the Minister's announcement that there will be a community pot in the first renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction.  That has been the first bit of light in the tunnel for about 20 years.  If all we need to do is supplement that with our ring-fencing of grid income to match whatever is in the community pot as regards the feed-in tariff, it creates a major opening for community generation to take place.</p> <p>  As regards Templederry, the advantage of a community generation project is huge.  We have two 4.6 MW wind turbines in our parish, but the income generated from them is equivalent to that from a 30-turbine development by an outside developer because in the case of a developer all the money is moved out of the area.  We are very surprised that Deputies do not promote community renewable projects around the country.  Every parish is capable of owning between three and five turbines.  That would turn local economies inside out and would be huge from a community point of view.</p> <p>  The one thing that has helped us along the way is Tipperary Energy Agency.  Mr. Kenny from the agency is sitting beside me.  I do not think we would have got to a conclusion without it.  We see that SEAI is appointing consultants to help the special areas of conservation, SACs, as they are formed.  We suggest that an energy agency be set up in every area and region because the knowledge builds up in the energy agency and is retained for future projects.  Tipperary Energy Agency has probably been the most important factor in our success, and I especially thank Mr. Kenny for that.  I will hand over to him now.</p></speech>

It is stated in the climate plan that we will encourage more communities to engage in the process.  I am worried about this because many of those communities are encouraged to do things and then they hit a brick wall as they try to secure grid connections and find they are unable to export from their community centres.  They are asked as volunteers to support the energy transition at a local level and to do things that I employ engineers with four years of training in engineering design to do.  SEAI currently has a tender out which will involve approximately &euro;2 million per year or more in additional supports for communities to generate local area plans and so on.  That will go to consultants and it could go to us.  We have more or less decided not to enter into that process.  The same budget, if it was turned around and used to support local energy agencies at a county or regional level would be much more beneficial because every time a local agency does a project, it learns from it and can support other communities.  We do not need this support but other counties do.  Instead of paying consultants to do up a local area plan, the community can do it.  There is a certain lack of understanding of what is really required to get the energy transition to move at a local level.  Committee members saw this when they visited Tipperary and we would like the committee to understand what it could do to support the development of other local energy agencies across the country.</p></speech>

The CRU is the economic regulator for the energy and public water sectors in Ireland and safety regulator in the energy sector.  Our mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  Within this, one of the key parts of our vision is that customers are both empowered and protected through our policy development and decisions.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. John Melvin and Ms Lisa Fahy.  We welcome the opportunity to meet the committee to discuss our role in respect of citizen measures, specifically the smart metering programme, a project of strategic national importance for Ireland's low-carbon energy future.</p> <p>  The CRU's role as economic regulator of ESB Networks and other network companies is to ensure that customers and network users receive value for money while the network companies earn a fair return on their activities to make the necessary network investments.  Smart meters are the next generation of electricity and gas meter that are being rolled out across Europe and internationally.  This new technology will replace older, mechanical meters and will make available new products and services to energy customers.  Smart meters will make the switching process easier and empower consumers to make the right choice for their energy needs.  Smart metering will also enable the development of the smart grid and facilitate more flexible, reliable and better network planning in the future.  In 2017, the CRU decided to adopt the ESB Networks phased delivery plan for the smart meter upgrade.  This plan will see the roll-out of smart meters and smart services in three phases, commencing in 2019 and concluding in 2024.  The roll-out of smart meters commenced in September, with the first meters deployed in Bandon and Portlaoise.  ESB Networks has now commenced phase 2 planning and will identify the areas for the next meter deployment.</p> <p>  As the stock of smart meters increases, the facilitation of microgeneration and the development of the prosumer, as it is known, become a realistic prospect for households.  Consumers' ability to meet their own energy needs will increase energy consciousness and should underpin a broader shift in citizens' energy consumption and choices.  In line with the climate action plan and the rise in climate engagement, the CRU will work with the Department and relevant companies and agencies to ensure that microgeneration is facilitated in order that consumers can realise the benefits of more active engagement in the energy market.  Microgeneration has been accelerated for delivery in 2021 under the climate action plan.  The CRU recognises the importance of community-led renewable energy projects.  This has also been detailed in the Department's high-level design for the renewable electricity support scheme and in the Government's climate action plan.</p><p>In support of this, the CRU is developing proposals for the next round of connection policy, or ECP-2 as it is known in the industry, to facilitate the practical processing of connection offers for community-led renewable energy projects, as defined by the Department, by making up to 50% of non-batch connection offers available for such projects.  In order to further assist community-led renewable energy projects in the connection process, the CRU proposes that such projects do not require planning permission to have their application accepted by the system operators.  The process for this will be consulted upon shortly with a clear focus on both facilitating local projects and ensuring that there are appropriate levels of protection for such projects, as well as the wider energy consumer.  The SEAI leads on the area of smart finance for home retrofits under the climate action plan and the CRU will assess the potential for introducing pay-as-you-save via energy supplier bills in support of this work.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

I will start with two short questions for the CRU.  Dr. McGowan said that the smart metering programme will take five years to roll out.  I ask him to explain why it is going to take that length of time.  It will start this year but will not be completed until 2024.  What will be the initial benefits for the consumer in the context of climate action and reducing emissions?  What can the consumer expect in the initial phases?  On the roll out of financing measures, Dr. McGowan made reference to considering the potential for introducing a pay-as-you-save model through the energy suppliers, which was also referenced in this committee's report and in the all-of-Government action plan.  What is the timeline on this and how would it work in practice?  Is the CRU working with the SEAI on this?  I ask Dr. McGowan to explain how it might work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100200002#F00300"><p>I will not answer all of those questions myself but will pass some of them on to my colleagues.  The five-year timeline for smart metering is based on the fact that we will be installing meters in 2.2 million households.  Phase one is all about learning and understanding the best way to deploy the meters to ensure maximum take up.  Subsequent phases will see a significant ramp up in the volume of smart meters that will be rolled out.  The Chairman asked about the benefits of smart meters.  The original cost-benefit analysis for smart meters made it quite clear that initial savings would be identified by households both in terms of how much energy they consume and the amount they consume at peak times.  This benefits the consumers in terms of reduced electricity bills as well as a reduction in the amount of carbon emissions their energy consumption contributes towards.  It is also of benefit to the system in terms of reducing peak consumption.  We are confident that there are many more advantages and benefits to be accrued from the roll-out of smart meters.  Smart meters themselves are broadly cost neutral.  The overall cost of deploying smart meters is roughly equivalent to the benefits we have identified but there are many other benefits that we have not been able to quantify but which we are confident will derive from the roll-out of smart meters, not least enabling the deployment of microgeneration and the active participation of citizens in the energy market.  The benefits of that are very difficult to quantify but we see it as an integral part of the energy future.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Melvin to address the question on the pay-as-you-save model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Melvin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100200002#F00400"><p>The pay-as-you-save concept will be driven by the SEAI as the lead agency.  From our point of view, one of the key issues to be considered in that process is that customers will still be allowed to switch supplier even after making the initial investment.  The likely role for the CRU, as part of the project team, will be to ensure that it works in such a way as to ensure that consumers who make an investment through an individual supplier will not be trapped or locked in to that supplier for an extended period.  We will try to remove any barrier in the minds of consumers that might prevent them from engaging with the pay-as-you-save concept.  One of the key issues will be to try to ensure that the scheme can work and allow customers to change supplier over time.  We will try to ensure that this is not a barrier in the minds of consumers.  The first stage of that is to be delivered by 2021.  We will be an active participant in that work stream which will, in large part, be led by the SEAI.  Our focus will be on ensuring that there is not an actual barrier to consumers switching if they engage with this and also to ensure that there is no perceived barrier.</p> <p>  On smart metering, Eirgrid publishes the carbon intensity of the electricity on the grid every half hour, which is constantly changing.  Obviously, as the wind blows, the carbon intensity is lowered.  The price tends to be lower when the wind is blowing.  The carbon intensity tends to increase when the renewables are not there on the grid.  One of the key things that smart metering will do is allow people to see that when there is a high level of renewables on the grid, the price will tend to be lower.  This will allow people to benefit by shifting their consumption to those periods.  That is one of the key but very difficult to quantify benefits of smart metering.  Trials showed that Irish customers used 2.5% less electricity overall when smart meters were installed.  They also shifted around 8.8% of their consumption away from the peak.  We can quantify those two elements which were included in the cost-benefit analysis but it is really difficult for us to quantify the amount of carbon savings that would derive from this.  The half-hourly data will be visible and clear in the market.  If people install smart meters and have the half-hourly data shared with their supplier, they can really become what is know as "prosumers", and actively move their consumption to those periods.  All of that technology is out there and available and surveys we have conducted show that the normal, average Irish consumer is willing to engage in these kinds of behaviours.</p></speech>

Our main focus is to ensure that there is nothing in the scheme that would prevent an energy consumer from exercising his or her normal right to switch supplier.

I understand the necessity to have smart meters installed in order to be enable microgeneration to take place, so that the company charged with managing the grid knows what is available, when it is available, average demand and so on.  However, I have not heard an explanation as to why Mr. Fogarty's very simple request cannot be met.  In terms of scale, we are talking about a large-scale producer of electricity.  The community is not going to be using the electricity itself between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m and we do not know when it is going to be on grid.  It is a provider or producer that is coming into the marketplace.  The view circulating in the general ether was that community groups were not really together or in a position to get their funding in place but that does not wash any more.  These people have the where with all, the expertise and the experience and, more importantly, the capacity to get it done.  While I do not want to sound like somebody in another parliament, getting it done is what it is all about.  In our own constituencies and communities we see significant resistance to the big provider coming in from outside, even if that provider is Coillte or Bord na M&oacute;na.  People do not see the benefit and they certainly are no longer happy with engineers turning up and offering to give money to the local GAA club as the community gain.  The idea that they should accept such payments, get out of the way and let others get on with it is not going to work anymore.</p><p>The next wave of onshore wind will have to be in concert with and embedded in the community.  It will have to be owned and controlled by the community or there will have to be a far greater level of individual gain, rather than a broad-community, broad-brush approach.  There will have to be a deep retrofit for some homes close to the wind farms and there will have to be free electricity for them.  It will require a much greater level of engagement between the promoter and those who rightly feel they are affected.  The easiest way to address this is to establish why it takes the group in Templederry 12 years.  I have been involved in different community groups and one rarely sees the same people after 12 years.  If we want to get people to participate with the promise of a financial reward, 12 years is too long as many will have gone to meet their maker by the end of that period.  Does the CRU have the wherewithal in its legislative remit?  Does it need to tell us we need legislative change or enhanced powers?  Does it come under the remit of some other state entity or agency to demystify this Rubik's cube? </p></speech>

The timeline has to be greatly compressed and we have to get better at delivering a huge range of renewable energies if we are to achieve the targets we have mentioned by 2030 or 2050.</p> <p>  There are four key areas where we have a role to play and where we can make a direct impact.  The first is to deliver smart meters as a national programme.  We believe smart meters will facilitate a huge step change in participation in the energy market.  The second is to facilitate connections.  Until relatively recently, we had a large monolithic approach to connections in order to achieve the 2020 targets, called Gate 3.  The connection office took thousands of megawatts but then the gate closed and very little happened after that.  We have changed the process.</p></speech>

We need to be more agile as regulator and the industry needs to be more agile in terms of how it can deliver.  We are looking to deliver connections by having frequent batches.  Every 12 to 18 months a batch of connections is made available, with a number ring-fenced for community projects.  Large-scale generation may require planning permission and we are thinking of relaxing the requirement for community projects.  We are learning, and the first of our emerging connections policies, ECPs, ran to quite a few thousand megawatts.  The next one is being designed and will run next year and as soon as we have finished designing we will start work on the next one.  We will take feedback to learn continually what works.  I cannot give a guarantee that we will get the community energy projects absolutely right but we will certainly try to.  If we do not get it right we will learn, because another gate will be coming along very soon.</p></speech>

He is a man of huge reputation and he has moved policy by action on the ground.  It would be a major step in assisting us.  The CRU could then come back to tell us what we need to do on the legislative side to put it in place.</p></speech>

We have engaged in terms of filling in consultation forms with the regulator as much as we could over the past 15 years.  Some of the issues are with the regulator and some are with the network operator.  We applied for a small extension of capacity in 2007 and we should get that by 2020.  It will allow us to use the existing network to expand.</p> <p>  In March I spoke about something that was outside the regulator's control, that is, planning permission for rooftop solar panels.  It is still an issue and if one wants to put one on the local community hall outside the control of the regulator, one has to go and invest in the planning permission process.  It is by far the most restrictive planning policy.  We put a document on the record in March and we are still in the same place.  It involves one tiny line in a statutory instrument and I ask the committee members please to remove it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la sided with the lady from Limerick who appealed the requirement to take off the solar panels on her roof and won.  If I go to the regulator or the network to put 50 kW or 100 kW on the roof of a GAA hall, which could be done relatively cost-effectively, I require planning permission before I can ask how much it will cost for the grid connection.  I will not do it because I am not going to spend &euro;3,000 to find out that it will cost &euro;50,000 to connect my roof.  It is outside the regulator's control but is within the control of the Oireachtas.  It is a really easy change to make and we had a good discussion on the matter when Deputies visited Tipperary.</p></speech>

This process has gone on very long and there needs to be an answer as to why.  We are quite frustrated about it.  Did the Germans have smart metering before they started connecting residents and communities to the grid?  The late chief executive of South Dublin County Council mentioned smart metering seven years ago in the context of water meters.  We may have got to a different place in terms of water metering if the idea had been pursued.  This is an excuse for delay.  I am hearing nothing proactive from one side of the panel for how it is going to advance the project.</p> <p>  Who stopped Mr. Fogarty and his company?

However, we are just stuck.  Initially, we got three or four grid offers that were workable.  We put them in various communities.  We also got a few offers that were ludicrous.</p></speech>

That is one matter which needs to be addressed immediately.</p> <p>  For our four MW applications, we got a grid offer of &euro;2.9 million, another of &euro;1. 9 million and another of &euro;1. 3 million.  These were all out of the ballpark, were not viable and could not be done.  We got three grid offers that, when we come together with other communities around the country, we will be able to utilise.  That is where we are at.</p> <p>  We took a risk in trying to facilitate other communities.  The committee may not realise that there is a significant groundswell of communities which want to engage.  It would help if we got a small bit of assistance from the regulator in ring-fencing some of the grid.  The Minister made a recent announcement about the community pot in the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.  If the ring-fencing of grid were to go hand in hand with that, many community projects could get off the ground.  This would be a significant benefit to many communities.</p> <p>  We know about the frustration in the system and we know we are locked in it.  We have tried our best to highlight this and bring it forward.  There is goodwill in every direction.  The word &ldquo;action&rdquo; is an important part of the committee&rsquo;s title.  It can certainly address the legislation that is stopping this development.</p></speech>

That has put an obligation upon us and has facilitated us in the latest round of connection policies.  As Mr. Paul Kenny said, one of the considerations of ECP-2 is to remove the requirement for planning permission for community energy projects to ensure they can get a connection offer before they get planning permission.</p> <p>  A second element of that is to ring-fence 50% of the non-batched space for such projects.  A certain number of projects every year are available to network companies.  They have the space and resources to make a certain number of offers a year.  We have ring-fenced 50% of the non-batch element of that for community energy projects.  The choice of that 50% has been considered and chosen based on interactions with the Department and with other entities.  We are confident that this is the right size for what we understand to be the appetite for community energy projects.</p> <p>  We have met Mr. Kenny many times but perhaps we have not sat down together.  There was a call for a ring-fenced area for community projects.  That is part of our consideration.  There was also a call for the removal of planning permission for community projects before they can get a grid.  That is already part of our considerations for the next round.  We have an open-door policy.  Through the process of engagement, we have heard these concerns.  This is one of the matters we are looking to deal with and fix development under the legislation that obliges us to do so.</p></speech>

I agree.  However, it is easy to be when one is the only one in the class.  There were multiple agencies set up but only a few survive.  Can the Tipperary Energy Agency talk us through why it survived?  It is important if we want more of this model that we understand why the ones in the past did not survive.  If the Tipperary Energy Agency survived, why was that?</p></speech>

There were 16 in total.  Some operate currently as an energy manager in local authorities.  They were engineers seconded into what is now a company limited by guarantee, CLG, and back into the local authority.  The model the climate action plan calls for from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, looks for the local authority to take the role of a local energy agency.  That is why the other 13 failed.  It is a technical role.  It requires many entrepreneurial skills, a good business plan and people who want to deliver.  If it is a local authority engineer, it is more challenging.  If they have an opportunity to go for, they cannot recruit as it takes them a year.  They have a chain of command that limits the functionality.</p> <p>  Local energy agencies started as a European programme.  There are 400 of them around Europe.  The active ones are all relatively independent but still are governed by local authorities.  Our board is made up of the local authority.  They need to be on the ground and flexible, as well as being able to deliver for their communities.  If there is more demand, they can increase the number of engineers.  If there is less demand, they can decrease.  One needs to be able to deliver a service.</p></speech>

The biggest challenge we have with renewables is community participation and community acceptance.  One feeds into the other.</p><p>What is the cost to the taxpayer in terms of the public service obligation levy per megawatt coming from microgeneration compared with more commercial wind farms or other renewable energy projects?  How does the energy efficiency or carbon emission savings for the taxpayer from microgeneration compare with commercial wind farms and other renewable energy projects?</p></speech>

While there is a REFIT 3 scheme, which is a subsidy for the kilowatt hours produced for the larger wind farms there is no such scheme for larger solar farms.  There is no difference in cost because there is no subsidy for microgeneration.  There is, however, a capital grant for microgeneration available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  One aspect of microgeneration that is important and sometimes neglected is that if one consumes the energy from microgeneration in one's home, there are no transmission losses.  If energy from a solar farm in Wexford has to be transmitted to where other people live, there are losses as it is transferred across the country.  One of the benefits of microgeneration is that it is generated on a roof and used in a house and the householder can vary the demand in the house for the times when it is generated.  There is no subsidy.</p></speech>

I do not know the answer to that question.  There is no particular reason to believe there would be any difference between the carbon savings from a solar farm and microgeneration.  The real answer is that I do not know because there is no subsidy scheme for microgeneration or for solar power.  They should deliver the same carbon savings or possibly more if it is on a person's roof because they are using it locally.</p></speech>

However, if one is clever about the microgeneration subsidy and one only supports the export by a small sum, one will get all of the generation for a small sum and will subsidise only the spill.  If one generates 100 units, one only subsidises 20.  It is much cheaper than subsidising the 100 units.  There is no current plan, even in the climate plan, to subsidise anything.</p></speech>

We need all the generation we can get because we are going to electrify heat and transport.  If we do not do that, we will be in a much worse situation.  While that argument might be correct in Australia or might have been correct five years ago, it will not be correct in the next 15 years because we will all have electric cars and hopefully many of us will have heat pumps.  I have both in my house and I use 15,000 kWh, versus the average of approximately 4,000 kWh.  It will be a big change.</p></speech>

There should be a category for individual gain for those located closest to a wind farm or some other renewable energy project, such as scholarships or free or subsidised electricity.  There should be a recognition that while the community at large has accommodated it, there might be greater impact on the visual amenity for some people.  This has arisen particularly on the wind farm at Oweninny near Bellacorick, where the community accepted this wind farm provided there would be community gain.  I was present at the oral hearing.  There are, however, people in the immediate vicinity of the farm who ask why somebody 15 km away should get the same benefit as they do, when they must look at it.  I am aware that local authorities can do their own thing <i>ad hoc</i>but that is not robust enough.</p><p>If I missed something in the presentations it was because I was in the Seanad. </p></speech>

We are trying with the tools we have, such as the ability of the market to reward the generation, whether it comes from a large-scale offshore wind turbine or a community or a rooftop solar system, to have an impact.  We recognise the need for all types of energy from that variety of sources to be rewarded for their output.  We are also seeking to ensure that we can take connections of all those types through ensuring that the network companies are making connections available to all types of energy production whether large or small scale and finally through the delivery of the smart meters.  We have no direct role in community gain as part of the planning process and the level of community involvement in a planning application.  As an individual, and as an organisation, we recognise the role of community gain in ensuring that all aspects, including business, community and citizens, are involved in the transition but we have no direct role in determining whether that is part of the commercial basis for a scheme.</p></speech>

The problem with that is that the big developers are suggesting they share profit or that there are other systems for divvying it out.  There is no ownership for the community.  If a large-scale developer is building ten turbines, the community should own two of those.  The community could then borrow the money to develop those because they have complete ownership.</p><p>It is an asset in the community and it would be able to leverage more money on the strength of that.  It would make a major difference.  Currently, if a community is asked for a subscription of 20%, those people must put their hands in their own pockets.  No developers are putting their hands in their own pockets and they are using project finance to develop the other 80% of a project.  If there is a 20% share for a community, it should be owned by the community.  Networks have indicated there is a difficulty with metering in dividing it this way.</p></speech>

It is not currently prescribed and it is up to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to describe how that will be used.  I have seen that some of the large developers are working with their local communities to ring-fence 30% for what are called near neighbours.  It would be good practice.  Some of the better developers and the larger or State-owned developers are very much concerned with this and are trying their best to achieve this goal.

It ran into difficulty and on that occasion its representatives highlighted many difficulties in dealing with the commission.  I, along with the rest of the committee, hoped that on that occasion communication had begun to flow between the commission, the representatives of the plant and the committee.  We were assured the commission would accept a fresh application and that it would be dealt with expeditiously because the commission was familiar with the file.  I understand the Mayo power company applied a few weeks after that meeting and the application is ongoing.  To say that the applicant is frustrated is an understatement.</p> <p>  I am very disappointed.  I have spoken of this in the Seanad and I ask the witnesses today, in the interests of transparency, to make a statement on what is happening.  This committee was solely set up with the idea of achieving our climate action objectives and part of this relates to renewable electricity.  We are trying to displace Bord na M&oacute;na and peat burning and this is a high-efficiency combined heat and power biomass plant that fits the bill of helping us meet our targets.  We are asking private investors to fund these renewable electricity projects in every case, aside from State companies.  It is very hard to see how they can do business with the length of time it is taking the commission to deal such applications.  I say this while considering the commitments given to the committee by the witnesses on the previous appearance before the committee which have not been met.</p></speech>

Our planning permission ran out before we could get a delivery of turbines so we had to start again.  We eventually got planning after the process had been with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for two years and three months in 2009.  We set out to finance the project right when the financial collapse hit in 2011.  We met every possible obstacle that one could meet.  It was no harm and we managed to get around them.  It certainly was not easy.  In fairness, we lost six years of the project to Government agencies, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la and ESB Networks.</p></speech>

An individual offer is examined, taking in the route, reinforcements required at the point of connection to the existing grid and the cost of infrastructure to where the wind farm is, taking in distance and voltage.  The shortest route is normally the least costly route and it must be technically acceptable.  Taking in the impact of a piece of infrastructure or wind farm on the grid, some may require different amounts of equipment.  We have heard a number of different costs quoted and I do not want to comment on those other than to say the system operators, whether it is EirGrid or ESB Networks, are required to make what are called least cost technically acceptable offers.</p></speech>

I support Deputy Dooley's call for us to have witnesses from ESB Networks and the Department before the committee.  We are focused on trying to unlock potential and there is clearly potential for microgeneration and more projects like that run by the witnesses.  It is not just about large-scale operations and we all know we must try to get as much community buy-in and support as possible.  I know there are technical issues and I imagine larger scale projects are easier to get off the ground and there are other advantages to them.  I get that.  However, we should have many more community-owned and microgeneration projects.  I support the call to bring in representatives of ESB Networks and the Department.</p> <p>  I have a concern relating to smart metering.</p><p>I have been doing some research on it and when it was introduced in British Columbia in 2012, the number of winter disconnections rose from 4,000 per annum to 30,000.  The rule in the system in this State, whether it is written or unwritten, is that people are not disconnected in the winter months.  Given that this would be a more automated system, what protections would be put in place to ensure people would not be disconnected automatically?  In recent years we have had very cold spells and this is not an issue because of the written or unwritten rule.  I expect my colleagues would agree that the ESB will rarely disconnect somebody.  There would have to be a very good reason for it.  It certainly does not do it during the winter months.  Will the regulator address that concern and how it would work in practice?</p></speech>

Part of the code of practice is that one cannot disconnect customers during the winter for non-payment of bills, for example.  That is to ensure customers are protected at the most vulnerable time of the year when it is cold.</p> <p>  The smart metering programme is being rolled out on a phased basis and the ability to remotely disconnect and reconnect meters will become a reality, but the code of practice and the customer protections in place at present will endure.  They will not change just because a different meter is being operated on the system.  We would be vigilant that it should not be an issue.</p></speech>

I was busy elsewhere.  The project is brilliant.  It is unfortunate the witnesses are pioneers and it has taken so long, which is frustrating.  The committee has discussed this and has recommended that the one-stop-shops should be run by the local authorities.  However, given their experience, the witnesses are the experts.  Have the local authorities invited them in or would they consider imposing themselves on them to give them the best advice on what to do and not to do and the pitfalls, based on the 12 to 20 years they have been trying to get this project off the ground, to find ways that are a little more simple?  It is not to re-invent the wheel as they have already done that.  Have the local authorities across the country reached out to the witnesses to seek their expertise?  They are the pioneers, the only ones who have done it, and I congratulate them on that.</p> <p>  The witness referred to 30% of a wind farm owned by the community.  It would be similar to what we strive to achieve with social and affordable housing in each development, depending on its size.  Often developers can buy their way out of that so it might be helpful if that was enshrined in legislation.  Perhaps Mr. Fogarty and Mr. Kenny would respond about the local authorities, in particular.</p> <p>  Turning to the commission, I have some reservations with regard to smart metering.  If I am correct, it will be dependent on the mobile telephone networks to operate and swathes of rural Ireland have poor, if not no, mobile telephone coverage.  There is also the broadband deficit.  What are the implications of this for getting 100% of households to make the transition to smart meters?  In addition, cyber attacks may well be visited upon networks by nefarious individuals or groups.  Is that suggestion well founded or is it an urban myth?  What would be the cost of managing cyber security on the networks?</p></speech>

It has been brilliant.  The Tipperary Energy Agency has a big input with it.  As regards other committees or anything else, we have never been invited to anything or asked for our opinion on anything.  In many ways, we feel as if we are pariahs and that we fall between two stools.  The "No" campaign does not like us because it is afraid communities might wish to develop them and the large scale developers do not like us because they are afraid it might catch on and they would lose out.  Generally, we do not get invited anywhere.</p></speech>

On the local authorities issue, there are 31 local authorities.  A climate plan was delivered to them recently that contains a wide range of new supports or services they must provide.  They do not have any extra finance to support these.  Somebody carried out an analysis and found that it would take 300 extra staff to deliver what they are asked to do in the climate plan.  They do not have any revenue for that.  We have engaged, including yesterday, and will continue to engage over the next couple of months to try to present the opportunity of a local energy agency as a method of delivering local energy support.</p> <p>  The 20% community ownership is not enshrined in legislation.</p></speech>

However, if one takes the large Bord na M&oacute;na one in Oweninny that was mentioned or a very large Coillte one, it might be a &euro;200 million project, and 20% of that is &euro;40 million.  If the local community wishes to be a &euro;40 million shareholder it will have to leverage, which means it must have asset ownership.  The renewable electricity support scheme does not enshrine asset ownership.  If one does not have asset ownership one cannot borrow, if one cannot borrow one cannot leverage and if one cannot leverage the 20% is unachievable.  It is only achievable if it is split ownership, which requires a number of things to change, including the grid code.  What we will see is the large wind farms with 2%, 1% or 0.5%, perhaps, because that is the equity ownership the local communities can deliver.  It is important that there is a change there.</p></speech>

It has a wider coverage area than 4G.  In addition, the meter will record what happens.  If one is in an area with bad 2G coverage the meter will record the information every half hour.  The communications piece is whether it uploads it every day.  It is not that one will not necessarily have the ability to measure one's consumption every half hour, but how regularly the information is transferred back to ESB Networks' IT system and on to the person's supplier.  Some of the benefits will still be available even if one is in an area without good coverage.</p> <p>  The cyber attacks piece is a significant part of the technical requirements that all of the entities across Europe that are rolling out smart meters must take seriously.  I do not have the costs amount associated with that, but it is a significant part of the system design.  It is cyber secure by design in the same way privacy is protected by design.  It is a significant part of the roll-outs of smart metering across Europe.  It is a serious issue and it is one of all the costs involved in rolling this out properly.</p></speech>

One of the committee's first actions was to visit Tipperary and it was a very useful tutorial for us.  Speaking for myself, I was largely ignorant of the work that was being done by the Tipperary Energy Agency and we certainly learned a great deal from that visit.</p><p>I am not sure how long ago that was, but if we are to be honest it would appear that little or no progress in furthering the agenda has been made in that time.  Having said that, we have an opportunity, through this interaction with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, to ensure that when it develops proposals for the next round of connection policy on its electricity connection policy, ECP-2, to quote the witness, it engages formally or informally with the Tipperary Energy Agency to benefit from the insights of the Tipperary Energy Agency and its constituent parts.  One cannot design community-led energy projects without talking to the Tipperary Energy Agency.  That is self-evident and quite obvious from our interaction so far.  </p><p> I am very much taken with the approach of the Tipperary Energy Agency.  I would describe it as democratising energy supply.  It provides a mechanism by which communities, particularly rural dwellers, can feel they have a stake in providing energy.  Regarding wind energy, for instance, an opaque community dividend that the big players mete out to individual communities can be intangible for many individual households.  They do not necessarily see the benefit of it.  Instead of that, this model means that people are part-owners of the turbines they see going up.  That is something they have a stake in.  Starting from that premise, we have to work back and devise a model that ensures democratisation of energy supply.  That is an opening remark. </p><p> The climate action plan is now very clear on microgeneration policy.  If I can walk away from today's meeting with a commitment from the stakeholders to engage with each other, the committee will have done a good day's work.  Other speakers have already made that point.  Our committee recommendations were very clear on the solar and photovoltaic element.  If I recall correctly, we wanted to see progress on ensuring that farms or individuals could use solar power by March 2020, with the relevant statutory instrument amended to overcome that hurdle.  I am surprised to hear that this process has not been expedited.  That is something that we as a committee could take up directly with the Minister, perhaps through the Chair.  The Chairman may already be engaging with the Minister on that issue.  Achieving that could provide the Trojan horse that is necessary for farms in particular, which can accommodate bigger solar arrays because of barns, outbuildings and so forth, to realise this potential.  I suggest the committee write to the relevant line Minister to see where that stands.  The Chair may have a view on it. </p></speech>

Regarding smart metering, Deputy Eamon Ryan gave me my very first smart meter in 2008, when he rolled out the pilot scheme as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The smart meter is now in a box somewhere in my attic.  We have been talking about smart metering in this country for well over ten years.  I welcome the move by ESB Networks, but I wonder if we could learn a little more about where the pilot scheme stands.  I do not mean that the witnesses must report back now.  It would be useful if we could have a further engagement with ESB Networks.  Bandon and Portlaoise are the two towns involved.  If we are talking about behavioural change, which is ultimately what this committee is all about, I would hope for ambition for a greater roll-out on the part of ESB Networks and the regulator.</p></speech>

Bandon and Portlaoise just happen to be the two towns where this is starting.  Some 250,000 meters will be installed in the first phase, which runs up to the end of next year.  In the new year, the installation people will move into Cork and Dublin, in and around the N11.  Later next year, they will be active north of that line, that is, across the whole country.  The second phase will see the next 1 million meters installed before the end of 2022.  The final 1 million meters will go in by the end of 2024.  It is a very significant piece of work.  The only reason we mention those towns is that those installations started in September.  Around 2,000 of them have been installed now.  The smart services, which offer the ability to utilise them, will be activated on 1 January 2021.  People will start to get the benefits then.</p></speech>

It would need to be between 12 cent and 15 cent, and it could not be greater than the retail price.

Why have none of them come together and put solar panels on a couple of hundred roofs?  There may be examples that Mr. Melvin can outline.  The examples of the Aran Islands and County Tipperary are often cited but are there other examples where something is happening?  I refer in particular to the application of solar power, which is suited to local community initiatives.</p></speech>

As for why it is not happening, the grid, about which the other guests spoke, was doubtless an issue in this regard, although we are considering changing the policy.  There are also elements of generation in a geographic space and members of the community surrounding the space selling to one another.  That concept has grown recently throughout Europe and is included in the clean energy package.  The move may be more advanced in other parts of Europe but the concept was not very common outside the islands as recently as five years ago.  There will be a programme of work over the next two years under the clean energy package to examine the barriers that have prevented it from happening.  I do not yet know what the barriers are but the grid was definitely one.</p></speech>

In Ranelagh, which is in my constituency, what would prevent me from approaching 200 or 300 households and saying we should all take the initiative together?  It would be much cheaper to buy 2,000 panels than a small number and one builder could do the whole job in order that the price would decrease.  That is just an example and we could also sell the energy to one another.  Why has that not happened in the case of one of the 200 or 300 communities?  What would prevent me from doing that tomorrow if I were to give up my day job?</p></speech>

There is a requirement to meet a certain level of standards.  When providing for a community and sharing the electricity we all generate with one another, the generation must be tied in and linked to the supplier, as must the customers, and the suppliers have to be able to leave the co-operative if they so wish.  They are probably the barriers that have prevented it from happening.</p></speech>

Surely regulators have thought for a long time about flipping the entire business model in order that the utilities' job is not to sell electricity but rather to minimise it and help customers achieve that in whatever way.  Have we put much thought into that?  I acknowledge that it is difficult because in the commercial world, one must be paid for something.  Have we considered flipping the business model for energy utilities in order that their performance, reward and return on capital are contingent on selling less, as a way of breaking their apparent ability to put a stranglehold on some developments?</p></speech>

There is now an independent system operator whose role is to forecast the need for energy rather than build energy demand, and to design a system to deliver that.  Our role is to try to design a market that will ensure that the energy produced is cost reflective.  Twenty years ago, when we were established, the cost of energy was not cost reflective.  That has changed but I agree with the Deputy that an awful lot more has to change between now and 2050.  We will have to change much of the model.  I might not have addressed the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

As we have discussed elsewhere, I believe that the CRU's role needs to change to one where cost minimisation is not a sufficient indicator of success.  Success is about decarbonising and minimising use.</p></speech>

There is an important distinction.  We do not take steps just because they are cheap but instead seek solutions.  We do so on behalf of the consumer because, ultimately, consumers pay all the costs, and we seek the lowest cost pathway in that regard.</p> <p>  We also recognise the role of communities and of microgeneration tariffs.  While they will add cost, we recognise they are part of the broader transition, that is, the idea that everyone has to be on board with the transition, although costs are associated with that.  It is not that we refuse to allow costs.  We recognise we need to be more agile and to think differently.  Part of that concerns what the mix will look like and what is the lowest cost at which we can deliver it.</p></speech>

I understand the concerns.  As we seek to build credibility and public support for sustainable energy measures, it is important to conduct community and environmental impact assessments.  We can help social and environmental impact assessments to be successful by ensuring community engagement and ownership are part and parcel of community-led projects.  I will look for a comment on this, but I accept that it is a much clearer proposition to look for these assessments after having a grid offer.  It is very difficult to look for planning permission prior to knowing whether access to the grid will be provided, especially when such costs are involved.  It seems that a grid offer is a fundamental sticking point.  In that regard, I note that Mr. Fogarty mentioned three different 4 MW offers that came with completely different prices.  I think the prices in question were &euro;2.9 million, &euro;1.9 million and &euro;1.3 million.  He mentioned that somewhat more acceptable offers were made when bids were combined.  Was he referring to combined bids of the same community schemes?</p> <p>  I have a related question for the regulators.  I am seeking to build on what Deputy Eamon Ryan was saying.  I am concerned about two things, the first of which is the larger sets of offers which have been referred to as the large gate.  What has it done for the timing and predictability of small-scale community initiatives?  Is there the potential to introduce something that looks more like a predictable and consistent rolling mechanism for grid offers on particular scales?  Rather than having to enter a giant competitive tendering mechanism without having any idea what will happen, communities should be able to make plans in the knowledge that a certain grid offer is likely to be made.  </p> <p>  The second thing about which I am concerned is the consistent reference to the concept of the least cost technically acceptable offer.  We know that this is not reflected in European procurement legislation which has consistently moved away from a lowest cost focus.  While environmental and other factors may be included in the technical specifications, there is also the capacity for quality criteria to be reflected in the awarding mechanisms as part of the most economically advantageous approach to tendering and procurement.  It is not simply in the specifications.  I appreciate that a number of contracts are reserved and ring-fenced.  We must look to place a stronger value on things like community involvement, sustainability and how it fits into other Government plans.  </p> <p>  I ask the delegates to respond to the points I have made before I come back in on a different issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fogarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100200002#O00200"><p>On the grid, we have combined with four or five communities throughout the country.  We have tried to spread a number of grid applications to match them.  Previous speakers have described how it depends on whether the local power station needs to be upgraded.  If a 4 MW project tips the balance to the extent that a bigger transformer needs to be put provided, all of the costs will be loaded onto us.  This could be avoided in the case of community applications.  If wind energy is being supplied to the power station, wind and solar power generally do not reach a peak at the same time.  If it is windy, it is more than likely that the level of energy from the sun is fairly low and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is a misnomer to think the grid needs to be upgraded by 4 MW of solar energy if there is already enough wind energy in the system.  A lot of things could be worked to the advantage of community applications.  I think they could be considered in tandem with large-scale applications.</p></speech>

When I was speaking about planning permission, I was referring to rooftop solar panels.  A person living in Germany, Britain or Northern Ireland can install solar panels on his or her roof without having to seek planning permission.  The authorities in these jurisdictions have decided that solar panels do not affect the character of buildings, other than heritage buildings.  The paper we submitted to the committee in March was written by two planning experts.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision that certain developments were exempt was in agreement with the paper.  Under an exempted development statutory instrument introduced in John Gormley's time as Minister which had been designed for solar thermal systems, panels to a certain number of square metres are allowed.  If we change the number in the statutory instrument, we will remove completely a significant barrier to rooftop solar panels.  We have been campaigning on this issue for many years.  It is extremely frustrating, given that people everywhere else in Europe do not have to spend money in this way.  Local authority planners will ask why they should waste &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 worth of a planner's time in the assessment of a planning application when all that is involved is the installation of solar panels on the roof.</p></speech>

It should be done properly and to a very high standard.  One of the big issues is that even though draft wind energy guidelines have been in place since 2014 or 2015, the guidelines have not been launched.  This creates a great amount of uncertainty for communities and normal developers.  I think most of the executives and civil servants are quite frustrated at the political failure to launch the planning guidelines.</p></speech>

I might put some brief questions to Dr. McGowan and his colleagues because they will not have much time in which to respond.  I will begin with a specific question.  </p> <p>  Is the regulator concerned about grid offers?  Is there a point of expiration in a planning process that follows the grid offer?  It is a technical question.  </p> <p>  I have some other issues and concerns that I would like to put to the regulator.  One of the concerns mentioned about smart metering relates to the threat of disconnection.  Approximately ten years ago it was the practice of the ESB to have a buffer reserve fund to cover cases of non-payment.  I think the regulators at the time required the ESB to get rid of the non-payment fund to facilitate competition.  I accept that there is a code of practice.  On a practical level, might it be necessary to ensure all operators have some buffer fund to cover cases of non-payment, especially as we move towards smart metering?  It was pulled away from some years ago, but it might need to be reintroduced.</p></speech>

We have moved away from very large gates.  Our enduring connection policy now involves smaller batches of connection offers which can be run on a regular basis.  Through it, we can adjust the batch to meet various policy goals as they emerge under the renewable energy support scheme or other policy goals.  The idea is that it be a rolling system.  I hope that addresses the Senator's first question.  </p> <p>  Mr. Melvin will answer the questions about the least cost technically acceptable offer and smart metering.</p></speech>

It has been designed to reassure developers that the offer received from the transmission system operator or the distribution system operator involves the lowest cost, the shortest route, the smallest technically acceptable wires and the smallest technically acceptable transformers.  It is obvious that the quality requirements which are set by international standards for equipment like this have to be met, as do the health and safety and environmental requirements.  The concept has been designed to reassure developers that when they get the cost which they may consider too high for their project to bear, the cheapest way to get from this point to that point has been calculated.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about disconnections.</p><p>Where a customer is in debt to an energy supplier, the codes of practice oblige the supplier to offer a payment plan to that customer.  My colleagues will correct me if I get any of this wrong.  That payment plan will involve the continued supply of electricity or gas while part payments are made under it to pay off the debt.  There is a high rate of adherence to payment plans by customers and the rate of disconnections has decreased significantly since some of the policy changes were implemented.  Another option for consumers is to move to prepayment meters whereby they can ensure for themselves that they do not get into debt.  There are a lot of policies in place to protect consumers who have been in debt or fear they may get into it and, as my colleague mentioned, there is, in essence, a moratorium on disconnection during the winter months.</p></speech>

"Up to 50%" is a fluid notion.  What is envisaged in that regard?  I refer to Mr. Kenny and Mr. Fogarty.  They have a great deal of equity in community projects.  While members of a community wishing to exit is not as much of a concern in relation to community projects, we have seen in the United States that where there are a number of individuals selling their rooftops into a combined offer, there have been some exploitative practices by companies tying people into contracts.  What do the witnesses regard as good practice with regard to an individual whose rooftop is involved in a project and who seeks to exit?  It is not an issue yet but it is one that is coming.</p></speech>

Of those 30, 15 will be set aside for communities.  As I said earlier, the whole idea around batch processing is that we learn from it.  We determine whether they were all used or if demand was greater than supply.  As there will be another batch in 12 to 18 months, we can design it to take account of our experience on the previous batch and to determine the policy under the RESS and what the RESS seeks to support.  The idea is that there is flexibility in the batch process to take account of what we learn and address the policy as it emerges.</p></speech>

If my questions have been answered already, I ask the Chairman to tell me and I will look up the answers in the transcript.  Dr. McGowan has partly answered one just now, but for clarification, when does the CRU envisage that the first RESS auction will be held?  Will a community pot definitely be included?  If so, how will community projects be prioritised or catered to in grid connection?</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Fogarty.  I refer to the Government's action plan on climate change.  Is the Government covering some of the areas that require to be overcome within that action plan or does more need to be done?  More important, what would Mr. Fogarty like our committee to do to facilitate or assist with getting things done on the community side?</p></speech>

It is led by the Department.  The high level design is for it to be led by a community pot and that will be developed.  There was an industry engagement three Fridays ago on this.  We are prioritising very differently from the way we did in the past with regard to community energy projects and grid connections.  We are considering this and there will be a consultation on it.  The idea is that no planning will be required and, as Dr. McGowan said, 50% of the non-batch will be available to them.  There is only one site at the moment and we understand 15 will be a sizeable and useful number in the context of those we understand might be out there.</p></speech>

It is very welcome to hear the number "15".  That is a good idea.  The climate plan is comprehensive and it is great to see it all down with a wish list of what we need to do.  There are 186 actions with many sub-actions but there are not staff and capacity to deliver that plan.  I, and people like me in other organisations, do not have confidence that the climate plan will be delivered in a timely fashion because there are not enough people in the Department to do it.  There is insufficient vision to deliver it and there is insufficient coherence on the delivery of the climate plan.  While a significant and robust plan is there, on which the Minister must be commended, it will take 20 years to deliver given the current capacity of the Civil Service.</p> <p>  During the discussion, one tiny point was missed.  The community benefit funds are not currently exempt from taxation.  When we talk about someone being impacted by a turbine, they will, right now, lose a great deal of that to the tax system.  The committee might consider whether it would be useful to figure out methods on the &euro;2 per MW hour and that community benefit fund at local level.  If it is applied to someone's electricity bill, he or she will have to pay 50% if he or she is an earner at over &euro;35,000.  It is a real issue for developers and those who want to see a benefit fund that they will lose most of it to the tax system.</p></speech>

It is working and delivering and it deserves a round of applause for that.  However, the scheme is limited because of the planning permission issue, which I will not get back into now.  The community power launch date is dependent on when the community pot becomes available.  We are dependent on the Department and the regulator for that.</p></speech>

This is important as it causes serious problems for the broadcasting and editorial staff.</p> <p>  I warmly welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, and her officials.  The members will wish to work with the Minister of State today in that she must leave the meeting before 2.50 p.m.  It is no disrespect to the committee but is due to travel arrangements for the rest of the day.  I guaranteed her officials that they will be out of the room at that time so we will condense our questions to accommodate her.</p> <p>  I welcome the distinguished visitors in the Public Gallery.  I offer a special warm welcome to my old friend, Mr. Paul Walsh, from the British Embassy.  The attendance of the British Ambassador today denotes the significance of what is happening with Brexit and related matters.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is before the committee for one of our regular engagements.  She will update us on Brexit preparations as well as other issues being considered at the General Affairs Council, which include the ongoing negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, discussions on the rule of law and preparations for the next European Council meeting which will be held on 17 October.  Clearly, a great deal is happening at present.  It is only four weeks to the Brexit deadline and the situation remains uncertain.  It is important that we are as prepared as we can be for all outcomes and eventualities.</p> <p>  While Brexit remains our greatest concern, life goes on and there are other important issues to be considered.  The hearings for the European Commissioners-designate are taking place in the European Parliament this week.  The new European Commission should be up and running in a month, with a new vision and new priorities for Europe.  We certainly saw last week that the new European Parliament is developing its priorities and that MEPs have found their feet.  Our MEPs are performing well in their new roles.</p> <p>  I would normally read out the usual reminders about the rules of privilege but as the Minister of State is familiar with them I just remind everybody of their application.  I invite the Minister of State to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019100200002#A00300"><p>I thank the members for their assistance with the time challenges today.  I will try to be as brief as possible but I will be back before the committee again so if there is something we do not cover we will have an opportunity to do so again.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to address it and to outline what will be on the agenda of the General Affairs Council as well as where we currently stand with Brexit.  I will attend the General Affairs Council on 16 October in Luxembourg.  The agenda will include preparation for the European Council meeting on 17 October.  That includes the enlargement process in respect of Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia.  At the European Council leaders will discuss a range of issues, including the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the new EU institutional cycle.  With your permission, Chairman, I propose to first brief the committee on the work of the General Affairs Council, GAC, and then give an update on the preparations for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.</p> <p>  Over the summer, the Presidency sent a questionnaire to member states to determine their positions on a number of issues in the MFF negotiations.  This was followed by one-on-one bilateral meetings with each member state to discuss their key priorities.  Ireland&rsquo;s meeting was held on 2 September between myself and the Finnish Minister for European Affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen.  Our discussion focused on Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities, particularly the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the proposed cuts which we oppose, and the overall level of the MFF.  At the General Affairs Council on 16 September, the Minister said that these meetings had been helpful in determining the political perspectives on the negotiations.  The Presidency will use that to help prepare a paper to steer the discussions at the European Council meeting in October.</p> <p>  The Finnish Presidency also updated Ministers at the September GAC on its recent work on the MFF and set out its plans for the next steps.  In my intervention, I said Ireland's first priority was the CAP and preserving the overall CAP payment.  I shared concerns, however, that Brexit may overshadow the overall discussion on other issues at the European Council.  I noted that it was important that leaders give a clear direction regarding the overall size of the EU budget and that we must ensure the MFF is adequately resourced to deliver on our priorities.  While there are some who believe a smaller European Union should mean a smaller budget, we believe that with newer and emerging priorities as well as the important traditional priorities we must ensure it is adequately funded.  We have always said that we are willing to pay more in that regard.</p> <p>  At this month&rsquo;s European Council, leaders will also discuss implementation of the next strategic agenda.  Adopted in June, the agenda will guide the EU&rsquo;s work for the next five years.  The European Council will monitor the implementation of the priorities and give further political direction, as necessary.  We will work with fellow member states as well as the new Commission and the European Parliament to ensure the agenda is successfully implemented.  Given the massive amount of contact and engagement we have had with citizens and the work this committee has done over the past year and a half, it is important citizens can see that their interventions and communications with the Government have been reflected in the agenda and that they are clearly followed through and implemented.  In addition, leaders will be updated on the appointment of the next Commission.  In that regard, I congratulate our Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, who was officially appointed Commissioner for Trade yesterday.  Following hearings for all Commissioners-designate, the Parliament will vote on the Commission as a whole later this month.  If approved, the new Commission will begin its term on 1 November.  Christine Lagarde will also be formally confirmed as the next European Central Bank, ECB, president at the European Council.</p> <p>  Regarding enlargement, the forthcoming GAC will discuss whether to open EU accession negotiations with the Republic of North Macedonia and Albania.  Ireland fully agreed with the European Commission reports in May which judged that both countries had made significant progress on the requested reforms and that EU accession negotiations should be opened this year.  I visited North Macedonia and Albania earlier in the year and it was clear in my engagement, not just at political level but at many other levels, that progress has been made.  North Macedonia has made great strides on its reform agenda and demonstrated particular political courage in signing and implementing the Prespa agreement.</p><p>The situation in Albania is more complex but it is clear that significant progress has been made across many of the chapters in the past year, in particular the comprehensive justice reforms are a significant achievement.<br/><br/>Ireland supports the opening EU accession negotiations with both countries.  It is our strong preference that they would both advance together.  In order to maintain credibility in the region, it is up to us to maintain and follow through on our commitments and reward the candidate countries for the reforms that they have already undertaken.<br/><br/>In terms of the rule of law, an issue which has been discussed for some time, the issues that have arisen in a number of EU member states regard the failure to comply fully with the Union's fundamental values, which is deeply concerning.  We will continue to work with the EU institutions and member states to resolve the challenges currently faced through constructive dialogue and to prevent such challenges from emerging in the future.  The September General Affairs Council discussed a number of rule of law issues.  The Ministers had a general discussion on how we can strengthen rule of law in the Union, prompted by the European Commission's communication last July.  A formal hearing on the rule of law under Article 7 also took place at the September meeting to consider the situation in Hungary, which is the first such meeting to take place.  In addition, the Commission briefed Ministers on the ongoing state of play regarding the rule of law in Poland.<br/><br/>On Brexit, which is an issue that the Chairman wanted this meeting to focus mainly on, the next General Affairs Council will provide an important opportunity to re-affirm our priorities with my EU 27 but, most importantly, the need for a solution that addresses the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  The EU&rsquo;s solidarity and understanding remains absolutely resolute as re-affirmed by Michel Barnier when he met the T&aacute;naiste in Brussels last Friday.  It is heartening to know that we face the Brexit challenge with all of the stability and solidarity of our EU membership and what it brings.<br/><br/>Given the current political uncertainty in London, the risk of a no-deal Brexit remains significant.  Ireland and our EU partners stand by the withdrawal agreement and still see it as the best way and best mechanism to achieve an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  However, we are committed to finding a way forward.  The EU is open to considering any credible, fully worked-out proposals put forward by the UK so long as they achieve the same outcome as the backstop.  While the UK has provided the Commission with four technical non-papers, these do not constitute formal proposals or amount to legally operational solutions.  As the Taoiseach stated after his meeting with Prime Minister Johnson in New York, there remains a serious and significant gap between what the UK is putting forward as possible solutions and what the EU can accept.  Irrespective and despite what we have heard in recent days, that position has not changed.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, the Government's continued preparations for Brexit have the highest priority.  We have always been clear that a no-deal Brexit would result in absolute disruption and severe negative economic impacts across this island.  We are, however, continuing to actively prepare.  This planning incudes engagement at EU level, responses by Government and actions by business and individual citizens.  These measures, I believe, are working.  We have held more than 1,200 stakeholder preparedness events that covered sectors ranging from construction to tourism and issues ranging from customs requirements to currency fluctuations.  These events are guided by advice from Departments, Government agencies, county councils and individual sectors.  More than &euro;70 million in support funds is available through Enterprise Ireland alone, which is just one support mechanism.  I encourage the business sector to access the funding that is available to them.<br/><br/>Continuing the approach of Budgets 2017 to 2019, Budget 2020, that Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will announce next week, will look to support the sectors most exposed.  As one of the UK's closest trading and business partners, Brexit will mean change for all Irish businesses regardless of location, size or sector.  It is vital that exposed businesses, in particular, prepare for no-deal.  The Government's campaign entitled Getting Your Business Brexit Ready - Practical Steps focuses on the nine steps that every business, whether it is large or small, should take now to help it prepare for Brexit.  Since 16 September, local enterprise offices have begun weekly slots on a number of local radio stations nationwide, providing information on getting businesses ready for Brexit.  Many businesses have already taken the necessary steps but I urge those that have not to do so as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I shall now discuss the landbridge, which is a huge concern given our status as an island but also because we export 90% of what we produce.  Given the importance of the landbridge as a trade route for our businesses and economy, the Government has been working to ensure that transiting, via the landbridge, remains as efficient as possible in all Brexit scenarios.  These efforts are both domestic, in terms of new infrastructure and processes in place in our ports, and international.  In particular, we have begun engaging with our colleagues in the Commission, in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, to mitigate as much as possible the effects on goods transiting via the landbridge.  There was a shared recognition of the strategic importance of the UK landbridge as a transit route for all our economies.<br/><br/>Let us be clear, the landbridge after Brexit will not replicate the <i>status quo</i>for operators.  It will very much depend on traders being compliant with the new requirements.  Detailed advice on this is available on the Government's Brexit website, which I strongly urge people to consult.<br/><br/>Targeted information campaigns are under way to ensure that operators are aware of the steps that they must take and the supports available to them.  As noted in the July 2019 contingency action plan update, operators should be prepared for delays at UK ports in general, and at the port of Dover in particular, given the general disruption that a no-deal Brexit would cause and given the clear understanding that we cannot expect Irish hauliers to be given special or preferential treatment over other European hauliers or, indeed, hauliers from the UK.<br/><br/>The Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario, which is a serious question that is being raised, would result in far reaching change on the island of Ireland and risks for Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement are significant.  This is not something to be taken lightly and is certainly not something that we are taking lightly.<br/><br/>The Government continues to work closely with the Commission to meet the shared twin objectives of avoiding a hard border and protecting the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  This work involves us looking at necessary checks to preserve Ireland's full participation in the Single Market and the customs union.  Any arrangements in a no-deal scenario would be sub-optimal to the backstop and have profound implications for North-South trade, including through the impact of tariffs, checks, additional costs and administrative burdens.  I believe it would have an impact on the co-operation that has evolved North and South since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  To avoid the emergence of a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation is essential deal or no-deal.  In the event of a no-deal it will be a prerequisite to any negotiations on a future agreement between the EU and the UK.  The Commission has been very clear in saying that in the event of a no-deal in order for negotiations to re-engage financial settlements, citizens' rights, the Irish Border and the Irish protocol will be back on the table.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that Ireland is working on preparedness and contingency planning as a committed member of the EU 27 with the full support of the European Commission and other member states.  Many of the actions aimed at mitigating the effects of Brexit are also being taken at an EU level as they involve sectors regulated by EU law.  The EU has put in place contingency measures in a range of sectors of particular importance to us such as aviation, finance and road transport.  The EU has published some 80 preparedness notices, providing guidance for businesses and citizens.  We welcome the Commission's proposal to extend financial supports, should there be a no-deal Brexit, by making the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund available to support Member States and affected workers.  We are engaging with the Commission and other member states on the proposed scope and details of the measure.  We have been assured, in the event of a no-deal, that further financial supports would be provided, not just for us but other member states negatively impacted.<br/><br/>Brexit presents an unprecedented challenge to Ireland.  It is only by working with the Government, business and citizens together and with our EU partners that we can aim to mitigate, as much as possible, the implications of a no-deal and ensure that we are as prepared as we can be for the changes it will bring.  However, we cannot understand and know all of the potential challenges that may arise.<br/><br/>I am happy to take any questions that the Committee members may have.  Again, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address the committee today.</p></speech>

I join with her in congratulating Commissioner Hogan on his hearings on Monday and his success.</p> <p>  I believe that we have not reached the eleventh hour just yet and, therefore, we should not upset ourselves.  I am not saying that the Minister of State has done so and she has been very factual.  We have had papers or non-papers and so on.  A lot of what we are hearing on this side may rely on leaks but she may have more information than some of us have about the papers.  I wonder if they are not somewhat of an opening or ongoing gambit on the part of the British Prime Minister.  We must remember that he is playing to his own audience in Manchester, as we know at the moment.  As the Minister of State has stated, our protection of the backstop and the Good Friday Agreement is rock solid, which of course we all welcome.</p><p>Is the British Prime Minister running down the clock, so to speak?  He has said he will obey the law, and there is the Benn Act, so will we reach a stage where he will seek an extension from Brussels?  Britain, as much as Ireland, needs to get into that transition period of two years or however long it will take to work out a full and proper trade agreement.  We all hope that common sense will prevail and that discussions will continue to take place.  We have to travel in hope rather than despair but I fully accept everything the Minister of State said about the preparedness and the preparations being put in place for a no-deal Brexit.  We have to be ready for that if it happens but given the state of the British Parliament and what it has decided already, and the Benn Act, I cannot see it happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019100200002#C00200"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  To follow on from that, Brexit is overshadowing everything.  I listened to the Minister of State's remarks and there is probably very little in them with which I would disagree but I have a different view from that of my colleague on my left.  I am alarmed by what is contained in the non-papers.  That we would have a buffer zone on both sides of the Border is extremely worrying.  It is clear to me that people in the British Government are not listening to many of us in Ireland.  I do not get the sense that they understand Ireland and the challenges we face, particularly in the Border areas.  I do not believe they know much about the history of that area, that it is a contested area and that we have a peace process that very much needs to be nurtured.  We have this ludicrous suggestion in one of the non-papers that was put forward but my worry is that they are not listening.  They have not been listening up to now.  I share the view that they are running down the clock and what we are facing into as a result of that.  It will be a disaster for Ireland but it will also be a disaster for the people in Britain.  The worry is that this is more about the next election rather than trying to get a deal with the EU and Ireland.</p> <p>  In terms of what we can do, the Minister of State said that this was part of the discussions, and possibly a no-deal Brexit.  Does she see any weakening on the part of any of the countries in the European Union?  There was some suggestion that the British Government would try to put pressure on some countries to opt out of this process.  Does the Minister of State believe those countries understand Ireland?  Do they realise the challenges we are facing?  Is there any talk of relaxation of fiscal rules?  If they accept that a no-deal Brexit will be a disaster, what flexibility will they show Ireland in the future?  Are those practical issues being discussed?  I do not have a disagreement with the Minister of State.  If there is disagreement from the Opposition it is on the question of preparation.  Do they understand that in Europe?  Are we asking our European partners for A, B and C in terms of trying to mitigate against a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019100200002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her and her ministerial colleagues for the work they have done at European level and in the context of Brexit.  In particular, I congratulate Commissioner Phil Hogan on his continuation in what will be an important and challenging role for the next five years.  This Commission and European Parliament will experience more challenges than have ever faced Europe since the formation of the European Union.  We wish them well because that is what will be required.</p> <p>  I refer to the necessity for continued support for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, on the basis that our agrifood sector is as important to us as engineering and motor manufacturing sectors are to other countries in that it is indigenous and self-sufficient.  As there is minimum importation and maximum exportation related to it is crucial to our economy.</p> <p>  We congratulate and support the Minister of State on the enlargement process as it currently stands.</p> <p>  Regarding Brexit, we have to acknowledge the support from all political parties and none in this country.  They recognise the importance of Brexit from an Irish perspective and we have to congratulate them on that.  We must acknowledge the tremendous work of the European Commission, in particular the negotiators, and recognise the time, energy and diplomacy invested in the issue by our colleagues in Europe.</p> <p>  My view on Brexit is so far, so good but I am not optimistic.  I am concerned for this reason.  From the outset, the Good Friday Agreement was seen as a crucial element that could not be interfered with in any way in the future simply because of the tragic experiences we had in this island of Ireland for many years.  The agreement was reached after a long, drawn-out process that many of us thought would never come to a conclusion.  For anybody to suggest interfering with that or weakening it is sad.</p> <p>  Another issue worries me slightly.  How stands international agreement from now on?  To what extent do we honour international agreements?  Presumably, we honour them in letter and in spirit.  If we deviate from that, there is no sense in having international agreements or agreements that are entered into by governments on behalf of the people.  What happens if somebody comes along and says, "By the way, all of that is changed as of now"?.</p> <p>  The island of Ireland as an economic entity remaining within the customs union and the Single Market would be the best outcome for Brexit if there was to be a better outcome.  I implore all involved to stick to that.</p> <p>  I am amazed by the suggestion about a border.  Those of us on both sides of this island love talking about a border and that we do not want a border but the suggestion recently is that we should have two or three borders.  Presumably, the negotiating tactic would be that one or other of those borders might be removed as a means of enticing agreement.</p> <p>  This is a particularly challenging and difficult time and much will remain to be dealt with in a year's time.  It is not something that will go away overnight or in a discussion between now and Christmas.  This is a serious issue for the island of Ireland and the European Union and it is very serious, and this has not been debated adequately, for the United Kingdom.  It is not in the interest of this country to have the United Kingdom in a disadvantageous position as a result of a decision taken by whomsoever.</p> <p>  We hope the solidarity that has been the hallmark of debates and discussions on Brexit remains.  If it does, I believe the outcome will be the best that can be achieved regardless of what else is on offer.</p></speech>

I want to cut straight to the chase.  A senior politician in this country has said this may boil down to the Single Market or the Good Friday Agreement.  I would like some assurance that both are held in equal esteem and neither is trade-offable against the other.</p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions.  Will the Minister of State tell us what exercises have been carried out with respect to import-export customs checking on our ports?  Do we know how long it will take to check a 40 ft trailer and how long it will take to clear a truck?  We were told there will be 9 km of tailbacks in the UK.  How far will the tailbacks be in Ireland?  What facilities have we off-site for Dublin Port, Rosslare, Waterford, Cork and, possibly, Foynes in Limerick to allow for the parking or stacking and racking of trucks until they are cleared?</p> <p>  Clearly, we have lost all corporate knowledge of managing a customs border over the years.  I note some vehicles were delivered to County Louth yesterday.  Is training taking place for customs officials?  This brings me onto the issue of the Border or borders, as my colleague adverted to.  The Conservative Party, and in particular the Prime Minister, have no understanding of what a border in Ireland means, as they suggest we might have a border ten miles north of the actual Border and ten miles south of it, creating a 20-mile no-man zone somewhere between the two jurisdictions.  This would give a field day to every criminal and smuggler that ever walked.  On the basis of this, what accommodation has been prepared for the military in the case that we must reintroduce a border?  If we put up a border post, we will have to have a guard and if we have guards, we will have to have military people to look after them.</p> <p>  The landbridge will clearly be a problem.  In the past, some of my colleagues have stated that the British Government might allow for rapid transport between Holyhead and Dover.  This is just not going to happen.  At the end of the day, trucks are trucks and they will fall in line with whatever trucks are there.  The seabridge becomes an option but there will be an expense or cost involved in using the seabridge to go directly to Duisburg, the Hook of Holland or wherever.  Will we be able to provide some support for companies to get over the initial cost impact of using the seabridge?  In the event of an illegal - as we understand it - crash-out on 31 October, is it not true that on 1 November 2019, trade talks will have to start anyway?  The notion the UK will crash out with no deal is a bit of a nonsense because it will have to find a deal within a few months of crashing out anyway.  I will leave it at that because I know the Minister of State's time is very tight.</p></speech>

I represent Dublin Bay North and the Dublin Port tunnel is major infrastructure on the north side of Dublin.  If it closes for five minutes because of an accident, there is traffic chaos in the entire city.  I hope plans and preparations are being put in place for the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who represents Dublin Central, is giving the issue great attention.  There is nothing surer than that the citizens of Dublin will be greatly discommoded if traffic comes to a standstill because of problems in the Dublin Port tunnel in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister of State that the issues in the withdrawal agreement will be the first items on the agenda in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I hope it is realised by all parties concerned that these issues are simply not going to go away.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State confirm that discussions have taken place between the Republic of Ireland and the European Commission on measures to be taken in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  I am not asking for details of the discussions but are such discussions taking place?  When will we know the details of these discussions?  Obviously, there are a lot of issues to be considered in this context and I am interested to know where that stands.</p> <p>  With regard to the new European Commission, we have a new European Parliament that is very fragmented in comparison with previous European Parliaments.  I am interested in the fallout from this and the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as the President of the European Commission.  She tabled a proposal to have a Commissioner to protect the European way of life.  Where does this stand?  I know the European Parliament is quizzing the European Commission nominees at present.  Is this still something that is being pursued?  As for the Minister of State's comments on the rule of law, we have President Trump in the United States and Mr. Johnson as Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, and adherence to the law seems to be becoming increasingly optional in the world today.  We have the rise of the far right in the European Union.  Given the fallout from the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen, can we be assured the new European Commission will continue to pursue it actively?  The fundamental values of the European Union are at stake.  I am interested to hear the comments of the Minister of State on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019100200002#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the committee and giving us such a detailed statement and update on the ongoing work.  I want to follow on from what my colleagues have said on Dublin Port, where I worked for 19 years.  Many exceptional thriving companies that employ a lot of people are based there.  They operate on the basis of moving in and out fairly seamlessly to do business.  This is effective and good for the economy.  If no proper infrastructure and plans are put in place, it will have huge implications both for the city and for the many companies operating very effectively and efficiently in Dublin Port.  They need the road infrastructure to operate competitively because we certainly would not want anything to impact negatively on them.  There is a broader context for the existing businesses operating in the area and they need to be considered, supported and assisted.</p> <p>  To come back to what we are hearing through leaks and rumours, which may not be true, what are the thoughts of the Minister of State on the British Prime Minister even considering such alleged rumoured or leaked proposals, given that he knows it would be completely unacceptable to the Irish Government, based on conversations and the agreement in place since December 2017, not to mention the illegal implications of what he proposes or suggests?  I am concerned, following the comments of a previous speaker, that if it is true, he is pursuing it on the basis of a softening of position in Europe to try to get a deal.  In such a case, will the agreement and plans in place between the Irish and British Governments become the sacrificial lamb with regard to getting an outcome, deal or agreement?  Obviously we do not want this.  We know it is totally opposed, not alone by the Irish Government but also by all parties in the House. </p> <p>  There have been rumours about an extension of time and this has been spoken about and discussed at various levels.  How does the Minister of State feel this could come about given that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, has certainly said he will not look for an extension of time?  Europe has indicated an extension would be supported, and the Irish Commissioner, Phil Hogan, has said on public record it would be supported and given, but how could it come about, given the Prime Minister of the day has certainly indicated he will not ask for it?  This leads us to believe the UK is heading for a crash-out at the end of October if there is no deal in the meantime.  How does the Minister of State see this playing out with regard to an extension if it were to be considered?</p> <p>  With regard to the funding available to businesses, I am a supportive advocate of the SME sector, given that they are the lifeblood of the economy and the number of people they employ.</p><p>Why does the Minister of State think there has been such a slow take-up of that funding and why are they not knocking the door down to avail of it?  Is it because the scheme is too complex and complicated?  Is it surrounded by too much red tape?  We know that business is struggling in a number of areas.  Although the economy is recovering and we are back to a very low percentage of unemployment, business is still struggling every day with wages, high insurance costs, access to credit and all that goes with it.  Is this perhaps a step too far and the scheme too complicated and complex and that this is why they are not availing of it?  Is the red tape something the Minister of State has considered and something that needs to be reviewed?</p><p> I must apologise to the Minister of State and the committee, but I have been selected to deal with a Topical Issue which is very important in local politics in the constituency.  I will probably have to leave before the Minister of State replies to my questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019100200002#E00200"><p>I will respond to the Deputy's comments first as he has to leave.  </p> <p>  There has been significant investment, not just in Dublin Port but in Rosslare and the airports also.  It has allowed for new customs bays, new inspection bays and new parking spaces.  Moreover, additional staff have been hired; additional space has been bought and permanent infrastructure put in place.  Not all of the permanent infrastructure is in place in Rosslare, but there are temporary measures which we believe will address many of the challenges we may face, taking into account the fact that the United Kingdom would be a third country, which would require separate bays, separate inspections and separate routes.  The biggest challenge we potentially face is hauliers not having the full paperwork filled in, not having an EORI number to allow them to trade with third countries, not having their customs declarations filled in properly or at all and not having the paperwork ready.  This could all create delays.</p> <p>  To answer the question about the training of customs officials, last week the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation re-emphasised an ongoing training programme - it has been ongoing for some months - under which we have been training individual customs agents to work with either businesses or companies which may have only one or two people to ensure they will have the correct and appropriate information to fill in the customs declaration forms.  A huge amount of work is ongoing, but, as well as that, customs inspectors have been hired.  There has been an increase in numbers.  As I mentioned, we are possibly looking at an increase from around 1.2 million or 1.3 million customs declarations forms to potentially 20 million in a very short space of time.  Therefore, a huge amount of work is under way in that regard. </p> <p>  With reference to the Prime Minister, the leaks and what we have been hearing in the past few days, I have to stress that they are reports and that nothing has been presented to the Commission in the form of a legal proposal or legal document.  I watched the Prime Minister's speech this afternoon and there is no greater clarity.  No details of any proposal were outlined in it.  Again, we need to wait for the official proposal to be made and any legal documentation to be presented to the Commission.  Until that is the case, what I have said publicly is that much of what we are hearing is not compatible with the commitments as set out by the United Kingdom.  Without any clear proposal or details, it is just speculation.  We have to be ready and willing to hear what it might propose.0</p> <p>  On an extension of time, as Deputy O'Rourke rightly put it, it would have to be requested by the United Kingdom.  The European Union cannot grant an extension without a request being made by the Prime Minister.  Of course, an Act has been passed by the UK Parliament which legally requires the Prime Minister to seek an extension, but, again, it is not something in which we can been involved, nor would we be.  If an extension of time was to be asked for, from our point of view, if we were faced with no deal or an extension, obviously, an extension would be appropriate.  However, we would need to know that it would not be a rolling extension that would just prolong the uncertainty and challenges for industries that are already facing significant challenges without a clear direction as to where we are going. </p> <p>  On funding supports, many supports have been accessed.  A significant number of direct payments have been made across different sectors, from agriculture and small and medium enterprise to tourism.  There are also loans available, but, as the Deputy can understand, irrespective of whether they are long or short term, or whether they are at a lower rate, it is money people have to take and then pay back.  For the two largest loan schemes of &euro;300 million each, people have been approved for half of the funding, but only a fraction of it has been drawn down.  I do not think it is because the schemes are overly onerous or complex.  They are not the complaints we have been hearing through the various channels, including Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, the Department's agencies, local enterprise offices or councils.  It is simply that people, understandably, do not want to take on a potential financial burden if they do not need to.  Again, I stress that being approved for a loan does not mean that one has to draw it down; being approved means that they have that safety net if they need it. </p> <p>  On overall supports, I again stress that the Minister will be announcing a budget next Tuesday in which there will be specific, timely, targeted and, we hope, temporary measures for specific sectors that we know will be impacted on in the event that there is no deal.  We already know that small and medium enterprises, the agriculture sector, the tourism sector and the retail sector will be among them.</p> <p>  To respond to Senator Coghlan's comments on my negative tone, I believe a deal can be done.  As I said, we are hearing about elements of a paper that has not yet been presented.  Much of what is being relayed through the newspapers is not compatible with the commitments made.  However, we have to be willing and ready to accept any new proposal and look at it objectively. </p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Crowe's comments about our EU colleagues, there has not been any weakening of which I am aware through my engagement with all of my EU colleagues and the same goes for the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and several other Ministers.  There has been no change in position.  I believe they understand the challenges we face.  Because many of them have come here to meet not just the political representatives but individuals living along and near the Border and the business sectors which would be impacted on if there was no deal, I believe they understand the position.  That is why we have already seen support from the Commission, including the beef exceptional aid measure which was an additional support.  A total of &euro;50 million was allocated from the Commission which was then matched with &euro;50 million from the Department.  We have up to the value of &euro;200 million available through the rescue and restructuring scheme under the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Again, it is a relaxing of state aid rules, given the acknowledgement that businesses are already facing significant challenges businesses.  Some of the money has already been accessed.  We have also had the very clear indication that, in the event that there is no deal, when industries will be impacted on in a negative way, further financial assistance will be made available, not just for Ireland but for other member states also.  I believe they understand our concerns.  They have already shown flexibility but, obviously, until we know what the overall situation looks like, it is hard for them to provide further details.</p> <p>  On the United Kingdom pressurising other member states, if it has, we are not aware of it and there has been no change in position.  It is my understanding the EU 27 will remain strong and together when it comes to the European Council meeting on 17 October.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy Durkan's contribution, the CAP and the agrifood sector are top of my priorities when speaking about the MFF.  If we are to ask the farming community not just to be champions of food security around the world but also to protect the environment, among other things we will need to ensure they are adequately funded, that it is not just a love and a passion for them but that they can make a living from it also.  We know that the farming community has been going through a very difficult period.  There are suggestions the agricultural budget, the CAP in particular, is a traditional and older priority, but, for me, they are very real current priorities, ones we need to protect both now and into the future. </p> <p>  On the Good Friday Agreement and being optimistic about future international agreements, we have consistently reminded the United Kingdom of its obligations to what is an international peace treaty.  We will continue to do so right up until the end of the deadline.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell spoke about our twin objectives and asked whether either of them was tradeable.  The simple answer is "No".  Our objective in our communications with the Commission is to protect the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  It is also to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  The Single Market is extremely important to the economy and our livelihoods.  As I said at the beginning, we export 90% of what we produce.  As an outward-looking trading country, the Single Market is our largest market, one we need to protect.</p><p>The Good Friday Agreement is extremely important to every person on this island, both North and South, and we need to protect it.  Dual testing is currently ongoing.  This includes physical checks but also desktop studies.  I do not have the exact details of that but it has been ongoing for some time and continues weekly.  If there are details, maybe I could get them for the committee separately.<br/><br/>Training of customs staff is ongoing.  In the last month or two, it was perhaps 611, although do not quote me on that figure.  A substantial number have been trained recently.  What we are talking about with regard to the Border is very different from what the UK is proposing.  The UK is proposing a permanent solution which would involve checks as part of a deal and that is not something we will accept.  With regard to no-deal planning, we are talking about damage limitation.  There will have to be checks.  However, they cannot pose a security risk or threat.  They would potentially not allow the <i>status quo</i>to be maintained and would be temporary, in our view.  We are talking about two very different things but to answer Deputy Haughey's question, that conversation is ongoing and we hope it will be concluded in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>Significant work has been done by private companies and sea ferry operators on the supports available for the landbridge.  We have the <i>MV Celine</i>, which will be the largest ro-ro ferry in the world, which has been added to ensure that we have adequate space between Ireland and mainland Europe.  We have the <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>,  a passenger ferry as well as a haulage vessel.<br/><br/>The Minister is looking at the financial supports sought by hauliers and the transport sector along with overall Brexit supports in next Tuesday's budget.  I do not have clear details on that but I think we will see it next week and that there will be an attempt to try to accommodate any requests or supports when it comes to Brexit preparedness over the next week.<br/><br/>With regard to the new Commission role on the EU way of life, I think the relevant committee is mainly focused on migration and security.  The title of the Commissioner has raised a number of questions.  I am not sure whether that title is changing or if there has been a change in focus.  The substance of the Commission is the important matter, relating to migration, security and trying to build a consensus.  In the two years I have been a member of the General Affairs Council, it is the one issue that we have failed to move forward and find a consensus on.  There needs to be an additional focus on that and I am glad the Commissioner is doing so.<br/><br/>The new mechanisms relating to the rule of law were raised by Deputy Haughey.  The Commission has outlined a series of mechanisms that would work in parallel with the Article 7 process through which we have engaged with Poland and Hungary.  There are also suggestions about financial implications for the next European budget but those would apply to all member states and would be equal and fair in their application.<br/><br/>If I have missed anything, people might mention it, otherwise I can come back to matters another time.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the enormous amount of work that has been undertaken by the health sector at a governmental level, from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and so many others.  I also want to acknowledge those beyond the governmental and State level, namely the stakeholders we have been working with collaboratively - the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and so many others -  in preparations in the official, agency and industry sectors.</p> <p>  I want to assure the committee and, more important, the public that we are focused on being as ready as we possibly can be.  We are well prepared to troubleshoot issues as they arise in the days and weeks following Brexit and to minimise any disruption to citizens.  I also want to assure the committee that a citizen of Ireland will be able to access the same health services after 31 October.  Patients will continue to avail themselves of health services on an emergency and planned basis when travelling to the North or the UK.  There is a commitment on the part of both Departments that the established North-South co-operation in health matters will continue.  This is so important, as has been the goodwill and a deep embedded culture of working together North and South when it comes to health matters.  </p> <p>  At the request of Government, my Department finalised legislation yesterday which we brought to Cabinet to provide benefits to residents of Northern Ireland similar to the those of the European health insurance card in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  This is something that has been very much welcomed by all parties in this House, in Northern Ireland, and by society in the North in general.  This was an idea that we had already dealt with in the Brexit omnibus Bill, in terms of North-South and east-west reciprocal health arrangements.  We have gone a step further here where, if a Northern Ireland citizen finds himself or herself ill while on holidays in Spain or France or somewhere else in the EU, we have agreed to assist them in meeting the costs.  With the co-operation of the Oireachtas and this committee, Chairman, my intention is to pass that Bill into law in advance of 31 October; I look forward to working with the committee in that regard.</p> <p>  Supply lines for drugs and medical devices are all being examined.  Significant buffer stock is already held within the domestic supply chain.  There is no need to stockpile medicines by either a patient, a pharmacy or a hospital.  This is an important message for our citizens and for our health service to hear.  To do so would hamper access to medicines by those who need them when they need them.  </p> <p>  Brexit has been a key focus for all of us but there are many other ongoing health service issues.</p><p> I understand the Chairman has invited the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office to attend a meeting of the committee later this month.  As such, I will not dwell too much on that aspect other than to say that since we last met, we have taken several significant decisions towards the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One of the most significant of these relates to the publication of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report on removing private practice from public hospitals.  I have made clear my view that this should be done.  It is entirely unfair and inequitable to have private practice continuing unabated in public hospitals while public waiting lists lengthen in many specialties.  It is an unfairness that must be addressed.  I hope there is similar clarity from all parties in the Oireachtas on the need to tackle this issue.  I accept that many colleagues here have offered that clarity, but it is not forthcoming from some others.  The expert group did a good job of tackling this complex issue and I thank Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and his team for their work.  I intend to consult with stakeholders and colleagues before returning to Government later this year with a response to the recommendations and an implementation plan.</p><p> Another significant development is our decision regarding the restructuring of the health service, the effective dismantling of the HSE as currently constructed and the establishment of regional entities.  Since I was last before the committee, we published the capital plan, which outlines more than 250 projects across the country, the provision of 480 new beds, 30 new primary care centres, 58 community nursing units, and significant investment in mental health and disability projects.</p><p> We are planning for the winter period, which is essential to do.  I hope to be in a position to announce additional resources for winter planning as part of budget 2020 to reduce delayed discharges or transfers of care, get people back into the community, increase home care provision and improve access to the fair deal scheme and to transitional care.  I expect the chief executive officer of the HSE will comment on the significant work being done by the HSE in this area.</p><p> Next Thursday, we will launch the HSE's flu vaccine campaign.  This year, for the first time, on foot of a recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, a quadrivalent vaccine will be offered, which provides a substantially greater level of protection to the population compared with the vaccine given in recent years.  We have had good leadership from politicians across the political spectrum on the promotion of vaccination efforts.  I note that Deputy Kelly spoke recently at the Global Vaccination Summit about the importance of vaccination programmes.  I ask all members to encourage at-risk groups to get the vaccine, including healthcare professionals.  More broadly, we must continue to emphasise our support for vaccination programmes and work to debunk the myths associated with them.  I could say a great deal more on this, but I must allow time for the other speakers.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer; and Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute operations.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 commenced on 28 June 2019.  On that date, the newly established board of the HSE met, with the Minister in attendance.  Under the Act, the board is now the governing body of the HSE, accountable to the Minister.  I look forward to working with the board and providing every support and assistance to the members in their work.</p> <p>  A key priority for the HSE is to maximise the provision of safe services, within the funding with which we are provided.  This is a significant challenge for the HSE in the context of the increasing level of demand for our services.  Demand is rising due to an aging demographic, more complex service demands and ongoing societal and economic change.  The latest reported financial position, as at July 2019, shows a deficit of &euro;281 million, or 3.1%, with 43% of that relating to operational service areas and 57% relating to pensions and other demand-led areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was 72% higher at &euro;485 million, or 5.8% of the budget, with 80% of the deficit in the operational service areas.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services are in respect of providing residential placements to service users with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialist emergency care within the acute hospital setting to a growing population of older and frailer patients.</p> <p>  Costs in respect of pensions, the State Claims Agency, the primary care reimbursement service and overseas treatment are largely driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic situation and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  I have directed relevant national directors, community healthcare organisation chief officers and hospital group CEOs to identify and put in place additional measures to limit, to the greatest extent practicable, any overruns within operational services.</p><p>The measures to limit overruns include greater emphasis on controls around agency spend, overtime and staffing levels.  Monthly expenditure limits have been agreed and are being monitored closely, including at a monthly financial management meeting which I chair and all the community healthcare organisation chief officers and hospital group CEOs attend.  This is a challenging process but we are committed to embedding an improved culture of delivering within the budget allocated to us by the State.  Doing so will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which is in the best interests of patients, service users and their families.<br/><br/>The 2019 HSE capital plan, which was recently launched, forms part of a rolling ten-year investment plan for health.  Modern infrastructure and equipment are a crucial part of the provision of a quality health service and, ultimately, a positive patient experience.  An allocation of &euro;642 million was allocated this year to continue the delivery of more than 91 projects across the country and initiate another 73 projects for acute and non-acute services.  Fifty-eight community nursing units, CNUs, are at planning and design stage and &euro;85 million has been allocated to deal with infrastructural risk, replacement of equipment and replacement of ambulances.  This investment will provide increased capacity across the health service and support the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.<br/><br/>Budget 2019 provided for the establishment of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office at the Department of Health, with &euro;20 million allocated for the establishment of a ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  This fund will test new ways in which we can bring care closer to home, including putting the patient and client at the centre of service design and delivery.  Across the country, 122 projects have been selected for funding.  A total of these are from HSE or HSE-funded services and include projects supporting individuals to prevent and manage their chronic conditions and projects to enhance community care services and mental health support services.  These projects will run for a period of 12 months from initiation and processes will be put in place to enable successful projects to be scaled for national implementation over time.<br/><br/>The HSE and the Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office are working to progress the full range of Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme actions and projects.  We have also been working to establish higher-order priority work programmes over the next two years, which have the potential to transform the way care is delivered and experienced in Ireland.  These programmes will be jointly led and implemented by the Department of Health and HSE and will cover the design and implementation of regional health areas.  This is essential in ensuring we have better enabled delivery organisations fully focused on delivering services that meet the needs of the local population.  In addition, the priority programmes will deal with service capacity and service access.  This will address the implementation of the health service capacity review recommendations across acute hospital and community care services, while also reducing the inevitable demand for beds in the coming years.<br/><br/>Winter preparedness planning is a core component of annual operational planning in the health service.  It is essential to ensure service provider organisations are prepared for the additional seasonal pressures associated with the winter period.  Analysis has shown significant levels of growth in emergency department attendance and admissions over the past winter seasons, outstripping population growth by more than 2.75%.  The winter preparedness plan was developed by the HSE through a collaborative process across all key services, including community operations, acute hospital operations and the national ambulance service.  The plan sets out the core components of an integrated winter plan and seeks to guide those developing their local plans in terms of essentials that must be considered.  Through this proactive planning and action, combined with the assistance of the public in following winter season guidance from the HSE, including availing of the flu vaccine programme, we will endeavour to provide safe and efficient services.<br/><br/>In August of this year, the HSE launched the new gender neutral human papilloma virus, HPV, vaccine programme for girls and boys in their first year of second level.  Information packs for parents are being provided through schools by the local school vaccination teams, which have now started to give the first dose of the vaccine.  The implementation of this new programme is backed up by campaign materials including videos, social media posts, radio advertisements and the <i>hpv.ie</i>website.  The provisional uptake of the HPV girls' programme is approximately 70% for 2018 to 2019, which is an increase from 64.1% in the previous school year.  It is important to acknowledge the powerful work of the late Laura Brennan in promoting the HPV programme.  She made an enormous impact in communicating the benefits of this important life-saving vaccine and encouraging parents to get informed via the Get the Facts resource.<br/><br/>The new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre, Children's Health Ireland, at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown opened in July.</p><p>This opening is a major milestone in the new children's hospital project.  Since opening, the latest available figures indicate that 645 children presented to the urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital and 94% of children were discharged home.  The average time spent by patients in the urgent care centre is 112 minutes.  The urgent care centre will continue to extend the hours of operation on a phased basis.  It is expected that 25,000 children and young people will visit the urgent care centre every year, leading to a reduction in emergency department attendance for children.</p><p> Since opening, the latest available figures indicate there were 514 attendances to the Connolly Children's Health Ireland outpatients department.  When fully operational, this new facility will provide 17,000 outpatient appointment attendances annually.  This new facility and service is a welcome development and will contribute to significant reductions in general paediatric outpatient waiting times for patients and their families.  I thank Children's Health Ireland and all concerned for their work and commitment in getting this facility operational.</p></speech>

What is most interesting about the opening statements is what is not in them.  The hospital consultants, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals are saying the public health system is on fire.  They are talking about more than 1 million people waiting for healthcare.  That was not mentioned anywhere in any opening statement.  More than 500,000 men, women and children are waiting to see a consultant but that was not mentioned in any opening statement.  Already this year 10,000 women and men over the age of 75 have waited on trolleys in emergency departments for more than 24 hours.  That also was not mentioned in any of the opening statements.</p> <p>  When the Minister's predecessor, the now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, held office in 2015, he said the Government would ensure no man, woman or child would wait more than a year and a half to see a consultant.  It was pointed out at the time that even if the Government hit that target, the waiting list in Ireland would be the longest in Europe.  That was the extent of the ambition of the target.  In 2015, the then Minister and now Taoiseach said the number would be zero and when the current Minister took office in 2016, that number was 13,000.  An extra &euro;3.5 billion has been allocated to health spending since but that number has increased from 13,000 to 106,000 men, women and children now waiting more than a year and a half to see a consultant.  For every one person who was waiting three years ago, there are now seven.  That is a crisis in anybody's book.  None of this has been mentioned in any of the opening statements.</p> <p>  What does the Minister say to all these people and why has he not mentioned this crisis in his opening statement?  Why has the HSE not mentioned the crisis in its opening statement?  What does the Minister say to the 10,000 men and women over 75?  What does he say to the 106,000 men, women and children waiting more than a year and a half for an appointment?  What does he say to the children with special needs in our county waiting three and half years for help?  Why has he not spoken about any of this and what does he have to say to them as they wait and suffer, with many of them deteriorating while they seek access to the public health system in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#G00400"><p>It is kind of ironic that I come to a health committee meeting and when I am asked not to deliver my opening statement but to take it as read, the second comment from a member of the health committee critiques what is not in the opening statement.  As the Deputy knows, opening statements are a brief summation of some current issues.  He knows the meat of these meetings comprises what we discuss through questions and answers.  If the Deputy so wishes, the next time I attend this committee I can provide a lengthy opening statement and read it in great detail.  Deputy Alan Kelly and others would rightly criticise me for doing so.  I ask Deputy Donnelly not to be pedantic in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy will note that a significant portion of my opening statement speaks to the greatest potential crisis facing our country at the end of this month, which is Brexit.  He might excuse a Minister coming before a sectoral committee and highlighting what the Government and its agencies are doing about it.</p> <p>  I say to the people mentioned by the Deputy that we absolutely must do better.  Since I became Minister, fewer people have waited for a hospital operation.  Fewer people are waiting today for a hip or knee operation or a cataract procedure.</p><p>I say to those people that when Deputy Donnelly's current party was last in office, it did not publish outpatient waiting list numbers.  When Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was Minister for Health and Children, he did not publish statistics for the outpatient waiting lists and we had did not have a clue about them.  It took my party and Deputy Kelly's party to go into government and decide to publish those numbers.  A Fine Gael-Labour Government was the first to publish them.</p><p> I say to those people that we have agreed a reform plan for the next ten years, which we have never done before in the country.  It is Sl&aacute;intecare and I think we all agree on it.  It will reorientate healthcare.  We have made major progress with inpatient waiting times.  In fairness, the Deputy's party has played a constructive role in that, which I acknowledge.  We have not made anywhere near as much progress as we need to with outpatients.  We will have to reorientate the health service to do it.  What does that mean practically for somebody waiting today?  It means the new GP contract, which I agreed with GPs and which 95% of GPs voted in favour of because they recognised it as a good deal for general practice, will see from the start of next year conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure being treated in the community for the first time.  These conditions treated through the outpatient process currently.  I hope members have visited Connolly Hospital's urgent care centre to see the facility at work.  As its chief executive said, it means approximately 500 more kids on the outpatient waiting list will be treated, as it targets those who are waiting longest.</p><p> The Deputy specifically referred to consultants.  Earlier this week, I wrote to the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, inviting its representatives for talks next week on how we can sort out some of the consultant recruitment and retention issues, which are very real.  Those talks will begin with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and my Department on how to resolve those issues.  We sat at this committee last year discussing how to sort out supporting general practice and we have done so.  We worked our way through with nurses a deal that came about, although admittedly after industrial action.  We need to do the same with consultants as we need more of them.</p><p> This will require a multifaceted approach and doing a number of things, including shifting more to the community, which is exactly what Sl&aacute;intecare is starting to do.  We will have to ask our GPs to do more and give them more resources.  There will have to be more consultants in hospitals.  I fully accept the points made by the IHCA and IMO about consultant numbers.  There is no disputing those numbers.</p></speech>

All of those things must happen but we have been listening to similar explanations for years.  The reality is things are getting worse and faster.  We have gone from 13,000 to 106,000 people waiting more than a year and half for an appointment.  That has happened in just three years.  The Minister is correct as the one measure that seems to be working relates to the inpatient waiting list and surgery.  However, that is working because the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has been turned back on.  It worked very well in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and it brought waiting times down to months.  It was turned off and the numbers increased again.  I acknowledge the Minister's indication that having it turned back on again was a Fianna F&aacute;il priority.  It is working and we believe it needs to be expanded.  This should not be a long-term measure, as we need a public health system that can deal with this, but it is required for the short term.</p> <p>  I can bring this to an individual case.  Last night I spoke to a mum in Wicklow whose child has been waiting three and half years for therapy.  She was very annoyed.  On the same day received a letter from the HSE stating there had been further delays and the child would not be seen, she received a leaflet from the Minister indicating Rugby World Cup dates.  She asked how taxpayers' money can be spent on a leaflet indicating world cup dates but not for her son to have therapy over three and half years.  What does he say to her?</p></speech>

While he is protected by privilege, I am sure he would not wish to accidentally slur me in that regard.  I do not know the details of the case.

We have provided funding for an additional 100 therapy posts in the health service this year.  We need more speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and others.  The Deputy's party froze such recruitment, sadly, which should be acknowledged.  The Deputy may have the solutions today but a recruitment moratorium was introduced by his party.  He is the party spokesperson on health.</p><p>That Government introduced a recruitment freeze, stopped hiring speech and language therapists and occupational therapists and did not replace those who were on maternity leave.  We are endeavouring to catch up.  Not only that, we are also trying to do things differently.  The Minister for Education and Skills and I have brought forward an integrated programme of speech and language therapy and occupational therapy in schools, including in our constituency, for the first time ever.  It is showing real benefits in west Wicklow and other parts of the country.  I would like to see us make further progress made in budget 2020.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.</p> <p>  I move to recruitment, an area in which there is a crisis.  Throughout the country there is a crisis in the recruitment of consultants, while individual hospitals face crises in the recruitment of mental health professionals, therapists, nurses, midwives and many other grades.  The Minister has written to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  Has he also written to the Irish Hospital Consultants Association to offer to hold talks?</p></speech>

The reason behind it is one of sequencing.  Without getting into a big discussion on industrial relations and taking up the committee's time, I note that the INMO is a member organisation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is a party to the public sector pay agreements and we will engage with it first.  That is the appropriate way to proceed.  It is the long-standing tradition.  I do not speak for the INMO in any way, but I would like to arrive at a point where there would be collaborative and joint talks.  I hope the initial meetings will be with the INMO, but I would absolutely like to see them broadened to include the IHCA which body is effectively making the same points about recruitment.</p></speech>

We have not yet sat down in a room with the INMO to begin the discussion.  I hope it can start some time next week, after the announcement of budget 2020.  We will have to look at what has been done for other public servants and the pace at which it has been done.  There must be equity.  We must also be cognisant of available resources, especially in the context of a potential no-deal Brexit.  I see it as the phasing of conversations.  I accept that there is a media challenge in recruitment and retention and  that pay parity is part of it.  However, there must also be a second phase which must be about substantive reform, including reform in line with the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  We cannot continue to stand over private practice in public hospitals, something on which  I hope the Deputy will support me.</p></speech>

Last year there was a focus on reversing the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts for GPs, for which provision was made in the budget.  Talks had to happen, but provision was made, which meant that the Minister, the Government, the Department and the HSE had space in which to begin to reverse the FEMPI cuts.  Will such provision be made in the budget to allow for the reversal of the new entrant pay disparity for consultants if the talks succeed as I hope they will?</p></speech>

We will have to see how the engagement with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform goes.  It is primarily a matter for him, as is public sector pay policy.  The Deputy is right; provision was made for changes to the GP contract.  It was not revealed publicly for negotiating reasons, but there was space.  There was no space for nurses, but we still managed to find resources for them.  The practice varies.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance on which to make a call at budget time.</p></speech>

There were 81.  Now there are 82.  There does not seem to be any change in that regard.  The Minister will be aware that the trolley count started when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  We know that September was a record month and that the number now stands at 82.  Does the Minister have anything he would like to say to the staff and patients this morning?  I have been there and spoken to the nurses.  I was there when we took industrial action several years ago to have additional staff recruited.  It was hell on earth then, when the number was always below 40.  Is there anything the Minister would like to say to the people in question?  The Taoiseach apologised to them yesterday and acknowledged how stressful it was for staff.  The figure is only moving in one direction.</p></speech>

I echo the Taoiseach's words yesterday.  What staff and patients at University Hospital Limerick want to know is what are we going to do about it.  I cannot remember when, but I visited Limerick a couple of months ago, I visited CervicalCheck staff.  I called into the hospital where I saw the significant progress being made in the development of the 60-bed ward block.  The mid-west has been really badly treated in the reconfiguration agenda which I do not intend to reopen.  I see why it was decided to centralise several services in University Hospital Limerick, but it was never given the beds required.  I see the clinical director of the hospital, Dr. Gerry Burke, regularly highlighting the inequity in bed numbers.  I will reverse that trend and the Deputy will be pleased to know that it is not just talk from me.  If she visits University Hospital Limerick, as I know she does, she will see that work on the 60-bed ward block is well under way.  In this Oireachtas I have been under significant political pressure from Senator Kieran O'Donnell, Deputy Kelly and others from the mid-west to move ahead and do something quickly.  We went ahead with the 60-bed modular ward block.</p> <p>  I also see in the figures I have been given that about 68 additional staff have been hired in Limerick in the last four weeks, including 48 in nursing.  The chief executive may wish to add to this, but we are genuinely putting extra staff and beds in place.  As to what we can do right now, I have called a meeting tomorrow on the position at University Hospital Limerick and in the mid-west.  I expect people to come from the hospital, but I also expect to meet the HSE and the Department.  One of the issues about which I heard from hospital management when I visited and about which I have heard from Oireachtas colleagues is that the number of delayed discharges from the hospital is much higher than it used to be.  Traditionally, there would have been about eight, but that number has now reached 47 or 48.  </p> <p>  I have been talking to the chief executive about increasing funding for transitional care services in the region.  I offer my apologies to Deputy Harty, as I should have mentioned the representations he has made in that regard, but I was looking in his direction.  We will also be making provision for winter planning in budget 2020 to be announced next Tuesday.  In the short term my message to people in Limerick is that more beds are coming.  One can see in looking out the window that they are under construction.  Also, there are 68 more staff members working in the hospital than there were five weeks ago.  In the immediate term I want to see what we can do to improve social care services to help to decongest the hospital.</p></speech>

Improvements in transitional care services should have been made a long time ago.  There were warnings about all of this when the reconfiguration was carried out against the wishes of the staff.  They pointed out what was going to happen and it did.  I must also reference my colleague Deputy Maurice Quinlivan who has sought 14 times, on the last count, to engage in a Topical Issue debate with the Minister.  The Minister must be an extremely busy man because he has never turned up once, which is regrettable.</p></speech>

There is a primary care centre in Balbriggan and while I keep asking the Minister if it will get additional staff, he keeps telling me it will not and nor is there a plan to put in additional equipment.  If built, these primary care centres are not being adequately staffed. Similar to other points that have been made here, I can point the Minister to people in my constituency who have been waiting 36 months for therapeutic interventions for their kids.  They have been told they must wait a year before their kids can get onto lists and so on.  We are aware that the lists are lengthening.</p><p> If one considers a primary care centre that may just have a general practice doctor in it but no additional facilities - especially in an area such as Balbriggan where the population is growing - apart from the buildings, does the HSE have a workforce plan?  Mr. Reid will be more than familiar with this issue.  Can the Minister share such a plan with us and point us in the direction of X number of staff?  They are not coming to Balbriggan because while I do not know how many times I have asked this through parliamentary questions, the answer always is that services will be provided from within existing resources.  This means there will be no additional staff, despite the growing population.  Is there a workforce plan for all of these new primary care centres that are being built or are under construction?  Does that plan mirror Sl&aacute;intecare and will it provide therapies within the community?  Thus far, it has not.  The Minister will be aware that since the primary care centre in Balbriggan opened some two and a half years ago, Sinn F&eacute;in has been campaigning for diagnostic facilities for the centre but people still must travel all the way into a hospital in town for a simple X-ray.</p></speech>

Yes, through the PA Consulting capacity review report there is an indication of the additional staff we need in primary care.  The director of the Sl&aacute;intecare office, Laura Magahy, is currently working with the HSE to turn that into a workforce plan.  Ms Magahy will be before the committee on 23 October.  To be honest with Deputy O'Reilly, the short answer is that we need some 4,000 extra people working in primary care.  Through the Sl&aacute;intecare office, I intend to map out how we get from here to there.  Despite the very difficult constraints under which we are operating in the context of a no-deal Brexit budget, I expect to begin to make progress on that in 2020, as well as to map out how we can build on that in each of the following years.  Ms Magahy has done a considerable amount of work on this.  The end point is that we need some 4,000 more people if we are to make sure that our primary care centres and our primary care teams are operating at full capacity.  The decisions on how that staff is divided out is the responsibility of-----</p></speech>

These are for the primary care centres the Minister is talking about opening in the short to medium term.  Those staff would have to be in college now or there would have to be some plan.  If they are not in college now, then they will not be in post in time, and the facilities will not happen.  Will the Minister please step back to that?</p></speech>

It is 4,000 staff over the ten-year period to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare's working in the community.  Obviously, the Deputy will be aware that not every one of those staff may necessarily be working in a primary care centre.  It is an additional 4,000 staff.  I take the Deputy's point that we have to be recruiting and training enough people and this will be part of the workforce plan also.</p></speech>

Assuming the current cohort coming through our colleges does not all emigrate, and to be honest the Minister knows they are emigrating, and in the event that the Minister manages to massively improve the retention rates for new graduates, we would still need, at this juncture, to have additional people in college to be able to skill up in that area.</p></speech>

One issue - on which we have to come back to the Government - is for an implementation plan for the regions that will involve integration and the workforce plan.

I hear very clearly what has been said, and at some point in the future this may be addressed.</p> <p>  I know that time is limited and I have a question on the working group on contraception.  Has the Minister received that report?  When the Minister receives the report, is it his intention to publish it?  By way of observation, I note the Department has established a task force.  While I do not mean this in any disrespectful way to Mr. Breslin, the women's health task force is headed by a man, which is a bit of an own goal.  Will the working group on contraception report be published?  The Minister has said that he does not have it yet.</p></speech>

I note the Deputy took a different viewpoint on the women's health task force from that taken by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the National Women's Council of Ireland, and the European Institute of Women's Health, all of whom welcomed the establishment of the task force.  That is fine.  It is not chaired just by a man.  The task force is co-chaired by the Secretary General, who happens to be a man.  When one is the Minister, one cannot find a more senior official in the Department to appoint than the Secretary General.  One can be a committed feminist and be a man.  It is very important.  I am sure the Secretary General is-----</p></speech>

I expect to receive it in the coming days.  I have a sense of what is in it but I have not yet received it.  I believe that the Deputy has a sense of what is in it also.  We need to do much better around the access to contraception.  We need to arrive at a point where contraception is free.  The Deputy asked if I will publish the report.  I can see no reason I would not publish it.  I would like to publish it and I would like to brief party spokespeople on it.  Without having the report, I believe that we all know that if there is to be change in this area, it will require legislative change and a fair whack of funding.  How we do both is something on which I would like to engage with the committee.  I hope to get the report this week, in the next couple of days.  I will let the Deputy know when I do.</p></speech>

I will have a quick-fire round now with some priority questions as they will take a bit of time, and I will ask more in the second or third time I come in, or both.  My initial questions, just to prepare the Minister's officials, relate to the children's hospital and to what is going on in the mid-west, which the Minister has touched on.  My other question relates to gynaecological services in Letterkenny.  If I have time I will also ask about CervicalCheck.  As I have said, I will have other questions later.</p> <p>  I refer to the minutes of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, and the children's hospital programme and project steering group over the last months of this year.  I have a copy of the minutes and their sub-committee minutes here and I have gone through them.  Will the Minister supply this committee with all minutes of the boards and sub-commitees to the Chairman within a week?  I presume the Minister will do this and I would appreciate that.  This is the first request.</p> <p>  The NPHDB minutes of 3 April state that the finance and construction committee received a report wherein it was reported that additional monetary risk had been identified on provisional funds.  It also stated that this was going to affect the timelines for the hospital.  I am aware that Mr. Reid has written to the board members looking for this revised timetable.  Perhaps Mr. Reid will send on this letter to the committee, and the response, if he has it.  On 29 April, on the procurement sub-committee meeting, the minutes express concerns around the costs as they are appearing.</p><p>I have spoken to people and we all know there are further issues concerning this hospital.  At this point at the beginning of October what is the status of the timelines for the delivery of the overall project?  Has the Minister been informed of any issues regarding the timelines and, if so, when and by whom?  I direct the same question to Mr. Reid.  </p><p> At what scale are the costs escalating?  I remember once being accused by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il Chamber of exaggerating in that respect.  The figure I mentioned at this committee has been superseded and increased on and the Taoiseach admitted in effect admitted that since.  What scale of an increase are we talking about or is the Minister aware of?  </p><p> I ask Mr. Reid, in particular, to advise what concerns he has relating to the costs and timelines in accordance with the reason he wrote that letter?  Obviously, he has read the minutes of the board meetings, as I have.</p></speech>

My answer is "yes" in  terms of access to all the documentation and minutes.  It is important we continue to engage transparently with these committees and we will certainly make them available.  On 12 June when Fred Barry came before this committee, he pointed out, as did the PwC report and as we all know, that outside the GNP process other issues that can arise, including contractors submitting claims.  I am aware, although not of the scale of it, that extra claims have been submitted.  I believe this committee has been made aware of that previously also.  However, an extra claim does not necessarily result in that claim being paid.  The Deputy will remember when he and I were discussing this a number of months ago that a number of claims submitted ended up crystallising into a much smaller amount than was claimed for.  Obviously a project of this scale and complexity, the largest construction project ever in our health sector and one of the largest public sector construction projects in Europe, will have claims submitted as the project goes on.  It is important the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board can continue to deal with that in a commercially sensitive way.  I have no information of a rise in costs other than the fact that claims are being submitted, dealt with and managed, and that is the normal flow of this project.</p></speech>

On the costs, my views are exactly as outlined by Fred Barry when he last came before this committee, namely, there are some issues of risk outside the GNP process - that is not new and that has been said many times - and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has to manage that.  I have no further information to add to that at this point.</p> <p>  On the timeline, as the HSE said when this query was first submitted, with a project of this scale some parts of it can run ahead of schedule and some parts of it can run behind schedule.  Overall, I have been informed that the project is still scheduled to be completed in 2022 and opened to the children of Ireland in 2023 on time.  I visited the hospital, as I know the Chairman did, and huge progress is being made on it.  The Connolly part of this is open.  I know this is an issue of intense political scrutiny, and it should be as it involves a great deal of money.  The hospital will have a massive health benefit.  The progress being made on this project is phenomenal.  I reiterate the invitation sent to the committee and encourage all the members to visit the site, meet the management on the site, ask questions, meet the BAM people, and see the progress being made.  I think they would all find it very valuable.  Does Mr. Reid want to come in?</p></speech>

I spent three and half hours yesterday on the site with Fred Barry and all the team.  I would state the obvious.  It is fantastic to see the project above ground and to see the scale of it.  It is a massively complex site in the middle of a mostly residential but also industrial area.  Inevitably it will be a difficult project but it is reassuring to see the progress that is being made.</p> <p>  On the issue of cost overruns or delays, I specifically had a conversation with the team on that yesterday and the feedback I got was exactly as the Minister relayed.  They have had a number of submissions from the contractor through which they are working.</p></speech>

I certainly did not get facts, numbers or details of them on the site but they asked me for support from ourselves and the officials on the continued negotiations with the contractor.  Obviously, I reassured them of that.</p> <p>  In terms of the complexity and the timeline of the delay, I pushed them that we must continue with the timelines, to which we are committed, and as part of the negotiations, that must be in the mix as well.  It is early days in terms of what has been submitted.  I think this will happen throughout the project given its nature.</p></speech>

I just need to be clear that I have not been advised of a change in the timelines for the construction by 2022 or the opening in 2023.  The only cost issues I have been advised of are the same ones of which the chairman of the board advised the committee on 12 June, namely, that developers can submit claims as they go along, and, as the chief executive officer has rightly said, those claims are often robustly defended.</p></speech>

The situation in UHL is the worst I, or any of us, have ever seen.  I want to take this out of party politics, genuinely, because I live among these people.  I live over the road from this hospital even though I am in a different county.  This is something I take a personal interest in every day.  I have never ever seen the situation there as bad as it now.  I have never seen so many people affected.  I am referring to patients, their families and the staff.  I have never had so many staff come to see me.  The issue is simple.  The reconfiguration never worked.  The resources were not put into it.  Let us take the politics out of the issue.  The mid-west is now being discriminated against.  That can be shown by a comparison of key performance indicators and resources in UHL versus - we picked this hospital randomly - Beaumont Hospital.</p></speech>

I do not wish to make a political point of it but it will not be delivered until the following year.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The 90 bed unit will not be provided for in the three-year capital plan.  The issue is the estimated &euro;40 million differential in terms of what is needed to bring the mid-west group of hospitals to a particular level versus current funding.  Approximately 130 doctors, 200 health and social care professionals, 150 nurses, 160 additional beds and 50 to 60 transitional care beds are needed.  The existing MRI scanner, donated by a philanthropist, is 14 years old and is continually breaking down.  In regard to 82 people currently on trolleys, 30 of them could be facilitated if the hospital had a new scanner.  The hospital does not have the &euro;6.5 million required to buy a new scanner or the &euro;1.2 million to rent one.  For God's sake, will the HSE please put together a package in the interim for this area?  People are suffering at a level I have never before seen in my political career.  My colleagues across politics are saying the same.  </p></speech>

I appreciate Deputy Kelly saying that he does not want to make this political and that he has made it a plea for the mid-west.  In the interests of fairness I want to note that Senators Maria Byrne and Kieran O'Donnell and Deputy Michael Harty, who also represent the region, are here.  This is a massive issue for the people of the mid-west.  I have shown a willingness to respond to it.  The issue which all of the members have asked me to advance first is bed capacity.  They have also asked that in advance of any capital plan being published, we proceed with the 60-bed modular unit.  I agree.  It would be nice if it had opened yesterday or even today.  We could have done with it opening yesterday.  However, it is now well under way.</p> <p>  Members have asked, above and beyond that, what more can I do.  In other words, while we are waiting for the extra capacity to come on stream what more can I do in regard to transitional care and the MRI scanner.  I am due to meet tomorrow with the HSE and officials of my Department in regard to the mid-west, where I will consider all of the issues that have been raised by my Oireachtas colleagues.  I will ask Mr. Reid to comment now.</p></speech>

I have spent some time there, including in the emergency department and with the local manager and the group manager.  Deputy Kelly highlighted the cost of purchasing or renting a scanner, which would be a very significant cost investment.  We have spoken with local management on this issue.  Mr. Liam Woods, the national director, is working with local management on how we can accelerate the immediate deployment of a scanner for the area.  We accept that a second one is needed and we are working with local management to deliver it.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Stephen Donnelly that we have a huge problem in terms of consultant recruitment.  I mentioned at previous meetings that 16,000 additional staff have been recruited to the HSE in the last four years.  I have also raised concerns about the disproportionate recruitment of staff, with a 24% increase in managerial and administrative staff versus an increase of as low as 3.6% in hospital staff.</p> <p>  On the consultants issue, the Minister referenced an invitation to a meeting to the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, to discuss, among other things, the two-tier contracts in regard to consultants.  Will the Minister clarify what process will be engaged in with the Irish Hospitals Consultants Association, IHCA, which feels excluded?  It was indicated a number of months ago that there would be engagement with it, but it has not yet occurred.  In the last number of weeks in particular it is at sea with regard to what is happening.  At what stage will engagement take place with the IHCA in regard to the process and how it will be involved in this area?</p><p>An additional 500 consultants were recruited over the past five years, but a number of consultant posts are currently occupied by locum or agency consultants at huge cost.  We can only fast-track a reduction in this cost by putting in place a better structure of employment.  It is extremely important this is done.  Before I continue, will the Minister clarify when it is proposed to engage with the IHCA, which represents the majority of consultants across the country?  Five years ago, it represented 2,500 consultants but it currently represents approximately 3,000.  When will the engagement with the IHCA take place?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I accept that there are serious recruitment and retention issues in the health service, which are particularly acute when it comes to the issue of consultants.  That is not just my view.  We specifically asked the Public Sector Pay Commission to examine the issue and it acknowledged that there were recruitment and retention issues in regard to consultants.  I want to build on the commission's findings and have an engagement with consultants on how we can rectify those recruitment and retention issues.  I genuinely believe that pay parity is an issue but I do not believe it is the only issue.  We need to examine Dr. Donal De Buitl&eacute;ir's report, and the OECD which I commissioned and published on the same day as I published the De Buitl&eacute;ir report, in regard to what other countries do regarding work practice as well.  </p> <p>  Next week, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE will commence engagement with the IMO.  We are commencing the engagement with the IMO because it is a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and it is a party to the public sector pay agreements.  On the question regarding whether I want to see those talks broadened out after initial engagement, yes I do, but it is a matter for discussion with the IMO as well.</p> <p>  The IHCA has submitted more than 100 claims with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, on the issue of new entry consultants.  I would much rather that we worked out a way forward in relation to this matter through direct engagement but I will not tear up the rule book in regard to normal industrial relations.  Senator Burke mentioned engagement.  I was not in a position to attend the IHCA conference for an important personal and private reason.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, made himself available to attend that conference and was told that he would not be given a speaking slot, until the morning of the conference where they reversed the decision.  We are more than willing to engage with consultants but we have to engage in the context of a brave and ambitious reform agenda through which we can deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  Those who put together the Sl&aacute;intecare report asked me to put in place a Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, which I did.  For the first time ever, we have a cross-party approach to healthcare reform in our country.  I am very proud of the plan which a minority Government produced with the Opposition.  That plan also states that we have to change working patterns.  I was also asked to commission the De Buitl&eacute;ir report.  To see it immediately dismissed by representative bodies is very disappointing.  They should be open to engaging on the substance of it.  </p> <p>  In response to Senator Burke's question, we will engage with consultants, commencing with the IMO.  I do want to see the engagement broadened out to other consultant organisations as well.  I want to resolve this issue.  I am already on record in regard to, in my view, the unfairness around pay parity.  We have to engage in the context of the available resources, a no-deal Brexit and a reform agenda.  The resolution is not just pay.  Pay is an element but so too is reform and access to theatres for young consultants.  It is also about how we can engage our consultants in our primary care network and primary care teams and about how the new advanced nurse practitioners can take some of the workload in terms of care off some of our doctors.  I am excited that we are going to finally engage.  I would have liked this engagement to happen much earlier but I am pleased to now have agreement with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other places to commence it.  I think we can start a conversation about an exciting journey of reform that will help with recruitment and retention.</p></speech>

I am asking for a commitment that it will be involved in some way in the negotiations.</p><p>It very much feels sidelined and that there is no engagement with the Department.  My understanding is that in recent weeks there has been little or no engagement on the way forward and the IHCA was not even aware an invitation was being issued to the IMO.

There should be no confusion on this matter because it is quite straightforward.  We engage-----</p></speech>

I am putting forward the view of ordinary consultants who work very hard in the health service.

To be helpful, I absolutely see a role for the IHCA and I take fully the point made by the Senator.  I want it to be engaged.  There are many excellent representatives in the organisation.  They are very sincere and want to make a difference.  In case I did not say it clearly enough, I hope and expect that after initial engagement with the IMO, the talks will be broadened to include other representative bodies such as the IHCA.  This is the process I am following.  No one need be excluded and no one need feel entrenched.  There will be engagement on the immediate issues of recruitment and retention.

I met Mr. Martin Varley four months ago, before I took up this role, and I have had a number of meetings with him since.  The HSE has directly engaged with the IHCA on a range of issues.  I and the chief clinical officer, Dr. Colm Henry, have had meetings with clinicians and clinical directors.  There is a lot of direct engagement with consultants.</p> <p>  Specifically with regard to the IHCA, reinforced from my days at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is that we must respect the industrial relations process, which has a channel to work through in the first instance.  I can only expect that the IHCA will be involved in the process at some stage but we must respect the process as it leads out.  In my direct discussions with the IHCA and at its conference I said very clearly it must be part of the solution.  It relentlessly challenges us on a range of issues, very understandably.  Some of the issues are service related but the IHCA has also challenged us on our capital plan, Sl&aacute;intecare and the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  It must be part of the solution as well as identifying some of the major issues.  I said this very clearly at the IHCA's conference and to people directly.  There has been direct engagement with the IHCA and I expect it will be part of the process at some stage, but we must respect the industrial relations process.</p></speech>

All I am saying is that over the last number of weeks a different message seems to have been conveyed to them and I am concerned about that.</p> <p>  I want to move on to another issue, namely the elective hospital in Cork.  There appears to be a structure set up within the HSE with no involvement by either of the local authorities in Cork or the university.  There seems to be a committee that nobody knows anything about.  We need to move on with the project in terms of identifying a site and then moving into the planning process, which will take some time.  Both local authorities have indicated to me that they have not heard from the HSE and that there has been no engagement.  I am concerned about that because this is an overall plan not just for Cork city but for all of Cork and the south west region.  I am a bit surprised at the silence surrounding this project.  I do not want to see a repeat of what happened with the Mater hospital, which went on for 25 years because we cannot afford that in Cork.  I seek clarification on that issue and would like it in writing.</p></speech>

We have included the project in the capital plan but the Senator is rightly putting us under pressure to make sure that the preparatory work, in terms of sites and so on, is done quickly so that we do not have a gulf between now and the significant capital coming on stream.  In the interests of time, I will ask the CEO to revert to the Senator in writing.  We are eager to ensure - and I know that Mr. Reid shares this view - the process is inclusive of the bodies to which the Senator referred.  We will revert to the Senator in writing if that is acceptable to Mr. Reid.</p></speech>

I seek clarification but am not attempting to have a swipe at the Minister or his officials.  Over the years I have repeatedly asked questions about the adequacy of the health budget to meet the challenges faced by the health services in the course of the year.  At the beginning of every year I am always told that the budget is adequate and at the end of the year we find that it is not and there are reasons for that.  Every Department is asked at budget time to make projections for the year ahead and within each Department there are components which make a contribution but something is going wrong all of the time.  There is some shortfall that is not being addressed.  This is not a criticism of anybody at all and I am not making any political point here.  In terms of the delivery of the health services to the general public, we need to know that we have reliable information coming from reliable sources so that we can budget accordingly.  What is the answer to that question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#S01100"><p>If Deputy Durkan has difficulty using his 12 minutes, I am happy to give longer answers if that will assist, but I do not think he will.  Deputy Durkan is right to raise the issue of the health budget.  There is a number of parts to the answer.  First, we must be honest about the fact that the Oireachtas makes decisions outside of budget time.  The Oireachtas rightly decided this year that we needed to sort the nurses' industrial relations dispute which was not budgeted for.  We decided, through the various industrial relations mechanisms, that we needed to solve the SIPTU dispute.  We also decided that we needed to do more on Brexit and more in relation to Cervical Check.  Deputy Durkan, as a long-serving Member of this House, knows that budget day is a moment in time, albeit an important one, but in a dynamic environment like healthcare, decisions can be made after the budget which can have a significant impact.  We will see evidence of that this year as well.  I am interested to hear Mr. Reid's views on this.  There is an issue around making sure that we have better data and information in health to prepare us to engage in the budgetary process.  I must say, honestly, with the arrival of the new CEO and the new board structure, the financial information and data coming from the HSE in the context of that process is like night and day, so dramatic is the improvement.</p><p>I am pleased to say that when the Supplementary Estimate figure for health becomes clear in the coming days, it will be a very significant reduction on what was required last year because of very intense financial oversight by the CEO, the board and HSE managers and staff across the country and I thank them for their work in that regard.  The final point is that if we are talking about better outcomes and better value for the taxpayer's investment, then we must focus on the reorientation of the health service.  We must do more in the community and we must deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  I know that Deputy Durkan is a passionate supporter of the latter.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#T00200"><p>In terms of delivering against budget at the start of the year versus the end of the year, there are three forces that managers in the HSE and I must manage.  The first is obviously improving the services that we are delivering, which Deputies are quite rightly challenging us on in terms of where we are today; the second is providing a safe environment for all users of our services; and the third is doing all of that within the budget allocation that we have been given by the Oireachtas and Government.  They can be competing forces on a daily basis but we must make judgments throughout the year to keep those forces in balance together.  How are we doing that?  If one takes my opening statement on where we are this year in comparison to last year, one can seen a strengthened financial performance which I put down to a few factors.  We are now operating at a level where each hospital group CEO and each community officer attends a monthly meeting with the chief operations officer and the national director.  We go through slides, hospital by hospital, group by group, CHO by CHO, on service performance and financial performance.  They all have allocated budgets, month on month, to report back against.  That may sound like basic financial governance but it is really important and it is having an impact.  We have hospital group managers owning their budgets and CHO group managers owning theirs.  They are committing to actions for the following month and next Tuesday we will go through the whole process again.  The basic discipline of strengthening our financial management processes across the organisation is proving beneficial.  I can demonstrate that by pointing members to the current position on our budget this year compared to the same time last year.  Apart from the fact of being down on the same position last year in terms of the overrun, the mix is also important.  </p> <p>  If one looks at the &euro;16 billion budget that the HSE was allocated for the delivery of services, &euro;12 billion of that is for operational services, where we can hold individual managers, hospitals and CHOs to account.  On that funding, we have challenged the CHOs and everyone else not to go above &euro;100 million, which is accounted for by our acute and disability pressures.  The other &euro;4 billion of the &euro;16 billion budget relates to pensions and demand-led services.  We can get our arms around some aspects of that, like drugs reimbursement by using more biosimilar products, for example.  We are now challenging every clinician in this area and we now have data telling us which consultants in what hospitals and hospital groups are using biosimilars.  This is a much more cost-effective use of our drugs budget.  We have put a gain-sharing agreement in place with some hospitals and clinicians, whereby they are rewarded for the use of biosimilar products which makes a significant saving for us.  We can do a lot in some areas.  In summary, if one looks at our budget for this year, the largest part of the &euro;281 million overrun, at 53%, is in the demand-led areas where we are under pressure.  In fairness to the operations systems, they have a stronger control over and grip on the finances.</p> <p>  Regarding data, Members will be well familiar with the lack of a robust financial management data system across the health service.  There are remnants of the various health boards and the different systems that were in place in various areas.  I will not go back over the past but at the next board meeting on 18 October we will discuss and seek approval for an investment plan for a new integrated financial management system.</p><p>This system will be integrated across hospitals, including acute hospitals, community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and our section 38 organisations.  One of the pressures we have to deal with as part of this process is the management of finances within section 38 hospitals.  In summary, we will have improved financial controls and management processes, we are investing in a new financial management system, we will have greater clarity on what individual hospital groups and CHOs can control and will be able to hold them to account for those matters, and we will have to balance service pressures with patient safety pressures to mitigate risks, an issue which many members have raised.</p></speech>

That does not wash with the public or staff.  It frustrates the staff.  I am not being negative about it but, as a former Opposition spokesman on health, I would have thought that, when the Estimates are being drawn up at the beginning of the year, various known unknowns or unknown unknowns, as a certain president used to say, would be brought into play and their likely impact over the course of the year calculated.  I would have thought a prime cost, PC, sum would be included for issues of which the health service was not yet aware to ensure and safeguard the veracity of the Estimate.  The veracity of the Estimate at the beginning of the year is crucial.  We can increase the number on waiting lists by any amount while still maintaining the veracity of the financial Estimate, but that does not solve the problem; it does not deliver.  If we do not start delivering very quickly, confidence will be lost.</p> <p>  I will move on.  The Chairman can tell me when I am running out of runway.</p></speech>

There is no maternity cover at all for speech and language teachers.  That affects a sensitive group of people who require speech and language therapy as part of their treatment.  A teacher dropping out for six months, or less than six months, while no cover whatsoever is provided results in the child's general behaviour taking a downturn.  That is not fair to the child or the parents.  It frustrates and annoys parents.  It appears to be a simple issue to resolve.  It would certainly not cost billions and it should be dealt with.</p> <p>  I recently met a constituent whose child has scoliosis.  When that issue was highlighted on television a couple of years ago, we thought that it was going to be resolved very quickly.  It was not as if 2 million patients were affected; it was a particular cohort.  Delivery of services for that cohort should be the responsibility of a particular group within the health service.  </p> <p>  Who is responsible for failing to deliver in those two specific areas?  Dealing with these issues would not undermine the integrity of the general delivery of health services.</p></speech>

With regard to speech and language therapy, I am pleased that in this year's budget, we provided funding for 100 additional therapy posts across the country.  That was a big ask of the Minister, Deputy Finian McGrath.  Deputy Murphy-O'Mahony also highlighted the need for these 100 additional posts, which I acknowledge.  I am informed by the HSE that it expects all of those posts to be filled by the end of the year.  That will be one of the most significant increases in many years.  As I said in discussion with Deputy Donnelly earlier, I do not believe that this, in itself, is enough.  We are going to need to build on it in the future and we also need to look at how we deliver the model of care.  The pilot speech and language therapy programme in schools is an exciting model.  This has been done in the UK for a number of years and it has resulted in significant progress in respect of waiting times.  That is the role I would like this programme to fulfil.</p> <p>  With regard to scoliosis, I can provide the Deputy and the committee with an update in writing on our progress.  Responsibility lies with the children's hospital group, Children's Health Ireland.  There has been extraordinary focus on this area.  Additional staff have been provided and there was a significant increase in the number of operations performed last year compared to the previous year.</p><p>I need to be honest; we have a number of complex cases in which a number of different medical issues above and beyond scoliosis are at play.  In 2016 we carried out 224 procedures in this area, whereas last year we carried out 418, so I am satisfied that there is a massive focus on this area.  Of course, we need to continue improving.  Perhaps Mr. Reid would like to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.358" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#V00200"><p>I will quote the same figures and there are further figures that I can supply.  The number of expected interventions in respect of scoliosis has been significantly ramped up.  I will make two quick comments with regard to the Deputy's points on maternity cover and staff morale.  I am with the Deputy in respect of staff morale.  One of the priorities on which I have led personally since joining the HSE is, with my leadership team, to work and engage with staff to improve staff morale.  It is not always a matter of finance; it is also about the pressures staff are under every day.  We need to give them support and confidence.</p> <p>  There are arrangements in place with regard to maternity cover.  As the Deputy knows, we arrange agency cover, which comes at a significant cost to us.  A large proportion of our agency spend goes on maternity cover.  Approximately 35% of workers in the HSE are on various types of reduced hours or reduced working arrangements.  This is largely because the greater proportion of our staff are women.  We should support that and I encourage such support but it does result in a demand for agency support.  There is provision for maternity cover within the various settings.</p></speech>

It was much appreciated.  It is long-awaited and will be enjoyed by the vast number of people who will attend it from the catchment area throughout County Kildare.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming before us.  As the Minister is aware, Bantry General Hospital is the only rural model 2 hospital.  Last December, the Minister announced great things for the hospital, including the endoscopy unit and rehabilitation services.  Where does that all stand at present?  Will the Minister guarantee that the overspend on the national children's hospital will not affect the plans for Bantry?  The hospital provides a great service to the people of west Cork.  It helps people avoid travelling to the city, where they would take up bed spaces, so when Bantry General Hospital is running well it is a win-win situation.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the Minister of State has taken an active interest and has led for me on this issue because he is a representative of the constituency.  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony has rightly continued to highlight this issue and I thank her for doing so.  I will answer with regard to the national children's hospital and then Deputy Daly may go into the specifics regarding Bantry.  Let me be very clear; the national children's hospital will have absolutely no impact whatsoever on this project or any other capital project.  The reason for that - I remind Deputy Kelly that he will get another 12 minutes shortly - is that in compiling the summer economic statement, we made a decision to put aside additional resources for the national children's hospital.  As a result, all of the various projects across the country which many people said would not go ahead-----</p></speech>

She has been very consistent on it and that is much appreciated.  I was at a meeting with the management team in the hospital on Monday.  We met the CEO of the hospital group, Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer, and the CEO of Cork University Hospital, CUH.  The team from the department of surgery in CUH was also present with a view to increasing the available theatre time.  As the Deputy knows, the theatre is only open two and a half days a week.  We are making consistent strides towards getting that theatre open five days a week in order to build greater theatre capacity within the greater Cork area.  That is very good news and positive not only for west Cork, but for all of Cork because some of the waiting list in CUH can be dealt with in Bantry when this is achieved.  We are making good progress on that front.</p> <p>  The endoscopy unit has been confirmed in the capital plan.  There will be a meeting in the HSE tomorrow with regard to the detail of the capital plan.</p><p>It is on track and progress is being made on it.  I assure the Deputy that the rehabilitation unit announced by the Minister on his visit to Bantry is still very much to the fore.  It was discussed at length at our meeting last Monday with the hospital group and the management teams of CUH and Bantry hospital and will continue to be discussed at those monthly meetings.</p></speech>

We will launch the HSE influenza campaign next Thursday and will encourage healthcare professionals and those in at-risk groups to avail of the vaccination.  I am encouraged by the significant and welcome increase in the number of people over the age of 65 who got the flu vaccine last year.  I welcome the incredible work of staff in our hospitals and community health organisations who are encouraging peer vaccination.  However, in spite of the significant increase, not enough healthcare professionals avail of the vaccination.  I would welcome cross-party support on this issue and would support all of us speaking with one voice.  We will run several advertisement campaigns and have a large public launch to address the importance of the flu vaccine.  I encourage healthcare professionals to get the vaccine.  It will protect them and those with whom they come in contact.  There has been progress in this regard in recent years, but we need to see more.  Dr. Henry will address the question on the new vaccine.</p></speech>

According to reports from Australia, there was an earlier than expected peak in flu-like illnesses there but it did not sustain.  That bodes well for us in the northern hemisphere in terms of the likely impact of the flu.  It is the H3N2 strain, for which the vaccine is effective.  Based on the experience in Australia, which largely informs our experience during the winter, there may be an early onset but it will not be sustained.  The impact will be low in terms of severity and the strain of flu is susceptible to the vaccine we will introduce.</p></speech>

What about a nine year old with special needs?  While I welcome this, it is important that all children with special needs, regardless of age, get a medical card.  Are there plans to extend the card to such children?</p></speech>

It will ultimately be extended to children under the age of 12.  I want the parents of primary school children not to have to worry about the cost of going to the GP.  The budget will decide the pace at which we can do that.  The Taoiseach and I have publicly stated that we would like to extend it next year to those under the age of eight.  That will require legislation, the support of the Oireachtas and agreement with the IMO on the fee to be paid.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a fair point regarding equity and people who do not fit within certain age cohorts.  With the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, we changed the law to provide every child with special needs in receipt of domiciliary care allowance with an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  That was championed by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  All Members will be aware from their constituency clinics that the measure has helped many people in terms of no reviews and so on.  That is one change we have made.  Anyone who has a disability and receives domiciliary care allowance automatically receives a medical card.  That is welcomed by all members.</p> <p>  On broader eligibility, I am conscious that Ms McGahey will appear before the committee to deal with Sl&aacute;intecare at the end of the month.  The Department will commence a significant body of work on eligibility, encompassing who should be eligible, who should pay, what constitutes universal healthcare and how we will meet costs.  We will examine those issues.  I agree with the Deputy.  My policy position is that once we provide for those aged under 12, as we should, eligibility should be extended based on income and need rather than being in a specific age cohort.</p></speech>

He highlighted his difficulty in navigating the medical card system.  I also had a very good meeting with representatives of the Irish Cancer Society.  I have asked Mr. Wall and certain other stakeholders, including the Irish Cancer Society, to meet the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and consider providing better patient information on how people with an illness can navigate the medical card system.  We provide medical cards for persons with a terminal illness.  There is an emergency medical card and a discretionary medical card that can be granted if someone has a terminal illness that is not reviewed.  Currently, such cards are issued if someone has a terminal illness and is likely to live for approximately 12 months.  Mr. Wall has asked me to consider, as the Deputy probably would also, people who will live for 13 months, 14 months, two years or three years.  It is not an exact science; it is medicine.  Thankfully, people are living longer because of medical improvements.  I have committed to reviewing this issue and examining the definition of a terminal illness and how the medical card system interacts with it.  These two issues relate to Mr. Wall.  We are due to meet again at the end of November.  I will keep the Deputy updated in that regard.</p></speech>

The committee may wish to meet representatives of the PCRS and the medical card section and provide feedback.  We constantly try to improve our processes.  The HSE has done a very good job in going online with <i>medicalcard.ie</i>.  When I first visited the medical card centre in Finglas, there was paper all over the place which had come in the post.  One can now apply and upload documents online.  One can take a photo on one's iPhone and submit it.  One receives a text message in order to track a submission.  There is always room for improvement.  If there are difficulties in that area, we should work together to address them.</p></speech>

He must admit that the position on homecare packages is almost at crisis point.  People are crying out for such packages.  Those who pass the assessment are being told that there is no one available and that the HSE will get back to them when something becomes available.  They are left in that position for months.  It is very cost effective to keep people in their homes and provide them with a small amount of help.  Are there plans to increase the provision for this area in the budget?  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>

It will be a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, next Tuesday.  The Deputy has made a valid point on homecare.  Everyone in the room shares the frustration at people receiving HSE approval for two hours help per week but being placed on a waiting list.  That is very frustrating for all of us.  There are more than 6,000 people who want homecare but cannot access it.  I wish that was not the case.  It would cost approximately &euro;50 million to clear the list.</p></speech>

I have outlined the problem.  A statutory homecare scheme is being designed, the details of which I intend to unveil in January.  We have committed under Sl&aacute;intecare to introduce it in 2021.  The scheme will operate along the lines of the fair deal scheme, in that it will be statutorily available when sought.</p><p>What we could do for the next 12 months is interfere in the current system and put a band aid on it, but instead we will take the time to devise an entirely new scheme of homecare support that will not have the postcode lottery aspect that bedevils the current scheme.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#Y00600"><p>I thank all of the delegates for coming.  I will start with a number of questions about the hospital consultant issue, even though many others have also contributed on it.  </p> <p>  My concern is that ten years on from the recession, we are not making inroads in recruitment.  Sl&aacute;intecare, on which many members of the committee worked a number of years ago, is a roadmap for a period of ten years, but it will not be doable if we do not have the necessary front-line staff.  For example, Beaumont Hospital recently lost three dermatologists to the private sector.  It now has only one whole-time equivalent in dermatology and 400 patients have been referred for dermatological treatments in the private sector or elsewhere.  Here we are again, with consultants being poached by the private sector.  In the Bons Secours Hospital in Cork the last 12 appointments have been made from Cork University Hospital.  There is a huge amount of leeching.  An emergency department consultant left Tallaght Hospital recently to enter the private sector.  I understand the argument about the market and consultants, but when one looks at the sub-specialties where there is very little private work such as emergency medicine, psychiatry and paediatric radiology, these are areas in which we have some of the most acute recruitment problems.  We continue to recruit administrative staff, as Senator Colm Burke pointed out, but we are losing front-line staff such as nurses, consultants and the people we need to do the work on the front line.  I know from talking to hospital consultants that they are very disheartened.  </p> <p>  Reference has been made to the IMO letter, but we must consider the issue of false economies and locum staff.  A locum anaesthetist in Bantry was paid &euro;415,000 to do a job last year which is far in excess of the salary of a permanent consultant.  Tet locum consultant had no role in education, training or any of the other work in which permanent consultants engaged.  To my mind, the total cost to the health service is almost &euro;600,000, which is not sustainable.  There are 108 consultants who are not on the specialist register, SpR.  As members know, they are concentrated in regional hospitals, which is a huge risk.  While I did consider naming the hospitals in question, I decided that it would not be fair to the representatives who are here.  There is a figure of &euro;3 billion in State Claims Agency costs, 90% of which comprises health claims.  We are training the most doctors, exporting the most and then poaching them from developing countries which is in breach of WHO guidelines.  Despite plans, including implementation plans, and so forth, I am very concerned that we will end up in a situation where we will not have the expertise required.  There was an acceptance a number of years ago that the country was on its knees and that we would have to put our shoulders to the wheel.</p><p>Many consultants are running out of patience.  I am concerned that we are dumbing down our health service and dumbing down quality.  It may get to the point of no return and we may never be able to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Perhaps the Minister or an official can tell me how many consultant posts around the country are unfilled.  What is being spent on locums and temporary staff?  </p><p> Another massive issue is the annually increasing spend on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This obviously has its benefits in that people get treated, but it is not a sustainable model of care for treating patients in the system.  It was always expected to be a sticking plaster for areas in which there were capacity issues rather than an attempt to stop a haemorrhage.  It was not supposed to export our patients.  </p><p> The consultants claim that &euro;20 million per year will attract consultants home.  They claim they will not work on the same corridor as someone who earns more than them for doing the same job.  It seems very reasonable.  I agree with the Minister that it is about far more than pay, but it must start with pay parity.  Something has to be done and some way forward has to be found.  These people are not just doctors, they are the people who are running the system and who have corporate knowledge of the Irish system.  If we lose the goodwill of the consultants, we will never be able to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I would like to put some figures on the record of this committee, because I believe they are important.  I accept there is a challenge in respect of recruitment and retention and that pay parity needs to be addressed.  I have said that, I believe it, and I do not disagree with Deputy O'Connell in that regard.  There is the whole-time equivalent of 3,153 consultants in the Irish public health service.  More than 600 additional consultants have been recruited over the past five years and 139 additional consultants have begun working in the health service over the last 12 months.  While I accept there is a challenge in respect of recruitment and retention, people are sometimes of the opinion that there are now fewer doctors and that we are losing doctors.  The statistics do not show that.  More than 600 additional doctors have entered the health service over the past five years, including 139 over the past 12 months.  That does not take away from the point Deputy O'Connell makes about the very significant issues in recruitment and retention.  The CEO will speak to vacancy levels and so on in a moment.</p> <p>  I am deadly serious about sitting down with consultant representative bodies to do two things.  I want to address the immediate challenges with regard to recruitment and retention, of which I accept pay is an element.  I also want to build on the Public Sector Pay Commission's findings.  The Deputy should remember that we, as a Government, saw this as such an issue that we asked the Public Sector Pay Commission to carry out a body a work on it.  The commission told us to sit down and engage and I want to do that.  </p> <p>  I will need the help of the consultants to do the second thing I want to do.  Deputy O'Connell talked about the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, into which she has put a lot of work and a lot of her personal time.  It is disappointing that, every time we move forward with an element of Sl&aacute;intecare, I hear from the representative bodies that they do not agree with it.  The speed at which the de Buitl&eacute;ir report was dismissed by representative bodies is very disappointing.  The Deputy talked about international comparisons.  The OECD report I commissioned, which we also published that day, shows that Ireland is out of sync with other countries in respect of private practice in public hospitals.  Phase 1 - and it will have to be phase 1 because sequencing is important - will have to be talking about the immediate recruitment and retention challenges, of which pay parity is an element.  That needs to be done before we can talk about reform.  We will start that process with the INMO next week.  I want to expand those talks to include other bodies such as the Irish Hospital Consultants Association in due course.</p> <p>  We will then need to move to phase 2, which will have to be about the Sl&aacute;intecare reform agenda.  I accept that one cannot be done without the other.  We have very hard-working doctors working under a lot of pressure and they need to realise that the political system and I want to support them.</p></speech>

On the issue of pay, I will restate my own position.  Having spoken directly with consultants and the consultants' association, there is no doubt that this is an issue of equity which is capable of causing an issue of morale.  It is also an issue of recruitment and, equally, of retention.  People are having different experiences when they go elsewhere.  Having said that, the second point I want to make is that I have spent a lot of time with the chief clinical officer in direct engagement with consultants across the acute system.  I agree that we need their goodwill and that we need to hear their voices and the issues they are raising with regard to service delivery.</p><p>There is fairly regular direct engagement between clinical directors and consultants across the system.</p><p> There are significant vacancies throughout the country.  The Minister referred to 39 such vacancies.  There have been 144 in the past 12 months by my count.  There are 78 recruits in the final stages of assignment, which should further enhance recruitment numbers.  There are approximately 377 posts vacant across various disciplines.  Some people claim there are approximately 500 such vacancies but the registered number is approximately 377.  We have several initiatives for consultants led by our national doctors training and development unit, which is looking at what we can do to attract applicants to certain specific disciplines.  </p><p> On the Deputy's final comment, we must address some work practice issues apart from pay as part of a process of engagement with consultants.  There are significant challenges attracting consultants to certain elements of the acute system.  That is a factor with which we will deal regardless of whether the pay issue is settled.  These are challenges in certain acute settings.  The committee has a list of them.</p></speech>

It is difficult for a doctor working in a busy hospital in Dublin to hear that a locum doctor in Bantry who can put on his coat at the end of his shift and walk out the door is being paid &euro;415,000.  A permanent consultant cannot walk out the door, go home and cook dinner for his or her children, but the guy in Cork who can walk out is getting one and a half times the salary but none of the hassle, if one wants to call it that, or the training and development.  One can understand why people lose faith in the system.</p></speech>

All present are aware of the expansion of the industry onto high streets and, clearly, how profitable it must be if rates and so on can be paid on such a number of outlets for these products.  If the products are to be marketed as a smoking cessation aid, they must be subjected to the normal regulatory approval processes and procedures.  However, it appears that they are a technological drug delivery device.  If they are not smoking cessation products, they are, essentially, glorified cigarettes.

It has been formulated to penetrate the lungs and blood system to a greater extent than cigarettes do.  The raw material is nicotine, which tobacco companies have plenty of and want a market for.  Somewhat like the Minister's thinking on vaccination, I am instinctively inclined to ban vaping altogether but I realise that is not possible.  Will achievable regulations be brought in?  Are we going to protect our children by banning these products?  Will there be education on them in schools?  It seems that much capital was spent on smoking cessation and we now have these new products, some of which are 20 times as addictive as cigarettes.</p></speech>

They are targeting our children.  It is clear what they are doing.  Large cigarette companies, which know the war on tobacco is under way and that we are heading towards a tobacco-free Ireland, are mooching into a new area.  I was in a petrol station a few nights ago.  Some time ago, the Oireachtas decided to bring in plain packaging and block the advertising of cigarettes.  However, when I looked behind the counter in the station, I noticed that all of that advertising has been replaced by advertising for e-cigarettes.  I am appalled at the number of Oireachtas Members who ask me to meet representatives of vaping companies.</p><p>I will never meet them, so Members - I am not referring to anyone in this room - can stop asking me to do so.  This is a new arm of the tobacco industry, it is a threat to our children's health, and we need to call it out.  What are we going to do about it?  We will first ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children, people under the age of 18.  We will bring draft legislation to Cabinet this month, I think, to do that.  We in the Houses of the Oireachtas have a really good record of taking public health decisions on a cross-party basis, and I look forward to working with the committee in that regard.</p><p> Beyond the sale of e-cigarettes to children and the benefits or otherwise of vaping as a cessation tool, it is fair to say the evidence is evolving at a very rapid pace.  HIQA did an assessment of this in 2017.  I have now asked the Health Research Board, HRB, to look at the potential harmful impacts of e-cigarettes, vaping or whatever one wishes to call it.  Its response is due next March.  Step one, then, is to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children.  Step two is to look at the HRB evidence in March and see what further action we need to take.  My instinct, not as a doctor but as someone who talks to doctors, is that there may be - may be - an understandable logic to a person already on tobacco moving to e-cigarettes.  However, that is very different from targeting 14, 15 and 16 year old kids with nice, colourful things and children's flavoured e-cigarettes and advertising them to try to get around our rules on plain packaging.  We will therefore have to take this very seriously and be very vigilant about it.  The first step forward is banning the sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s.</p></speech>

We have a very serious problem in University Hospital Limerick.  The problems facing hospitals in general are capacity, consultant numbers and diagnostics.  One of the critical points in Limerick is the lack of a second MRI scanner.  I know that Mr. Reid mentioned the HSE is considering whether to buy or lease a scanner, but the absolute urgency of a second MRI scanner in Limerick cannot be stated strongly enough.  Many people in hospital are waiting unnecessarily for MRI scans to determine whether they are admitted or discharged or to make proper diagnoses so they can have proper management plans.  I refer in particular to neurological conditions but also cancer.  Unless Limerick is supplied with a second MRI scanner, the problems we see there every day, 70 or 80 people waiting on trolleys, will remain.  Trolleys are just a manifestation of what is happening within the hospital itself.  Casualty is not the problem; the problem is what is happening in the house of the hospital.  There must be a second MRI scanner in Limerick immediately.  What will the Minister do about this?</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Woods to update us on the HSE's position on how we advance this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#BB00400"><p>I had dialogue with the group chief executive last week.  Like the Chairman rightly said, on that day I think there were 44 patients in the hospital awaiting an MRI scan, which is clearly a key factor in patient flow.  I will come to the Chairman's main point presently.  What we have done in the short term is bring MRI capacity outside of the hospital where we can but, clearly, this only works to a certain extent.  The NTPF has worked with us in this regard, which has been helpful, over last winter and in this part of the year.  The underlying point, that Limerick requires a second MRI scanner, is agreed, and we are looking at options including, as the Minister said, winter funding.  I think the quickest option is to acquire a leased MRI scanner.  The timescales around acquisition and building would be longer.  We will therefore look at the option of putting a leased MRI scanner on site as part of our winter programme.  The implication for us is a cost that I think has been referenced at approximately &euro;1 million to &euro;1.4 million, but a second scanner is a key requirement that is fully accepted, so we are working with the group on what that would look like on the ground.</p></speech>

Will it be provided this year?  Will it be provided before Christmas?</p></speech>

Clearly, we would look to accelerate that as quickly as possible, but we would require some level of procurement and perhaps a little guidance from procurement colleagues on that.  Such a transaction tends to take six to eight weeks to complete, as I understand it.  The other challenge we face is simply to address the challenge of the funding that is required for the hospital.  We do, however, recognise the need for the scanner and are keen to move on it.</p></speech>

To be helpful and constructive, I ask the chief executive to arrange for the HSE to have a meeting, as well as its meeting with midwest representatives, within a fortnight to discuss issues in the hospital in Limerick and in the hospital group, specifically the issue of the MRI scanner.  If we could arrange that, it would be great.</p></speech>

The second point I wish to make concerns the trolley problem.  In the month of September the number of people on trolleys was 40% higher than in the same month last year, so whatever reforms are happening or whatever the Minister is doing is quite patently not working.  I will give him some examples.  Moving away from trolleys, there are patients suffering greatly because of bed capacity problems, not necessarily just because they are on trolleys.  There are patients for whom we as GPs must fight to get them into the system.  It is not just a matter of asking for a consultation; it is actually a fight to get people into the system.  There are patients in the midwest who have cancer and who have been waiting six months for a basic diagnostic procedure.  A number are cancelled or time out.  I was in contact with one patient this morning, an elderly gentleman who has been waiting for surgery for a number of weeks.  He was admitted on Sunday night and fasted all day Monday and all day Tuesday, and today is Wednesday and he still has not had his surgery.</p> <p>  The Minister cannot just dismiss these issues by saying the numbers are improving.  There are real stories behind each one of these patients.  I do not think he recognises the urgency of that.  I just did not get a sense of urgency this morning from the opening statements he and Mr. Reid made.  I just want the Minister to respond.  How urgently will he address the bed capacity issue and the consultant capacity issue?  I understand from what he said today that he has now written a letter to the IMO.  He committed to doing that before the summer recess.  He did it on the last day of September.  He has not contacted the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  The recruitment and retention of consultants is a huge barrier because it can be proven that if a consultant or two are added to a team, that waiting list drops immediately.  Addressing recruitment and retention is therefore the key to reducing the number of people on waiting lists and trolleys.  What urgency does the Minister attach to this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#CC00600"><p>I hope, politics aside, that the Chairman does not doubt the commitment I attach to the urgent needs of our patients.  Nobody has a monopoly of concern or compassion for them.  In the Chairman's region, when he and others approached me and said they could not wait for the capital plan and that something had to be done about bed capacity in Limerick, we went ahead together and found the funding in advance of the capital plan to proceed with the 60-bed modular unit.  Unlike previous Governments, which during boom times decided there were too many hospital beds in the country - that gets airbrushed from history now - and shut them down, my record is that in every single year I have been Minister there have been more beds in the Irish health service.</p> <p>  Looking at recruitment and retention truthfully, we had a major issue with GPs, a major issue with our nurses and midwives and a major issue with our consultants - and others, but I will take just those three significant groups.  We have worked our way through the GP process.  We have more to do, but the GP community itself has endorsed by 95% the arrangement we reached.  I know that the Chairman, while acknowledging there needs to be a new contract, has welcomed the progress in that regard.  With the nurses and midwives we have come up with an agreement that will see more money put into nurses' pockets, which was ratified by 66% of nurses and midwives.  My next big body of work on recruitment and retention in the health service concerns consultants.  As Minister for Health, however, I find that on some days I come into the Houses of the Oireachtas and everybody wants to get very irate about the overspend on health while, on other days, I come in and before 11.30 a.m. we have probably racked up a bill of &euro;500 million or more.  There are competing demands in the health service.  That is why we must reform it.  I know that that is why the Chairman is passionate about it, but so am I.</p><p>I am absolutely passionate about reform in the health service.  We would like to do it a million times more quickly, but we have taken major decisions in the past six months alone such as on the agreement with GPs, the breaking up of the HSE into new structures and engagement with consultants.  We are genuinely putting the building blocks in place.  As Minister, I will, rightly, be held to account on day-to-day issues, but I am satisfied that the things to which I have referred are the blocks that will build a better health service.  A compelling case has been made by members today, as well as by colleagues from the mid-west, as to why we need to move on the question of MRIs.  As it sounds like the lease model will deliver on it much more quickly, we need to explore it urgently and rectify it.</p></speech>

When the service plan is published, the first line is always that it will be challenging to meet demand and demographic change and provide for the introduction of new services.  Having a "challenging" budget implies that the HSE will not be able to deliver the services it wants to deliver.  If it goes over budget, it is because it is delivering more services to deal with the unmet need that has built up.  If we are to meet our target and come in under budget, there has to be reform of the system because it is inefficient.  Senator Colm Burke referred to the number of non-front-line staff employed every year.  It must take a huge number of non-front-line staff to run an inefficient service.  It is absolutely essential in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare that there be urgency, but I do not get a sense that there is that urgency in the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  How urgently is the Minister addressing the issue?</p></speech>

I hope the committee and the Oireachtas will help me to deliver the bits that are not just the nice fluffy bits.  We can all say we are in favour of more homecare services - Sl&aacute;intecare - and dismantling the HSE, which is the right thing to do.  The HSE and the excellent people who work in it know that its current structure is not configured correctly.  It is a thorny issue to tell people that they have to change the way they work.  Today a consultant is allowed to engage in private practice in a hospital in Limerick, while there are 80 patients on trolleys in the same hospital.  There will be a moment when people will have to nail their colours to the mast and I cannot wait until we get to that moment.  Are people in favour of Sl&aacute;intecare and what it actually means, or they in favour of it as though it was a Rose of Tralee-type concept?  I am in favour of the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, which will mean big and significant changes.  It will mean paying consultants more and tackling issues such as pay parity.  It will mean greater bed capacity, but it will also mean no more business as usual.  It will mean fewer managers in the health service and ultimately lead to a voluntary redundancy scheme as we streamline management.  Where there are two finance functions today, one for community services and one for hospitals, there will have to be one.  Front-line staff who are brilliant and do an excellent job will have to look at different ways of working and we will have to remunerate and support them accordingly.  The Chairman is beyond reproach on this matter.  I accept his bona fides, but I know the clear views of everybody in the House, including Deputy Kelly, on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  I challenge every political party represented in the D&aacute;il to issue a statement this week confirming whether it is in favour of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.</p></speech>

I am referring to the south-east palliative care centre, which is part of the Dunmore wing of University Hospital Waterford.  The top three floors will house 72 acute beds run by hospital management, with the bottom two floors being a new, state-of-the-art palliative care facility.  Local Oireachtas Members, including some of the Minister's colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, got a tour of the facility last week.  Palliative care will be run by the CHO but the problem is that only &euro;300,000 has been allocated as a start for staffing and revenue funding.  People in the south east are scandalised by the fact that the building is built, fully equipped and ready to be opened but has not yet received the revenue funding.  We have met with officials who have told us that even when they get the funding they will have to recruit staff and we could be talking about a year or more before the unit becomes operational.  How much will it cost to fully staff the palliative care unit?  Why was the funding not given much earlier, given that we knew this was going to be completed and fully equipped in the summer of this year?  It could be lying idle for months or a year but patients in the south east deserve the same palliative care options as people in other parts of the country.</p> <p>  In responses to parliamentary questions, the Minister said there would be an allocation arising from the overall funding for palliative care in the Estimates.  Will the full allocation, of &euro;4.5 million or &euro;4.6 million for next year and &euro;5 million for subsequent years, be given in the Estimates so that the unit can be fully opened?</p></speech>

I respect the way they work on a cross-party basis on issues of importance in the south east as it is effective.  I am very aware of concerns of people in the south east over this issue.  They have a new state-of-the art facility in the shape of the Dunmore wing, which will house an incredible palliative care facility.  My understanding is that the south-east palliative care centre was constructed at a cost of &euro;31.26 million and I thank the Waterford hospice movement which I think has agreed to provide &euro;6 million to the HSE towards the cost of the lower level and level 1 palliative care services.  There is incredible community support for this and it will be the first inpatient and day service specialist care unit for the south east and will also cover Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Wexford.  When fully operational there will be 20 inpatient bedrooms with individual gardens for anybody who requires the expertise of specialist palliative care multidisciplinary teams.</p><p>There is an allocation of &euro;300,000 for this year for this hospice and for a number of others.  Deputies Donnelly and Brady will be aware of one in Wicklow.  We cannot open the centre now until we have the certainty that the &euro;4.8 million will be in place for 2020.  I am very hopeful that we can resolve this matter together this week.  I do not want to get involved in the <i>minutiae</i>but there will be a time lag as it will take time to recruit the appropriate staff to provide the services.  We have the funding of &euro;300,000 to begin the process and my job is to make sure we have the funding for 2020 so that management can proceed with certainty.</p></speech>

My question is specific to University Hospital Limerick.  I have looked back at the overcrowding data on individual days for the past month and there has been an average of 67 people on trolleys.  In September last year the average was 44.</p><p>This is no longer a political issue, it is a human rights issue.  I am seeking confirmation from the Minister that there is a radical plan to address this issue.  The 60-bed modular unit is under construction and my understanding is that it will be completed by June next and operational by September.  I understand also that planning and design in respect of the 96-bed acute block is under way.  Following this historical reconfiguration there will be more than 150 additional beds but until such time as the 60-bed block is in place, we need a radical plan to deal with overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick.  Today, there are 47 people awaiting discharge.  The figure for this time last year was eight.  Owing to the lack of beds in Limerick, the focus must be on discharges.  Can the Minister give a commitment in regard to the transitional funding under the fair deal scheme?  </p><p> The Minister referenced the MRI scanner.  The existing scanner is at breaking point.  If it were to break down, would it take six or eight weeks to replace it?  The situation has reached crisis point.  An MRI scanner needs to be provided with immediate effect.  Six or eight weeks is too long for the people on the ground.  When will a radical plan and transitional funding be put in place for University Hospital Limerick to improve the discharge rate and provide a new MRI scanner?</p></speech>

The Senator is correct in terms of his remarks in regard to the 60-bed modular unit.  I know we are only as good as the next thing we can do for this region and that it is important that we do an awful lot more.  I get that.  We do have a plan to increase bed capacity by 150 or more, with the 60-bed modular unit well under way.</p> <p>  There are three areas we need to address.  We need to examine how we can work as a group.  As mentioned by the Senator, reconfiguration has happened.  It happened many years ago, long before I became Minister or a Deputy.  We do still have capacity within other hospitals on occasion.  We need to look at how we use the group and the community together.  During my recently unannounced visit to Limerick and the hospital, I spoke to people from the area and to staff at the hospital and they all expressed the view that there is more that can be done in respect of the smaller step-down hospitals.  We need a plan.  </p></speech>

I have heard very clearly members' views on the issues of diagnostics and the MRI scanner.  It is the view of all members, echoed by the CEO, that we could free up capacity and get people in and out of the hospital a lot quicker if we had an additional MRI scanner.  I get that.  There is need for consideration of how best to achieve that and there is a funding requirement which we need to examine.  The Senator asked about social care and if, while we are waiting for additional beds, we can do more to help to get people home and into transitional care.  I expect to be in a position next week on budget day to put together a winter package that will include an increased social care dividend.  In terms of a timeline, I have suggested that the HSE should meet mid-western representatives in two weeks' time to see how we can progress these issues together.</p></speech>

I, too, want to raise the hospital issues but there are number of points I will make that might support it.  On the MRI scanner, I note and welcome that the timeline for provision is pre-Christmas and I take on board that a complementary plan for the better use of associated hospitals in the group will be put in place.  There are other issues that need to be addressed, including recruitment of an MS nurse, for which I have been fighting for a year.  I have been told that funding is in place, that the position has been advertised but the recruitment has not progressed as it there must be a sign-off at a national level from on high, which ties in with the situation nationally in terms of recruitment.  Recruitment will help to address the issue of lengthy periods spent on trolleys and waiting lists for scans.</p><p>If there was an MS nurse in place, people would not be taking up hospital beds.  The lack of recruitment and an MRI scanner are leading to huge problems in the hospital.  All of the problems need to be addressed together.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on the plan for the better use of other hospitals associated with the group.</p></speech>

I know also, because the Senator raised it in this House a few weeks ago, that her view is that St. John's can and should do more and that it has a proposal for a 120 bed ward block, to which we will give consideration.  We first need to do the infrastructural upgrade of that hospital in terms of fire safety and so on.  The Senator will be aware that those projects are proceeding.</p> <p>  On the scanner, we have had a useful conversation this morning on the benefits of an additional scanner to the mid-west region in terms of trolley numbers.  The HSE and the Department will stress test that proposal and we will see if we can make progress in that regard.   On the MS nurse, while I am not familiar with the specifics, I am aware that the Senator has been championing that recruitment for some time.  An additional 68 staff were hired in the hospital in the last five weeks, more than 40 of whom are in the area of nursing.  I will undertake to make inquiries in regard to the MS nurse recruitment and I will hand over now to Mr. Reid to comment further on the mid-west in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#GG00300"><p>What has been put in place pre the winter plan is a &euro;10 million additional injection across the system, of which the mid-west is part.  This funding is, largely, funding directed by the Department and the HSE in terms of current expenditure, to try to address, pre the winter plan, some of the issues in terms of transitional care beds and to relieve pressure under the community support scheme, the nursing home support scheme and in respect of home help provision.  There has been some improvement in the last few weeks in terms of delayed discharges, which we would expect, in turn, to impact on trolley numbers.</p> <p>  I want to assure members that in terms of delivery all of these matters are urgent and a matter of priority everyday for our managers.  In terms of trolley count, including in the mid-west, over a three week period in September there was an increase of approximately 6.5% in people into our emergency departments, which is very significant.  I visited University Hospital Limerick and many of the acute hospitals throughout the country.  What we are seeing, particularly in the past few weeks, is an additional requirement for older persons coming through our emergency departments.  As members will be aware, in our acute settings the rate of admission generally is one in four or 25%.  In the case of older persons, it is one in two.  As I said, we are seeing a significant surge of older persons into emergency departments and, thus, a significant increase in terms of admissions.  The additional investment made ahead of the winter plan will have some benefit over the next few weeks as well as it starts to work back through the system.</p> <p>  On recruitment, in the period from July 2018 to July 2019 we recruited 2,895 staff.  Since the start of January this year, 1,138 staff were recruited into the health system.  The latter is a mix of nursing, midwifery, consultants, management and administrative staff.  On management and administrative staff recruitment, which I have examined in detail, 85% of these staff are front-line support staff.  We do have an issue and we will be reviewing the centre of the HSE in terms of management overhead.  However, I would like to reassure members that much of the recruitment is primarily targeted towards front-line services.</p></speech>

There is a recommendation for three such posts, but one would be welcome.</p></speech>

Sharon Butler Hughes played a pivotal part in exposing the laboratory computer glitch which resulted in the delay of thousands of screening test results.</p><p>She has been forced to break her privacy in recent weeks by going public about her concerns in that area.  The timeline with which she and thousands of other women have had to deal is shocking.  She was in contact with the Department on numerous occasions from the beginning of the year to at least 11 July.  The HSE and the Department knew in April and evidence is emerging that they were speaking in briefing notes provided for elected representatives during that period.  </p><p> On 9 July, she phoned the Department of Health and was told by an official that the Minister was fully briefed but on 10 July, the Minister stated that he only found out about the issue at about 6 p.m.  I understand that the Minister cannot know about everything that happens in the Department as it is a massive affair.  However, given the significant number of scandals that have occurred with regard to CervicalCheck and the period of time during which they occurred, would it not be the case that a Minister would say "if something does wrong here, raise alarm bells straight away and make sure I know"?  The defence that the Minister did not know what was happening in the Department with regard to this issue over a period of months, while the Department and the HSE knew and thousands of women found out is not good enough.  If a crisis had been occurring over a couple of months in a small shop in the Minister's constituency-----</p></speech>

I am very pleased that on behalf of the HSE, the CEO apologised about the IT glitch and that he took very swift action about commissioning an independent external rapid review.  I thank Professor MacCraith for carrying out that review.  He did not pull his punches.  He was very clear about the areas where improvement is needed.  However, I am also very conscious that I have exceptionally good and committed public servants in my Department who do an excellent job and who come in every single day, as do staff in the HSE, to do their very best to serve the public.  What I do not intend to do is reopen the findings of the MacCraith report.  I very much look forward to meeting Ms Butler Hughes.  We will arrange that shortly.  At the meeting, she will have an opportunity to discuss anything she wishes to discuss.</p></speech>

I accept the findings of the MacCraith report, which is very clear about what I knew and when I knew it, in full.  Most importantly, I am excited by its recommendations in terms of how we can make CervicalCheck even more responsive to women.  Mr. Reid and I, along with the CervicalCheck staff in Limerick, believe that the idea that someone would have to ring the Minister's office to find out where her smear test is constitutes a sign that we need to really improve how people can track their results.  That is what Sharon has helped to unearth.  Some of Professor MacCraith's recommendations in that regard are very helpful.  They include the idea that women should be able to track electronically.  I accept the MacCraith report in full.  I thank Sharon Butler Hughes for what she has done and look forward to meeting her.</p></speech>

We only screen for about four rare diseases through what is commonly known as the heel prick test.  Italy vastly expanded its screening programme over a very short time to include 40 rare diseases.  This was done during one year.  I know the Minister has engaged with the Italians.  Unfortunately, our failure to meet international best practice has had a devastating effect on families across the board, not least some of my constituents - Les and Lynda Martin and their family.  They have three young children, two of whom, commonly known as Cogs and Kiwi, have a rare genetic disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy, MLD.  I know the Minister met them recently.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ciaran Martin received a late diagnosis because when he received the heel prick test, it did not test for MLD.  His diagnosis has come far too late, his illness is terminal and he has only a short time left to him.  It is a heart-breaking and devastating issue that has been traumatic for his family.  Les Martin has begun a campaign to expand our national newborn screening programme.  I know the Minister recently appointed Professor Niall O'Higgins as chair of the national screening committee, which, hopefully, will meet before Christmas to lay out its programme.  A number of things need to happen.  </p></speech>

I know what a sincere help he has been to Les, Lynda, Cogs and Kiwi.  This is not a party political issue.  Both of us have got to know the family very well.  It is fair to say they have done a really important job in highlighting issues regarding our newborn screening programme.  I hope to meet Les Martin again in the next couple of weeks and I invite the Deputy to come to that meeting with me.  I must be honest.  I have been very honest with Les Martin, Senator Norris and others.  My gut feeling is that we should expand our newborn screening programme because when one looks at European and international norms, as my Department has done, one can see that some countries screen for fewer diseases than we do but many countries screen for far more.  It is fair to say that Italy probably screens for more diseases than nearly any other country but from memory, we are behind the European average in terms of what we screen for.  I think we should screen for more diseases.</p> <p>  However, I have told Les Martin and others and will continue to say that these are clinical decisions as well.  Under the Scally report, we have set up a new national screening committee, which was referenced by Deputy Brady.  I appointed the very eminent Professor Niall O'Higgins to chair it.  From memory, I appointed the other members of the steering committee this week and we will announce them in the coming days.  I hope the first meeting of the committee will take place, if not this month, then next month.  I have asked that the committee's first body of work be to review our newborn screening programme in line with international best practice.  We currently screen for eight conditions.  Should we screen for more?  I think we should but I have explained that this is a body of work that the screening committee needs to do.  </p> <p>  With regard to legislation, different countries have done different things.  Some have legislated in this area while others have not.  Senator Norris has brought forward a Bill, which I have spoken to him briefly about, but we have not yet engaged with it in detail.  I am committed to meeting him as well.  Let me meet Senator Norris and let the screening committee get its work under way.  This will be its first body of work.  Perhaps the Deputy and I could meet the Martin family in the next two or three weeks.  </p></speech>

This time last year, the Government made a commitment to hire an additional 114 assistant psychologists, which it more or less followed through with.  My understanding is that 300 people turned up for those interviews so we have roughly 186 extra people looking for a job and we talk about recruitment and retention.  According to information I received, some of those who were appointed to these 114 posts have already left their posts without carrying out any proper assessments or whatever responsibilities they had in their positions.</p><p>One individual spent their last week sending out 300 cancellations of appointments.  I wanted to raise this issue at this forum because, as we are all aware, Ministers do not know absolutely everything that is going on.  I wanted to flag the issue and I wanted Mr. Reid to know how difficult it is on both sides, because I am a realist.  The issue is that somebody within management is not giving the proper information to the relevant Ministers.  They are not cracking the whip, considering that there is a duty of care and responsibility with 114 new assistant psychiatrists.  Many of them are not allowed to carry out any work.  How many of them have left without doing anything?  If one person can send out 300 cancellations in a week, is there any possibility we can find out the truth?  Surely somebody in management with responsibility should be held accountable for that.  I would like to know who.</p></speech>

I do not know the details on who cancelled sessions but I do know that there is a review of the initiative being undertaken by the University of Limerick.  We hope to have the final report soon, around now.  The initiative was very different when we started with it.  There were different views on bringing in assistant psychologists.  We brought in 20 staff-grade psychologists at the time.  We have conducted a full review with the university to determine how the initiative has worked and to learn from whether we should expand it or operate differently.  I will have the results in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

There were substantial projections for making serious inroads regarding the waiting list for ancillary services or other services, such as child and adolescent mental health services.  It is a very positive development that we welcome, notwithstanding the Deputy's queries on some specific aspects.</p></speech>

I thank him particularly for coming to Belmullet hospital and for the courtesy he showed to the staff there and to those protesting outside.  I am aware of the issues discussed with him.  We will have a follow-on meeting, including on the commitments he made on the day.</p> <p>  I had several questions, as the Minister of State can imagine.  I am glad he is back.  The question I wish to ask is on Erris and the primary care centre.  Expressions of interest were sought some months ago for a new primary care centre in Bangor Erris.  What is the status of that?  I am a bit concerned that those who submitted the expression of interest have not been contacted yet.</p> <p>  Once expressions of interest are sought, does it mean there is an absolute commitment to the capital funding for the primary care centre and the necessary staff?  I am prioritising this question today because there are very serious circumstances in that the general practitioner covering the area is moving to another area, which will leave us without one.  I acknowledge the positions for Bangor and Glenamoy have been advertised separately but the only solid way forward is to have a fully staffed and resourced primary care centre in Bangor Erris to meet the needs of the population there.  The assessment of needs has already been made.</p></speech>

The Minister met some of the residents from the area when they attended the health committee on several occasions and he knows their concerns about the impact on their surroundings, their neighbourhoods and their homes, which are still collapsing, as well as the ongoing difficulties with the environment around the construction, which is going to continue for at least another decade with the development of the maternity hospital.</p> <p>  I want to raise two linked issues.  A second revised application has been lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In December 2015, 120 people, including myself, put in observations and submissions.  They have not been informed of this second revised planning application and there has been no notification.  I believe we are entitled to that.  It is kind of under the radar and we need to be informed of the process, if that is what is occurring.  Does the Minister or the HSE have a revised timeline from BAM in regard to the operational services of the national children's hospital?  Will that be made public and when?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that living near any major construction project will obviously cause significant disruption in an area.  As I said when Senator Devine introduced me to some residents here at the health committee, I think it is very important that the hospital constructors are good neighbours and keep people informed as to what is going on and consult with them.  I was told there were engagement fora in place.  The residents had expressed to me a view that more senior people need to attend those to keep them fully informed and I have passed that on.  Obviously, it is an unavoidable reality that when a major construction project goes on in an area, it causes a degree of disruption.  Trying to keep people informed and have good lines of communication open is basic good manners, and I would be very eager that this continues to happen.  Mr. Reid may have something to add.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, I spent some time yesterday on the site with the developers.  One thing that is quite impressive is that the first office one sees on the site is the community development office, which is located where people exit the Luas.  That is the way it should be in terms of demonstrating the commitment to the community and community gain.  From my previous life on local authorities, I know it is important for the residents to be kept on board throughout the process.  We can come back to the Senator in regard to the specific terms of any revised application, as I am not fully aware of it.</p></speech>

By way of figures, the number of delayed discharges in University Hospital Kerry this year is in excess of 3,000, which is almost in line with the trolley count for the year.  It does not take a genius to realise that if we solve one problem, we will go a long way to solving the other one.  Something else that is adding to the trolley count is the lack of availability of doctors on the on-call, late night service and at weekends.  There are specific difficulties for doctors from South Africa and other countries in regard to getting registered.  If that could be moved on, we would resolve a lot of that particular issue as well.</p><p>I understand the medicine reimbursement review has now been concluded.  There is not much public information about what the next steps will be or for what the review will be used.  Will the report be made publicly available?  What will the review be used for and what are the next steps?  Are there specific recommendations in the review?  Will this be a one-off process or an iterative process, which it is in other jurisdictions such as Scotland?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the work has now concluded and I expect to receive it shortly.  Yes, it is my intention to publish it.

There is a strategy where we will be taking on an additional 1,000 extra staff across the health service this year, including many extra nurses.  We can see that in the nursing numbers already.  There is a requirement, however, that our hospitals only hire those they are funded to hire.  It is just like schools and every other part of our public services.  There are more nurses this year than last year.  There will continue to be more.</p></speech>

She was sent a letter which stated:</p><blockquote>Thank you for referring the above patient to the CervicalCheck colposcopy clinic at University Hospital Kerry.  Unfortunately, we are unable to give this lady an appointment as her referral smear was done in the private sector.</blockquote> <p>That is not about prioritisation or that it will take a bit longer to see her.  Her doctor was told in writing that the hospital will not be seeing this patient.  The HSE statement stated &ldquo;it cannot direct acute hospitals&rsquo; colposcopy on matters relating to screening&rdquo; whereas it clearly has.  Since then, the HSE has come back and said that it accepts, with hindsight, that the email from the official may have led to confusion.</p><p>Will the HSE go further and accept that instruction went out from the executive that was flat-out wrong?  Calling it confusion is an insult to the hundreds of women who desperately sought help and were told they could not have it because of a clear instruction from the HSE.  Can it be accepted that this instruction was wrong?</p></speech>

The Chairman suggested that he felt no sense of urgency from the Minister.  I am not saying the Minister does not care.  We all care.  However, I do not get a sense of urgency from the healthcare system or the political leadership, which is the Minister.  I reiterate that I have read back through all the opening statements and there is no mention of the crisis in access.  We have the worst access that we have ever had in Ireland.  We have the worst access for patients through the public system of anywhere in Europe.  The Minister said he is deadly serious about wanting to sit down with consultant representative bodies, but then he cites what I think are unintentionally spurious reasons for meeting the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, first and not the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA.  The IHCA is fully compliant with industrial relations criteria to represent consultants, as of course is the IMO.  We have seen no movement on pay inequality in recent years, even though we know we have the lowest level of hospital consultants anywhere in Europe.  We know this is a major contributor to the inhuman waiting lists, yet there has been no movement in what is a pretty small number to reverse that.  The Minister is still going ahead with building private facilities into the national children's hospital and the national maternity hospital in spite of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, while stating that he supports that report.</p> <p>  I am not going to dwell on the attacks on Fianna F&aacute;il, but just to correct the record, because I know the Minister is keen on the record being straight, he seems to be suggesting that the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government took a load of beds out of the system, and for some bizarre reason he is increasingly referencing Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, presumably as some pre-election warm-up.  Between 2000 and 2004, Deputy Martin was Minister for Health and he added more than 1,000 beds.  In respect of the 14 years of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, the number of beds when it left Government was 1,000 more than when it came in.</p> <p>  The reality is that while I accept that the Minister cares, as we all care, the question is around prioritisation.  I do not see it and I do not feel the urgency.  The total health expenditure voted through this House over the past three years under Deputy Harris as Minister is about an additional &euro;3.5 billion, and in spite of that, access to public healthcare has collapsed.  If this is indeed such a priority, how has access collapsed given such a massive increase in funding for healthcare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#OO00300"><p>There are a number of questions there from Deputy Donnelly.  First, and I see him regularly making this point, I am not building private health facilities.  I am building rooms under the current rules that Fianna F&aacute;il was happy with in government, which allow those rooms to be used for private facilities.  The Deputy talks about the consultants a lot.  I would like him to go and talk to them about the use of those rooms because they would point out that they have a contractual right today to do private practice in public hospitals.  Unless the Deputy wants our doctors not to turn up at work, under their current contract they have a right to use those rooms.  I want to change those rooms.  I want them to be public rooms.  I do not want any private practice in public hospitals.  I would welcome Fianna F&aacute;il's position on that.  I see on the Fianna F&aacute;il website that it commits to the de Buitl&eacute;ir report on removing private practice from public hospitals.  The Deputy should say that.  It would be very helpful.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is in favour of removing private practice from public hospitals, we agree with this and we should get on and do it together.</p> <p>  On the beds argument, we will have this another day, probably in some television studio during some election, I hope in May 2020.  The number of day case beds might have risen but the number of inpatient beds fell at a time of economic growth in our country, and that is very regrettable.  I look forward to debating that point.</p> <p>  Access to the health service has not collapsed.  There is an absolutely serious issue with outpatients and a lot of the criticisms the Deputy makes regarding outpatients are valid.  I accept them.  We must do a hell of a lot better in relation to outpatients.  However, with inpatients it has dramatically improved.  The number of people waiting for hospital operations has improved.  Access to primary care, including the fact that we have expanded eligibility for free GP care, has improved.  I hope in the budget to expand access for more children to free GP care and to dental care.  That access is improving.  The fact that there are 100 more therapists means that access is improving.  If the criticism was of outpatients, I would take it and I should be held to account, but in general access has not collapsed.</p></speech>

That is the question.</p></speech>

We are doing more in the health service every year.  Our population over the age of 65 is growing.  Our birth rate is growing.  The complexity of cases is growing.  More and more people are now being seen quicker in many aspects in respect of many of our waiting lists, but we do have real pinch points in outpatients.  I do not believe that a ball of money will fix that.  It might help but doing more through general practice, primary care and the Sl&aacute;intecare reorientation is the only way we will do it.  I welcome the fact that we now publish outpatient waiting lists so the Deputy can ask me questions about it, which Opposition spokespeople were not able to do in the past.</p></speech>

With regard to Limerick, the Minister was talking about the additional beds and the building.  Just in terms of this winter, how many of those beds are going to be open, if any?  In the absence of those beds being open, what is being done to move the patients in the short term?  In the short term, there are 82 people on trolleys and they need somewhere to go.  I understand that at some point in the future there will be beds in the unit.  The pressure is already on them and they are not even been built, commissioned, staffed or anything.  The Minister referred to the new staff coming on stream.  Will he express that as a percentage or figure relative to the number of actual vacancies?</p> <p>  There is an emergency department task force.  I was on it years ago when it had a different name.  We had our regular meetings and they were important, but we were accustomed to meeting at very short notice when there was an urgent need for it.  Does the Minister not think there might be an urgent need for the emergency department task force to meet this week, perhaps as opposed to just hanging on until their next scheduled meeting, which I think is more than a week away?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right and again she knows the answer to this question.  The 60-bed modular unit is not going to be open for this winter.  I am not putting it forward as a solution to this winter.  I am just putting it forward as a commitment to increasing capacity in the mid-west.  What we are going to do this winter is a perfectly reasonable question.  Two things have emerged from our conversations today.  I gave a commitment that the HSE would meet mid-west Oireachtas Members within a fortnight.  One is whether we can improve diagnostic access in the hospital.  There seems to be an acute issue in terms of accessing MRI facilities, which hospital management and representatives think could, if resolved, really help patient flow.  The second thing is in the whole area of social care and delayed transfers of care.  Can we, through the budget next Tuesday, provide additional funding for more home care and more transitional care in the winter period?</p> <p>  The emergency department task force is due to meet next Thursday.  I think that is a sensible time to meet because by next Thursday I will have clarity in respect of winter funding.  The task force can usefully meet on that occasion.  Obviously, when the emergency department task force is not meeting, it does not mean I am not meeting very regularly with the HSE and the Department and remaining in touch with other stakeholders daily and sometimes several times a day.  The meeting next Thursday will be after the budget on Tuesday and I think we will be able to have substantive conversations.</p></speech>

I will get her to give the Minister a buzz.  Mr. Reid referred to gain sharing in terms of the use of biosimilars and suggested that the money could be ploughed back in.  With regard to gain sharing and the conversion of agency staff, this is something I have spoken to Mr. Reid's colleague, Mr. Mulvany, about <i>ad nauseam</i>and, God help him, he never gives a different answer, to be fair.</p><p>We all agree agency staff are more expensive.  It is not something anybody can dispute.  Where a hospital manager can convert expenditure on agency staff, can the money be used to recruit additional directly employed staff at the cheaper, more cost-effective rate?  Alternatively, if he or she manages to make the savings by converting from agency staff to directly employed staff, however reluctantly, does the money just go towards deficit remediation, as I suspect?</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly says, we are encouraging a conversion from agency staff to whole-time staff.  The resources available for agency staff are available to fund full-time staff.  We would, therefore, deliberately uplift the headcount ceiling of a hospital that previously had staff employed through an agency.  We would encourage it because, as the Deputy will be aware, it is better in both safety and financial terms.  We are approving posts like that.</p></speech>

Could I be given a number?  I presume that if that is the aim, a target has been set.  I am aware that targets were not set previously.  What Mr. Woods just said would be pretty meaningless if no targets were set.  Where targets are set, what is the conversion figure?  How many directly employed staff have been taken on?</p></speech>

I will make that known to the Deputy, if that is acceptable.  We are encouraging the conversion of as many as possible.  There is agency expenditure of just over &euro;400 million in the whole HSE.  Approximately half of that is in hospitals.  We are encouraging as much conversion as we can within-----</p></speech>

We have put in place a governance arrangement for the consultants through discussion with their respective mental health directors or the clinical directors in their hospitals to ensure we can assure patients going to them that they are keeping up to date with best practice, that they attend conferences within the hospital or meetings with their mental health directors and that they are keeping their education and training up to date.  Many of the doctors are well established and enhance services within their hospitals.

I am in touch with somebody in the constituency and she has raised the matter again with me again.  There has been some discussion on converting the building into accommodation for adolescents.  Could I have an update on that?  I advise the Minister that nine people were transferred from the Rosalie unit, much against the wishes of the community.  Three of them are now deceased.  It is a matter of great upset that it is just not known what is happening. </p> <p>  My final question is on a constituency-related matter.  A private company has put up a planning permission notice of its intention to build a private hospital in Swords.  The Minister might outline the extent of State involvement in that enterprise.</p></speech>

This is a quick-fire round.  I have tried to be non-political in this matter.  There is not enough urgency attached to the mid-west by the Minister and Mr. Reid in particular.  I am not going to tolerate what is going on there anymore.  I have to hold people to account to a level that has never been seen before.  It is going to happen.  I spent all morning dealing with cases in the hospital in Limerick.  Every time I walk out of the room, that is what I am dealing with.  A politician should not be doing that.  It is not that I do not want to do it.  I am sure the Chairman has to do the same.  It is not our role in life and it is not how the health service should function.</p> <p>  The 60-bed modular unit is a year behind.  I am not even going to go on about that.  That will not solve much.  It is not even possible to have infection control.  I encountered a case where the staff did not know what was wrong with a woman, yet they could not isolate her because they had not the capacity.  They ended up having to take her to a room in Nenagh.</p><p>Nenagh is not even ready for that.  There are so many issues here.  I put it to Mr. Reid that this needs an individual and complete piece of work.  It needs a complete, separate entity.  It is not Mr. Reid's fault; I have good time for Mr. Reid, which I have put onto the public record, and we have worked closely together.  I am not going to tolerate this any more, however.  I have been at this for 14 or 15 years but have never seen this before.  It is now October and can one imagine what it will be like in February?  What the HSE is trying to do relating to budgets is fine, but over the next years the whole thing needs to be recalibrated.  It is not currently being discriminated against, but the mid-west needs a &euro;40 million uplift on the current side, not just the capital side, in relation to everything I said earlier.  If it does not happen, then the mid-west will be discriminated against.  The HSE or the Department cannot say that I did not come up with short-term ideas for how to deal with this.  I have recycled these proposals over the last three or four years as the health spokesperson.  As for the MRI scanner, one can compare Limerick hospital with Beaumont Hospital to see how far behind Limerick is.  I have referred to the situation with doctors and nurses and have spoken on transitional packages.  I propose that Limerick hospital be turned into a seven-day hospital.  It would help if most things did not stop at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday.  The pathways towards the minor injury units in Nenagh and Ennis need to be extended.  I have been saying this for years, and the Minister will admit it. </p></speech>

The current way of transitioning people out of the hospital and into step-down facilities is not working.  I am dealing with Maria Bridgeman and Colette Cowan all the time.  They are two fantastic people and I have no issue with the management and the staff down there.  They are working but they are working in an environment that is impossible.  I ask Mr. Reid to please take this on board.  He should trust me when I say that I will take this to another level.  If I have to live inside the hospital, I will do it as an Opposition spokesperson.</p> <p>  With regard to gynaecological services in Letterkenny, the Minister has had correspondence on and is aware of a number of issues in respect of a case in 2017, some of which has been in the media and some of it which has not.  There was another case in 2019 and a further case has been brought to my attention within the past 48 hours.  Will the Minister indicate if he is going to launch an investigation into what has been happening up there or not?  What has the Minister done with the information that has been provided to him over a number of years?  I am aware of a case of a woman who has issues and is waiting for her situation to be dealt with in St. James's Hospital as a result of being pushed down from what happened in Letterkenny, over to Derry and now down to St. James's.  This is on top of the two other cases of which the Minister is aware.  I ask the Minister to please tell me that he is going to do something on it.</p> <p>  On the issue of medical cards for patients with terminal cancer I thank the Minister for meeting Mr. John Wall, who is a brilliant guy as we both agree.  Mr. Wall was very happy to meet with the Minister, and fair play to the Minister.  I have no issue there.  The Minister, however, has a budget coming up in a week's time.  The provision of funding in this regard would be small money in that context and unless the Minister provides funding in the budget, with all the will in the world he will probably not be the Minister in one year's time.  He needs to provide for it in the budget.  This is a real decision.  It is small money.  The 24-month profile is probably the way to go.  It is an interim step.  It seems like a cruel thing to say but this is a way to deal with it.  I ask the Minister to put this into his budget.</p> <p>  The Minister has received a letter from Tony O'Reilly about his wife Julie O'Reilly.  Julie was the lady who died from endometrial cancer and she was one of the 221.  I will not get into the details here.  Mr. O'Reilly has asked for an investigation into how his wife's medical details ended up with a newspaper.  Mr. O'Reilly has written to the Minister about this.  Personally, I would like to know how this happened also.  It should not have happened.  I have a copy of Mr. O'Reilly letter to hand, which the Minister has acknowledged.  I ask that the Minister address this issue.</p> <p>  Will the Minister clarify how many women have had their Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, results?  As it will be over by the end of the month, surely the Department knows by now what percentage of the total have those results.</p> <p>  I am deeply worried by Mr. Reid's opening statement with regard to section 38 and section 39 organisations.  This is not Mr. Reid's fault but it is his problem.  Some of these are about to fall over.</p><p>If those organisations fall over the State suffers, and the people suffer to a point.  This committee has been through this, as has the Committee of Public Accounts.  We need to put this on a different footing.  Somebody needs to stop this and turn it around.  A good few of these organisations are getting loans just to stay afloat.  This cannot continue.  What is going to be done about it?</p><p> I have two final issues, one of which is the recruitment freeze.  I have raised this question previously and we have all played games to the effect that there is no recruitment freeze, and others have also raised it.  In effect, there is a recruitment freeze.  As for control and expenditure discussions, I have heard the Minister say that one cannot win in this regard.  It is a good kick-back argument, which I understand, but when it comes to front-line services and the issues I have just outlined in the mid-west, the reality is it is affecting front-line staff such as nurses and doctors.  As with the issues mentioned by the Minister regarding the capital plan the two biggest jokes among the Minister's own staff, including management, is that the capital plan does not impact on capital projects down through the years.  They just laugh at that.  The second issue they laugh at is the idea that there is no recruitment freeze.  The Minister's own people laugh at that; they do not believe it.  When it comes to front-line staff, especially nursing and other posts, I ask the Minister to please show the necessary flexibility.</p><p> My last question is very important.  I dealt with it in the committee last week and it relates to CervicalCheck and the audit.  I could not get a clear answer last week-----</p></speech>

Tell me if I am wrong, it would be just a yes-no answer.  When the new audit comes into place for CervicalCheck, it will begin on the day after the last audit finished.  In other words, there will not be a gap period where there is no audit.  I said this last week and nobody contradicted me so I presume I am correct in that.  If I am not, then there is a serious problem.</p></speech>

We will have that work completed by the end of this year.  The Deputy asked if anybody was left out of that.  The RCOG report provided women with a diagnosis of cervical cancer up to 2017 with the opportunity to have their screening reassessed by RCOG.  As for anyone left in a gap, there will, of course, be an opportunity for any individual requests to come through-----</p></speech>

In fact, tomorrow I am due to spend time in an acute setting to demonstrate my leadership and experience the issues people are encountering.  I have no doubt that recruitment is part of the solution.  We are going to inject and have been injecting.  I need to indicate that we have recruited 1,138 people this year.  We are almost 500 above our budgeted for headcount this year, or, to be precise, 485 above the planned improvement.  Therefore, we have recruited and are continuing to recruit.  We recruited 60 in August and are targeting dedicated recruitment.  For example, we are in the process of recruiting graduate nurses, with a significant number of contracts offered on the community and acute sides.  We want to recruit these graduates.  As the national director, Mr. Liam Woods, said, we want to reduce our spend on agency staff as part of that process.  I have no interest in increasing that spend and would rather have full-time staff.  That is not a philosophy but a drive towards best practice.</p> <p>  On the issue of section 38 and section 39 organisations, I acknowledge that there is no extra focus being put on them.  My communication yesterday was across the system, including section 38 and section 39 organisations, in managing the significant issues with which some of them are dealing.  It has been presented to us a number of times and we have had some engagement with many of them.  Certainly, the Catherine Day report sets out how we need to work with the section 38 and section 39 organisations in a stronger way.  On controls and our management of the spend, they are the exact same controls we have in place across the HSE system.  We value what they do and they are important, but we have the same controls in place.</p></speech>

It was also raised by the Irish Pharmacy Union.  What is the proposal?  I understand that under the IPU's proposal, if the minor ailments scheme was to be introduced nationally, there would be about 1 million fewer prescriptions written and that there would, therefore, be a huge saving from the point of view of GPs.  There is a huge number of items that pharmacies cannot give out without a prescription.  Is this issue being looked at both from a cost savings point of view and also from the point of view of saving time for GPs?</p> <p>  The second issue concerns step-down facilities.  One of the issues in many hospitals arises where someone is admitted for reasonably minor surgery and has to be detained for two to three days.  We then find that he or she is in hospital for anything up to seven or ten days.  Is enough work being done to identify step-down facilities where the State would enter into a contract for the provision of these facilities?  It would be far cheaper than having people in hospital and there would be a faster turnover in hospitals.  Have we made any progress in trying to advance the provision of structured step-down facilities in each of the regional areas?  I can go back to 2004 or 2005, when there was talk of building co-located private hospitals on public hospital grounds, when we should be looking seriously at building step-down facilities reasonably adjacent to public hospitals.  Is that issue being looked at?</p> <p>  The other issue concerns children with disabilities.</p><p>I understand a few places such as the COPE Foundation and St. Michael's House which deal with children with disabilities have a scheme in place under which children with disabilities can stay with another family for a weekend to provide respite care for their parents.  Could we have an expansion of that scheme?  There are a huge number of families who want to make a contribution and they can do so by providing care for a child with disabilities over a weekend and, at the same time, giving some respite to his or her parents.  It is a very effective way of providing the service.  Is there any proposal to roll out the scheme further?  I know that it has to be carefully established and managed, but it is up and running and operating well.  Families who have become involved have found it extremely rewarding.  At the same time, it is extremely helpful for parents with children to care for a child with disabilities.  </p><p> I would appreciate responses on those three issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#VV00200"><p>I will deal with the first two.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will take the question about children with disabilities.  </p> <p>  On the minor ailments scheme, I am very glad that the Senator raised the issue because representatives of the Irish Pharmacy Union came to see me in the not-too-distant past.  It has been a really constructive partner on Sl&aacute;intecare and in coming up with ideas.  It has also been an extraordinarily good partner on Brexit preparedness in the group chaired by the Secretary General that works with external stakeholders.  I acknowledge that contribution.  We have run a minor ailments scheme on a pilot basis and I believe it has shown very good results.  If representatives of the IPU were here, they would be talking about the fact that it has been operated on a pilot basis for a long time and ask why it could not be expanded.  It is a fair point.  When I most recently met IPU officials, we asked that the IPU and the Health Research Board look together at how we could design a comprehensive minor ailments scheme in order that we could address exactly the points made by the Senator.  In return for doing this for the pharmacies, it would have a benefit for the hospitals.  I will check to see the exact stage the conversations are at and revert to the Senator in writing. </p> <p>  On the issue of step-down facilities, again, I agree 100% with the Senator.  There are two answers to his question.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who had to leave to take questions on promised legislation in the D&aacute;il and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have pulled together a group in the areas of housing and health to look at how we can meet needs in communities.  We do not just look at building houses; we also look at the position where, if we build what used to be kownn traditionally as retirement villages within communities, we can decide whether it actually helps to keep older people in their community and out of hospital.   That is one body of work.  The second is that in the new integrated regional structures we will be mapping out exactly what they wlill be.  We talk about capacity a lot in the health service. There are real capacity constraints.  One area in which we potentially have spare capacity, or capacity that could be better utilised is smaller hospitals and community nursing units.  As part of the Sl&aacute;intecare mapping exercise for each of the new regional organisations, that issue will be looked at.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the issue because St. Michael's House and the COPE Foundation in Cork are involved, as the Senator said.  It is part of Jigsaw.  We have 8,600 people in residential care and in the region of 27,000 in day services.  Within respite care services, this year there will be 180,500 overnight stays and 3.08 million hours in home support services.  These are part of mainstream respite care mservices.  During the summer we opened our 12th respite care house.  Although it did not get a mention anywhere, 12 new respite care houses have been opened.  The final one was opened in the middle of the summer.  I thank the HSE for being on target.</p> <p>  As part of the respite care service, we have families coming forward to volunteer to assist other families, particularly those with high dependency young children and young adults with disabilities.  To the question of whether I believe in it, the answer is "Yes".  To the question of whether I support it and would encourage its expansion, the answer is absolutely "Yes".</p> <p>  There is a group in society which we know as carers.</p><p>There is a group of families who do very valuable work by providing services for young children and adults with disabilities, which we must support and I will support them.  During the year we have moved 160 people out of residential homes, and away from an institutionalised setting, but put them into community settings.  Part of the process involves those who have no extended family, and people are often left in institutions in cases where their family members have died or it is very difficult for the family.  We need to provide more support.  </p><p> Senator Burke asked about the families.  There are approximately 800 families involved, which should be supported, and assistance expanded.  </p></speech>

I thank the organisation for its diligence in that regard.</p> <p>  One of the conversations we had earlier, which the CEO also addressed concerned the mapping exercise of what the workforce plan looks like for each of our new regional areas.  The Deputy has been a big believer that we should return to regional structures.  We are now doing that.  What is the appropriate number of therapists, nurses, doctors and everyone else that we need in each region based on the population?  I expect that the HSE, working with the Sl&aacute;intecare office, will make really good progress on that in the coming months.  The Deputy will be able to have a interesting exchange with the Sl&aacute;intecare office when its personnel attend here at the end of this month.  </p> <p>  Without pre-empting the budget, do I expect that we will be able to begin to make progress or build on the progress to date in 2020?  Yes, I do, but we need to look beyond that.  We need to have an understanding, as an Oireachtas, of what the next number of years look like.  I mean if we do this in 2020 then what more do we need to do in 2021 to 2023 to get to where we need to get to in terms of speech and language therapy?</p> <p>  I unapologetically believe that the model has to be about more than just the health service building up its pool of therapists and the Department of Education and Skills building up its pool of special needs assistants and resource teachers.  It has to be about using the dynamic that is the Departments of Education and Skills and the Department of Health working together.  We have a pilot in place.  Indeed, part of Deputy Durkan's constituency and certainly part of his county is involved in that.  The model has been used in other countries where it works really well.  Instead of a child going to a speech and language therapist, the speech and language therapist or occupational therapist goes to the school.  We do not have the evidence base yet and await the evaluation of the programme but from talking to parents and teachers I already know that the service is beneficial .  Yes, I think we can make more progress in 2020.  Does Ms O'Connor wish to add anything? </p></speech>

The reply received was that there was no maternity cover for speech and language therapists.  As a result, the patients or children receiving the therapy can no longer get the therapy for the duration of the maternity leave.  To my mind, that seems like a minor issue that can be dealt with relatively easily.  Can it?</p></speech>

With such a high level of a female workforce, referenced earlier, we can have very high rates of maternity leave, which we do not always cover.  It depends on the criticality of the post and how long a person will be gone.  We take into account a number of factors but we can end up paying for a post twice when somebody is on maternity leave and we replace her.  That is not to say we never do it.  We do, but we must take into account the wider context in terms of affordability within the area.  We do not automatically replace everybody who goes.</p></speech>

Families have come to me about the fact that maternity cover is provided in other professions.  This is a genuine issue.  We must accept that if children with disabilities miss speech and language therapy it is not a good thing.  There are preschool speech and language services now.  As the Minister mentioned, there is on-site therapy in mainstream education.  Last year, &euro;2 million, I think, was provided to develop speech and language therapy in schools.  However, we must tackle the issue of providing maternity cover.  Deputy Durkan has made a very important point about a lack of maternity cover and I have heard the same message from families.</p></speech>

His or her quality of life is affected because one cannot repeat that phase of a child's life.  It is gone.</p> <p>  Scoliosis is an issue that I raised initially.  Given the severity of scoliosis, the concerns of parents of the children affected and the discomfort experienced by children with scoliosis, is there a system to prioritise these children for treatment?  Can we be sure that the system works?  </p> <p>  In terms of the national treatment purchase scheme, is it possible to ascertain the nature of the cases referred for treatment in Northern Ireland, the UK or wherever?  Is it possible to ascertain the precise type of condition referred?  Are patients referred through the private sector in terms of the scheme?  Is it possible to do so?  I presume that can be done.  Are there facilities that provide the same services lying idle in this country due to the scheme?  My information is that there are.  If we have the facilities then we should not let them lie idle. </p> <p>  I am glad to see that a new regime of HPV vaccination has commenced.  Obviously it will be more effective than previously for a whole lot of reasons.  I believe there are two series of the new vaccine.  One is a series 7 and the other is a series 9, which is being utilised.  Series 7 is the one that is receiving attention at the moment.  All children are referred for the series 7 vaccine as opposed to series 9 which, for all I know, is a better vaccine.  I would like an explanation on this.</p> <p>  Is it possible to conduct a forensic examination at all levels of the number of agency staff that have been employed in the public health service?  Is it also possible to examine whether the money might be better spent in having permanent or temporary rolling staff?    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#XX00300"><p>On speech and language therapy, I reiterate the points the Minister of State and I have made.  I fully agree with Deputy Durkan.  The issue that he has raised highlights the need for us to create community teams in areas.  I say that because where an area becomes so wholly dependent on any one healthcare professional, and things can happen in all of our lives in terms of career breaks, maternity leave, paternity leave and whatever, we obviously need to make sure that we do not build a system that is wholly reliant on one healthcare professional.  That is why I think the reforms we are bringing in through the creation of our community network teams, but also our work with education, lessens that reliance on any one individual.</p><p>What Members are seeing is that we are continuing to increase investment and staff numbers, yet we are continuing to see some of the challenges that Deputy Durkan has outlined.  That is certainly the direction of travel.</p><p> On the treatment abroad scheme and-or the cross-border directive, I have a very long table, which I will send to Deputy Durkan and circulate to the committee, that shows the procedures.  The major ones are orthopaedics and ophthalmology, for which people travel abroad.  I am glad that Deputy Durkan raised an interesting point about whether the taxpayer is funding treatments abroad that we should be doing here.  The short answer is that in some cases we could be doing better in Ireland.  For example, I constantly hear about ophthalmology and people going to the North to have their cataracts removed.  We have opened a new theatre in Nenagh at a cost of &euro;1 million last year, which it is fair to say has dramatically reduced the number of people waiting for cataract procedures and dramatically increased the capacity for this country, not just that region, to meet the cataract demand in the health service.  We must be looking constantly for opportunities - one might use the term low-hanging fruit - where we have level 2 hospitals, which back in the day were big emergency hospitals but no longer have an emergency department and have capacity.  Of course, that requires staffing, so it is not always as easily done as I have outlined.  The theatre in Nenagh is an example of where we are trying to do more here than we previously had the capacity to do and people had to go abroad.  We had to send children abroad for the treatment of scoliosis.  Nobody here, including me, thought that was acceptable, and we are now building up the capacity of our theatres and surgeons to ensure we can have a sustainable service in Crumlin and Temple Street and ultimately in the new children's hospital.</p><p> To respond to the question on the HPV vaccine, I will have to rely on Dr. Henry to respond to that technical question or to revert on it. </p></speech>

Obviously, we want to reduce our spend on agency staff.  The total spend is just around &euro;400 million, and I will be happy to share the breakdown of the expenditure.  We spend about 32% on support staff, which is mainly health care assistants, and 64% on medical and nursing staff, which is broken down between community and acute services.  Our agency spend is just over 5% of our total spend in terms of payroll.  It is something we wish to reduce.  In terms of equivalence, it is about 5,500 head count.  It is a marginal element of our overall spend that we want to reduce.  It is a flexible resource that we need to utilise, where we have to utilise it.</p></speech>

Large tobacco and cigarette companies are mooching, so to speak, into vaping.  To bring it back to another issue, the rise of the global cannabis market is predicted to be &euro;123 billion by 2028.  It seems very clear that big tobacco is involved in this market as well.  It is similar in ways to the way that vaping has taken off.  As somebody who only has facts and science to rely on, it is becoming increasingly difficult to win the argument and it is actually easier at times just to say nothing and pretend that one does not know anything about things because the level of angst if a person stands up to something like this is to some people not worth it.  In my mind it is worth it.  I feel particularly strongly about this issue, and while I am a major supporter of and am pro-decriminalisation of drugs, I feel very strongly about the statutory instrument signed at the end of June, which is contrary to the legal advice provided to this committee and contrary to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, advice.  In the HPRA report of 2016, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, the first paragraph of the executive summary states:</p><blockquote>To date there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness (efficacy) of cannabis products. </blockquote><p>It goes on to refer to conditions "such as those for which there is a public interest".  I am concerned that, due to public interest and a ferocious campaign for the authorisation of medicinal cannabis, we have somehow diluted our drug regulations.  The HPRA is only supposed to license and authorise medicinal products, and cannabis does not fit into that category.  We do not yet have any trial data, which is important to take on board, as it is for any other drug.</p><p> When it comes to public health, we are depending on big tobacco, via vaping, to tell people how to tackle a nicotine addiction.  How are we to deal with a market, which is potentially worth &euro;128 billion, and is currently worth &euro;60 billion to &euro;80 billion, that purports to have a miracle product that will cure everything?  We, as elected representatives, have to protect public health.  This feeds into the phenomena of fake news, anti-vaxxers, and significant marketing and online influencers.  We will face a public health nightmare in five or ten years because we will have diminished our regulation standards.  Could a pharmaceutical company challenge the Department on this?  Someone could rock up with cannabis, which does not have to go through the normal trials or regulatory process, while that company might have a drug that has gone through the trials and ticked all the boxes, and yet is not getting a marketing authorisation.</p><p> I also have an issue with the HPRA's remit, which at this point in time covers medical products.  The product being allowed onto the market, albeit with limited access, is simply not a medicine.  Populism has succeeded here to some extent.  It is easier to use a statutory instrument than to legislate on this issue.  I could be wrong but as a pharmacist, I feel strongly about drug regulation.  Any dilution of regulations will lead to public health issues in the future.  I realise I am standing alone on this issue because it seems like I do not want to give sick people and children this miracle medicine.  However, claims have been made about treatments that simply cannot be true and that eat into the sound advances made in public health.  Have the HSE or the Department predicted how we will deal with the challenges that will no doubt arrive on our doorstep in a number of years?  They will have arisen under the Minister's watch because of a statutory instrument that allowed a product with no scientific basis onto the market.</p></speech>

I withstood massive political pressure from this Oireachtas when it endeavoured to pass irresponsible legislation without grounding in science.  It wanted to set up a cannabis research authority, whatever that was going to do, among other things.

However, the limited legislation that preceded the statutory instrument stipulated that it would have to be prescribed by a consultant in the relevant field.  A neurologist would have to prescribe it for a neurological condition and so on.  My understanding is the statutory instrument does not specify.</p></speech>

GPs could apply to the ministerial licence scheme, whereas only a treating consultant can apply to this programme.  The treating consultant is the safeguard.  There is no pseudoscience involved.  A medically qualified consultant who is treating someone has to satisfy himself or herself that this is worth doing in his or her medical opinion.  It is not a political decision.  At one stage some people here would nearly have had me giving out the cannabis.  That will not be the case.  It will be done under very strict medical regulations for a set period of time.</p> <p>  I accept the Deputy's view because it is a fact that the evidence on the medicinal benefits of cannabis is scant at best.  It is not an authorised medicine.</p></speech>

I am not disagreeing with her view that there is no evidence base for cannabis as a medicine.  However, it is the medicine of last resort.  If a medically qualified consultant treating someone for one of the three relevant conditions believes it could help, he or she is allowed to seek the licence.  We spent a significant amount of time setting up the programme and bringing together an expert group, but we were criticised for doing so.  The guidelines for the programme have been designed by doctors, scientists, pharmacists and others.</p></speech>

It is important that I outline my views.</p> <p>  I refer to biosimilar products and the legislation needed to allow community and hospital pharmacists to substitute them, as was done in the case of generic products ten years ago.  Is there any proposal from the Department to allow pharmacists to substitute biosimilar products?  The Minister knows that legislation is required as the current legislation only allows for the substitution of exact molecules.  My understanding is this could result in a health saving of between &euro;70 million and &euro;100 million, which would cover the cost of free contraception for the women of Ireland for a year.  When the Minister goes to the Minister for Finance, he could save him &euro;100 million and then bill him &euro;100 million.</p> <p>  We discussed the issue of contraception at length at the committee on the eighth amendment and the Government's approach was that contraceptives would be provided free of charge.  I understand there are budgetary constraints, but we made a promise in that regard.  We identified that almost 50% of crisis pregnancies occurred owing to a lack of contraception and education.  In the light of the upcoming budget and the time that has passed since the referendum, it is high time we followed through on the commitment given.  I know that the Minister has set up a new working group to consider the matter.  It is high time simple things like this were done, if for no other reason than as a gesture to the women of Ireland for the nigh on 100 years of reproductive persecution they suffered.  Such a gesture could undo some of the bad of the past.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy O'Reilly, a significant financial commitment will be required, but there is more to it than that because we will also have to change legislation, set up systems and so on.  There will be a lead-in time, but I am 100% committed to making contraception free.  I have committed to doing so without receiving the report, as it will simply guide us on how best to go about it.  I expect to be in a position to have discussions in the coming days with Deputies O'Connell and O'Reilly and others who are interested in the issue.</p> <p>  I commend the leadership of the CEO of the HSE on getting on with dealing with the matter of biosimilar products.  We are already beginning to see the benefits.  We need to build on the scheme in order that it can grow and become a normal part of budgeting and the financial flow in the health service.</p><p>For our part, on the Deputy's question, we will be publishing our national biosimilars policy by the end of this year.</p></speech>

I will be exactly that - brief and to the point.</p> <p>  I have just come from a briefing from the IPU.  I note that the Minister works well with that organisation.  For an organisation, it is non-adversarial and non-confrontational and sometimes it might deserve to make more progress for adopting that approach than other organisations that have a different attitude and might get farther because of the noise they make.</p> <p>  On the minor ailment roll-out, the pilot scheme has been successful.  I must declare an interest because I am a practising pharmacist, as is Deputy O'Connell.  We need to get that rolled out.  There are 2,000 pharmacists ready, willing and able to help and who want to do it.  It would be a major benefit to the health system to get that rolled out and to make progress on it immediately.  Will the Minister put a timeline on that?</p> <p>  As a profession, we are the last group on which there has been no progress on reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  The Minister has made a commitment in that regard.  We would like to see progress because we deserve it.  We are willing to work with the Minister.</p> <p>  On progressing the profession, a new contract is needed, as was the case with the GP profession, and progress was to be made on that.  The Minister will find a willing partner in rolling out a new contract to develop the service to embellish what we can add to the health service.  The Minister will find us more than willing to work co-operatively with him in that regard.  I highlight those three issues in the hope we can make progress on them.</p></speech>

I said, but want to repeat, that the IPU, particularly in relation to Brexit, has been an extraordinary organisation to engage with.  I made the comment at the last external stakeholders meeting, "If only we could all be as collaborative on other issues."  It has been brilliant in stepping up to the plate.  I want to formally thank it and others - all the various stakeholders and manufacturers.  The second point about the IPU is it approaches dialogue with me and my Department in a solutions-oriented way.  Deputy Brassil's commentary is fair.  The IPU is so constructive that we need to make sure we move on some of its suggestions.</p> <p>  I will have to come back to Deputy Brassil on their minor ailment roll-out.  As I stated to Senator Colm Burke, where I left it with the IPU is that the union and the Health Research Board were to interact and look at what such a roll-out would look like.  I will write to Deputy Brassil on where that is at.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second and last questions kind of roll into one.  In any negotiation about fees and fee reversals, we must look at it also in terms of contract reform and service levels.  The commitment that I gave at the IPU conference still stands.  We will sit down with the pharmacists at the start of 2020 on both matters.</p></speech>

It relates to the need for additional permanent residential places for persons with an intellectual disability, ID, across the country but specifically in community healthcare organisation 1, CHO 1, which is in the north west.  As matters stand, the only funding coming forward at present is going towards decongregation, which is important, but there are a number of people in the community whose families are under unbearable pressure in caring for somebody who should be in a residential place.</p><p>Additional funding is needed to address that because it is simply not sustainable.  I seek an update on the funding for permanent residential places from the Minister.</p><p> I am bringing up a specific case that needs to be dealt with out of frustration.  This relates to somebody who was awaiting such a permanent place for a number of years but, because of the circumstances, had to go into an emergency placement in January last.  That person's care has been catered for since then by moving the person around three different respite centres because the person needs two-to-one care but the centre needs to be a closed centre when the person is there.  If the person was in one respite centre only, it would mean nobody in that area would get respite.  The person, therefore, has been moved around three centres.  Twice over the past ten months, a permanent external placement has been identified for that person but the funding fell through.  It means that, ten months on, the respite care for many people in the community is being affected and, of course, the placement that the person has is not what it should be because the person should be in a permanent residential centre.  I have followed the case closely.  It is unacceptable that it has not yet been dealt with.  I will pass the details on to the Minister and I hope I will not have to be back in three months, which would mark a year since the point when this person was first moved around various respite centres.  On the broader point, can the Minister provide an update on the need for funding for permanent residential places alongside de-congregation?</p></speech>

I note the importance the Deputy attaches to it by the time he has had to spend here to raise it today.</p> <p>  No doubt there is significant unmet need when it comes to both permanent residential places and emergency places.  We are endeavouring to prioritise both in our budgetary discussions, which, as he can imagine, are tricky considering the environment in which we are operating.  The HSE has done some good work in this regard.  Ms O'Connor might like to elaborate on that.  Regarding the individual case, I would be pleased to receive the information from the Deputy and to pass on to the HSE, and we can revert to him directly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#CCC00300"><p>There are a few things we are looking at.</p> <p>  We are challenged on the emergency front.  That may be what the Deputy was referring to.  On decongregation, we have moved 160 people this year and we will continue to decongregate.</p> <p>  Where we have an urgent need for a placement, depending on the needs of the individual, we are challenged on two fronts.  The first is that the cost of placements can be extremely high for individuals.  The second is we cannot always get them.  Often we have a variety of providers who assess people and we make arrangements and they fall through.  That is particularly prevalent in certain parts of the country.</p> <p>  We have an extensive piece of work looking at all of our placements at present because in reality we should get away from emergencies.  We should not be dealing with emergency placements - that is the language we use.  By building in earlier intervention with families and by building in respite care, which we discussed earlier, we can reduce the emergency nature of placements.  On the work we are doing, we are looking to see how we can work better with providers to prepare for people who have more complex needs because that is where we become particularly challenged.</p></speech>

It is only when they become an emergency that cases are dealt with and, in the meantime, people are under unbearable pressure.  It is only emergency cases that are out there because standard ones are not getting dealt with and they have outstayed the respite and home care options for catering for people's needs in many circumstances.</p></speech>

We received figures, recently enough, that the CHO for our area has sanction for 14 mental health professionals to support children with disability - an extraordinarily important and worthy set of supports.</p><p>Not a single one of those has been filled.  From the 14 sanctioned posts, zero has been filled.  This means children with disabilities all over Wicklow are not getting the mental health supports they are meant to be getting where posts have been sanctioned.  Will the Minister provide an update as to why so this is such a chronic problem, and will anything happen?</p></speech>

I share his concern because, as he correctly states, we have sanctioned the funding for these 14 posts.  I have also been in contact with the HSE seeking an update.  I do not know if Ms O'Connor has an update or whether she will revert to the Deputy and me.</p></speech>

My next question concerns an MRI machine for the Carlow-Kilkenny region.  People raised &euro;250,000 in 2016 and the Minister met them in July 2018, saying the money would be released within weeks for the building in which the machine would be placed.  As of last week, when they approached me, nothing has happened.  The Minister gave a commitment in July last year, but why has the funding not been released?  Will the funding materialise?</p></speech>

The short answer is that the MRI for Kilkenny is absolutely funded.  I thank the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital Carlow-Kilkenny, one of whom has been in direct contact with me, for the incredible fundraising work that the local community has done with this facility.  We are putting in more than just a new MRI and there will be a new waiting area.  It is quite a sizable investment, to which the community has contributed much.  It has planning permission and the next step is to go to tender.  I have asked the HSE to come back to me with the date on which it intends to go to tender.  I expect to have that information from Mr. Reid very shortly.  I assure those people, through Deputy Donnelly, that the project will go to tender very shortly.  I have met representatives of the hospital management and HSE estates.  It is a major need and opportunity for the hospital.</p></speech>

I like to be constructive and take on board constructive suggestions, and the Deputy made one on this matter.  Deputy Donnelly and I spoke in the D&aacute;il about how the children's hospital construction had to conclude before the new building for the Coombe could be built, but the Deputy rightly suggested that we should be doing preparatory work in this regard.  In the capital plan we worked with the HSE to identify funding to appoint teams for each of the individual hospitals so some of that preparatory work could be done.  Perhaps I could write to the Deputy with some of the detail.</p></speech>

It might be more of a question where the HSE might come back to the committee.  There is a fundamental difference in views as to what is going on with nurses not being hired.  I have heard the HSE statement and the caveat that there is no embargo in place but there may be conditions where financial plans have not been sanctioned and therefore hospitals do not have permission to hire those personnel.  Will the HSE or the Department, whichever is the correct group, come back to the committee with a detailed explanation of what is going on?  There are 82 people sitting on trolleys in Limerick as we speak, but the nurses seeking jobs there have been told an embargo is in place.  Will the witnesses come back to the committee with a realistic picture of what is going on?  Which hospitals are actively hiring and which have been told that, for various reasons, they cannot currently hire those personnel?</p> <p>  As I stated, there are 82 people waiting on trolleys in Limerick as we speak, and although some will get beds today, more people will walk into the hospital throughout the day and tonight.  There are measures that could be taken today as opposed to long-term strategic and infrastructural capacity-building measures.  Home care package numbers could be increased as an emergency measure and there could be a pause on some non-urgent elective care.  More supports could be given to GPs very quickly so that patients who do not need to come into accident and emergency departments would not do so.  The nursing vacancies could be filled very quickly.  We know the numbers throughout the country for people waiting on trolleys is bad, but at 82, does the number for Limerick signify that this a crisis?  Could emergency measures therefore be taken so the people in Limerick could see some improvement right away?</p></speech>

We have put &euro;10 million into the system in trying to provide extra social care support.  Limerick will clearly benefit from some of that.  For example, we are seeing the number of delayed discharges finally beginning to fall after weeks of it rising.  It is still very high but it is decreasing.  We had another good engagement today, particularly with members from the mid-west and the Chairman, about doing something on diagnostics.  We are taking that away and we have agreed that HSE representatives will meet members from the mid-west within a fortnight to see how to progress the issue.  The core of the Deputy's question was what we can do now, as we are almost in winter, to improve flow, social care etc.  I expect that on budget day next Tuesday, we will be in a position to announce funding for the winter, from which Limerick and other parts of the country will benefit.  We will focus on the short-term measures of assistance.</p></speech>

To be fair, I asked many questions and I am not sure that one was answered.  If it was, I can check the record.  What is planned in this regard for Balbriggan, as we have been campaigning for this for two and a half years, and scanning facilities and diagnostic equipment are essential?</p> <p>  The dual diagnosis programme was on the HSE website but I have been advised that it has been removed.  I have been contacted by campaigners to say their fear is that the programme has somehow been stalled or shelved.  The Minister might be able to provide an update.</p> <p>  Women and men have been affected by mesh implants.  Will the Minister give an update on this?  I know he has met some of them, as I was there for both meetings.  It is not just women who have been impacted but because they highlighted it, men are coming forward to say they have felt an impact.  These women have shared their harrowing and horrific stories with the Minister.  My information is that very similar cases exist among the men affected by this and it is no less severe, painful or awkward to speak about.  Those women had the courage to come forward and there are men in the same position who would be happy to inform the Minister about what is going on with their health.</p></speech>

We had a meeting and I thank Deputy O'Reilly for facilitating it.  I had a follow-up meeting with Mesh Survivors Ireland and I have committed to another meeting.  I need to get back to it with a date for another meeting, which will probably be next month.  The Deputy is welcome to attend.  Dr. Henry can update us on the commitments made to the group.</p> <p>  We have provided an uplift for diagnostic equipment in the capital plan and the HSE must map out where that is going.  In fairness to Deputy O'Reilly, she asks on a very regular basis about Balbriggan's diagnostic equipment.  Perhaps we can update her or at least promise to revert to her on the matter.  Ms O'Connor can speak to the dual diagnosis programme.</p></speech>

I refer to a decision made by this Minister and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on 2 January and 3 January this year.  It relates to the transposition into Irish law of the EU directive on ionising radiation.</p><p>That obviously affected the practice of chiropractics.  The Minister at the time indicated that he intended to bring in regulations to ensure that a high standard was applied and that we were complying in some way with the requirements.  My information is that since then, not all European countries have complied with the legislation at all.  The particular issue was pursued vigorously by an individual for a period.  If that individual had the pain that I have in my back at this moment, he might not have been in such hot pursuit.  Will the Minister have a look at that again to see whether it might be possible to regulate in a way that would meet the requirements of the European Union?</p></speech>

As he knows, I held out on this one for a while.  I understood the views being put forward by a number of Members of the Oireachtas.  I have to be careful in what I say because I think there is a legal challenge and legal correspondence in my Department in respect of this.  The bottom line was that in order to comply with the directive, one needed to prescribe certain professionals and in order to do that, they needed to be regulated.  As the Deputy knows, chiropractors in our country are not regulated although in other countries they are.  It varies significantly across the European Union.  I am of the instinctive view that they are a group that should be regulated, but there is a long list of people seeking regulation.  On the advice of the chief medical officer and others, I asked that the Health Research Board would look at the regulation of chiropractors, risk and so on, and I am awaiting that report.</p></speech>

Pulling all the stuff together than I have been talking about in the previous two rounds, has the Department plans for a massive public health campaign in terms of identifying what we can learn from where we failed before?  I refer to the vaccination rate with HPV vaccination dropping to 52%, which was not on the Minister's watch but it did happen, and to the great effort by all the witnesses, the late Laura Brennan and many others such that we collectively have got that rate back up.  In terms of public health education, if we look to some of the developing countries such as Rwanda with its vaccination programme, the programme is front-loaded with education and their system has worked well.  We are failing because we probably did not cop on quickly enough to the power of the Internet and of false claims.  As the Minister knows, I have my Bill, which is waiting to progress.  It is clear from the conversation about measles and mumps that people do not seem to realise how serious these conditions are.  The generation that saw these conditions is largely older.  My own mother is a retired public health nurse who specialised in infectious diseases so I am very much aware of the dangers associated with them.  However, it is very hard to fear what we cannot see.  Are we going to do anything to try to mitigate the risk of the propagation of false claims?  I am thinking of something to do with the value of science and fact, our institutions, the value of research and development.  Organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society clearly have public health as their remit.  There is a need to identify those whose remit is probably not public health but the bottom line on their balance sheet.  Beliefs are hard to change and I believe the only way we can do that is through education.  There is a shift whereby people are not going to listen to the celebrity chef as to what they should take to cure their terminal cancer.  However, the Department and the Minister need to pre-empt what is coming down the road in terms of slick marketing campaigns to get into people's pockets, essentially, and in some cases into the pockets of the Department, I would say, in terms of the funding of medicinal cannabis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.709" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100200002#GGG00200"><p>No, I am at 2 minutes 52 seconds.  The Minister recently mentioned a flag system for news and I welcome that.  I discussed this before at a Facebook event.  I am not sure how we would do it in terms of the Internet but I like where the Minister is going with it.  It is very important.  As we saw with the HPV vaccine, it is really hard to roll back.  The lie has got around the world before the truth puts its boots on.  One has to stand for something or one will fall for anything.  That is why I feel so strongly about this.  On the HPV vaccine for the boys, I congratulate everyone involved in the roll-out.  In light of its success, have we plans to vaccinate the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth-year pupils?  There seems to be such an appetite to do it.  I know it is another bill and the Minister is probably always presenting bills but the money will be saved in the long run.  I am sure there is a sum there for the cost of fixing the decline in HPV vaccination in terms of cost of life but also cost to population health.</p></speech>

We have made really good progress on vaccination together as an Oireachtas.  The HSE has shown incredible leadership in this area.  It shows how when the health service really puts its mind to something, we can make progress.  When we engage with others outside our initial health family, our friend, the late Laura Brennan, obviously being a key example of that, but also lots of other organisations and people, we can see the energy and the movement that creates.  We launched the Vaccine Alliance on 10 September.  I am very excited about this.  We specifically put Science Foundation Ireland on it for that very reason.  It is doing its scoping exercise on the work it should do now.  They have Barnardos, USI, lots of doctors, parents and patient advocates.  It is a really good mix.  David Robert Grimes, whom the Deputy knows, is a really powerful advocate and is on that group.  It is to come back to us with what it thinks we should do.</p> <p>  One of the issues in any public awareness campaign, as the Deputy will know, is the need to target certain groups.  When we look at vaccinations and pseudoscience, the impact is not uniform across all of us.  We need to do a little bit of work in terms of what works for different parts of society.  The short answer is that we have major plans for pushing back on misinformation regarding vaccines.  The point the Deputy is making at to how we broaden that out into other issues is a good one and I will reflect on that.</p> <p>  On the HPV vaccine, I am delighted we got this done and that it is rolling out.  I am hearing really good things back in terms of uptake rates.  I am in the realm of anecdote at the moment but am hearing from GPs and others that they are seeing a lot of demand.  They are seeing parents coming in asking for vaccines for their older sons.  The medical advice available to me currently is not to do that but we did the catch-up programme for girls and we still have it so I am keeping it under active review.  There is not a current proposal for it.  Obviously people can get it but have to pay for it after first year.  We will keep it under review.</p></speech>

He spoke about the delivery of ophthalmology services in Nenagh and there is a proposal that Ennis would become a centre for day-case ear, nose and throat surgery, but it would need two modular theatres to deliver that service which, again, would take pressure off University Hospital Limerick.</p></speech>

As the Chair indicated, I am joined by Mr. Frank Gallagher, principal officer, and Ms Mary Jones, assistant principal officer, who have responsibility within the Department for the Land Development Agency, LDA.  We are happy to answer any questions that committee members may wish to pose.  I might just provide some background on the policy basis and guide members through some of the key elements of the general scheme.<br/><br/>There is widespread consensus that spatial planning policies aimed at ensuring that the right forms of development happen at the right time and in the right sequence are important, and that this will not happen without a more proactive role by the State in land management terms.  In 2015, we published a national planning policy statement which recognised the importance of creating sustainable communities by ensuring that the right development takes place in the right locations and at the right time.  Following on from that, and to progress objectives in relation to sustainable urban development, the Government&rsquo;s national planning framework, NPF, published last year alongside the national development plan under Project Ireland 2040 committed to the establishment of what was then titled a national regeneration and development agency.  Under the NPF, national policy objective 12 stated the following:</p><blockquote>The Government will establish a National Regeneration and Development Agency to work with local authorities, other public bodies and capital spending departments and agencies to co-ordinate and secure the best use of public lands, investment required within the capital envelopes provided in the National Development Plan and to drive the renewal of strategic areas not being utilised to their full potential.</blockquote> <p>The Government&rsquo;s establishment of the LDA is a key implementation step in the context of the NPF&rsquo;s policies in this regard.<i></i>The LDA will act as a key new Government instrument and in line with its mandate, the agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.  It will significantly assist in the redevelopment of our cities and towns to support the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.<br/><br/>The two primary objectives of the LDA are to ensure the optimal usage of State lands, co-ordinating their regeneration and development and opening up key sites not being optimally used - especially for delivery of new homes - and to drive strategic land assembly through mechanisms that will bring together both public and private sector interests in ensuring the timely preparation and release of strategic land for development in a counter-cyclical manner, stabilising tendencies towards volatility in development land values, securing more of the increase in such values as a result of the planning and infrastructure investment processes for the common good and thereby driving increased affordability through better and more cost-competitive land availability.<br/><br/>As members will be aware, the LDA was established in September 2018 on an interim basis by statutory instrument under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, as amended.  The main aim of the general scheme of the LDA Bill is to establish the LDA on a primary legislative basis.  It will be a corporate Bill to allow for the establishment of the LDA as a designated activity company, DAC, under the Companies Act 2014 and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure will be the shareholders.  Heads 8 and 9 are the crucial parts of the general scheme in respect of the objectives and functions of the LDA.  Under head 8, some of the key objectives of the LDA include: to develop land for housing or other related development purposes on relevant public lands and other lands in support of the implementation of the national planning framework on a commercial basis; to establish mechanisms and collaborative structures between public and private entities to develop relevant public lands and other lands; and to establish structures to facilitate delivery of housing on relevant public lands and other lands.  The general scheme also makes it clear that the LDA must have regard to the policy of the Government on proper planning and sustainable development and contribute to the economic and social development of the State, while at the same time obtaining a positive financial return for the State.<br/><br/>Head 9 sets out the functions of the LDA.  These functions are categorised as commercial functions and non-economic public functions.  The commercial functions include: identifying relevant public lands and appraising their potential for development; acquiring lands in public and private ownership; disposing of lands where they are no longer required to enable the LDA to undertake its functions; developing, or facilitating the development of, relevant public lands and other lands; obtaining development consents, permissions and other approvals for land and related development projects; drawing up and assisting relevant public bodies and owners of other lands to draw up master plans for development on relevant public lands and other lands; and providing assistance to other relevant public bodies, including local authorities, to provide housing and related developments.  The additional, non-economic public functions related to the management of publicly owned lands and include advising Government on the management and use of public lands and establishing and maintaining a register of public lands.<br/><br/>I will briefly run through the general scheme.  It consists of seven parts, each dealing with a separate aspect of the establishment of the LDA.  They include the aforementioned functions, corporate form and funding arrangements, among others.  Part 1 of the general scheme contains the standard provisions normally included in legislation in relation to short title, collective citation, commencement, interpretation, the making of regulations and expenses.  Part 2 provides for the formation of the Land Development Agency as a designated activity company under the Companies Act 2014.  It sets out provisions in respect of such matters as the LDA&rsquo;s formation, constitution, objects, functions and board.  It also provides for the appointment of staff, including the chief executive.Part 3 contains provisions relating to the dissolution of the current statutory body established under the establishment order, which will be superseded by the body to be established under this Bill.  It therefore contains associated provisions in respect of the transfer of functions, staff, as well as requirements in respect of a final report and accounts in relation to the body to be wound up.  These are standard provisions regarding the dissolution of one public body and the transfer of functions to another.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains provisions concerning the funding of the LDA, including an amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 enabling the capitalisation of the LDA.  The subscription of share capital by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the LDA is also included in this section.  It is envisaged that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be the majority shareholder, through the capitalisation of the LDA by up to &euro;1.25 billion from Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, funding.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will be a minority shareholder; this is for governance reasons as the agency will be under the aegis of his Department.  It also provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may subscribe for further shares from time to time.  It is envisaged that this provision will be used to facilitate the transfer of sites to the LDA.  Sites owned by Government Departments and non-commercial state agencies will transfer to the LDA via the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who will receive either a payment for the sites or an <i>in specie</i>or equity investment in the LDA equivalent to the market value of the lands.<br/><br/>Part 5 concerns the financial reporting of the LDA and the preparation of its annual financial statements. Under the Act, the LDA will be required to submit annual financial statements to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. This part also contains provisions in respect of the accountability of the LDA to the Committee of Public Accounts and reporting arrangements.  Part 6 requires the LDA to compile a national public lands register of relevant public lands and also provides that public bodies must assist the LDA in relation to the compilation of the register.  Part 7 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions in respect of such things as shadow and <i>de facto</i>directors and a review of the achievement of the LDA&rsquo;s purposes.  As some of the LDA&rsquo;s functions are commercial in nature, it also provides for an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act to exclude these activities from freedom of information, FOI.  The LDA&rsquo;s non-economic public functions and the general administration of the LDA will be covered by FOI.<br/><br/>As I have outlined, the provisions in the general scheme are primarily intended to provide for the LDA's corporate form and financial structure and to reflect the Government&rsquo;s intention that it act on a commercial basis.</p><p>It is the Minister&rsquo;s wish and intention that the general scheme be advanced in drafting to a published Bill as a priority and with a view to enactment as speedily as possible, targeting the end of this year.</p><p> I thank the Chair and members for offering us the opportunity to update it on the general scheme of the Bill.  We are happy to clarify any issues arising.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Phelim O&rsquo;Neill, head of land at the Land Development Agency.  We will do all we can to assist the committee with its pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill.  I will provide members with an update on what the LDA has done in its start-up phase regarding the sites in our initial portfolio and the significant progress it has made in other areas since it was set up one year ago.  I will also outline our plans for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020.</p> <p>  Our challenge over the past year has been to balance moving as quickly as possible to accelerate the delivery of new homes in the short-term while building from scratch a new and significant Government agency with the appropriate governance, staff, structure and strategy to have what we consider to be a transformational and beneficial impact on land availability and housing supply in the long term.  We are fortunate to have a supportive and experienced board of directors and chair, who have provided the LDA with the oversight and direction it needs since they were appointed in January of this year.  The board has provided the growing executive and staff team on the ground with clarity of focus.  That focus is on opening up land for the development of new homes and providing affordable housing options for our citizens.</p> <p>  On home delivery in the short term, our focus has been on the eight sites in our initial portfolio and identifying the best route to deliver homes and support development on these sites in as expeditious and sustainable a way as possible.  With that in mind, we have advanced preliminary feasibility work on the eight sites, which have the capacity to deliver approximately 3,000 new homes.  One challenge was that the sites were quite raw and there was little or no work done on advancing the development process on them prior to the LDA becoming involved.  We have completed the initial feasibility work and, as such, professional teams have been appointed to advance planning applications for three of the sites, including in Skerries in north County Dublin, where approximately 250 homes will be delivered, on the site of the former St. Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital in Cork city which should yield approximately 200 homes, and at the former Devoy Barracks in Naas, County Kildare, which should yield approximately 200 homes.  In addition to the eight initial sites, the LDA is working on a ninth site in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  We anticipate it will deliver approximately 600 social and affordable homes in Shanganagh, Shankill, south County Dublin. The design work is well advanced and we aim to lodge the planning application before the end of the year.  Based on current information, we expect construction to start in late 2020, subject to the approval of the planning authority and the elected members of the county council.  In parallel with our work on the four sites I mentioned, further design teams will be appointed in the coming months.  We aim to have an ongoing pipeline of planning applications and construction starts.</p> <p>  Although the formal legal transfer of sites is to take place upon enactment of the Bill, the LDA has had full access to the sites in order to allow it to complete any necessary work in advance of their development.  The legal transfer has not held us up.  The transitionary period to which I referred is supported by pre-transfer agreements with landowners being put in place, as per the Government&rsquo;s decision on the transfer of the lands.  This will help to ensure continued co-operation and smooth the way for the legal transfer upon enactment by performing as much of the upfront legal work as we can</p> <p>  We are continually looking for new opportunities beyond the initial portfolio.  In this respect, we are working well with local authorities and other State bodies in regard to accessing additional land.  As members may appreciate, accessing this land is never straightforward, particularly where there are existing operations and uses on the land.  However, I am confident the LDA will gain access to additional State lands in the coming months and over the long term.  It is difficult to identify these lands in this statement due to negotiation sensitivities which I hope members will understand, but I would welcome the opportunity to update the committee on progress on a regular basis.  In terms of ongoing opportunities, of particular importance is that the proposed legislative mandate to identify relevant public lands using the wording in the draft Bill and to advise Government on their management is a key enabler for the LDA.</p> <p>  On the provision of affordable homes, of perhaps greater significance than our short-term delivery of units is the development of mechanisms to make accessing homes more affordable.  We are interested in innovation in respect of all housing tenures and make no secret of our ambition to develop scalable and more affordable renting mechanisms and platforms.  We are supported by our emerging partnerships with local authorities.  We are equally ambitious about meeting and, often, exceeding the 40% minimum social and affordable requirement on all sites.  For example, our aim is to provide 100% social and affordable homes on the Shanganagh site I mentioned.  We consider this a real statement of intent and a concrete example of the impact we are looking to make in the short term.  Our work in this area can help capitalise on, and provide scale to, the emerging affordable or mid-market rental platform being championed at the site on Enniskerry Road, County Dublin.  Our long-term ambition is that affordable rental homes become a viable and available option for citizens, as is the case in other European cities such as Vienna.</p> <p>  Making a long-term impact is of paramount importance.  Although there is an urgent requirement to focus on short-term need given the scale of housing supply pressures, we must also look at the long term.  In light of the historically volatile nature of our housing market, we cannot afford to lose sight of the importance of measures that will have an enduring and stabilising effect in the long-term.  The overriding motivation for the establishment of the LDA was to engender this long-term stability, utilising a wide range of tools, including more effective usage of State-owned lands, targeted deployment of State capital and other measures.  This, by its nature, is complex work and many of its benefits will only become visible and tangible over time.  However, I hope members will agree that it is no less important for that.</p> <p>  A key component of our work in this space is the development of long-term strategies for the LDA&rsquo;s activities in our main city locations.  This is a multi-year project that will allow us to focus our resources effectively within these locations to avoid haphazard decision making, such as where we might be interested in acquiring or opening up land at appropriate times in the economic cycle, and to support our national objective of compact and sustainable growth.  Other work supporting this long-term benefit includes the development of a State lands database.  This will give the State, for the first time, a comprehensive repository of information on the lands within its control and provide a valuable tool for managing the State&rsquo;s interests in a cohesive and co-ordinated manner.  The first major deliverable from this activity is expected in the coming months and focuses on State lands in Galway.  We hope it will provide us with a prototype which can be used as a pilot for developing the database nationwide.</p> <p>  On building a new organisation from scratch, we have had to design and build the operating and institutional platform of the LDA, which is an entirely new organisation, in a way that will create a valuable asset for the State.  This requires a skilled and experienced staff base, as well as procurement frameworks and other processes and procedures to allow it to operate as efficiently as possible, and in addition to governance structures to ensure robust oversight and accountability as a public body.  With this aim, the board assembled comprises a wide range of relevant skills and experience, with private sector and public sector knowledge. The board, with Mr. John Moran as chair, was formally constituted in January.  We have also made significant progress in hiring the right mix of skills to carry out the agency&rsquo;s duties on a day-to-day basis.  From a standing start, we have hired 11 direct employees with another due to start next week, all of whom are experienced professionals with detailed knowledge of property, finance, human resources, operations and organisational development.</p><p>We will likely double this resource base over the coming year.</p><p> We have put in place new governance structures and operational platforms that will serve the agency&rsquo;s needs, levering best practice from other State bodies and the private sector.  This will add momentum for the LDA to the deliver on its objectives, while also providing for effective oversight.  To complement our in-house staff, we have assembled a series of frameworks for engaging with external providers of professional services, such as architects, project managers and other essential partners.  This has allowed us to harness the external knowledge we need in an effective and cost-efficient way.  Professional service costs are an inherent feature of property development but, as custodians of State resources, we will constantly seek to manage these costs in a way that ensures value for money.</p><p> I will conclude by assuring the committee of our commitment to meeting our ambitions and reiterating our intention to make a tangible, beneficial and lasting difference to the housing market.  While 2019 has been primarily about putting in place the building blocks necessary to achieve this, I am confident that 2020 will be the year in which the LDA will be seen to make a visible and tangible impact.  I am conscious that we cannot achieve our aims without the ongoing support of this committee and our other stakeholders.  I thank the committee for the support it has shown to us so far and I look forward to continuing to work with members constructively to achieve our shared goal of accelerating the delivery of new homes, as well as the creation of liveable communities in a manner consistent with our compact growth objectives.  A major part of that work includes members' scrutiny of the general scheme of the Land Development Agency Bill, which is essential to give the LDA the tools it needs to deliver the success we collectively want it to achieve.  My colleague and I will be happy to take your questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.728" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#F00200"><p>This is hugely significant legislation, whatever an individual's view of it may be.  In some respects, it is on a par with the National Asset Management Agency Act back in 2009, though it is very different legislation and its intention is positive.  We are in the process of scrutinising an agency which, if it does what Government policy wants it to do, will hold assets equal to or even greater than the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, over its life cycle.</p> <p>  As I have been strongly of the view that we need an active land management agency with strong powers and a strong budget, I fully support that part of what is on the table.  Having read the heads, however, I am still not convinced that combining active land management with residential development in a single agency is the right approach.  This is more a criticism of Government than of the Department or the LDA.  It is deeply regrettable that, yet again, the Government is bypassing local authorities, refusing to resource them as the primary deliverers of residential development on public land and choosing, instead, to set up a new agency.  This is for a series of reasons which I hope to be able to come to in a couple of rounds of questions.</p> <p>  My big concern relates to the setting the LDA up as a commercial company.  I would like the witnesses to tease out the rationale for taking that option.  I presume it is because it wants to be off the Government's balance sheet.  The problem is that this sets up a series of difficulties for how the entity will work.  We already have been told that the bulk of the LDA's activities will not be subject to freedom of information requests, which was one of the big issues related to transparency in NAMA and its dealings with big public assets.  While head 8 states that it has to have regard to Government policy, it is an independent commercial company.  There will inevitably be conflicts between its commercial requirements and Government policy, as we have see in respect of section 10 of the NAMA Act and the terms of the body itself.</p> <p>  Head 8 also makes no reference to social or affordable housing.  In the head in question, there is no statutory obligation on the LDA to deliver social and affordable housing.  It may be the intention and it may be Government policy but we are setting up a commercial entity that will have a life of its own.  Why is there no clear unequivocal statutory responsibility to provide social and affordable housing in line with Government policy?  Why must it only have regard to Government policy, rather than being obliged to comply with it?</p> <p>  There are no compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers in the Bill as it stands.  I am a strong fan of active land management but without CPO powers there will be a big difficulty, because the only way of getting land off other public agencies is by engaging in commercial negotiations to purchase it, putting the agency in a very weak position.  CPOs cost the market price plus something extra, so they are not cheap.  Why are CPO powers not in the Bill?  The witnesses cannot comment on the Attorney General's advice but we know from leaks, presumably from somebody in Government, that the Attorney General is concerned that there will be a state aid rule issue.  Are there state aid rule concerns?  My big concern is that I am hearing we might get amendments on CPO powers on Report Stage or Committee Stage.  While it was bad enough to have relatively straightforward amendments to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act on Report Stage, something as constitutionally significant as CPO powers to an independent commercial company is another matter and I urge that this committee be given sufficient time to consider it, if that is the route we are going down.  Does any other independent commercial entity have CPO powers?  I know local authorities have them but I wonder if this is the first time an independent body would have such powers, if indeed they are to be given to the LDA.</p> <p>  My really big concern is the development model, which involves joint initiatives.  The witnesses mentioned Shanganagh but, to some extent, that involves poaching a really good local authority project that is already well developed simply because the Government would prefer it to be developed off-balance sheet.  Can they talk us through how the model works?  Some of us have a lot of experience of it, while others do not.  I will come back on the second round to interrogate their answers.</p> <p>  Mr. Coleman mentioned three sites, namely, Skerries, St. Kevin's and Devoy Barracks.  Can he give us a breakdown of the tenure mix in those?  What really matters in all of these, including Shanganagh, is the price.  What is the target for affordable rents and for affordable purchase?  In the one joint venture which we are currently looking at, namely, O'Devaney Gardens, elected members are being asked to vote on Monday on something for which they have not even been told the prices.  They have only been given very complicated sets of figures, though some of us have worked out what the prices are and they are nowhere close to affordable.  Can the witnesses give us some assurances of what the new agency hopes the price points for rent and affordability will be?</p></speech>

I also agree entirely with his views on the need for an active land agency.</p> <p>  The intention at Shanganagh is to deliver approximately 200 social units and some 310 cost rental units, with approximately 90 affordable purchase units, depending on the final decision of the elected members.</p><p>The manner in which we intend to deliver it is that the LDA will step in and deliver the social units on a project management basis, while the cost-rental units will be delivered on the basis of a financial model we want to put in place, whereby we will recover the construction and operating costs through the delivery of the rental and funding costs on an ongoing basis.  The intention is to come up with rent that is more affordable in the target market - people who struggle to afford private sector rents and those who cannot access social housing because they do not qualify for it.  It is a matter of trying to hit the mid-market level.  The same cohort would also qualify for the affordable purchase scheme.  The intention is that all of the homes delivered on site will look no different one from the other.  The social units will look the exact same and be built to the same specifications as the affordable units.  Regarding the structure, it will on completion require the delivery of social units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or to a nominee which could be an approved housing body.  The LDA will hold and operate, at least in the short term, the affordable rental units, while the affordable purchase units will be sold to qualifying participants.</p><p> I refer to the other sites we have mentioned, namely, the Skerries, St. Kevin's Hospital and Devoy Barracks sites.  The Skerries and Devoy Barracks sites originated from the Housing Agency which will be able to determine, in consultation with us, the composition of social and affordable units to meets its requirements.  That is part of the negotiation in accessing the sites.  We have not completed the discussions, but I would have thought and the early indications are that the Housing Agency will look for a level of social and affordable accommodation higher than 40% at those locations.  St. Kevin's Hospital in Cork has been sourced from the HSE and is subject to the wider requirement of the Government's decision on the figures of 10% for social housing and 30% for affordable homes on such sites.  I hope that answers Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question.</p><p> I will ask some of my colleagues to come in on some of the policy issues on which the Deputy touched.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#G00200"><p>I think the Deputy wanted them to be dealt with in a general sense, rather than specifically.  </p> <p>  The setting up of the LDA as a commercial body is set in the context of its primary objectives, which were, in respect of active land management, to make optimal use of State lands and the &euro;1.25 billion in State resources that would be invested through the ISIF.  The best way of leveraging it in the long term, with the target of delivering 150,000 homes over 20 years, is to set up the agency on a commercial basis.  In due course, if the decision, made independently by the statistical authorities, is that the LDA is off-balance sheet, it will not be Government debt in that regard.</p> <p>  As for the overall setting, we are consistently keeping our eye on the likes of EU state aid and procurement rules.  They have framed the legislation before the committee in terms of how the LDA can act in that delivery.  I will make a number of points about overall governance.  The shareholders are the Minister and the Minister of State.  NewERA has been working with us.  It is intended that it will advise the Ministers in that regard.  In keeping with the norm for a range of other commercial bodies that act in this area and make commercial decisions, NewERA will give independent advice to Ministers.  In that sense, each of them, in line with the code of practice, will receive a shareholder's expectation letter that will set out Government policy.  Ultimately, the LDA is owned by the Government.</p> <p>  We are looking carefully at the CPO issue which needs a little more work.  It is intended that there will be CPO powers.  It is a matter of getting the balance right.  Bodies such as the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, had CPO powers.  There are a range of powers within other areas, but I do not have the specific information to hand.  However, I take the point that if we are to bring forward something on Committee Stage, Deputy &Oacute; Broin will wish to see it.  The LDA has powers and there is some surrounding case law.  Some of the utilities also have powers.  Most of the powers are set in the context of the legislation.  As I said, I take the point that the Deputy would like to hear in good time about anything that is to be brought forward on Committee Stage to deal with the CPO issue in order that he may consider it.</p></speech>

Ms Graham has said the LDA works with the local authorities.  What consultation has taken place between the local authorities and the LDA?  I ask because this is about supply and land available for building.  I always say Dublin always seems to be the focus.  In his opening statement Mr. Coleman said the LDA was working on eight sites in Dublin, Cork and Naas.  It is important, however, that he explain what is happening.</p> <p>  I always say we must work together.  Can the LDA assure the public that, in working with the local authorities and adhering to development plans, local area plans and national planning policies, it can make an effective change in housing supply?  That is a huge question.  It is important that we do not just create a new agency with many great staff working to achieve very little; the LDA needs to ensure all land across the country is utilised and not caught up in red tape.  What exactly are the criteria in that regard?  The Government launched the agency last year, yet it was not put on a legal footing.  There were websites, appointments made through the board and promises, but, again, Mr. Coleman might come back to me on what exactly will happen from here on.  Before the summer recess, some of us asked for a list of lands held by the 31 local authorities at which the agency was looking.  It was said everything was sensitive, which I understand, but the LDA's biggest role is to provide information to ensure transparency.  If we get that, at least we will be able to go back with our concerns to the people for whom we work.  However, the agency was set up a year ago and there is still no information.  We do not need to start on that foot.  It is not good.  </p> <p>  Perhaps the delegates might come back to me with the answers to those questions.</p></speech>

Roughly 80% of the homes that could be delivered happened to be in Dublin.  We certainly have a focus on the key urban areas.  We have had considerable engagement with the local authorities in the relevant regions, especially in Cork, Limerick and Galway, and want to target others, including Waterford.  Part of our mandate is to provide a greater focus not simply on the building of homes but also on making regional areas more attractive to employers and other bodies in which to increase their significance in comparison with Dublin.</p><p>Obviously there are a lot of pressures in Dublin manifesting in very high housing costs and so on that we do not want to prevail.</p><p> The point has been well made and taken.  I can assure the Senator that it is a priority to achieve greater regional balance for the LDA board.  I am quite confident that she will see additional activity through 2020 in the regional cities, particularly by the LDA.  I am happy to come back to the Senator regularly to provide updates on what we are doing in this area.</p><p> A point was made that all of the land should be utilised, that it should not be caught up in red tape, and about the need to have transparency in terms of what the LDA is looking for and looking at.  I will give a combined answer.  The LDA was set up to enable and open up land and provide ways to develop land.  One of the ways to do so is to draw attention to what lands are in State ownership and other lands to see if we can bring them forward for development.  A key part of that will be the State lands database that we are compiling at present.  We anticipate that the database will be made available.  We want people to see what lands are available, in particular State lands.  We want to bring more attention to those and ask whether such lands can be used for alternative purposes.  It is part of our role to engender that.  We also want to consider site assembly opportunities.  Where pieces of land have been locked up to date, and they might be adjacent to State lands, we want to see if we can bring them into play as well, and not just look individually or in silos at pieces of land.  We want to bring in other lands that to date, for whatever reason, have been locked up, and provoke and see whether we can get additional action.  That points to the query made about making sure that land is utilised.  Any time we consider a piece of State land, we consider everything around it or close to it to see what else can be done to bring it into play.</p><p> Quite a bit has happened since we have been set up.  We now have a board.  We also have a panel of architects, designers, project managers and so on that we can access quickly.  As we properly procured them through public procurement, they can be quickly appointed to the sites we have access to.  We have a very skilled staff base, especially on the property side, who are experienced in project management and delivering large-scale residential projects.</p><p> In terms of the sites, it is probably not generally understood that a huge amount of front work must go into understanding what is on a site, its feasibility, capacity, traffic etc.  The LDA office has been a hive of activity with people trying to make sure such work is done.  If the front work were not done on sites, then we would not be in a position to appoint design teams to design what goes on the sites.  That work is below the radar but it stores up a lot more physical and tangible activity for the LDA through 2020.  Throughout 2020, one will see more planning applications lodged, more sites accessed and, ultimately, the construction of new homes on those sites.  I am confident that people will see that coming through.</p></speech>

More affordable options or mid-market options, as I like to call them, are acceptable to the councillors.  If we do not provide a solution around the affordable element, we will be unable to access the site.  Affordable housing is a key enabler for us.

Many of the projects that we saw in the first call for the urban regeneration development fund would be from local authorities doing feasibility studies for activation in their areas.  The two almost sit together.  We will see investment to unlock lands, certainly in many of the regional cities and towns.  There can be site assembly by local authorities, maybe on smaller sites rather than the LDA.  It is not taking that function away.</p></speech>

I look at this matter first and foremost from the point of view people who have been locked out of the housing market.  They are young people, people on low incomes and, in many cases, people on middle incomes.  When these people hear of the establishment of an agency that has a remit to deliver 150,000 houses over a 20-year period, they will probably think it is an opportunity.  Maybe they will think 20 years is a long time to deliver 150,000 houses and the time should be more compressed, but they will still view this as an opportunity.  When they hear that 60% of the houses are likely to be done on the basis of private market and market rates, they will consider themselves still locked out and that it will not deliver housing that is affordable for them.  They might think 30% is affordable but that depends on one's definition of affordable.  Recently, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government described a home in O'Devaney Gardens that costs &euro;310,000 as affordable.  The people I represent would say they would be priced out of that housing as well.</p> <p>  I repeat the question asked by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  How does Mr. Coleman define affordable?  Obviously affordability varies from site to site but what is the framework?  What type of affordable homes and prices does the LDA aim to deliver for the people I am talking about?  Given there are so many people on the housing list in this State, I must register my opposition to the allocation of 10%.  The Taoiseach spoke about this being modelled on the ESB or Aer Lingus where the private sector did not deliver but the State stepped in and delivered.  In reality, what we have is a housing crisis delivered by the private sector and the solution provided by this Government is the biggest privatisation of public lands in the history of the State.</p> <p>  I will get down to brass tacks and discuss my own area.  The initial feasibility work has been completed and professional teams have been appointed to advance planning applications on the St. Kevin's development, which is good.  When can we expect the planning application to be lodged?  I know no one can state the day or week but when is it hoped that on-site construction will begin?  When will the houses be delivered and available to people?</p> <p>  Again, I will discuss the ratio of 60:30:10.  A lack of housing for key workers is a huge problem in Cork city.  For example, ambulance paramedics, firefighters, nurses and teachers cannot afford housing in the city, so they must move far out into the county to source cheaper accommodation and drive to work every day.  There is a real opportunity with 200 houses.  If it is 60% at market rates, these people will be priced out of the market.</p><p>Why do we not buck the trend and challenge that at the St. Kevin's development?  Why do we not have a far bigger percentage of genuinely affordable housing and a bigger percentage of social housing there?  The social housing lists are bursting at the seams.  Why is the ratio 60:30:10 and can that be changed?</p><p> One of the biggest swathes of new housing we will have is in Cork docklands, with 15,000 units, which is probably 10% of the overall Land Development Agency, LDA, target.  There is a multiplicity of sites there.  I could name them but would take up too much of the committee's time.  Will the witnesses give the committee an idea which will be the first two or three sites that may be developed there and the timescale?  If St. Kevin's is to be the first site in the city, what will be first docklands site to be developed and when?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Coleman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#J00200"><p>I thank Deputy Barry.  If the Deputy does not mind, I will start with the last question.  I totally agree that Cork docklands is a massive opportunity to increase the scale of Cork.  It is a huge urban regeneration opportunity.  It is almost contiguous with the existing urban fabric beside the other office accommodation and other residential accommodation that has been contemplated in the area.  We are in fairly regular in-depth consultation with our colleagues in Cork City Council around the development of the whole area to see what added value the LDA can bring.  A lot of work is ongoing there with Cork City Council.</p> <p>  With regard to what will be the first sites to come on stream, I am not trying to evade the question but the issues around the Cork docklands are very complex in the context of infrastructure, levels, flood defences and other infrastructure that may be required, including bridges, and the existing operations of the Port of Cork, which is planned to move out to Ringaskiddy.  Without that initial feasibility work being complete, which is in progress, at this point it is difficult to say exactly what will come on stream first.  It will depend on a number of factors.  This is not to try to evade the question.  My comments are to reassure the Deputy that we share his views on this opportunity and that we are placing a lot of focus on that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to this being a privatisation of public lands.  Part of the LDA's remit will be, at the appropriate time, to assemble its own landbank, but perhaps not exclusively from public sector sources.  There may be a point in time in the cycle of the market or for very long-term land where it might make sense for the LDA to acquire land on the market.  It could almost be the opposite effect to the point made earlier in that land currently privately held may become publicly held.  It is not all one-way traffic over the long term of the LDA.  In ensuring value for public money in our operations, we have to consider aspects such as the point in time of the market cycle we are at when any decision is made, where a particular piece of land is at in its zoning, or the timeframe for when it will become available for housing delivery.  It is important to note this.</p> <p>  On the affordability split for the sites we are working on with the local authorities and the Housing Agency, the social and affordable component will actually be higher than the 40% component, which is the Government decision relating to centrally controlled lands that requires a minimum 40% social and affordable housing.  When one considers the composition of the LDA's entire portfolio, and given that we will be dealing with local authorities also, it is likely to be quite a bit higher than 40% of social housing on the portfolio basis.</p> <p>  The question of what is affordable and what the term "affordable housing" means is a really good question.  Housing at every level is affordable to someone and is unaffordable to others.  The LDA is targeting a mid-market product, especially on the rental side, for people who are perhaps locked out of private housing or who are finding it extremely difficult to afford private sector rents, and those who do not necessarily qualify for or cannot access social housing.  It is these people in the middle.  We have done some work looking at deciles of income and trying to land a rental product for cost rental bang in the middle of an affordability level for people on those incomes.  This is what we are targeting.  We are not going to build something and then work out what it cost us to deliver and look to get that back in the rental cost, whatever that is.  We are starting with the objective of targeting those people and they are the people the Deputy has mentioned: key workers, nurses, fire service workers, teachers and so on, who struggle in the private sector market.  This is what we are looking at.  We are not doing it in a vacuum in terms of what those people can afford.  We are targeting to deliver something they can access without putting them under undue financial stress also.</p> <p>  I hope this address some of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

Active work is happening on that.  We anticipate having a planning application lodged in mid-2020.  We are hoping for construction to start in the first half of 2021 with homes delivered in the first half of 2022.  It is important to note that property development by its nature is inherently uncertain with regard to timeframes.  Issues always arise, perhaps through planning or one may discover an impediment on site.  These timelines are our best and fairest estimates currently.  I assure Deputy Barry that my team on the LDA land and development side is constantly looking for ways to pull out blocks of time from that process to ensure activity happens as quickly as possible on site.</p></speech>

Addressing vacant and derelict sites to turn them into much-needed homes is a welcome measure, but I want to learn more.  I seek a number of clarifications from the representatives today.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses please clarify the ownership of the currently publicly held land, before and after development?  Will they also clarify the ownership of the homes that are built?  Regarding the 60:30:10 mix, will those homes be in the ownership of the State, individuals, developers or corporate landlords?</p> <p>  I also wish to press the witnesses on the definition of "affordable".  As Mr. Coleman has rightly said, every home is affordable to somebody if he or she has enough money.  It seems to be the crux of the issue and I would like to hear more about that.  What might be an affordable rent?  The success of renting in places like Hamburg or Vienna is to do with security of tenure as well as reasonable rates of rent.</p> <p>  If there is any profit, will the witnesses indicate to whom this would accrue and where it would go?</p><p> On the governance arrangement, I would be interested to know more about DACs.  I also wish to know more about mitigation against conflicts of interest on the board and among the staff.  There were many golden circles that got us into a lot of difficulty.  How can we mitigate against those?  With regard to freedom of information and measures against lobbying, how can we be certain that the company will not make the same mistakes that were made before?</p><p> Could I have clarification on inter-agency inter-sectoral arrangements with local authorities and on interfacing with local plans, the Housing Authority, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and developers?  Is there a possibility that the new entity will create duplication and additional delays?  Has anything arisen to date that needs to be ironed out before we put something into law?  Are there lessons about which we need to know?</p><p> My final question is for Ms Graham.  She said in her presentation that the general scheme makes it clear that the LDA must have regard to Government policy on proper planning and sustainable development and contribute to the economic and social development of the State while at the same time obtaining a positive financial return for the State.  That is a balancing statement.  How will the balance be achieved?  Who will make the decisions?  How will it work in practice?  It seems a little vague.  I would like clarification on those questions.</p></speech>

Let me address some of her queries.  She asked a good question on whether we are adding another layer on top of what already exists between local authorities and other public bodies.  I would respond with a firm "No".  We are only seeking to become involved where we are additive, or where something that could be done is perhaps not being done.  Alternatively, where a public body does not have a housing remit, we must ask whether we can make the land in question available for housing while also taking account of the body's own operational needs.  There is certainly no adding to duplication or delays.  On the contrary, we envisage becoming involved only where there is a void or a need to fill a gap, or where delays can be taken out of the process.  That is our objective.</p> <p>  Let me touch on some of the points made on the ownership of publicly owned land and the question of who will own property when it is built.  There is no simple answer because there will be a multitude of categories.  For example, some houses will be built and sold to occupiers, who will own them.  Some of the homes will be social housing and will be built and held by local authorities or their nominees, such as AHBs.  Some homes, as in Shanganagh, will be built through the LDA in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and will be held, in the short to medium term, at least, by the LDA and rented to people at mid-market level.  There is a multitude of ways in which the homes will come out.  We are not restricting ourselves to any particular tenure.</p> <p>  I agree the question of what is affordable is a key one.  On emulating what is happening elsewhere, in Vienna cost-rental is a major form of tenure.  We are examining examples from the Continent closely.  We have participated in much of the discussion on cost-rental and the Vienna model over the past year.  We have spoken at many events also.  We envisage the cost-rental product we are seeking to deliver in Shanganagh and on the other sites to which we have access as being entirely consistent with that.  It will be sustainable over the long term because, as the name implies, the rent is a fair rent set to recover the cost of delivering the product.  It is entirely consistent with our mandate.</p> <p>  I was asked whether the model represents a privatisation of State assets.  This model actually expands the State's reach into housing, housing delivery and housing stock.  At present, our reach as a State is through social housing only but in places such as Vienna, Hamburg and the Netherlands, social housing means a different thing.  It includes a much broader cohort of the population.  Half the population, or maybe 60% in the Netherlands, live in what they call social housing.  It is a much broader category.</p></speech>

On security of tenure, if we are to hold and operate cost-rental accommodation efficiently, at least in the short to medium term, we will want people to stay and continue to pay the rent.  We will not be like private-sector landlords, who would be happy for people to leave in a rising rental market.  They could recalibrate rent on a tenant's departure.  That is not our objective.  We would want people to stay.  In jurisdictions such as Germany, people stay in rental accommodation for 13, 14 or 15 years.  We would want to offer that to people here.  They might not want to because they might have other aspirations but we would like to offer it.  It has a number of benefits, including the avoidance of transient communities.  It would result in the building of communities.</p></speech>

On local authority lands or perhaps some of the Housing Agency lands, however, the proportion of social and affordable housing will be much higher.  In Shanganagh, for instance, it is 100%.  It will not be the same everywhere.</p> <p>  The question of what is affordable is a key one, as I mentioned to Deputy Barry.  We are taking an evidence-based approach to it.  One one level, we face the constraint of delivering a product that ultimately covers its cost and, on the other, we must provide housing that is genuinely affordable.  It is no good if the housing covers its cost but is not affordable to the target market.  That is why we are doing a lot of work to understand what our target market is.  It is associated with those middle deciles of household income.  It is a matter of trying more to understand the percentage of that income that should be available to those concerned to meet accommodation costs while allowing them to live an enjoyable life and cover the costs of living beyond housing costs.  We are doing a lot of work on that.  The perceived wisdom is that around one third of a person's net disposable income should be available to meet housing costs.  That is in and around what we are targeting for the middle deciles of income.</p></speech>

The designated activity company under the Companies Act 2014 replaced what we used to refer to as limited companies.  Many of our commercial State bodies are in that corporate form.  Considering the general scheme, there are a couple of areas where that does not apply, or where we disapply it.  An example concerns the accounts being given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This involves a mix of the company law and the State governance aspect.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the objectives of the LDA and having regard to planning policy and other considerations.  With regard to planning policy, the LDA is really a creature of the national planning framework.  It has been set up to support the goal of compact growth and to deliver on the population requirements coming from the national planning framework.  It will obviously be applying for planning permission and will have to be consistent with the policies set out by local authorities in the cascade that will come down from that.</p> <p>  The other element was contributing to economic and social development and competitiveness, in addition to making a financial return.  It is about acting commercially with a conscience.  The economic aspect and social development will both be taken into account.</p><p>The dividend authority for the profits that may accrue in the case of all commercial bodies is set down by the relevant Minister who, in this case, is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  All dividends from State bodies accrue to the Exchequer.  Dividend policy is usually set out in the shareholder expectation letters which are received by all such commercial bodies.  The policy might state returns are not required at an early stage of a body's evolution, that the returns are to be reinvested, or it might set out a particular requirement.  It is a long-term objective.  I hope that addresses the issues raised.</p><p> The Department, with the LDA and the Housing Agency, is looking at all aspects of housing, including the cost rental model.  There are definitions of affordable housing within statutes and regulations, as well as the wider concept of affordable housing.  The 40% quota about which we are talking is not a statutory requirement; it is a decision the Government has made which applies to any public land being disposed of, even if the LDA is not looking after it.  The definition of public lands is given at the beginning of the general scheme of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister circulated a briefing note on his appointment yesterday, which reminded me that Mr. Coleman was involved in NAMA, banking and accountancy - three areas that do not generally instill much public confidence or trust.  One of the big challenges facing the organisation is that it must gain public trust and public confidence.  Mr. Coleman has a huge responsibility on his shoulders, as do the chairman and the whole organisation.  We also have a responsibility, as legislators, in deciding how to frame, adjust, amend, or tweak the legislation before us.</p> <p>  I note a number of concerning issues.  First, we may need to further scrutinise the freedom of information arrangements for this legislation because we need openness and transparency.  We must learn from some of the terrible things that happened with NAMA, although they were not Mr. Coleman's responsibility.  The references to NAMA, banking and finance jumped off the page at me.  The biggest, most important job is building trust.</p> <p>  The LDA has two interrelated responsibilities, as the delegates know.  One is to drive the delivery of new homes, utilise State lands and assemble large-scale strategic land banks involving public and private lands.  It is not restricted to housing; it can also be commercial.  The LDA has a financial remit with shares set up to pay for it.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions about the relationship between the LDA and local authorities.  Mr. Coleman stressed this issue and talked about bringing added value, which is important.  We cannot and should not have duplication.  The local authority is the planning authority and the housing authority.  It also has many other functions.  We have seen the consistent erosion of the powers and functions of elected members of local democracy and government.  That is a common theme running through a range of issues and services, from Traveller accommodation and local government finance to local property tax and the planning regulator.  More central powers have been granted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, while local elected members have less involvement in engaging, even in strategic development housing, for instance.  Under this regime we have experienced an erosion of local democracy.  That is a fact and I challenge anyone to dispute it.  While I am concerned about this, I welcome the principle behind the establishment of the Land Development Agency and what it will achieve.  It is, effectively, the State's real estate manager.</p> <p>  I am not going to get into specifics, but I see enormous potential in the Dublin docklands.  We have also discussed the docklands in Cork and Galway.  I am familiar with a number of them and their potential.  We have to realise land is a valuable State asset which has to be utilised for housing, to gain economic benefits for the State, for job creation and in future planning.  I want to flag this because it is important.</p> <p>  Transparency and public confidence are also important aspects of this matter.  Will the delegates confirm that the LDA has the capacity to secure funding from the European Investment Bank?  I assume that is a given, but I ask the delegates to talk about that issue and it being off-balance sheet.</p> <p>  I foresee a potential of conflict in acquiring lands from local authorities that currently have a section 138 disposal mechanism in place which empowers the elected members, not the executive, to dispose of any property on their books for longer than 12 months by lease, sale or freehold.  That will present problems and I understand it has already done so.</p> <p>  We have talked about the Shanganagh Castle site a number of times.  It has been stated it will consist of all social and affordable housing, which I welcome because it is a fantastic site.  I ask the delegates to confirm the transfer arrangements.  As I presume they will require some lean on the assets of these properties for guarantees and in getting funding, I ask them to tease out the matter for me.  Are the LDA, the State and the Department advocating for compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers for the LDA?  A number of State agencies have CPO powers, as did NAMA, of which Mr. Coleman will be aware.  How that worked and the experiences of it is another story.  That will present challenges which we will have to overcome to get these lands.  I ask the delegates to touch on this issue.</p> <p>  In his presentation Mr. Coleman mentioned the challenges of the formal legal transfer, which will potentially be his biggest issue.  It will also be a challenge for us in the context of the legislation and due process.  He talked about partnership and synergy.  I like the tone of it because some local authorities will think of the LDA as another big agency established by the State to come and take their lands.  I can see why they would have that fear, but it is not necessarily genuine and their fears need to be allayed.</p> <p>  I will touch on one or two more issues.  The delegates are going to talk to us about the Shanganagh Castle site.  I ask them to also share with us where they are with the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum.  It is a substantial site with potential capacity for 1,500 units.</p> <p>  Head 9 may be the most challenging part of the legislation.  I do not think the LDA will have problems in identifying the landowners, as there are substantial wasted lands all over the place.  I have a copy of the vacant site levy implementation progress report that was filed with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for each of the 31 local authorities.  It makes for very interesting reading.  Substantial lands that are vacant, abandoned, or derelict may not fall within the remit or ownership of local authorities.  That is a challenge for everyone, including State agencies.  I suggest the LDA and the Department take a fresh look at this issue and seek an update from each of the 31 local authorities on these derelict, abandoned and vacant land assets.  There is enough development potential in these lands for the next 50 years if they get their hands on them.</p> <p>  I refer to acquiring lands in public and private ownership.  How will the LDA acquire lands?  If someone says the LDA or the State wants 100 acres of land in south County Dublin, the price of the land will go up.  People are going to know about it.  Price sensitivity is an issue, as is confidentiality.  There is a need for a balance between it and public knowledge.  How do the delegates envisage all of it working out?  It is perhaps the biggest challenge of all.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Coleman well.  It is an exciting project which I support in principle.  However, I am concerned that the local authorities might believe there is duplication, or that their own powers are being eroded further.</p><p>I am asking the simple question again: is the Department proposing or recommending compulsory purchase powers in the legislation and what is the view of officials of that policy?  Is compulsory purchase simply something to have up the Government's sleeve as a potential - perhaps not weapon - tool to be brought into play if it does not receive co-operation in the disposal of these land assets?</p></speech>

There are decisions the LDA could make on purchasing land, but we are looking at the potential for compulsory purchase.  It is just a question of how to get the balance right.  Particularly in the context of the full assembly of a mixed site, strips of land, colloquially known as "ransom strips", could be used.  We are trying to strike that balance.  </p> <p>  Senator Boyhan made a point about the LDA having the capacity with local authorities and other public bodies to look at that issue in a confidential manner in order that they could act commercially and land prices could be kept from rising.  That feeds into his first question about the balance within freedom of information legislation and what is commercial and the other elements of the operation.  That is the balancing act in which we are trying to engage.  I agree completely with him on the need to utilise all sites.  That is obviously one of the pillars of Rebuilding Ireland.  We have done a great deal of work on vacant sites reuse and obviously introduced things like repair and lease programmes in that context.  Proposals are coming under the urban and rural development fund, particularly in smaller towns where there may be a derelict site at the back of a shop on a main street which could be activated.  There are also larger regeneration projects in respect of the LDA.  All of these things have to be moving in the right direction.</p> <p>  In our engagement with the chief executives of the local authorities who we meet regularly they have demonstrated a co-operative spirit with regard to the LDA.  The Senator is concerned that they might see it as a threat, but they are working together in a way that will avoid the issue of duplication that has been raised here to ensure both parties will have the best outcome.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the disposal of local authority lands, which is a much broader matter.  The lands the legislation defines as "public lands" are those lands owned by Ministers and direct non-commercial entities.  The LDA will act with commercial bodies on a commercial basis and local authorities on a partnership basis, rather than seeking to acquire local authority lands.  Mr. Coleman might explore that issue.  There will be a broader governance piece on changing local authority and elected members' powers of scrutiny of their own landbanks.</p></speech>

However, the LDA is working with the local authorities and has powers under the legislation to deal with a wide range of bodies, including local authorities, for the purposes of master planning and other arrangements.  In that sense, it can deal with all actors, public or private.</p></speech>

A very good example is the site in Shanganagh, which is live and perhaps the most advanced project we have with any local authority.  If the LDA is to build and operate mid-market cost rental homes on that land, it will be required to transact on that portion of the land with the local authority at some level.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, the EIB or any funder to which we are speaking will look for some form of effective security if we are borrowing to enhance the productivity of the land to enable our construction, just like a bank would seek security on the land.  It does not have to be the freehold but could be a leasehold of sufficient length to allow it to have an effective security position if things were to go wrong.  That element of it might require the application of section 183, but everything that happens up until then will be done in partnership with the local authority.  The relationship that has developed in the past year has been very good.  There was an initial question mark over what it actually was and how it would work as far as the local authorities were concerned.  It goes back to the issue of avoiding duplication.  Where people are doing things well, we do not want to upset them.  It is only where we can add something to the mix that we will do so.  That goes back to the Bill and the functions it contains to facilitate work with local authorities to assist and advise them where they require it.  The relationship with local authorities is generally good and when we are ultimately transacting with them, it will have to be on a level that is acceptable to them.  There are reserved functins such as those in section 183 to be considered.</p></speech>

How we manage our land and affordability is critical.  As such, I welcome the establishment of the LDA, albeit I have some questions about the establishment process and how oversight will be carried out.  I will start on the oversight issue.  It concerns the oversight of the LDA and, subsequently, any subsidiary of it.  When I was newly elected to the Oireachtas three years ago, it came as a bit of shock to find that I was not allowed to ask questions about Irish Water.  Will I be able to submit parliamentary questions about the operation of the Land Development Agency?  Are there parts of it that I will be excluded from asking about in respect of oversight?  Will it stretch to subsidiaries of the LDA also?</p> <p>  When we talk about affordability, land cost is an issue.  I noted Ms Graham saying all State land would be transferred at market value.  Once we keep using market value for land, achieving affordability becomes very difficult.  As we are all aware at this stage, regulation is the same across the country.  Building material, labour and finance costs might vary slightly, depending on the higher risk in rural areas, but the fundamental key to achieving affordability is the cost of land.  When we transfer State land to another State body at market value, I do not know how we can achieve affordability.  I mean that genuinely.  We have mentioned the national development plan and the ramping up of compact growth.  We are also ramping up densities.  We are, in fact, ramping up the market value of land.  All of our development plans nationally have perhaps one full cycle of six years and perhaps another half cycle for land zoned.  This has ramped up the value to a greater extent.</p><p>If we are buying all of it at market value, I question how we will ever get to the level of affordability.</p><p> We have had representatives of the Department, local authorities and approved bodies before us and today we have officials from the Land Development Agency.  Only last week we had the Minister before us, while the proposal in the budget last year was to allow local government a cap of &euro;6 million with which it could deliver housing.  The Minister said that would not happen as we needed oversight.  He said local authorities should go through the 59-week, four-stage process and that he would not give those powers to them because they did not have the ability to deliver.  We are handing &euro;1.25 billion to the Land Development Agency.  Does it have a four-stage, 59-week process?  If a local authority skips the Department because the process is too complicated and goes straight to the Land Development Agency, will it get through it much more quickly?</p><p> How we deliver housing in the future will be more complex because of the introduction of the Land Development Agency, especially as it tries to deliver 150,000 houses over 20 years.  That works out at 7,500 houses per year.  How many of them will be delivered through the local authorities or privately on public or State lands?  I might come back in later on that issue.</p><p> The off-balance sheet position and the commercial basis of this body are of interest because we have just gone through two sessions discussing how and why approved housing bodies have been moved from being off-balance sheet to being on-balance sheet.  The delegates said with near certainty that the Land Development Agency process will be off-balance sheet, but perhaps that is not the case.  In our interactions with the approved housing bodies, the Department of Finance and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government it was clear that it was not just the capital aspect that made the process on-balance sheet but rather the control of the local authority.  There was the differential rent aspect, allocation and design criteria, which had led to the Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT indicating that all it was on-balance sheet.</p><p> Who is dictating the allocation of all social and affordable housing related to the Land Development Agency?  Is it the agency or the local authorities?  </p><p> They are a few initial questions, but I might come back in again in the second round as I have certain concerns about oversight.  I am disappointed by the 60:40 split that was mentioned, as is everybody here.  Is it worth considering it within primary legislation and putting a figure on it?</p></speech>

There were a number of issues raised about oversight and governance.  We have set this up to be a commercial State body, with a view to it being off-balance sheet.  That is ultimately a matter for the CSO and EUROSTAT to decide, but we take into account our best judgment in establishing the governance, oversight and models for trying to balance all components of European Union state aid and public procurement rules, as well as commerciality.  A commercial body needs to act economically within a market.  That is part of the balancing of the percentage of affordable housing.</p> <p>  There are a couple of components to oversight.  The shareholding Ministers are the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who holds the majority share and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There are the normal activities in which a commercial body needs to engage for the shareholding Minister.  There will be a shareholders' expectation letter, setting out all of the requirements, with a code of practice for State bodies, setting out the elements of strategic plans and financial accounts, some of which is also reflected in legislation.  A particular element, which is similar to Home Building Finance Ireland, is that the Land Development Agency will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There will be direct Oireachtas oversight in that regard.</p> <p>  In common with other commercial bodies and the process for parliamentary questions, the arrangement is that the Minister will answer questions about the policy elements, while the day-to-day arrangements will include facilities for Oireachtas Members to receive prompt answers to questions.  That will be required of the Land Development Agency, but it will not be through the parliamentary question system.  </p> <p>  There are a number of complexities surrounding the position of being on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet, as described by the Deputy.  It is quite complex.  Currently, the agency's funding under the establishment order comes through our Vote.  It is within government.  When the Central Statistics Office has the legislation, business plan and all of the other elements, it will make a judgment.</p> <p>  The legislation is trying to comprehend all eventualities, including in the short term and potential powers the Land Development Agency may need in the longer term.  Some of the issues such as the 40% figure mentioned by the Deputy are, therefore, dealt with as part of Government policy rather than being written down in legislation because it applies not only to the Land Development Agency but also to other bodies disposing of land outside these arrangements.  It is a broader matter.  </p> <p>  I believe I have answered the Deputy's questions and Mr. Coleman will follow up on them.  He will explain in more detail the market value model.  In the context of providing for what happen in the longer run, it allows for acquisition.  The other component is that an equity investment can be made.  The land will be valued and it will take account of the fact that there is affordable housing to be developed on it.  It will take into account the state of the land with reference to the required infrastructure.  In the transfer the Land Development Agency will take an equity investment, rather than having to hand over cash.</p></speech>

I know from experience that land could not be given away in Dublin five or six years ago, but now it is massively expensive.  In some locations, for an apartment home, there could be a derived land cost well in excess of &euro;100,000.  This swing and volatility in land values is a big issue.</p> <p>  Ms Graham has mentioned how the Land Development Agency gets land and the consideration is that if it gets it at market value, will it fuel the process again.  That is not the case.  As Ms Graham said, the land will transfer at a value, taking account of the affordability requirement.  Effectively, the value will be reduced to facilitate the delivery of affordable accommodation on the land.  At Shanganagh, where the site comprises entirely social and affordable housing, there will be a vastly reduced value attached to the land.  It will be reduced near enough to zero in order that social and affordable housing can be delivered on it.  The risk of the agency fuelling the process is somewhat mitigated by the values taking account of the affordability requirement.</p></speech>

Roughly speaking, it would be something like that but the price he pays for the site would always be tagged to what he thinks he can sell the house for at the end.  Similarly, if the LDA is looking to target an affordability level, it will impact on what can be paid for the site because the costs of delivery are relatively fixed in that they are the market costs of going to a contractor, etc.  The affordability requirement will effectively reduce the value of the site.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.780" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#O00200"><p>Is that the reason for the high level of private housing on some of the sites?  Is this high level to offset the affordability requirement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Coleman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#O00300"><p>While that will obviously assist with the delivery of affordable accommodation, that is a policy matter for Government.  The issue is much more complex than pure value.  One has to look at sites on a site-by-site basis.  For instance, we have access to a site in Balbriggan in north County Dublin where the general area has relatively high levels of social housing and State-funded housing.  It might be appropriate to diversify social mix to facilitate the delivery of private or affordable homes in that site.  The decision is taken on a case-by-case basis.  It could even be that the market value of a home in that area will be relatively affordable compared with other locations.  The issue has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>I am <i>ad idem</i>with the Deputy that the cost of land is generally a difficulty in the market.  One of the issues I recall from my previous life is that a seller trying to get someone to pay as much as possible for the item being sold, which is land in this case, is always looking for competitive tension because there is a limited supply of what is being sold versus the number of people seeking to buy that item.  That scenario, whereby a large number of people were chasing land, has pertained until now, although the position has been alleviated somewhat in more recent months.  Potential buyers can do as many spreadsheets as they wish but, ultimately, they must consider what their competitors will bid.  This competitive tension ramps up values and part of the reason for that is there are not enough land development opportunities available.  Part of our mandate is to make more land available for development by utilising State land and other land where we can.  This will remove some of that competitive tension from the land market.  The objective is to have the competition element arise when the homes are completed and sold or on the basis of innovative construction measures that deliver homes more cost-effectively, rather than at the point at which the raw material - the land - is being purchased in the first place.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiments on land costs.</p></speech>

We have governance structures in place to deal with that.  We recognise that while we were set up to be an independent, commercial semi-State body, we are ultimately custodians of public money.  We are very conscious of that and we have rigorous internal procedures in place for valuing sites and developments and, ultimately, for valuing investment decisions.  We have two sub-committees of the board of directors, namely, the audit risk committee and the investment committee.  The investment committee scrutinises proposals to ensure there is something from a risk and value perspective for which the LDA should be utilising public money.</p></speech>

All bodies are covered by the public spending code.  As Mr. Coleman noted, that would apply to the LDA.  However, there is a difference between the governance of Exchequer funds and the funds of a commercial semi-State body.  One of the elements I referred to earlier was NewERA.  What usually happens with the investment programmes of a commercial State body is that a threshold is set and any projects that exceed that threshold come directly to the Minister.  The entering into the capital commitment, rather than the project itself, is then considered.  This consideration involves looking into how stretched the company is financially to ensure it is financially sound and the additional capital commitment does not overstretch it.  It is done on the basis of that kind of capacity.  That is where our governance of the LDA's spending would come into play.</p></speech>

If we were to do this all over again, I would not start from here.  In light of all the responses to the questions, I respectfully suggest that the cart has been placed before the horse.  At this late stage, we should be discussing draft legislation rather than the heads of Bill, given that the LDA was announced over 12 months ago.  Does the Department or the Minister have a timeframe in mind for passing this legislation?  What happens to the LDA if this legislation is not passed before this D&aacute;il and Seanad are dissolved?  With political cycles, that is a distinct possibility.  We have two more sessions of pre-legislative scrutiny on the heads of the Bill and my party and I are not happy with significant parts of this legislation.  It is not for the Department to answer for this as I fully respect the job the officials have to do.  My issue is with the structure of the LDA, land disposal and various other matters on which we did not agree when I asked representatives of the Housing Agency about them at a committee meeting some weeks ago.</p> <p>  Mr. Coleman stated that while the LDA had control or oversight of the land, it will not have the land until the legislation is passed and it can be transferred to the agency.  We will not allow this legislation to be rushed because the LDA is a significant body.  I support in principle the idea of an agency to deliver homes or develop land but I wonder what will happen to the LDA if the legislation is not passed.  What will happen to the eight sites the agency oversees if there is no legislation in place to underpin it?</p> <p>  I was a little surprised when Mr. Coleman indicated that little or no work had been done on these eight sites.  That is not my understanding of the position.  I know a full master plan has been done for Castlelands in Balbriggan.  Mr. Coleman did not refer to that site but it is potentially one of the LDA's sites.  A significant amount of work has been done on the site by the local authority.  I need to be comfortable that, in general, we are not facilitating a wholesale transfer of responsibility from the State and the local authorities to a commercial semi-State entity to deliver public housing.  From reading the heads of the Bill, it appears that this vehicle would permit that.  Deputy Casey referred to a disagreement that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has been having with regard to an agreement made last year to raise the discretionary cap to &euro;6 million and allow local authorities more freedom to deliver social housing developments.  On the one hand, the Minister described this as a reckless move while, on the other, he is seeking to set up an agency with a budget of &euro;1.25 billion which will not be subject to freedom of information legislation.</p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Coleman on his appointment, which was only formally made yesterday.  Sources from the Land Development Agency were reported in the media over the summer as saying the agency would not be subject to the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  Why is that?  Who has that opinion?  I respectfully suggest that it is the Houses of the Oireachtas - the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and this committee - that decide what is in the legislation.  It is not for officials in the Department or employees of the Land Development Agency to decide what is permissible and what their roles are.  All we have are the heads of the Bill.  I return to my earlier point regarding the announcement made last September to establish the Land Development Agency, on foot of which a skeletal structure was set up.</p><p>Why has it taken so long to get to the stage of producing the heads of the Bill?  When will we see the draft legislation?</p><p> Regarding the disposal of land, affordable purchase and the idea of chasing affordability based on market value, we do not agree that the LDA needs to dispose of land to deliver affordable housing.  I have been struck by the constant references to affordable rent, cost rental and the Vienna model, which Mr. Coleman has mentioned more times than affordable purchase.  A mix is required.  Senator Kelleher mentioned security of tenure.  My party holds the view that the best security of tenure is to own an affordable home.  We do not believe that disposing of land to deliver affordability is necessary.  Mr. Coleman seems to be saying that that is Government policy.  If the Government changes, though, the LDA will have to deliver the new Government's policy, whoever is in it, should the LDA be formally established under legislation.  Many of the issues involved flow from the fact that this should not have been announced until more work had been done on the legislation, powers, roles and areas of responsibility.</p><p> Oversight is my main concern.  It was stated that the Committee of Public Accounts would have oversight.  That is good.  I was its Vice Chairman in a previous term and it is a good committee that provides good oversight.  What about parliamentary questions and oversight by this committee, though?  According to head 39, the Freedom of Information Act will not apply to the LDA where its commercial functions are concerned.  That is a blanket cover and will remove wholesale the various functions listed in head 9(2).  I could understand if a matter had to do with the price of purchasing land or tenders to specific developers or builders, but the Bill is effectively saying that people cannot find out about anything.</p><p> I would like an answer to the question about the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  Perhaps the media has misreported it.  I read a number of times over the summer that the LDA would not be subject to the lobbying Act.</p><p> I have other questions to ask.  From speaking to local authorities across the country, agreeing criteria for a national affordable purchase scheme is crucial.  Lacking a scheme will hinder the LDA's job and the costing of its sites.  Will Mr. Coleman or Mr. O'Neill comment on this?  It is an issue when trying to cost an arrangement, as I have seen at a number of the LDA sites.  In Ballinastone in Donabate, the local authority is finding it difficult to know what to put the houses out to sale for because it does not have an affordable purchase scheme.</p><p> I will contribute again during the next round of questions.</p></speech>

We are looking for an early enactment.  Obviously, there is a process.  We welcome that the committee has taken this legislation speedily, as the pre-scrutiny stage will feed into our drafting process.</p> <p>  Regarding the associated issues, this legislation is setting the LDA up on commercial terms.  A critical component is the capitalisation of &euro;1.25 billion.  As Mr. Coleman outlined, there is wide scope within the establishment order, which is allowing the LDA to advance the lands and gives it the power to acquire, purchase and take on leases.  On a practical day-to-day basis, that work is moving forward.  Important governance elements around the commercial side are reflected in this Bill.  The capitalisation is probably the critical aspect in terms of scaling up activities to the next level.</p> <p>  While I note the Deputy's comments on the time taken, in establishing the LDA we have been teasing through many issues, including the transfer of sites.  This has informed us in developing the general scheme.  The early engagements have allowed us to develop it.  We have been working through issues such as state aid, which is complex, public procurement and the general government balance.  These issues have taken some time to address, but they have been informed by practices in respect of the individual sites - it has been a kind of bottom-up approach - and engagement with local authorities and others.</p> <p>  I note the point about the affordable housing criteria.  The LDA is working as part of an overall initiative around affordable housing.</p> <p>  We are trying to achieve a balance between the governance of a commercial body that has the freedom to act in the way we want it to, by which I mean active assembly and being agile, in order to get the best for the State in terms of overall housing while having the kind of accountability that we require.  The Bill contains a number of components on the commercial side to ensure that there is Government oversight and all of the accounts are laid before the Oireachtas.  The Committee of Public Accounts component is not the norm for commercial matters, but this aspect has regard to the fact that valuable State moneys and lands are going to the LDA.</p> <p>  We have not specifically covered the lobbying legislation, but what is contained within the Regulation of Lobbying Act is a matter for the Oireachtas.  Commercial State bodies are not covered by it currently.  There is legislation that is held by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Lobbying is not covered within this Bill.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan referred to a circumstance in terms of freedom of information.  We are trying to achieve a balance between those functions that are purely commercial, where FOI would interfere in getting the best value for lands in the public's interest, and more day-to-day operations on the administrative side, which would be covered by FOI.</p> <p>  I believe I have covered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

Essentially, its land disposals must produce Part V housing for local authorities in the form of 10% social housing and extra affordable housing.  The local authority will remain the housing authority.  That would be the intention.  The LDA will not take over functions of the local authority in that regard.</p></speech>

The journey over the past year has been most informative concerning what we need to address.  There are many elements that, had we not had this experience, might not have been advised and reflected in the Bill.</p> <p>  As to the question of taking over from local authorities, it comes back to the avoidance of duplication.  We do not want to do something that is already being done well elsewhere.  A good illustration of that can be found at the Shanganagh site.  If the desire of the local authority was to develop entirely social homes on that site, we would probably say that there was no role for us, as the local authority would be well capable of doing that itself.  It is where we can add something that we have a role, for example, a financing structure around cost rental.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point about the Balbriggan site's master plan, which we have fed into over the past year, was well made.  It effectively sets planning policy in the area, but I was referring to much of the other work that was necessary to advance development, for example, examining infrastructural constraints and the solutions to them.</p><p>My point holds generally, but one can discuss where we fall on the development spectrum.  We have no view on the lobbying point because that is a matter for the Oireachtas.  We respect the authority of the Houses in that regard.  The Deputy referred to affordable purchase.  We have no philosophical objection to affordable purchase which is a product that will suit many locations and people.  As such, we will continue to engage and work with the Department and to work within the prevailing policy on affordable purchase.</p></speech>

In effect, the policy is to dispose of the land to deliver the affordability.  In looking at other models, does the agency see opportunities or is that a policy matter for the Department to address with regard to delivering affordable homes without having to dispose of the land?</p></speech>

Ultimately, one is talking about costs of delivery and trying to reduce those, while still delivering a quality product.

The first is whether the Information Commissioner has been consulted on an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act.  That would be useful and beneficial for obvious reasons.  The ability to request information under the Freedom of Information Act is vital for a healthy and functioning democracy.  Supplementary to that, I propose that we write to the Information Commissioner to seek the office's views on it.  Is the Land Development Agency subject to the ethics legislation re conflicts of interest and declaration of interests?  Deputy Darragh O'Brien referred earlier to the Regulation of Lobbying Act.</p> <p>  Under head 7 of the general scheme, how many subsidiary entities does the LDA envisage need to be established to support its functions following enactment?  How will that be structured?  Some of the functions in head 9 appear to carry an elevated risk profile, for instance in 9(2)(j), which refers to profit-sharing agreements with third parties and 9(2)(k), which refers to investment vehicles.  How will the risk be managed and mitigated and who will ultimately be responsible for same?  I always think brevity is a virtue when I am Chair and we have members queued up on the runway for a secondary round of questions, so I will leave it there and hand over to Ms Graham.</p></speech>

I will try to be brief.  In terms of freedom of information, the general scheme of the Bill has been worked on across the Government and the freedom of information legislation is looked after by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is looking after freedom of information policy, so I cannot say whether the Department has consulted with the Information Commissioner.  We have taken its views on board.</p> <p>  The LDA is covered by the ethics legislation.  You asked, Chairman, about the structures under head 7 and the elevated risks.  I will let Mr. Coleman respond on the specifics.  These are enabling provisions, should the agency wish to or need to establish subsidiary companies.  Sitting under the legislation would be the constitution, in that every DAC has its constitution, which is approved by the Minister.  It sets out a lot more detail but it would always be the case in line with that, and in line with the code that the establishment companies would require ministerial approval.  Many of those areas you raise, Chairman, as having elevated risks, would be dealt with in that element of the governance.  We are very careful across the board to ensure that those risks that might be associated with commercials are called out in their constitutions in terms of when they need ministerial approval, when they need board approval and other such elements, including what needs to be reflected in various reports that would come to the shareholding Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.803" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Coleman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#R00300"><p>I guess the group structure would include special purpose vehicles, which would be set up in the normal course and would be consolidated upwards into the top company to facilitate risk isolation on particular sites, or as Ms Graham said, if we entered into a joint venture, JV, that might sit in a subsidiary or if there was a different activity, just to facilitate the activities in the normal way.  That would be the purpose of the subsidiary entities.</p> <p>  In terms of the elevation of risk by joint ventures set out in paragraphs (j) and (k), aside from providing flexibility, given that we are setting the legislation for the long-term operations of the LDA, in many respects that could reduce risk.  Having a joint venture with someone could be a risk mitigation strategy, whereby one would get someone else to put in money to the scheme, as opposed to just the State or the LDA being the sole investor in a scheme.  In the case of a site assembly situation, where one might have a private sector operator beside a public sector site, it might be necessary to form some sort of JV there.  They are just a couple of practical examples that might arise.</p></speech>

It is structured as a commercial, independent entity with 60% of the units to be sale on the open market, because that is the only way one can get it off-balance sheet.  We just need to be clear about that.  We are talking about an investment over 20 years of between &euro;40 billion and &euro;60 billion to deliver that quantity of houses.  I accept a portion of those will be bought back by the State for social housing.  Given what we know about the failure of Irish Water to get off-balance sheet and the difficulties of approved housing bodies, unless this entity is sufficiently independent in its investment decisions, rent setting and price setting, and unless a majority of its output is for the open market, that will not be off-balance sheet.  This leads to the fundamental contradiction or tension in the development end of the legislation.  This goes back to a point Ms Graham made when she talked about the optimal use.  Optimal use depends on what it is that one is trying to do.  If one is trying to meet sociable and affordable housing need, then one would not use this vehicle because it requires one to reduce the amount of social and affordable housing that is deliverable on public land in order to get it off-balance sheet and be independent.  However, it is optimal use if one is talking about it from a commercial or off-balance sheet level.  My first question for Ms Graham is one I asked previously but it was overlooked.  Why is there no statutory obligation included in the legislation for the delivery of social and affordable homes?  That just seems to me to be such a glaring omission.  I am not even talking about a percentage or a target because those things can vary, but it seems absolutely incredible that in the first instance, that statutory obligation is not there.</p> <p>  What does Ms Graham mean by optimal use?  She used the phrase twice when I asked her about it.  What does the Department or Government mean by optimal use?  It is important that we understand what direction this is going in.  I asked a question about conflict between the commercial requirements of the designated activity companies and Government policy and nobody answered it, but it is a real issue.  This was a constant problem with NAMA, where NAMA in its aims and objectives had to contribute to the social and economic development of the State, as this does, but it had in section 10 a clear, commercial obligation to get the best return for the State.  When Deputies and local communities were trying to get NAMA to release assets for the social and economic development of the State, it could not, because there was a conflict.  For example, to go back to the memorandum, what the witnesses are essentially saying is that nobody will see the memorandum until after the legislation is passed.  Is there a memorandum with the LDA, as it is currently constituted?  Is the memorandum of the newly constituted DAC going to be the same?  A number of witnesses said there would be a shareholder's expectation letter from the Minister, but I presume once one sets up an independent designated activity company, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation says it must have due regard to Government legislation, if it wants to make a commercial decision, it will be able to make that commercial decision irrespective of what the Government policy is.  NAMA was continually accused of acting in ways that were not in the public interest.  I am interested in the views of the witnesses on that.</p> <p>  The development model is really crucial.  We will not get enough time to scrutinise the Bill today but we should come back to it.  In some senses, the cynic in me thinks the Government was very smart in letting the development at Shanganagh go ahead, because it allows the witnesses to talk about a development that is so atypical of what it is going to do that it takes the hard edge off the problems with the joint venture and other mechanisms.</p><p>The crucial point is that there are two ways of delivering affordable homes, which is to return to Deputy Casey's absolutely correct point about land.  There is the &Oacute; Cualann model, where a not-for-profit entity comes in and says that this is the economic cost of building the unit.  All other main costs of development are waived in one form or another, as they do not apply to &Oacute; Cualann.  The unit can be delivered and be sold for between &euro;175,000 to &euro;250,000.  The other one is the joint venture model.  I have a great amount of experience from Kilcarbery in my own constituency and I know the details of what is on the table with O'Devaney.  What happens in that model is a private developer is asked to come in and give us a market price for the delivery of the unit, not the economic cost for the building of the unit, but the market price.  On the basis of the figures we have from Dublin City Council the market price that Bartra is currently proposing for similar types of units to the ones we have in Poppintree is &euro;477,000.  There will be something of a discount, but Bartra will still get paid approximately &euro;380,000 for that unit.  There will then be a shed load of serviced sites funding that will come in, again subsidised to the developer although the State gets an equity stake in the property, to bring it down to &euro;310,000.  This is not affordable for the vast majority of people who are being targeted by the affordable purchase scheme.</p><p> There is a huge risk in allowing the joint venture model, or variants of it, to be the driving force of this, because not only would there be a reduction in respect of social and affordable housing to 40%, with 10% social housing on public land, but it will also run the risk of the actual price of the affordable units being too high for many of the categories of households that Government policy wants to target, or the rents will be too high for many of the households because of the cost recovery requirements.  I would like to hear more reassurance from the witnesses as to how this development model is going to deliver rental properties in Dublin for &euro;700 to &euro;900, which is a third of the take-home pay of the people the Government says it wants to assist, which is between &euro;38,000 and &euro;75,000 for social housing; or houses for sale below &euro;250,000, which is the price point one needs for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan which is being offered.</p><p>  The other thing we have not got our heads around at all yet is-----</p></speech>

If it has 100% social, it has value: A, if it is 20% social it has value: B.  What is hidden in the joint venture model is the ability of a developer, who is one's partner and is bringing the finance, to extract additional value from the land, by pricing it in to the units that are sold on the open market.  What members should be really clear about is that 60% of this land, if it is done like O'Devaney, will allow the developer to extract the full market value of the land in the sale price to the poor unfortunates who have to buy overpriced homes.  I would like to hear more from the Land Development Agency as to how we are going to be guaranteed that in the first instance the State, the taxpayer, but also the affordable and the private home purchaser is not going to be a source of very significant value extraction by developers.</p> <p>  The final point is a very good one made by Deputy Casey. </p></speech>

What we have been told today, and people listening need to understand, is that we will be handing over &euro;1.25 billion of taxpayers money to the LDA - I am not suggesting in any way that the LDA is not capable and competent in developing out those sites - where there will be virtually no scrutiny as to the approval of the design, tender, or the delivery of those units for the these projects, comparable to local authorities.  That beggars belief.  The argument will be that this approach allows one to do it more quickly.  How can we justify that? </p> <p>  If there was a third round I might come back in but I doubt we will get to it.</p></speech>

We are looking at land that is being used for non-housing or non-development purposes, that we might say could be more optimally used.  The LDA is proposing to present options to the owner of the land: the Government or the State, to allow it all make that decision, where it may not have the knowledge, work done or the due diligence that would enable it to make balanced decisions.  That is what we mean by optimal usage.  The ultimate judge of that will be the Government.  For instance, some of the sites that we have access to now, the Government has felt could be more optimally used.  These will now be used for housing-focused activities.</p> <p>  The development model at Shanganagh has been a one-off and a kind of Trojan horse in order to piggyback other developments onto it.  It is genuinely not the case that we are currently trying to speak with other local authorities about similar models.  Ultimately, we just want to get housing delivered on these sites and to help get that done where we can.  This has not been some sort of strategic mechanism.  Ultimately, we have had to convince the councillors, local and not central government, that what we are doing and proposing to do in Shanganagh is worthy.  It is a genuine effort to assist in getting activity happening on sites</p> <p>  How do we ensure that we have a product that is affordable?  The Deputy has cited the &Oacute; Cualann model.  We certainly respect what &Oacute; Cualann has done and achieved with the focus that this brought to bear on what can be done there.  Ultimately, where &Oacute; Cualann delivers on sites, it oversees the main contractor to try and deliver efficiently and affordably.  We, on the social and affordable aspect of things, with particular emphasis on the affordable, will have similar oversight, where in the case of Shanganagh being used as an example, we will directly procure a contractor to deliver in as cost-effective a manner while maintaining the quality of the product.  We should have some similarities in terms of the production methodology there.  That experience, allied to our general market knowledge - when we are seeking if enter a joint venture, JV, with certain parties to deliver on state sites - should enable us to look through us to what the costs of delivery of the affordable requirements on those sites is.</p> <p>  It is important to note that it is not just necessarily to allow a JV partner to come in and profit from the private sector element of the land.  They will obviously pay an amount or there will be a value attached to whatever the deal is with the JV partner.  It is not just about delivering on state lands with JV partners, we are also looking at situations to combine State land with private-sector land as well.  That is what might give rise to a JV to bring in other lands that might otherwise not become available, and that the State currently have a hold over.  JVs can be different things.  I hope that has given some sort of insight to our approach.</p></speech>

The objects of any such commercial body are as set out in its statute and it has to comply with that.  That is why it is very important that this committee has been looking at head 8, in particular.  </p> <p>  We talked earlier about the balancing through contributing to the economic and social development of the State, the competitiveness in the economy of the State, as well as the financial return.  The LDA sits within the policy of compact growth which is clearly a very important part of the national planning framework, NPF, an increasingly important part of the climate action plan, as well, and of sustainable communities. These are the components of policy that the LDA has to deliver on, not just in getting a financial return.  This is the way in which Mr. Coleman has described issues in looking on a site by site basis, the nature of the sustainable mix, and how that will play out.  </p> <p>  On accountability, I want to draw the distinction, because the governance of a commercial State body is critically important.</p><p>In terms of the funds that are going to local authorities through the Vote for the Department, the Accounting Officer is the Secretary General who appears before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The arrangements we have set in place, and I accept that there was the discourse at the previous committee a week or two ago around those elements, are in compliance with the public spending code.  In terms of the commercial State bodies, they also have to look at the public spending code.  Accountability is through the board and that will feed through to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I would not like there to be a concern about the stream of accountability, it is just coming in a different form.  Therefore, there will be investment gates and so on that Mr. Coleman and his team will have to go through to the board.  In addition, there is oversight at ministerial level in terms of large investments.  That will be set out.  The same would happen for any commercial semi-State companies, for example, the ESB, Gas Networks Ireland or Irish Water.  When capital commitments are being entered into, there is advice from NewERA and ministerial consent is required from the shareholder Ministers.  That is part of the governance framework.  That element of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Land Development Agency is very important.</p><p> On the point around the additional dividend that Government has sought in terms of affordable housing, that is something that Government has decided across the public land that it holds.  That is why it is not being reflected in LDA legislation.  It applies to any public body disposing of land.  It is within the housing policy area and it has not been something that we have reflected in housing legislation.  The mandate of the LDA over time is clearly in terms of the totality of housing supply and looking at increasing the overall supply of housing, as part of the totality of measures the Government is taking to improve overall supply, affordable housing supply and social housing supply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.820" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019100200002#T00200"><p>This is probably the single most important legislation we are going to pass this term.  It needs scrutiny.  I do not think we are going to run out of time today but I am sure we will be back again another time.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned something I would like to return to regarding the off-balance sheet proposal.  I have a certain concern around that.  To achieve off-balance sheet status, from what I am hearing, we would need to have 60% private or commercial activity on the State side.  That means out of the 150,000 houses proposed over the 20 years, only 60,000 will be social and affordable.  The rest will be private.  If this Land Development Agency ends up on-balance sheet, does it collapse?  Has it failed in its purpose or can it deliver if it is on-balance sheet?  We are trying to look at an agency that is going to be set up and that realistically has to be determined to be off-balance sheet for it to succeed.  We cannot answer that question today.  I do not know at what stage we will be able to answer it.  It is a concern.</p> <p>  During the previous debates on this issue, it was the total debt of the approved housing bodies that was put on-balance sheet, that is, historical debt, private debt and public debt.  Every single piece of debt went on-balance sheet because of that decision.  If the same happens to the Land Development Agency, it will not be able to deliver on its targets.  A key fundamental of this is the off-balance sheet model.  I am just trying to get to the nub of it.  If we fail in this, the Land Development Agency will have failed and will not be able to serve its function.  There are other things but I think we will just evolve them over time.  On that single point alone, that if the Land Development Agency turns out to be on-balance sheet it will not be able to fulfil the function it has been set, what is Ms Graham's view?</p></speech>

They can change over time.  There are commercial bodies that are on-balance sheet that were off-balance sheet previously.  They are not set in stone.  If we look across our portfolio of commercial State bodies, parts of some are currently on-balance sheet because of their investment profile while other parts of the same company are off-balance sheet.  These are accounting issues that are becoming increasingly complex.  What we are trying to focus on is what it is that we want the LDA to do.</p></speech>

We focus on getting the best corporate form that will facilitate that.  I will use the phrase "optimal usage"; that we make the best use of it.  We are focused on those components knowing that elsewhere there are decisions to be made by others around the Government accounting components.  We have tried to look at all of the trends in that regard, issues around state aid, what we have learned from the portfolio of lands we have and delivery today, to come up with a range of objects that we feel will succeed.  That is what we will be proposing that the Oireachtas would pass, ultimately, in a Bill to establish this Land Development Agency.  At some point, those accounting decisions will be made and obviously Governments decide what the implications of those accounting decisions are in a wider budgetary context.  I am not sure whether that fully answers the question but I appreciate that there is an unknown out there.</p></speech>

Ms Graham's point that 0% of those lands is seeing any housing in the absence of this sort of an intervention was well made.  Increasing the supply of private housing is not necessarily a bad thing.  There is a private housing supply issue in the market, as members know, particularly in respect of rental, which is becoming more difficult in all forms.  It is not a bad thing.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's points around the balance sheet treatment, Ms Graham referred to the question of what we want the LDA to do, and the Deputy's response was that it should build houses.  Absolutely.  However, we want it to do many other things.  We want it ultimately to open up and release land for the construction of housing as well, which is very important.  When we look at the capital intensity of what we are going to do, direct construction is the area that sucks up the most capital.  However, another very important aspect of the LDA is something that is not quite as capital intensive, namely, agitating where there is State land that could be used for better purposes to present cases to Government to ensure that it happens and is scrutinised appropriately, and also to facilitate the unlocking of land elsewhere that might adjoin public sector land, particularly but not exclusively.  It is not just the direct building of houses that the LDA is about; it is about more than that.</p></speech>

Ultimately, that is a consideration for the Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT.  The point is that one would like the LDA to be quite active during a downturn, when the private market might not be as active as otherwise.  Post 2009, the private market was effectively dormant.  An organisation such as the LDA which can operate independently, could have stepped into the market, which would have been of benefit.  It is important for our long-term objectives but it is not exclusive-----</p></speech>

We are trying to tease the issues through.  It goes back to my original point that it would have been preferable for the legislation to have been brought forward alongside the announcement of the agency, which is seen by many as a silver bullet.  All present know there is no silver bullet solution to the housing crisis.  While I acknowledge the point that none of the lands has been developed, that is not to say they would not have been developed otherwise.  I wish to put on record Fianna F&aacute;il's support for a model such as this.  However, if we pass this legislation and the LDA fails, we, as Oireachtas Members, will be judged on the intricacies of its operation.  That will not necessarily be the case for the witnesses.  It is for the Oireachtas to pass legislation and, as such, we must ensure it is robust.  That is the reason for our questions.</p> <p>  I previously asked Ms Graham to outline the timeframe for passage of the Bill as accurately as possible because we are in a political cycle.  I did not make that point to feed into any uncertainty but the fact is that we are on the cusp of an election in the coming months.  What is the timeframe to which the Minister is operating for the passage of the legislation, if it is supported?  I am not assuming it will be supported.  </p> <p>  As I have made clear to the Minister, my strong request as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on housing is that significant Government amendments to the Bill are not tabled on Committee Stage.   That happened with the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act when new sections of the Bill were submitted as amendments.  If we are to get the Bill published, I would rather see it, warts and all.  I urge just caution against such major amendments and ask Ms Graham to bring a message to the Minister that we do not want large additions or new sections to be introduced on Committee or Report Stage.  The Chair is new to the committee, so he may not be aware that has happened with significant legislation.  The Bill could work if it is done properly.  I disagree with some aspects of it, particularly those in respect of delivering affordability.  We will go through that at a later stage.  The timeframe is important.  </p> <p>  I have a technical query on head 30 regarding interaction with the Committee of Public Accounts and the person nominated from the LDA to appear before it.  Subsection (3), referred to in subhead 2, states that the nominated person appears as a person accountable to the committee, not as an Accounting Officer.  What distinction is being made between the individual accounting to the committee and an Accounting Officer?  Is the intention that the CEO of the LDA will not be its Accounting Officer?  Will the Minister be the Accounting Officer?  I ask Ms Graham to clarify that issue.</p> <p>  We will revisit these issues in the next session, particularly the issue of affordable purchase.  I keep raising it because I am concerned that although affordable rental is part of a model with which I agree, people keep talking about a European model of housing delivery.  We are behind the European average in terms of home ownership.  Between 21% and 22% of people here rent private accommodation.  There seems to be a policy move towards encouraging people to rent rather than buy, which is of concern regardless of whether it is renting in the public or private sector.  I would like to tease out further the balance between purchase and rental.  People should be able to have an honest and realistic aspiration to own a house and they should be supported in that regard.  If they do not have the resources to do so, that is when the State and public housing should come into play.  I am concerned at seeing another lurch towards a predominance of rental and less emphasis on purchase and home ownership.  </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions in today's engagement, which has been useful.  I have learned from it and will have far more questions on the next occasion.  The timeframe for passage of the Bill is significant.</p></speech>

The big sticking point for me is ownership.  It seems like a massive giveaway of public assets for 15,000 social houses.  I acknowledge there will be 45,000 affordable houses, but we have not defined what that constitutes.  I have big questions in terms of a cost-benefit analysis and cost rental.  If 60% of the cost rentals could be held by Ires REIT or a similar organisation, how could the State control the affordability of the rent and guarantee security of tenure?  Private property is given great emphasis in Articles 40 and 43 of the Constitution.  Unless we crack the ownership question, I would have a huge concern about what is being proposed.  That is a matter for the committee to tease out.</p> <p>  There are big questions about governance.  There should be a significant strengthening of the measures proposed in that regard, particularly in terms of the designated activities company and potential special purpose vehicles and public private partnerships.  Given the collapse of companies such as Carillion, protections need to be put in place.  I wish to see far more detail as well as the constitution of the LDA.  I would like to hear the views of organisations collaborating with the LDA, such as local authorities and the Housing Agency.  It would be important for the committee to hear those views on what is proposed and if the LDA adds as much value and is the picture is as rosy as the witnesses present.</p> <p> What is NewERA?</p><p>The Kenny report must be uppermost in our minds when dealing with these issues.  It is a sterling piece of work, to which we have not paid proper attention.  We must come back to an understanding that we are talking about homes, not products.  The question then is whether these proposals represent the best way to generate those homes.  The Raise the Roof campaign which is holding a protest in Dublin tomorrow represents the people in this country who do not have homes or who do not have secure homes.  Looking after them must be the driving force in this discussion.  If the legislation gets things right in that regard, that is wonderful.  However, there are concerns and questions that must be addressed.</p></speech>

The provision of homes is the critical and central objective of these proposals.  As I said, it is a matter of having the right accommodation in place at the right time and at the right price in terms of affordability.  There are several components to what we are trying to achieve and each them comprises different elements.  The lands we are transferring from public ownership to the Land Development Agency will remain in public ownership until the agency does something with them.  They will either be used for social housing and go into local authority or approved housing body stock, or they will be used to provide affordable housing for purchase or rent and homes for private sale to private homeowners.  Any funds accrued will come back and be regenerated via the provision of additional homes.  That is the essence of the model.</p></speech>

A key characteristic of the LDA is that it is a public company that is dealing in the public good, namely, to maximise what we can get out of these sites in the provision of homes and other types of urban development.</p> <p>  I note the points about governance.  If it is useful, we might pull together some information on that aspect for the committee.  There are various complexities involved in it.  The genesis of much of what is set out in the Bill is in the Kenny report, to which Senator Kelleher alluded, in terms of active land management and so on.</p> <p>  NewERA is part of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, family, having been established by statute by way of the Act under which the NTMA was set up.  It is the State's shareholder executive, its role being to advise Ministers on a range of commercial bodies and represent the State's interests as shareholder in those bodies.  Its purpose relates precisely to what the Senator is saying about the need for commercial mandates and public policy to be appropriately aligned.  NewERA deals with the ESB, Irish Water, Gas Networks Ireland and the Dublin Airport Authority, among other bodies.  It will also deal with the LDA.</p></speech>

The local authority members are asking how they can know that there will be permanent affordability.  It is important to emphasise that we all want the same thing.  As we told them, we are equally anxious to ensure the homes we provide are permanently affordable.  Our interests are aligned; we are as one on this issue and will come up with appropriate structures to ensure that objective is achieved.</p> <p>  The Senator's point about dealings with third parties and the collapse of some contracting firms is apt.  That is not a situation in which we want to find ourselves.  Our intention is to devise our own internal processes in order that we can mitigate that risk in so far as is possible.</p></speech>

I share colleagues' concerns about the huge percentage of homes that will go to private provision.  If we are talking about using public land for housing, it does not stack up if we are taking 100% of it and giving 60% away to private ownership.  I am concerned about that type of developer-led housing.</p> <p>  These legislative proposals give the Land Development Agency considerable power by way of its mandate to undertake national large-scale procurement of housing.  In his opening statement Mr. Coleman referred to building a new organisation.  What categories of expertise have been retained directly for this purpose?  Mr. Coleman might not be able to provide the information today, but I would like to know the numbers of architects, quantity surveyors, project managers and procurement professionals who will be directly employed by the LDA to carry out this enormous undertaking of acquiring, developing and maintaining the lands over time.</p> <p>  I presume the LDA will develop a policy to govern the specifics of how the cost rental model will work and how management systems for those developments will operate.  Will that policy be available for review by the Oireachtas before the Bill completes its passage through the Houses?  It is important that we see it before the legislation is enacted.</p> <p>  The LDA is beginning its work during a declared national climate emergency.  What steps will it take to ensure its developments promote and employ the most innovative and low carbon construction methods and have the lowest carbon footprint and life-cycle running costs possible?  This is particularly important, given the tenants' exposure to maintenance costs over time.  Does the agency have a climate action policy that will inform its work?</p> <p>  Does the Bill, as proposed, allow the Minister to sell his or her shareholding in the agency?  That is an obvious concern, given the large amounts of public land the LDA is seeking to assemble.  If there is such a provision, why is it necessary to include that power in the Bill?</p> <p>  People in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown have concerns about the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum.  What level of public consultation is planned on that development and when will it take place?  The complete dominance of build-to-rent housing in the area is locking people out of affordability to purchase homes in the places in which they were born and raised.</p></speech>

That is how it should be because it is public land.  However, I do not see what the Land Development Agency adds to this equation.  I cannot help but wonder whether the involvement of the agency is just another way of slowing down a protracted process.  That is not the fault of the LDA, but it is difficult not to see it that way for the people in the locality who are pulling their hair out waiting for things to progress.  The site has been earmarked for public housing since it was transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the local authority seven or eight years ago.  We could be forgiven for thinking that bringing the LDA in adds another layer of complexity and difficulty which would be avoided if the local authority just got on with building public and affordable housing.</p> <p>  I have made the point before to the delegates that, in principle, the idea of a land development agency is not a bad one.  On one level, it could be seen as the coming together of the ideas and recommendations set out in the Kenny report, but I wonder whether that is what the LDA actually will be.  In particular, I do not see what specific role it will have in respect of land that is already in public hands.  It clearly has a role to play in getting hold of land that is private and zoning it to ensure we will have sufficient land to meet our public and affordable housing needs.</p><p>In general, I do not see what role the LDA can have in respect of land already in public ownership that is not a stepping stone towards privatisation in some shape or form.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire site is one of the early ones, although it is approximately eight years late.  It seems to be exceptional, insofar as we are talking exclusively about public and affordable housing.  In the case of most of the other sites the LDA will develop, is it not the case that it will be privatising substantial amounts of public land?  That will be the longer term evolution of the LDA which will depend on private finance for the most part and we know what private finance does.  This activity is being taken out of the hands of the State.  The LDA has been set up by the State to achieve a certain role.  It is all about getting it off balance sheet.  As the LDA becomes a prisoner of private finance, private finance will end up dictating the reality of what happens on these sites and the balance will shift from all public and affordable towards a lot of private housing.  In such circumstances, we are told that it is not possible to say how much the affordable houses will cost because it will depend on the finance that can be obtained and how long for which it can be strung out.  That is what I mean when I say the LDA will become a prisoner of the lenders, private finance or the European Central Bank, with all of the conditionality that goes with it.  It seems that this is not what we need if we are to deliver a great deal of genuinely affordable public and affordable housing on scale and on public land.  I ask the delegates to respond to those questions.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the only movement that is entailed is around the public body.  While there are two sections, the section that follows needs to be referenced also.

It is fair to say it will be determined by housing legislation.  While there are pathfinder projects as part of the ongoing work on the cost rental model, there is also a working group working on it.  I understand a couple of months of work will be required.  It will probably be beyond the timeline for the Bill.</p></speech>

Clearly, we are involved in shaping that policy also.  Some of the points made by the Deputy, for example, about climate change and the need for a low carbon footprint, resonate with us.  Our task, as a body, is to implement the national planning framework which involves compact development.  In the developments for which we are responsible we have a bias towards a lack of car use because it contributes to a low carbon footprint.  The Shanganagh scheme, which is the first one on which we are working, is being designed to passive standards.  We are on the same page on that aspect of things.</p></speech>

When we have formed ideas and come up with potential solutions to some of the questions that have arisen about the Dundrum site, we will be very keen to open up it to public consultation.  There are assurances in that respect.</p> <p>  I would like to respond to some of the issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He suggested the existence of the LDA added another layer to this process.  As we said in our discussions with some of the other members, we do not want to duplicate the work of other agencies.  We see the LDA as a tool for the local authorities to deploy in circumstances in which we can add value.  Where we cannot add value, we will not get involved.  If we can provide potential financing solutions on the affordable delivery side of things, we will certainly try to become involved.  I argue that we will be additive.  Some members mentioned that it would be useful to get the evidence of some local authorities about our engagement with them and where they see us fitting in.  There is scope for a national body to provide solutions in that respect.  It may help to ensure duplication is avoided across local authorities.  It may also help to meet the need for consistency, learnings and scale.  The establishment of IDA Ireland, as opposed to a number of regional agencies, is an example of a national approach being taken.  It is an example from the past to which we can look.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the role of the LDA in the use of public land.  He suggested we might not have an additive role in dealing with the challenges associated with public land.  I argue that there is a very strong need for someone to challenge the way we use public land.  The LDA has been set up because there is a view that a specific agency is required to make the case to the Government and landowners for alternative uses of land, where appropriate.</p> <p>  There is another way to look at the Deputy's point about the privatisation of public land.  The LDA intends to be active in the land market, for example, by acquiring land from outside the public sector.  This means that at certain times in the cycle, it could be the other way around.  In other words, if land currently in private ownership is acquired by the LDA, it will end up in public ownership.  There is a balance.  It is not all one-way traffic.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the focus on private finance.  Obviously, we have been earmarked for significant public finance from public sources.  A &euro;1.25 billion capitalisation figure is proposed.  If we bring in private finance, in terms of debt finance, it will be used as a tool to try to make what we are doing more affordable.  If we can bring in cheap finance from the European Investment Bank, we will be able to pass on any saving to the occupiers of homes.  That is one aspect of our approach.  The other aspect involves considering how we finance and structure ourselves.  If we want to achieve true scale, the capitalisation for we have been earmarked will have to be recycled and stretched many times.  If we deliver everything directly and fund it entirely ourselves, the &euro;1.25 billion will probably be eaten up by the initial portfolio of eight or nine sites.  If we deliver seven or eight sites before running out of money, we will be at risk of being a one-trick pony.  It is important to look at solutions that involve all financing sources in a way that will contribute towards our goals, one of which is affordability.</p></speech>

We are joined by Mr. Michael Gubbins, chief superintendent, special crime operations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Mr. Pat Ryan, detective superintendent in the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau.  From the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, Childline, we are joined by Mr. John Church, its chief executive.  We are also joined by Professor Joe Carthy, director of the UCD centre for cybersecurity and cybercrime investigation, and Ms Caroline Counihan BL, the legal director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  You are all very welcome, as are your colleagues who are guests in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>I will shortly invite you to make your opening statements and I propose to do so in the order in which I have just introduced you, if that suits.  There is no hierarchy.  It is just the order in which I introduced you.  I first must draw your attention to the issue of privilege.</p><p> Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I caution our panel and visitors to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  Will the chief superintendent be leading off?</p></speech>

The report entitled The Future of Policing in Ireland provides a roadmap for an improved policing service in Ireland.  This report identified that cybercrime and Internet-enabled crimes are proliferating fast and that Ireland is not alone in struggling to deal with the threat and that tackling cybercrime must be regarded as a core function of policing.  A central tenet of the report on the future of policing in Ireland is that policing is not something the police do alone.  Likewise, the solution to tackling online harassment, harmful communications and related offences will require the involvement of multiple stakeholders across various Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and society in general, including parents, schools and employers.</p> <p>  The recent roll-out of the new operating model will enhance the investigation of crime through the delivery of a greater range of specialised services in local areas, such as the investigation of sexual crime, domestic violence, cybercrime, and economic crime.  Each division will be provided with a detective superintendent who, along with trained investigators in specialist areas, will be responsible for local crime investigation.  Complex or highly technical crimes will generally be dealt with at national level.  This initiative will see the establishment of regional cybercrime hubs and trained first responders, who will support the regional units and provide for a tiered level of capability nationally, with the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, GNCCB, as the top tier of support and capability.</p> <p>  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau was established in September 2016, providing an enhanced structure within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purpose of tackling cybercrime.  The bureau has a national remit with regard to the phenomenon of cybercrime, and in particular, the investigation of online criminality.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau is tasked with undertaking the forensic examination of computer media in all incidents reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau is currently supported by two regional pilot units, one based in New Ross Garda station, County Wexford, and the other in Ballincollig, County Cork.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, in conjunction with the Garda College, has developed a training module relating to the investigation of cybercrime for delivery to all students attending the college.  It is planned that other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be trained in cybercrime awareness and cybercrime investigation through our continuous professional development network.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will further its long-standing relationship with the centre for cybersecurity and cybercrime investigation in University College Dublin through the GNCCB and alumni who have undertaken courses of study at the university in the cyberdomain.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also develop more educational partnerships with third level institutions and international institutions with expertise in cybersecurity in order to ensure cutting-edge support is available throughout the organisation.  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, was established in 2015 and is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and that such investigations are handled in an appropriate manner.  In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.</p> <p>  Increasingly, children are engaging in the sharing of self-taken imagery where they send nude or sexually explicit or both personal photographs of one another to other members of a chat group, utilising platforms such as WhatsApp or Instagram, or over social media such as Facebook or Snapchat.  While this scenario has given rise to a form of bullying, there is an added danger when images are circulated outside the confines of friends or otherwise become available to third parties, who may then use them as a trap to engage with a child or set up fake profiles, using the images as bait.  In 2015, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established 28 victim service offices across the country which are tasked with communicating with victims of crime and prioritising their needs.  Protective service units, which will operate within each Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division, will assist in ensuring that relevant child protection, domestic and sexual violence incidents are thoroughly investigated and victims fully supported.</p> <p>  Any individual, adult or child, business or organisation, using a connected device is vulnerable to cybercrime.  Just as with offline crime, simple steps can often be effective in reducing these vulnerabilities.  Working in partnership with public and private sector stakeholders, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will use opportunities such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s communication channels, "Crimecall", public awareness campaigns and industry liaison to ensure people are educated on protecting themselves from cybercrime.  The investigation of all the relevant incidents and the examination of associated computer media is dependent on the disclosure of a criminal offence.  In cases involving the online safety of our young people, the primary offences are cyberbullying and sexual exploitation.  In this regard, the relevant legislative provisions are contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.</p> <p>  The Garda schools programme is currently being updated.  The Garda is working in partnership with Webwise to create modules within the Garda schools programme to be delivered to all primary and second level schools nationally, to include subjects such as cyberbullying, online harassment, consent and image sharing.  The "Be in Ctrl" programme was launched in 2018.  It is delivered to junior cycle second level students nationally.  It gives students the opportunity to recognise and understand online sexual coercion and extortion and will give them the information on how to deal with and report these incidents.  Three new modules are currently being created by Webwise and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are expected to be rolled out in 2020.  These would deal with cyberbullying and online harassment in primary school, the impact of cyberbullying and online harassment and the harm and legal consequences that image sharing has.  It encourages students on how to act responsibly when they encounter intimate content.  This is for both the junior and the senior cycle.</p> <p>  A new information and education resource called "Lockers" has been designed, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to assist schools in coping with and preventing the sharing of explicit self-generated images of minors.  Intended for use within the junior cycle social, personal and health education curriculum, "Lockers" is supported by a newly developed animation and six lesson plans, and includes an information section for school leaders.  This 25-page section informs principals on the context for sexting among young people, the laws that can come into effect when underage sexting occurs and the implications for school policy.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop its capacity and capability to tackle online harassment, harmful communications and related offences, and in this regard will interact in an appropriate manner with all relevant stakeholders. </p></speech>

The ISPCC is delighted to be in a position to support this important draft legislation and thank Deputy Howlin for introducing it and the members for considering it in committee.  As the national child protection charity, I wish to present to members the ISPCC&rsquo;s perspective on how this Bill may pertain to children.</p> <p>  Research conducted for the ISPCC in 2018 found that almost half of children aged six to 18 years old were always online.  The ISPCC&rsquo;s Childline service answers over 1,000 contacts every day from children.  Many tell us about their experiences online.  For example, a 16 year old girl told Childline she had sent images to a former boyfriend, who then shared them with others without her permission.  With these images now circulating widely, this girl told Childline she could not face going back to school and was contemplating suicide.</p> <p>  Online safety is an integral part of the ISPCC&rsquo;s policy work.  We welcome the commitment by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to establish an office of digital safety commissioner, an office we see as imperative for championing children&rsquo;s online safety.</p><p>The ISPCC continues to call for the introduction of a long-term national strategy for online safety.  The ISPCC is acutely aware of the long-term and devastating consequences bullying and cyberbullying can have on children.  As cyberbullying can take place through any digital means of communication, it is essential that modern platforms are included in how this Bill defines "communications".  Content which is shared online often has the potential to reach very large audiences, very quickly.  Young people told the Law Reform Commission in 2016 that they felt practices such as identity theft, online harassment and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images should be made illegal.  Through the ISPCC's work with children and young people, however, we are acutely aware of the need for an age-appropriate response to the proposed offences as outlined in this Bill.  By their nature, children and young people do not have the maturity level of adults: they may exhibit a greater tendency to be impulsive and they may not fully comprehend the consequences their actions online may have.  In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ISPCC would not advocate that children and young people under the age of 18 be criminalised for their behaviour.  Instead, it is essential they are educated and empowered to act differently in future.  Entry into the Garda youth diversion programme or similar may provide a more appropriate response.  Relative and relatable online safety education, delivered via the curriculum on a regular basis at both primary and post-primary level, is a key component in preventing these activities occurring in the first instance.</p><p> While we appreciate we are here today to explore proposed criminal justice responses to online safety, we need to take this opportunity to reiterate our call for industry regulation as a fundamental response too.  At present, industry regulation falls short of adequately protecting children online.  The ISPCC cannot support an approach of self-regulation of industry over legal regulation.  As the online world does not know borders in the same way as they pertain to the physical world, the ISPCC believes it is important to monitor international developments.  The Criminal Justice and Courts Act and the Voyeurism (Offences) Act, as recently introduced in the UK, make the practices referred to as revenge porn and upskirting criminal offences.  At an ISPCC event held in December 2018, the eSafety Commissioner of Australia outlined how the office has successfully assisted more than 1,000 young Australians to remove cyberbullying material.  The office is equipped with regulatory powers to penalise and fine social media companies should they fail to remove such content.  Children have a right to be protected and this protection extends to being online.  Legislation and regulation which strives to make the online world a safer place for children must be duly considered, respecting the particular rights and needs of child victims and child perpetrators.  We reiterate our point that such legislation, however, should not criminalise children and young people.  The ISPCC views the education and empowerment of children to become civic online citizens as the ultimate goal for which to strive.</p></speech>

It does not in any way take away from what Mr. Church has just put on the record.  We are not in the process of addressing any specific legislation.  I know that Deputy Howlin has tabled legislation, but this has been an identified substantive issue for address by this committee going back some time.  It emerged from our work programme for substantive address in the widest possible way.  There is no problem in referencing specific legislation that is before the Houses but that is not the purpose of our address, which is much wider.  Speakers are entitled to address any legislation they think pertinent to the process.  I invite Professor Carthy to make his presentation.</p></speech>

In the interests of time, I will keep my submission brief.  I will concentrate on two issues I believe are important in this area.  The first is regulation.  There is no history to show that a lack of regulation or self-regulation in any industry has worked.  We are relying on self-regulation very often in the cyberworld, which is a grave error.  Automobile legislation offers a very good model for the cyberworld.  Every car in the country is required to have a number plate, which can be used to identify the owner.  A similar system in the cyberworld, where users could be identified would greatly diminish instances of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, hate speech and so on.  If we could legislate in this key area it would make a significant difference.  I accept the details would have to be worked out very carefully.  First, social media platforms and online providers would have to register their users and the users would provide appropriate evidence of identity.  In the case of minors, parents or guardians would be responsible.  Second, users or parents who can show that they have been bullied, harassed or abused on a social media platform, should be legally entitled to find out the identity of the user carrying out the inappropriate behaviour.  That one simple measure would make a significant difference in this area.  I accept there is an international dimension but other countries would look to Ireland to set a lead and Ireland could pursue it at an EU level.</p> <p>  Computer users have a responsibility as well.  Again, the automobile industry offers an example in that we must have a national car test, NCT, on our cars.  We cannot put an unsafe car on the road.  If we have a computer system there is an obligation on us to have appropriate anti-virus software installed in order that our computers cannot be hacked, our information cannot be stolen or, equally important, that our computers cannot be infected by malware, which allows them to partake in attacks on computers on the Internet, unbeknownst to us.  That is a widespread problem.  Thousands of Irish computers are currently infected by such software.  The regulation could be such that if one is going on the Internet, one must ensure one has appropriate anti-virus software on one's computer.</p> <p>  In terms of keeping children safe, the concept of a digital safety commissioner is valuable but we must make sure the office has the correct mandate and the resources to carry out the tasks assigned to it.  We also need public awareness campaigns.  Again, to return to the automobile situation, the Road Safety Authority has a fantastic public awareness campaign and a similar campaign is required in terms of cyberawareness for parents and children.  Digital literacy education must be improved at primary level so that all children and teachers are aware of the risk and dangers of using computers online.</p></speech>

The RCNI is grateful to have this opportunity to share its views on online harassment, harmful communications and related offences with the committee.  Our clients of all ages are now reporting to us more and more forms of online sexual harassment and harmful communications of an intimate nature.  Effective regulation, via the criminal justice system and otherwise, generally has not kept pace with developments in online technologies and the almost universal use of Internet-accessible devices.  Many forms of online sexual harassment and harmful communications are covered by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and related legislation on child pornography but there are wide gaps in the criminal law as far as adult victims are concerned.  To us, these forms of sexual harassment are a form of sexual violence, and should be regarded as seriously as contact sexual offences.  Their impacts on their victims are just as grave and potentially far reaching.  Accordingly, we think it is appropriate to describe this behaviour as image-based sexual abuse.  It is difficult to compile an exhaustive list of all the forms which this might take.  They include sextortion, deep-faking, flashing, what is commonly but inaccurately referred to as revenge porn, and perhaps most disturbingly, the recording and distribution of videos of acts of sexual assault and rape.  They need to be addressed urgently to deter and where necessary, punish, perpetrators of grave harm through online technologies.</p> <p>  There have been some very encouraging positive developments in recent years, not least the Bill introduced by Deputy Howlin, which is based mainly on the relevant provisions in the draft Bill in the Law Reform Commission's Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety.  The RCNI broadly welcomes this Bill and would like to see it progress as quickly as possible.  In particular, we welcome the inclusion of section 4, concerning the distribution of intimate images without consent, which will address that form of image-based sexual abuse consisting of the one-off sending of intimate images online to third parties.  The current law on harassment covers only persistent communications made directly to the victim.</p><p>To give another positive example, the Law Reform Commission also put forward the idea of a digital safety commissioner&rsquo;s office, which would be responsible for regulating online service providers&rsquo; procedures and practices, especially in respect of take-down of harmful material.  This has also found expression in proposed legislation, such as the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, a Private Members' Bill put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  <br/><br/>We refer briefly to some of the principal recommendations RCNI makes in its full submission.  I hope it is in order to state that the recommendations refer to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, which is a Private Members' Bill.  It is recommended to consider separating the current proposed section 4 of the Bill into three distinct offences: generation of intimate images without consent, alteration of images to make them appear to be intimate images without consent, and their storage, distribution, publication, sale, etc, also without consent; to ensure that the wording of any offence or definition used in any offence covers originally innocent images of the victim that have been altered to appear to include intimate images of third parties, in order that it cannot be argued by the defence that the genitalia, anal region, etc., of the victim are not in fact depicted in the intimate image in question; to include, as has been done in Scotland, separate voyeurism related offences, to cover viewing victims without consent in intimate settings, installing equipment to record intimate images of them, recording such images, and storing, distributing, publishing or selling them, in each case without consent; to create a new offence of producing and distributing audiovisual images of acts of sexual violence without consent and attach significant penalties to it, an activity that should be an offence whether it takes place online or offline; to consider criminalising the intentional or reckless impersonation of others, real or fictional, in online interactions, which can be extremely harmful in a sexual context; to include a review clause and give responsibility for carrying out the review to the digital safety commissioner or a similar official, pending the creation of a new digital safety commissioner&rsquo;s office or a similar body, responsibility for which should be given to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; and to include provision to hear cases related to online harassment, harmful communications and related offences, <i>in camera</i>, ideally irrespective of whether their content amounts to image based sexual abuse. <br/><br/>I thank members for their patience.  RCNI thanks the committee most sincerely for taking the time, through the submission process and hearings, to consider these most important issues for all survivors of this form of sexual violence and all those at risk of it.</p></speech>

To answer her question, it is wholly in order to refer to any proposed legislation.  It just so happens the committee had signalled the matter a long time ago but we finally had the opportunity to discuss it.  Regrettably, we had to defer it a couple of times but we are now sitting down to address it.</p></speech>

I have a general, observation-style question.  I always defensively preface the following point by insisting I am not in favour of censorship, restriction or anything like that but I seek our guests' views on a matter.  Further guests will come before the committee and I would also like to hear their views.  Legislation reflects the actions of people, and whether they do something that could be deemed an offence or whether an offence needs to be created.  The core problem is that some platforms are completely unregulated.  There is an insane, wild west scenario.  It is impossible to imagine television, radio or newspapers uniformly stating that even though they broadcast, transmit or publish something, they have no responsibility for it.  For some reason, however, long after the birth of the Internet and such platforms, we continue to tolerate, not just in our country but internationally, the notion that large, multi-billion euro, profitable corporations can continue in this fashion.  That is the heart of what we have to grasp.</p> <p>  The reason I commented on censorship is that when I make the next point, people might say, "My God."  I am not in any way a fan of what the Chinese Government or other totalitarian regimes do in restricting the ability of people to post on or access the Internet.  Given that large corporations continue to interact in such jurisdictions, however, there must be a way, whether through delay, content monitoring or responsibility, that we can bring some of that to the wild west that currently operates in the western world.  One measure we should move towards is the notion that victims would have the right to sue platforms.  If there were a few substantial settlements, the providers would move quickly.  What are our guests' views on that?  Do they believe litigation and so on will have to be at the heart of reform in how we will deal with the matter in the next ten, 15 or 20 years?</p></speech>

I know she is ready to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.907" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100200002#G00700"><p>I will do my best.  To address the Deputy's final point, I fully agree victims should have the right to sue platforms and that a few hefty settlements would soften the cough of those online platforms that have not been as careful in exercising the due diligence we would expect of them to protect people from serious harm.  Nevertheless, I must qualify that by stating it is not a bad thing in itself because it still puts too great an onus on the victim.  What will happen is that people will say they cannot face such proceedings, that they do not care about the money, and that all they want is for the content to be taken down and reversed as far as possible.  They will say they want the process to happen in peace and privacy, quickly and cheaply.  The process has to work for victims.</p> <p>  In our various submissions to the committee, we have argued strongly that the role of the digital safety commissioner should include oversight of companies to ensure they keep up to certain standards.  The commissioner should oversee any take-down procedure and there should be a right of appeal to the commissioner if there is any failure in such a procedure.  Ultimately, the process should be backed by civil sanctions.  I would not rule out the idea, as a last resort, of making directors of rogue Internet service providers criminally liable for indefensible failure to take down harmful material where it has been notified to them.  The existence of a criminal offence would make them sit up.</p></speech>

It is ridiculous that any software provider in the world can produce a new application, launch it on the Internet and allow people to use it without any measure of its safety or of how it protects the data of the people involved.  Software designers are allowed to make their software do whatever they want with impunity.  We do not allow such practice in the aviation or automobile industry.  Definite controls are needed in that regard.  The Deputy is correct that billion-dollar companies make billions of dollars every year.  There is a cost of doing business and the cost for the automobile industry is that its cars must be safe, adhere to pollution standards and so on.</p><p>I would argue that there is a cost of doing business in this space, namely, people should regulate the content and ensure it is legal in whatever way that is defined by countries.  There is no technological reason for not doing so.  I would argue that it is a legislative matter.  The automobile industry offers an excellent example.  Although this situation is not something that we can fix quickly, we have been dealing with automobile legislation for 100 years and every year we tweak it a little.  We need to do the same in this context, but we need to start somewhere.  We probably will not get the legislation right initially, but we need to keep tweaking it over the years.  I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I always cite Childline, which is like a barometer of what it is like to live under the age of 18 years.  We listen 24-7, 365 days per year.  We constantly get children ringing us about online issues, but they do not say that they are ringing about an online issue, as children do not talk about online or offline.  This is the space they are living in and they are active in it every single day of the week.  Half the children between six and 18 years of age are online every day, but that figure is 94% for 16 to 18 year olds.  This is their life.  This is where they are living.</p> <p>  Self-regulation does not and will not work.  That ship has sailed.  I welcome the Minister's position on this matter, and we would actively support it.  In Australia, there is an interesting concept of co-regulation.  Getting representatives from the platforms around the table and having an adult and mature conversation is the only way to go.  From speaking to the larger platforms, I know that they are spending millions of euro on trying to tackle this, but they were not set up with the express objective of protecting children.  They are commercial operations.  We are talking about YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, but this issue extends way beyond them.  We are getting calls every day about new games that are launching and apps, including smaller ones, some of which require in-app purchases.  To use the Deputy's phrase, it is the Wild West.  The only way we can tackle this is through actual regulation.  I always use the analogy of how every other form of media that we look at is regulated.  Thanks to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, someone cannot put certain images up on television or outdoors.  Why are we allowed to do so online?</p></speech>

To address a technical element, the apps allow people to communicate directly and instantaneously.  I have three kids, so I have seen the use of these apps.</p> <p>  Turning to the point about censorship, it is nearly impossible.  For example, if I rang Professor Carthy on the phone, a delay could not be placed on it and I could not be told I could not say something.  WhatsApp, Snapchat and so on have the same function as a phone call.</p> <p>  Regulation and legislation are important, but everyone around the table will agree that we must work with the industry and talk to the young people.  The ISPCC is in attendance, but not just children should be involved.  Adults also have to be involved in and informed on these matters.  I have had numerous phone calls over the years about someone whose friend was in a bit of difficulty because of something that had happened online.  This issue crosses all age groups.  Children are very vulnerable and have to be protected, but there are other cohorts of people we must look after as well.</p></speech>

The latter is something that we do not address often enough.  Anyone can set up a successful business that sells drugs.  There is no regulation or anything.  It is just illegal, which is why such businesses are not set up, but one could sell drugs and make large amounts of money.  In the case of what we are discussing, though, we are in a strange situation wherein it is claimed that, because someone can build a technology with peer-to-peer or end-to-end encryption, he or she should be able to do it.  There may be some social good in certain contexts.  For example, we have seen protest movements around the world and people who are involved in trying to tackle unsavoury regimes using technology for good.  Having also seen the level of damage being done, however, we must be able to do something.  I am 50 something years of age, and Mr. Church's statistic about how virtually every aspect of 16 to 18 year olds' lives is online is frightening.  Deputy Jack Chambers is much younger than me, but many of us present probably grew up prior to the age when everything was available online - every photo of every birthday, every family moment, everything we did in school, etc.  That is terrifying to people who did not grow up with it, as is knowing that companies can use and exploit it or facilitate people who want to harass, bully or harm others.  I hope that we move to regulate it and that there will be a penalty for the perpetrators, but the people actually making the billions of euro will get to walk away scot-free and live a lifestyle thanks to something that has caused endless harm.  At a certain point in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, we as a society will look back on this period aghast that we put up with this and said that we had to do so because there was no way around it.</p></speech>

Just so that they are aware of what we are doing, we will ultimately produce a report on the issue of online harassment and harmful communications.  Obviously, we will make recommendations on legislative changes, but we are not limited to that, since it is not as though we are a legislative group.</p> <p>  I agree with virtually everything Deputy Brophy stated.  A part of the problem in a discussion about the Internet is that it can be broad, given the panorama of the Internet.  As such, I would like to examine one or two specific issues and probe how to deal with them.  Ms Counihan and Mr. Church raised an example - a woman under 18 years of age who is in a relationship consents in that relationship to intimate photographs being taken, but the relationship breaks down and her ex-partner subsequently posts the photographs online.  Could we probe this example for a while?  I would like to see how we might deal with it.  That would give us a good roadmap for how to deal in general with these issues.</p> <p>  It appears to me that her right to privacy has been breached.  Had those photographs been published in a newspaper, the courts would hold under the European convention and Irish constitutional law that the consent to the photograph being taken was a consent that was given in the context of a private relationship between her and her partner at the time.  If her privacy has been broken - I believe it has - the difficulty that she faces at the outset is that, in order to give effect to that breach of privacy, she probably has to go to court.  Do the witnesses believe it is necessary for us to put on a statutory basis the right to privacy that this woman has, which is a constitutional and convention right but is not given expression in Irish statute?  I will turn to the criminal aspects subsequently but in terms of the civil aspects, does Ms Counihan believe that there should be a law of privacy that sets out the woman's right?</p></speech>

It would be helpful.  Fair play to Deputy Howlin, who did this in his Bill.  However and wherever it is done, though, it is important that the principle of consent be referred to everywhere.  Of course the woman consented to those photographs or videos originally being taken in a private context, but it must be clear that that does not imply a general licence to broadcasting them to all and sundry or even to one other person.</p></speech>

If she wants to invoke the law, she has to go to a court where she will have to reveal her identity.  She will have to describe the events that took place so there will probably be a report about in the newspaper, which would put her off.  Does Ms Counihan agree?</p></speech>

That should definitely stay in and should be added to by an in camera provision.  That section does go some way towards safeguarding her privacy.  Professor Clare McGlynn makes the point in her critique of the same section that anonymity should begin before charge which would ensure that people would not be deterred but would be encouraged to come forward.  The whole criminal justice process, though it has improved in recent years, is still very difficult for victims and survivors of sexual violence.  It takes a very long time as well and the delay-----</p></speech>

Part of the problem is that technology companies do not believe they are publishers.  A newspaper is obviously a publisher but technology companies claim that they are not publishers but are servicing their communities.  There are online communities and the companies are just facilitating them.</p> <p>  Let us look at this now in a criminal context.  At present, the act in question is not criminal.  Potentially, it could be harassment but Ms Counihan is probably right in saying that there is no persistence to it, unless the repeated posting of the images could be viewed as persistent.  However, under the criminal law, I think it would be extremely difficult to secure a prosecution.  Would Ms Counihan agree?</p></speech>

The difficulty with an ISP is that it will not necessarily always be put on notice that this has happened.  It will not necessarily know.  Technically, I do not know if it can know at the same instant that the images are shared.  Does that sharing automatically come to the attention of some monitoring system?</p></speech>

It may not be the case that every single event is dealt with; it may be easier and more effective for more people to deal with it by way of a take-down procedure backed up by civil sanctions.  Ultimately, I do not see why these companies should not be criminalised if they do not take down material that they have been put on notice as being harmful.</p></speech>

If one looks at it from a criminal law point of view, if we introduce a new offence then the criminal law would have been breached.  It seems to me that the mechanism to give effect to her remedies and criminal liability is an online regulator.  If we look at it in the civil law context, the woman should be able to make a complaint about these intimate photographs to an online regulator, confirming that she did not give consent for them to be posted online and requesting that they are taken down.  The benefit of that, from her point of view is that unlike with the law of privacy, she does not have to disclose her identity by going to court.  An online regulator in that context would assist her in getting a remedy.</p></speech>

My feeling is that if it is done properly, that has the potential to be the quickest, safest, most private and most effective way to get the images taken down.  It will enable something to be done quickly.  Survivors really do not need the extra trauma of delay and uncertainty and, in the civil context, expense of court proceedings.</p></speech>

It is informed through an efficient mechanism at an early stage that there was no consent for these intimate images to be online.  If the company does not comply with that, then civil liability kicks in.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.948" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Church" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100200002#J02700"><p>I would like to add to what has been said.  I could not disagree with anything that Ms Counihan and Deputy O'Callaghan have said thus far.  The right to privacy is definitely an issue but as I said earlier to Deputy Brophy, the platforms are putting a lot of money and resources into this area.  I met representatives of Facebook recently.  That company employs approximately 30,000 people worldwide whose sole job is to take down inappropriate images.  Recently I read that something like 2.6 million inappropriate images were removed in one quarter, that is, in a three month period.  As I said earlier, these platforms were not set up to protect children.  They were set up to make a profit and while they are extremely beneficial to many people and add to effective communications, we would not let our road network run riot, with no lines in the middle of the road, no rules and no traffic lights but we are letting the equivalent happen with the internet.  Let us be clear, the ISPCC is not seeking to shut down the internet.  We talk to children every day and we know that the vast majority of both children and adults view the internet as extremely beneficial.  My own children use it every day to study for exams.  It is extremely beneficial but as with roads, which are also very beneficial, we need laws and rules.  The only way to do this is to have a proper regulator with teeth.  In the context of all other forms of media, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is a potential home for an e-safety commissioner for Ireland, if only to send out a message to the platforms that they are being watched.</p></speech>

To return to the example I gave, what Professor Carthy suggested in his paper would probably have a significant impact in deterring the woman's ex-partner from posting the images because, under the professor's proposal, he would have to disclose his identity and she would be able to identify who it was.  She would still have the difficulty of disclosing her identity, but it would assist her considerably if there was a requirement for his identify to be disclosed.</p></speech>

The offence mentioned by the Deputy is at the very serious end, but there are a host of offences at the less serious end which could be dealt with.  Many people post because they are anonymous and can say whatever they wish about individuals.  I am sure committee members are familiar with this.  The people in question would not make the posts if they could be identified and there was some regulation that allowed their identification.  Also, it would be appropriate for every company to have a take-down mechanism such that a person's first port of call would be the company to tell it that there is material on its platform about him or her and that he or she wants it to be taken down immediately before he or she would have recourse to a commission or something like it.  The commission should have a mechanism to do this quickly.  If the company did not respond, someone's next port of call would be the e-commissioner.  The companies have the money to put these facilities in place and it should be part of their process.</p></speech>

One of the issues, even in terms of regulations, is that time is of the essence with reference to content that is posted on social media websites.  As Chief Superintendent Gubbins stated, it is like making a telephone call.  It is instantaneous.  One of the bigger challenges we will have is that the content may not reside in this jurisdiction.  When something is posted online, it does not take long for it to be on other social media websites.  That is also a challenge for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In bureau investigations I have seen the difficulties in getting evidential data which is online.  That is something that will need to be considered in any future proposal or regulation.  The key message from me is that time is of the essence in order that if something happens in this jurisdiction, it can be taken down quickly.  Also, there should be no delays because once something is online, it can be anywhere.</p></speech>

I want to tease out the issues a little.  It was stated correctly that there were some pieces of legislation.  I note that Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has a Bill, as does Deputy Howlin.  A number of Deputies have brought forward legislation to deal with some aspect of the subject.  While that is part of it, our work involves looking at the bigger picture to see how it can be added to, expanded and turned into something which will be robust and strong enough to deal with these issues.  I am aware, as the previous speaker said, that there is an international dimension as the material goes outside the jurisdiction.  We do not how one would reach a platform based, for example, in Azerbaijan.  That is one of our difficulties.</p> <p>  I return to the key points and the example Deputy Jim O'Callaghan gave or a similar case.  While there is a civil case a person could take against an individual who has posted the piece of information or image and there may also be an element that could constitute a criminal case, the difficulty most people have is that, as regards the ability for it to be shared and the responsibility of those who share it, the company involved steps back and leaves the individuals involved to fight it out among themselves.  The company gets away without having to take any real responsibility.</p> <p>  There are a couple of points I want to make.  On traceability, surely there is a sense that there is almost a fingerprint for each individual engaged on the Internet.  We all hear, at least anecdotally, that all of the companies are geniuses at being able to trace and know everything about every part of our lives and that they engage in all of this analysis to determine whether we like country and western music or opera, or whether we are into this, that or the other.  From our interactions with others, they can almost identify people.  If they are already doing this, mainly through the use of artificial intelligence and various algorithms, it suggests that it would not be that difficult to to identify each individual, even where someone uses a false name and identity.  From his or her interactions with others, they will get to know who a person is and what is what.  In being able to find out his or her identity, is there a case for making a company responsible for being able to identify each person?</p> <p>  The example of the automobile industry was given.  For instance, if any of us here produced a piece of electronic equipment, we would have to send it away to be tested to obtain CE certification to indicate that it was valid and could be sold and used.  Surely if any of us here produced an app, there should be an authority somewhere where it would have to be tested to ensure it was fit for purpose and use.  Is there an international example of such an agency - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might know - that does this or is there any effort at European level to do it?</p></speech>

I will come back to what Professor Carthy stated about people having to prove who they are and their identity.  </p> <p>  In the nature of the business my colleagues and I are in, people do it on a regular basis, but they use a false identify.  No matter what we put in place, people will always find a way around it.  We must take this into consideration.  It impacts on traceability.  From what we have seen in some cases, people will generally create a new account to accommodate some of their criminal activities online.  It will not be personal, for example, to Michael Gubbins.</p><p>Such people will create a pseudonym when they go online, so there will be no history to support their identification.  The Deputy spoke about companies' responsibilities.  He is right.  I always look at the privileges and responsibilities of those big service providers.  They are big companies that make big money and they support a lot of employment, but they have a responsibility to protect citizens and their users, whether in Ireland or abroad.  We are here in this room this morning but those companies are not.  Some of what we are looking at is a new phenomenon.  We need to talk to these companies.  The Deputy is right to say that many clever people work for them.  We need them to face the issues that have developed as a result of their products.  The Deputy spoke about CE marking for cars and other products.  Because of how these service providers' applications facilitate us - and it might be one application today but another in the future - we need to be able to identify issues and ask them how they can help and what they can suggest in that regard.  </p><p> There are competing demands in the area of privacy of data and retaining information.  Companies might be headquartered in Ireland but the data for which we are looking might be somewhere else.  We then need to use mutual legal assistance treaties to get those data.  It can take a while to get through that process and, when the request is responded to, the data might not be there so the next step might not be available to us.  As a result of GDPR and so on, it is less likely that data will be available to help us with our investigations.  As Detective Superintendent Ryan said earlier, time is of the essence.  There is probably an opportunity for Ireland to take the first step in working with these bigger companies to find solutions as many of them have headquarters here.  We need to push it out, rather than looking outside and bringing it in.  Let us start at home first.</p></speech>

Law enforcement works with various service providers.  They give us training, they tell us what is available, they tell us how to understand the information they provide, and they tell us how to get it.  They are also involved with bodies such as the Virtual Global Taskforce with regard to images of child abuse.  They also report imagery to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, which is based in the US, and those cases are then forwarded to various countries for investigation.  With regard to this particular phenomenon, we have to tell them about our problems and identify ways to work more closely with them.</p></speech>

That is what is brilliant about it.  One pushes a button and gets one's information immediately.  It is a little bit too much of us to expect these companies to be able to detect when somebody posts a false or hateful comment or an offensive image and to take it down immediately.  With regard to the period of time they have to do so, however, people have told me that in some instances untrue, dangerous and terrible stuff about them has been left online for months on end.  It can sometimes stretch to years despite those affected continually asking and pleading with these companies to take it down.  Even when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na brings the problem to the attention of the companies the content is sometimes left in place.  Is there a need for additional legislation to force the providers to remove such content?  The legislation about which we are speaking goes some distance towards that end.  How do the witnesses feel about it?</p></speech>

If one asks for something to be taken down, they will say that it does not breach the rules.  As a country and as citizens, we have to challenge those community rules.  The committee will have an opportunity to address this next week, but I do not think that will get us where we want to be.  It will have to be regulated and legislated for.</p></speech>

The Deputy makes a very interesting and valid point about traceability and fingerprints.  Many intelligent people are able to figure out who we are.  I am not about to open the debate on the digital age of consent again, but the big issue we have is that children and young people, by their very nature, lie about their age to get onto these platforms.  There needs to be a greater onus on the Facebooks of this world to verify that age.  Many 13 year olds want to go into the discos where the 16 year olds are.  It is absolutely normal behaviour for children and young people.  There should be more of an onus on the companies in that regard.  In my opening statement, I made reference to the industry event the ISPCC ran with Technology Ireland, a trade association under IBEC.  The industry was present at that event.  We talked about the whole concept of safety by design and about encouraging, rather than forcing, platform and app developers to take child safety into consideration in this regard.  We talked about the idea of a CE-type mark.  That idea came up.  To the best of my knowledge, mobile phone operators in the UK are forced to issue phones set up as if they were to be bought by children.  There are small measures that could be taken that would play a big part in protecting children.</p></speech>

Common themes emerge, such as the lack of borders and harmful information spreading very quickly to very large audiences with no mechanisms to deal with it.  There is a gap between legislation and the platforms as a result of how quickly they develop.  There is a huge gap in legislation.  I thank the Law Society for its submission, in which it points out that we rely on the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 to deal with some of these issues.  It is a terrible subject and difficult to listen to.  I may come back to the ongoing training being provided to garda&iacute; to deal with these very difficult subjects.  No amount of legislation will sort this, although legislation is needed.  It is clear that legislation should always be a last resort.  Of course we need punishment for people who offend, but education is a very significant element as well, as are mechanisms that can deal with these issues very quickly so they do not progress further.  We might look at that next week.</p> <p>  I thank the delegation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its opening statement.  It says, "It is planned that other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be trained in cyber crime awareness".  When will that planned training start?  It is crucial.</p></speech>

It is especially low when it comes to sexual violence.  I would have thought we learned from that.  We have spent a long time in the D&aacute;il trying to get a second SAVI report to establish the prevalence of sexual violence.  We are all fighting and speaking from the same book.  What has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na done and what resources has it committed to obtain accurate knowledge and facts?  What can the witnesses direct me to so that I can see what is happening with crime online?</p></speech>

I will take her question away and come back with an answer because I do not have the facts or the figures.  I would have to utilise the Garda analysis service to help me with that.  Mr. Ryan and I can probably speak anecdotally about what we see coming before us.  With child abuse imagery, one will generally find that males are the offenders.  There is a mixture of offenders and victims, both male and female, involved in online harassment.</p></speech>

We are looking for data or information to assist us with our investigations, and it is either here in Ireland or it is not.

A separate problem to the one we are talking about today is the shocking amount of time young people spend online.  I think it is ironic that the companies making a fortune seek to provide an education space for their own children that has none of those distractions.  I am asking the witnesses not to be anecdotal even though I am.  That is what I read.  The facts are essential so that we can come to terms with this.  It is a balancing act between freedom of expression and privacy.</p></speech>

That is the medium through which they communicate today.  As a parent, I have done my best to have a conversation with them about the privilege of having access to this instantaneous information and communication and to understand how they use it and behave on it.  They are the same rules as one would apply if meeting a person in one's house or elsewhere, including not being rude to them or displaying images of them.  We have had some interesting conversations over dinner following from things I have seen at work.  I cannot reiterate enough the importance of parents taking responsibility and having a conversation with their children about balance and how to behave online.  It should be no different from how they behave if I or their mother was in the room.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  We all have parental responsibility.  We are meeting the companies in the next two weeks.  This meeting is to assist us in establishing the problems, their extent and how we strike a balance when writing up our report.  Statistics are vital in that regard.</p> <p>  Moving away from statistics for a moment, I have questions for Ms Counihan on another topic, the name of which I hate, that is, revenge porn.  The Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the submission from the solicitors have all raised it.  There is a different expression that I think captures it much better.  Will Ms Counihan elaborate on that?</p></speech>

It does not involve direct physical harm but can involve just about every other kind of damage to any other area of a person's life.  In the context of intimate partner violence, the mechanism by which the harm is caused and the nature of the harm is sometimes entirely individual and personal.  For instance, in a pattern of coercive control, an abuser will often know exactly what will drive his victim mad and distress her the most.  Because he knows her situation, he knows exactly what to say to her boss to cause her untold problems at work.  I am in favour of a broad definition.  Abuse is very often individually tailored to the circumstances, particularly in a long-term abusive relationship.  One cannot be too definite.  We have to be broad.</p></speech>

We might come back to this.  The submission from the legal profession makes a similar point.  It argues that the focus should be on harm inflicted and that consideration should be given to defining harmful content.  I have no problem with that.</p></speech>

The Scottish legislation is a good example.  It advocates shifting the focus from the level, nature or anything to do with the harm inflicted on the victim and onto the intention of the perpetrator.  Does that person have subjective intention to cause harm?</p></speech>

Section 4A of the UK's Protection from Harassment Act 1997 concerns "Stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress".  That might address some of the Deputy's questions in that regard.  Here, most of the criminal offences around harassment are covered by the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, while in the UK stalking would seem to be encompassed under 4A of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.</p></speech>

Ms Dixon's office concerns data.  To some extent the digital safety commissioner would conflict with the Data Protection Commissioner's role.  The Data Protection Commissioner is concerned with how we manage information and data and whether we should or should not keep it.  The digital safety commissioner would actually look for information to help him or her to protect citizens.

I wish to follow up on the point my colleague, Deputy Connolly, made.  We have many suggestions for legislation.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned codifying the right to privacy.  Others have mentioned verification of identity, which is important.  Has any country brought those moving parts together in any way?  We are at a very primitive stage in addressing this.  The witnesses are all nodding their heads, which I will take as confirmation.  Mr. Gubbins made an interesting point, which follows what Professor Carthy said.  One issue that seems to arise from the get-go is that a false identity can be used to create an account or multiple accounts.  If we legislated to require age verification, it would mean that the publisher, that is, the account holder, could not hide behind anonymity.  That seems to be a huge issue across all social media platforms.  A lot of these problems proliferate through fake accounts.  It could be simple legislation.  The problem arises in making it cross-jurisdictional and regulating it.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on that?</p> <p>  I believe that if people express something, they should stand by it, whether it relates to what we are talking about today or is potentially defamatory, as Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned.  If a journalist writes something, it is published in a newspaper and the journalist stands over what he or she has written.  It seems that on the Internet, the majority of difficulties arise from accounts that nobody can track or verify.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on how to deal with that properly?  Professor Carthy mentioned registration.  I note that Government services require proper verification of identity.  How do we deal with that?</p></speech>

In Ireland, a person cannot apply for a driver's licence without proving that he or she is of the appropriate age.  If Ireland does something, other countries will follow.  We are waiting for countries to take sensible steps in this.  Jurisdictions around the world are at a primitive stage, but if Ireland adopted sensible legislation, other jurisdictions would see that it makes sense and would follow in our footsteps.  It is not a technological difficulty.  The companies that appear next week will make all sorts of protests about it, but this could be a very straightforward mechanism.  It can be solved by the technology in a very straightforward way and it would make a huge difference.  We cannot overstate the difference verification would make.  We should also remember that most of the people on the Internet are sensible people who do sensible and good things.  Not everybody has a fake account.  A small subset of the population is misusing the Internet.  I would not want to give the impression that everyone in the population is using the Internet in an inappropriate manner, but unfortunately a significant number of people do and inevitably anonymity exacerbates the problem.</p></speech>

We could pass legislation requiring users to verify their age and identity, but as my colleagues and I find every day, there are false IDs, passports, and driving licences.  People will figure out a way around giving their correct age.  They will produce something that verifies an age and an identity but they will find a way around this if they want to.  Verification will address situations where somebody loses their head and does something wrong.  If that person has not hidden his or her identity, we will be able to pursue them.  It will make a dent.  However, anyone that is seriously intent on hiding their identity will figure out a way around it despite legislation and verification.</p></speech>

Mr. Gubbins mentioned this as well.  It is a fact of life that children will find their way around it but where there is a will, there is a way.  The reason for not doing it is commercial.  The reason for doing it is more of a civil and child protection issue.  I set up a Revolut account the other day and had to go through a number of things to verify that I was the right person.  There is a way if the companies want to do it.  The issue is that an awful lot of users would fall away and then advertising revenue would fall away as well so perhaps these companies have to operate under a different model with less revenue.  There is a thing.</p></speech>

An issue that goes beyond here is that of fake news, much of which is centred in countries that probably have less regulation than we would have.  Many of these issues could be resolved with a verification process because we would see a levelling of people.  As Professor Carthy said, the majority of people are there to have a community platform.  Many residents' associations have internal groups where everyone knows each other and is properly verified.  The external manifestation of many of these platforms involves anybody and everybody and the same individuals behind multiple accounts.  There is no technological difficulty but a commercial one.  There is a lot of discussion about corporation tax in an Irish context but we have a responsibility in the global context to properly regulate these entities because they constitute a platform of significant harm, as the witnesses have all noted.  It has to happen regardless of whether it is through legislation, co-operation or regulation.  I thank the witnesses for their submissions and information.</p></speech>

Deputy Chambers covered many of the questions I wanted to ask.  This area is a minefield.  As Deputy Connolly said, it is very upsetting to hear about what is happening.  We know what is happening and we know about online abuse.  We hear stories of children being bullied online and suicides.  I am a grandmother with two very small grandchildren - two beautiful little girls.  I often think "my God, what's ahead for them?"  To think about what can happen to children between the ages of six and 18 who are online is pretty shocking.</p> <p>  Some of the recommendations in Professor Carthy's presentation were very interesting.  His presentation was really powerful.  As he notes, it is quite simple.  It is not rocket science but I imagine there would be a significant backlash from the big corporations because Professor Carthy's suggestion will have an impact on their profits.  I know what that is like in here and what such a battle can look like and about trying to get as much support for what one is trying to do.  I know Airbnb has a system where someone registers for an account and must provide a scanned version of his or her passport to verify his or her identity.  That is one example of how it works.  The companies will come before this committee next week.  What does Professor Carthy think they will say about this?  What will be their protests?  He mentioned that they will protest against it so what will they say?  I hear what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is saying but at the end of the day, it is like road safety.  What will the companies protest about?  What are their arguments against it?  </p></speech>

They would argue that if they were to do this for every country, it would not be possible for them to do so.  That would be the most logical defence if I was sitting in their place.</p></speech>

The Internet is mostly positive.  We conducted some research in 2016 and 2017, although it may have been in 2017 and 2018.  I must check.  Among other things, we asked respondents about length of time spent online and the material they accessed.  We also asked parents about their involvement.  Some findings were of great concern.  While something like 60% of parents played an active part in most of their children's online engagement, quite a significant percentage of parents did not.  When probed, it emerged that they probably feared the technology.  They were not familiar with the technology and it was a topic with which they did not wish to deal.  It was easier to just hand the tablet over and allow it to become another babysitter.</p></speech>

We did ask if any child experienced what we would call cyberbullying or harassment and we have all that information.

I thank our guests for their presentations.  Deputy Connolly spoke about what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working on at this time and it sounds as if there is a lack of resources.  This should be one of the top priorities going forward.  It is a minefield and it is difficult but people being bullied online is one of the most worrying trends we must face.  I sometimes see it happening online and it is horrible.  I cannot imagine what it is like for young people who are bullied and the mental health issues that result.  The bullying can be by means of sexual abuse or mental abuse and it is awful.  People have been driven as far as suicide because of it.  It must be a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I look forward to hearing what the Garda will do in that area.  It is something that should be looked at in terms of resources.</p> <p>  I would like to know what language should be used.  We can ask young people to be careful about what they are doing online and tell them not to smoke or drink too much but I would love to educate myself and get to the core of how to manage the conversation that must be had with young people.  That is a vital conversation and I do not have the expertise.  I can tell young people to be careful and to mind themselves or ask them what is going on and try to monitor them but I would love to be more educated.  I imagine most parents and grandparents would love to know more so as to try to protect their children and grandchildren.  I thank our guests.</p></speech>

The idea is that everybody gets around the table and explains what should not be included in the design of a new programme, application, or form of communication on the Internet in the first place.  Let us not even nip it in the bud but, rather, make sure there is no bud to nip in the first place.  I would like to know what the attitudes of the representatives from the tech companies would be to that.</p></speech>

The point was made that this is not purely about the legislation, but also education and starting to teach children how to be safe online from an early age and to teach a parent how to have that conversation.  We counted 29 different organisations that are going into our primary and post-primary schools and probably teaching 29 different curricula.  It should be on the curriculum for the Department of Education and Skills. </p> <p>  I agree that the platforms are, to some extent, very educational tools but what are they doing in order to turn the conversation, switch it around and educate children?  A glut of funds is being thrown at various organisations by Google and Facebook.  Is that just a box-ticking exercise or is it a true attempt at educating our children?</p></speech>

Security by design means baking in the appropriate considerations from the beginning.  We are all at the start of this.  Somebody referred to the wild west earlier on and it is a bit like that because we are at the start of this.</p> <p>  It is worth remembering that there are vulnerable adults out there, as well as children, who have got themselves into a predicament and are worried and stressed.  Senator Black spoke about people who have taken their own lives.  Children are important but we also need to ask what responsibility those companies have for their adult users.</p></speech>

As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee regarding the 2019 mid-year review of expenditure for my Department.  The functions and responsibilities of my Department are many and diverse, ranging from support for the arts and culture, conservation and safeguarding of our heritage and language, to supporting sustainable island communities.  This year has been a very busy one for my Department with many notable achievements, including a new impetus to the promotion of our culture and creativity both at home and abroad.  The work of the agencies under the remit of my Department such as the Arts Council, our national cultural institutions and Screen Ireland, goes from strength to strength with innovative exhibitions, inclusive education and outreach programmes and an ever-growing diversity of creative engagement initiatives.  In addition, ambitious capital investment projects as part of Project Ireland 2040 are either under way or planned at many of these agencies.  A number of programmes and projects funded by or managed directly by my Department also continue to yield very positive results, including the work of Culture Ireland, the expansion of the per cent for arts scheme, the extension of the social welfare scheme for self-employed artists in conjunction with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the expansion of the Creative Schools initiative in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the ongoing development of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the first national day celebrating children and young people&rsquo;s creativity.</p><p>The new national heritage plan, Heritage Ireland 2030, will guide our heritage priorities and investment over the next decade and beyond.  In March of this year, a series of 70 public workshops on the plan came to a conclusion.  There was an unprecedented level of response and engagement, with over 2,000 organisations and individuals making submissions on what heritage means to them.  The need to address heritage impacts, the loss of biodiversity and the erosion of our heritage in general are very strong themes to emerge from this consultative process, as is a strong call for support for education and youth engagement with heritage<i>. </i>The analysis of the submissions is ongoing within my Department, laying the foundations for what will become the overarching policy for Ireland&rsquo;s built and natural heritage for years to come. </p><p>In terms of our language and islands, good progress continues to be recorded on the implementation of the five year action plan for the Irish language.  Supports for the Irish language and our Gaeltacht and island communities continue to be provided and enhanced to the greatest extent possible.  </p><p>This year has also seen progress on a number of key projects under my Department's investment plan as part of Project Ireland 2040.  I spoke to the committee earlier this year about the potentially transformative impact of this investment plan, bringing together all aspects of our culture and our heritage, built, natural and linguistic, under a single programme of investment with an holistic vision.  As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I look forward to continuing progress under this investment plan and indeed across all strands of my Department's work programme during the remainder of the year and into future years. </p><p>In terms of my appearance here today, members have been provided with a report by my Department outlining details of performance and expenditure across all programme areas during the first half of 2019.  The 2019 Revised Estimates provides for a gross allocation of just under &euro;339<b></b>million for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2019.  In addition, a further &euro;700,000<b></b>in capital funding was carried over from the 2018 provision.  Gross total expenditure incurred by my Department in the period to 30 June 2019 was &euro;153.2 million.  This expenditure represents 94% of profiled expenditure and 45% of the overall 2019 gross allocation.  In addition, the capital carry-over sum of &euro;700,000 was expended in full.  This expenditure has increased to &euro;205.7 million as at 31 August 2019, representing 97% of profiled expenditure and 61% of the 2019 gross allocation for my Department.</p><p> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and I will speak about the highlights in each 6programme area during the first half of 2019.  I will commence with the culture programme.  I will be happy to expand on any matter members may wish to raise.</p><p> Total funding of just under &euro;189 million is provided in 2019 for the culture programme.  Some 95% of this funding, or approximately &euro;180 million, is used to directly support arts and culture in Ireland.  Gross direct programme expenditure on culture, up to 30 June, was &euro;86.4 million, representing 48% of the corresponding 2019 programme allocation.  This percentage had increased to 63% as at 31 August.  As committee members are aware, a cornerstone of my Department's culture investment programme under Project Ireland 2040 is the &euro;460 million being set aside for the renovation of the national cultural institutions, the protection of the national collections and the enhancement of visitor experiences and services.  While much of the work in 2019 continues to be focused on the appraisal, planning and design of projects, the first phase of enabling works to prepare for the National Archives' repository redevelopment was completed earlier this year, with many of the State's papers and documents being moved to temporary storage in order to facilitate the preliminary site works.  The project is intended to deliver new purpose-built storage facilities at the National Archives premises on Bishop Street, Dublin 8 and will build in the potential to develop and construct additional storage in the future.</p><p> On the audiovisual industry, European Commission approval was received to extend the section 481 film tax credit for four years, from its original end date of 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2024.  This will provide certainty for production companies on the future availability of the credit and helps to ensure the Irish film industry will continue to grow.  Also in support of the Government's ambition to make Ireland a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation, new film regulations aimed at supporting broader regional development of the audiovisual sector in Ireland were introduced by the Revenue Commissioners earlier this year.  The regional film development uplift, announced as part of budget 2019, will be available to productions being undertaken substantially in areas designated as assisted regions, obliging production companies to make training and skills development a key part of their projects and ensuring the film industry will benefit from the additional activity long after thee productions have concluded.</p><p> Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is the first national day celebrating children and young people's creativity.  It took place again in June this year, with a programme of more than 750 free creative activities for under-18s across the country.  Although only in its second year, the initiative under my Department's Creative Ireland programme is already a great success and a firm fixture in the culture calendar.  Its success is due in no small part to the really impressive range of events for all ages and interests curated by the culture and creativity teams across the 31 local authorities.  Events included workshops, exhibitions and performances and were kicked off by our Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g ambassadors, who are Sarah Fitzgerald in Cork and Adam Cunningham in Galway city.  Ben de Barra's first film "The Happy Garden" was premiered in Dublin as part of Cruinni&uacute;.</p><p> This year has also seen the appointment of cultural ambassadors from Ireland's arts and culture community to promote Ireland globally as part of the Government's Global Ireland 2025 initiative and provide advice on and an input into strategic cultural initiatives and participate in key events and projects.  Martin Hayes, Shelley McNamara, Yvonne Farrell, Ruth Negga and Paul Muldoon all accepted the role of cultural ambassador in January this year for a period of three years.  I greatly appreciate each cultural ambassador's acceptance of the role.  In continuing to do what they do best they will be among Ireland's greatest representatives globally.</p><p> At the start of the year I was pleased to announce the publication of the guidance of the expert advisory group on the decade of centenaries, 1919 to 1923.  Consistent with this advice, I am committed to ensuring the State's approach to remembering all those who lost their lives during the struggle for independence and the significant events and themes associated with this period will be based on the respectful, sensitive, proportionate and authentic approach that has become the hallmark of my Department's decade of centenaries commemorative programme.  The collaborative approach between the State, the local authority network and community organisations to the commemorative programme has been critical in its successful delivery to date.  To that end, I was very pleased to be able to announce a funding allocation of &euro;10,000 for every local authority in 2019 to support their role in leading the development of commemorative activities at county level under the community strand of the decade of centenaries programme.</p><p> On the culture programme, it would be remiss of me not to mention Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture.  I was very pleased to launch the culture programme under Galway 2020 last month.  The programme presents a wealth of artistic talent inspired by and nurtured in Ireland, as well as the work of artists from other cultures.  It represents both Galway city and county, including the islands, spreading across Ireland and adopting an all-Ireland approach.  Galway 2020 is supported by the Government through my Department.  It is recognised not alone as an EU event but also one which fits within the Government's Global Ireland initiative which aims to increase Ireland's global profile by 2025.  The programme promises to be an exciting one, including many free events, and will I hope attract visitors from around the world who will experience at first hand the many and varied aspects of Irish culture.  </p><p> I will be happy to expand on any issue members would like to raise about any programme area.</p></speech>

As Vice Chairman, I look forward to working closely with him.  </p> <p>  The Minister has outlined a significant budget and many projects, some of which have been ongoing for the past 12 months since the previous budget.  She said the total budget was &euro;339 million.  I am not sure what the exact figures were for last year, but the Minister received a lot of money from the rural regeneration fund for various projects.  Therefore, she has a significant budget.  There were 43 projects in County Cork.  While many communities in my constituency were involved in various projects, none of them received any funds.  I am not sure whether it was a total of &euro;8 million that the Minister received from the rural regeneration fund, probably rightly so, but with an overall budget of &euro;339 million, it does not look good for it to be topped up from the rural regeneration fund.  That is my take on the view among the general public and the powers be should take notice.  The Department is obviously very powerful and well staffed.  I am aware of one rural community organisation that spent &euro;500,000 in trying to get a project off the ground and was refused funding.  Given the current level of funding available to the Department, it is not a level playing pitch.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  The Department is entitled to apply for such funding, but it is of major concern.  However, that is not the issue about which I wish to talk.  </p> <p>  Mid-way through her presentation the Minister said she would try to address any matter under her umbrella members would like to raise.  One such issue is the hedge-cutting Bill.</p></speech>

The Deputies can ask anything they like.</p> <p>  Specifically with reference to culture, we fund numerous projects in County Cork.  Most recently, we announced an allocation of &euro;350,000 for the Briery Gap Culture Centre which, as the Deputy knows, closed for a number of years following a fire.  We hope to get it back up and running.  It is located in the middle of Macroom and will add a huge amount to the town.  It will go a long way towards helping the community in the area.</p> <p>  We also fund the Crawford Art Gallery.  This year we gave it &euro;76,000 which helped it to open on Sundays.  It is doing phenomenally well.  Being able to open an extra day has had a transformative effect.  </p> <p>  The Department gives many other grants, including to the Cork Butter Museum, the Sirius Arts Centre, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen, St. Peter's in Cork, LeisureWorld, the Triskel Arts Centre, Banteer Old School Heritage and Drama Trust, Conna Community Council, the Cyclone Theatre Company, Wandesford Quay, the Everyman Palace, Cork Opera House, Firkin Crane, the National Sculpture Factory in Cork, the Graffiti Theatre Company, the Glen Theatre, the Cork Arts Theatre, the Laharn Community Centre and Cloyne Diocesan Centre.  Under the national development plan and Project 2040, the Crawford Art Gallery will receive &euro;22 million, which is significant.  I hope this addresses the Deputy's concerns.  I will come back to the heritage question.</p></speech>

Will the Minister see whether she can do anything to help local people to retain their identity by doing something about the provision of funding to help with insurance costs or having a group fund in order that all festivals could move under one umbrella?  The Minister and the Department could help in that regard.  All that is left in many rural places is a one or two-day event such as world fiddle day in Scartaglin.  The only funding it received this year was &euro;1,000 from Kerry County Council.  While those involved were appreciative, they did not feel it was enough for the job they did in bringing fiddle players from all over the country to Scartaglin for what is a massive event.  In many places, including Kenmare, Sneem and even Kilgarvan, the big problem is sourcing or meeting requests for insurance cover.  They will all be wiped out.  Given everything else that has been taken from them, including post offices, Garda stations, local shops and service stations, many local communities have very little left with which to retain their identity.  They have been trying their best.  This year some of them failed to hold events because of the cost of insurance.  Will the Minister see what she can do to help them to retain their identity?</p> <p>  My other questions are more appropriate to the discussion on heritage.</p></speech>

We are doing everything we can to look at it.  We offer support to festivals under the small summer festival scheme run by the Department.  Anybody is entitled to apply on an annual basis and grants are allocated accordingly.  We are very supportive of local festivals, as is the Arts Council.  Therefore, there are two separate streams.  There are some arts centres in County Kerry which we look after.  They include St. John's Theatre and Arts Centre in Listowel Square, the cultural centre in Killarney, Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne, Siamsa T&iacute;re in Tralee which is very well known, the Cahersiveen Community Resource Centre, Teach Siamsa Finuge, Teach Siamsa na Carraige and An Daingean Boatyard Arts and Cultural Centre.  The festivals programme is always open for applications for funding.  If the Deputy knows of anybody who wants to apply, he can let us know.</p></speech>

The creative schools initiative involves a welcome partnership with the Department of Education and Skills.  With reference to the higher implementation group and arts education policy, is the Department still striving towards having local arts education partnerships?  Has the creative schools initiative come from the manifesto of the local arts and education partnerships?  We have had Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g and prior to it Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca.  Both were wonderful.  Will this national day of celebration for young people and children continue or will it be parked to one side and will we have Cruinni&uacute; na something else the year after?</p> <p>  On the promotion of the Irish language, the five-year action plan is welcome.  The Department is involved in groundbreaking initiatives in arts education in engaging with the Department of Education and Skills.  The two Departments had not crossed over too much prior to the creative schools programme.  Will the Minister speak to us about the engagement with the Department of Education and Skills in the delivery of gaelscoileanna throughout the country?  Is it something in which she is actively involved or is it entirely within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills?</p> <p>  The Minister touched on Galway 2020, on which there was a presentation in the AV room last week.  This will be a hugely exciting year in the country.  the Galway International Arts Festival is of huge international significance for both the country and County Galway.  As a regular visitor to the festival, I know that it needs a permanent contemporary visual arts space.  From year to year it move from temporary building to temporary building.  I visited the old post office on Shop Street, in which this year's contemporary arts practice exhibition was held.  I know that there is a real desire to have a permanent home for this element of the festival.  I hope it is something the Government will ensure is a legacy of Galway 2020 when Galway will be European capital of culture.</p></speech>

If I leave anything out, the Deputy can refresh my memory.  She asked a number of questions about various topics.  </p> <p>  With reference to Galway 2020, as I mentioned in my opening statement, next year will be significant, and not just for Galway.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has a particular interest in the issue.  It will also be a significant year for Ireland in showcasing our culture and creativity and what we can do as a country.  The eyes of not just Europe but the world will be on us.</p><p>It is a great honour for Galway, along with Rijeka in Croatia.  It is going to be really significant in terms of what we will be able to do.  The legacy project was mentioned.  When I was launching the cultural aspect, I went to visit a potential site that they are looking at, an old An Post building.  Whether that transpires remains to be seen but it is certainly an option that is being looked at.  There are a number of different options.  One of our main goals for Galway 2020 is that we leave a legacy so that it is remembered for generations to come and the creativity and artistic endeavour that people put into the whole project are continued on so that it has ramifications for other people.</p><p> The Deputy also mentioned Creative Youth.  We have expanded the programme, doubling it from 150 schools to 300 this year.  That is going to engage about 100,000 students, which is quite significant.  There is also an increased budget of over &euro;6 million for this year, which is also combined with the Arts Council and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  There are three new local Creative Youth partnerships being rolled out through the education and training boards, ETBs, in Laois-Offaly, Kerry, and Limerick and Clare.  These are to develop new networks and enable greater collaboration within the local cultural and creative communities and also to complement the work being done in the formal school setting.  There is also Music Generation, which will increase opportunities for more children and young people to access high-quality, subsidised performance music education, with the commencement of five new local music education partnerships.  As well as that there is the national creativity fund with 30 exciting new and innovative partnerships.  That was launched in 2018.  The projects are now up and running; 15 of them are for children and young people.  They include the regional roll-out of the Fighting Words creative writing initiative and the founding of the Open Youth Orchestra of Ireland, a national youth ensemble for physically and intellectually challenged children.  It is the first of its kind in Europe and is led by the Royal Irish Academy of Music.  That was a very exciting thing to start.  Continued buy-in from the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council and increased support in respect of the early years setting remain really important for the continued success of the initiative.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a national day for creativity for children.  I think the specific question was whether it will continue.  Yes, we want it to continue.  The year before was Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca which in itself was a great celebration.  I think Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is even more successful and has great benefits for children and engaging them.  We are the first country in the world to have a day dedicated just for children&rsquo;s creativity.  It is quite cutting edge in that sense.  The feedback, particularly from rural, local communities, has been really positive.  It is a way of getting children involved in supporting local artists and voluntary arts groups as well.  It is run through the culture and creativity teams at local authority level primarily.  It took place on 15 June, as I said in my statement, and we had about 780 events.  There are about 55,000 children who engage in it.  It is really a great day.  There are three new young ambassadors as part of Cruinni&uacute; 2019.  There was also a full citizen engagement plan which we rolled out, including a partnership with RT&Eacute;, and the programme showed increased attendance and increased diversity of events available for children and young people.  That was positive as well.  </p><p> The recognition of Gaelscoileanna is important to my Department and there have been problems in this regard.  It is an issue really primarily for the Minister for Education and Skills.  I understand that a number of new Gaelscoileanna were announced recently following an intervention from the Language Commissioner and I think that announcement was widely welcomed.  However, it is mainly a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

I know Cavan-Monaghan ETB was not one of those.  From personal experience, I know it is certainly doing massive work in the visual, performing and literary arts.  Joanne Brennan is leading the local arts and education partnership there and has vast experience.  They were bitterly disappointed that they were not included in getting that annual programme funding.  I would ask the Minister to look at what they are doing.  I personally think it is a model of excellence in terms of their delivery.  I ask the Minister to engage with Joanne Brennan and see what they are doing there.  There is a lot to be gained and information and good practice that could be shared throughout the ETBs.  There are only 16 of them across the country and they are a really positive and useful vehicle for the delivery of arts education.  Cavan-Monaghan was certainly leading the way in terms of the delivery of that and actually ran a pilot scheme as far back as 2015.  I encourage the Minister to see what they are doing there and maybe give them some guidance, perhaps in the next tranche of funding she may be giving out to ETBs, that they would be successful because they are already doing it.</p></speech>

She mentioned a number of items under the Creative Ireland programme.  How has it developed during 2019?  Are she and the Department satisfied that the benefits of the Creative Ireland programme are being felt and spread across the country?  The Minister has answered my question about the creative schools initiative, which Deputy Smyth asked, with regard to the number of schools being brought under that scheme being doubled from 150 to 300 and an additional budget being put in place.  It is a really important initiative and partnership with the Department of Education and Skills.  A number of months ago I was at an art installation funded through this programme in Roscommon County Council offices and it was wonderful to see children engaging in it.  We could see the practical benefits in terms of that programme being rolled out.</p> <p>  On Galway 2020, my question has been answered really.  It is going to be a major event for Galway and I am happy to hear that there is a focus on it being a national event as well.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is on the other side of the county, I am from the eastern side of Galway.  It is important that we would see a number of events taking place within the wider Galway region and obviously as a national showcase.  There is significant Government funding being provided for Galway 2020.  I really want to emphasise the importance of it being spread across the area.  I say that because I was recently at the launch of the Larry Reynolds festival, which was mentioned.  Funding was secured through the summer festival scheme.  There is such talent and interest.  The committee is very vibrant and they do a massive amount with minor funding.</p><p>There is merit in ensuring the Galway 2020 programme, in terms of its reach, spreads wider than just the city.</p></speech>

She asked me if we are satisfied with how the Creative Ireland programme is going.  I believe it going from strength to strength.  It is working right across Government with the aim of embedding creativity across public policy ultimately and supporting and enabling participation in creative activities.  The Senator and Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned the Creative Youth plan.  Real gains have been made in the Creative Youth plan and in the creative communities plan because of buy-in from the Department of Education and Skills ultimately and also from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That is enabling a change at policy level, which probably was not done previously, and it is working very well.</p> <p>  Under the Creative Youth plan, the schools in County Roscommon participating in the creative schools initiative include the Feevagh national school in Ballinasloe, Scoil Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in in Keadue and Scoil na nAingeal Naofa in Boyle.  It is great to see the number of participants in that initiative double.  It may be an initiative that could be rolled out to more schools in the future.  It is a positive measure.  If we can engage with children at a young level in any type of creativity, it tends to stay with them for life, and that is something we are trying to do.  </p> <p>  Did the Senator ask me a question about Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g?  </p></speech>

There were a further 500 specific projects supporting this element, which was quite good.  In Roscommon, a project funded through the creative communities plan included the annual children&rsquo;s book festival, which is called Ros na n&Oacute;g, which is run by Roscommon County Council library services.  It is a national festival which celebrates literacy and creativity for children of all ages.  October is a very busy month apparently in Roscommon library services because they have a myriad of events scheduled throughout their branch library network throughout the month.</p> <p>  The whole-of-Government Culture Ireland programme has a wide range of measures to create opportunities for people of all ages in all parts of the country to engage with creativity and to derive all of the personal and collective benefits that flow from that engagement.  We have expanded our particular programme this year and we hope to do so more in the future.</p> <p>  What was the Senator&rsquo;s last question about the Galway 2020 programme?</p></speech>

I will not raise questions that have already been covered but some questions I wish to raise have not been touched on.  One concerns museum funding for both the National Museum of Ireland and the local museums.  We had presentations from local museums before the committee earlier this year and they raised a number of issues.  Some raised increasing insurance costs, a matter which is probably out of the Minister's hands.  While insurance matters, as such, are a private matter for companies, in many cases these are small rural museums but there are also some in the city that have increased costs because sometimes they display priceless objects or artifacts that have a price tag which increases their insurance cover.  Small museums find it difficult to cover insurance costs if they do not have a significant footfall and an independent benefactor to keep their doors open to provide the service they deliver.  Has consideration been given in the culture budget to finding a mechanism to provide group insurance schemes for museums?  If so, it could also address the needs in some of the other cultural institutions mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  The programme funding for the National Museum of Ireland was &euro;13 million.  That seems large but a number of acquisitions, for instance, would put a big dent in that pot.  That is usually what the museum is seeking and it also has a big programme.  I have had communications with the Minister and the museum on expanding its exhibition space and putting more of its archived artifacts on display.  That funding, while it appears substantial is small in comparison, for instance, to the funding for the Arts Council, An Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on, or even the funding available for the very worthwhile Galway 2020 programme, which is less than it but it is large considering it is a one-off programme.  Is the funding for the national cultural institutions and, in particular, the National Museum of Ireland because it has the highest number of visitors, large enough or does the Minister believe it is hampering those institutions' abilities to respond to demand?</p> <p>  Another area I wish to raise does not come directly under the culture heading as such but it does come under in a way in that Screen Ireland comes under it, which I wish well.  Funding in that area is increasing and, hopefully, it will deliver a more sustainable film industry into the future, which the committee has discussed here previously and which the Minister has discussed in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We have permission from the EU with respect to tax reliefs for the industry up to 2020.  Tax relief is tax foregone in some ways but we must attract a specific element of the film industry, multinationals or the big companies from abroad to make their big films in Ireland.  We have had good news on that front in recent times, but we need to examine how we can build a sustainable film industry which has directly employed workers.  If, in 2023 or 2024, the EU says such tax relief can no longer be granted, we must find a mechanism whereby the State can fund that directly.  Would that be through increased funding for Screen Ireland?  </p> <p>  I have a question on the spend on the Decade of Centenaries since its inception and its forerunners.  I was a member of the all-party committee which advised the advisers or the Minister in that respect.  The allocation of &euro;1 million to celebrate the centenary events in 2019, is minuscule.  Also, the allocation of &euro;10,000 to local authorities in that respect is derisory.  The local authorities are encouraged to put their own funding with that allocation.  However, given the number of local historical groups and the great interest that was shown when the last round of funding was available in 2016, that funding allocation needs to be greatly increased to encourage local organisations to organise events beyond just those of local interest so that they can attract people from outside their locality to help make sense of, celebrate and commemorate what happened 100 years ago.</p><p>The Minister attended a number of events organised by local organisations, such as the one in Soloheadbeg.  Those events cost much more than would have been available if that &euro;10,000, which would have been the full amount for that county, had been given to the organisations in question.  Funding needs to substantially increase if we are to do justice to the events that shaped Ireland's history from 2019 onwards.</p></speech>

As for the National Museum of Ireland, we engage with all national cultural institutions to ensure they have adequate resources for their needs.  Project Ireland 2040 includes &euro;85 million for the National Museum of Ireland, which is quite significant and will be a key support.  We have also provided support for county museums and key organisations such as the Hunt Museum, the Foynes Flying Boat and Maritime Museum in Limerick, Marsh's Library and the Butter Museum in Cork.  The Heritage Council also runs the museum standards programme, which funds local museums to help them get up to standard.  I recognise that it can be a difficult issue.  We are also funding digitisation projects as well.  In an ideal world we would have a bigger budget for any national cultural institution.  However, this year I allocated a significant amount of money and we hope that the &euro;85 million in Project Ireland 2040 will help realise a significant difference for the National Museum of Ireland in the future.</p></speech>

The title says 2040 but it the plan is for a ten-year period.</p> <p>  The 2019 work programme included many highlights, such as the exhibition on the First D&aacute;il, which was opened by the Ceann Comhairle on 17 January.  The National Museum of Ireland's strategic plan for 2019 to 2022 was launched in early March, and an exhibition by the Down-based artist Alison Lowry, which was an artistic response to the Tuam mother and baby home, the Magdalen laundries, and domestic violence, was also launched in March.  As part of the Traveller's Journey exhibition, the Department of Education and Skills has collaborated with our colleagues in the folk life curatorial team to launch an installation entitled "Camp", which will include work created by students from Limerick School of Art and Design and communities of Travellers in the west of Ireland, and will be displayed in the Museum of Country Life.  Other exhibitions include the Henri Cartier-Bresson exhibition and the rural electrification exhibition, which was launched on 11 July.  It is a very exciting programme and other progress is happening in 2019 as well.  The physical developments across the site over the next 15 years will be underpinned by three principles: protection, which includes providing the best conditions for the care of its collections, as well as access for education and research; safeguarding, that is, ensuring that all National Museum of Ireland sites are safe and secure as collections for the public; and accessibility, which means making the sites, exhibitions and interpretations fully accessible for all our people.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the audiovisual action plan and Screen Ireland.  We have a ten-year audiovisual action plan with funding of &euro;200 million under Project Ireland 2040, which will support the development of the industry.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiment about making Ireland somewhere special for the film industry.  The section 481 film tax relief has been extended and there has been a regional uplift of 5%, which is important.  I know from talking to film industry representatives from other jurisdictions that space is a big issue for them.  That is an area in which the regional uplift will be transformative and will also have economic benefits for local people.  There is huge demand for the facilities at Troy Studios in Limerick, for example, and we can do more in that regard.  The action plan contained eight policy recommendations, including oversight of the industry by the steering group; the section 481 film tax relief; strategic review of feature film funding; skills development; regulatory reform; and marketing and other reforms.  They are all important issues.  The skills development programme through Screen Skills Ireland is a new initiative that was set up in response to some of the submissions the film industry has made in that regard.  There will also be a skills assessment for the section 481 tax credit relief.  We have ongoing engagement with all stakeholders about project finance, which ultimately aims to attract international audiovisual projects to Ireland.  All those initiatives are in line with the Department's audiovisual action plan.  There is much exciting work going on in the film industry, and we continue to keep in close contact with stakeholders in order that we can work collaboratively together for everyone's benefit.</p> <p>  The Deputy's last question related to centenaries.  He and I have spoken in the D&aacute;il about the decade of centenaries on a number of occasions.  This year I allocated &euro;1.1 million to support the programme, which is a funding increase of &euro;250,000 on the 2018 allocation.  That is a positive.  I will seek to continue to appropriately resource the programme over the coming period through the normal budgetary process.  We are reviewing the funding requirements in the context of the development of the commemorative programme in line with the advice from the expert advisory committee.  I thank members for their efforts and participation in the all-party Oireachtas committee, which is of assistance in developing that programme. </p> <p>  We have given money to local authorities, as the Deputy mentioned.  That is important, because local people want to commemorate events in their own areas and counties, apart from the full State ceremonial events.  It was very important that we marked that and allocated money to the local authorities to do what they wanted to commemorate different events.  We doubled the 2018 funding; therefore that &euro;10,000 is double what it was previously.  We also provided &euro;10,000 to Soloheadbeg in Tipperary, where I attended an event myself.  The focus in 2019 has mainly been on larger national events, such as the centenary of the First D&aacute;il.  Last year was also a significant year for women's suffrage and the first woman being elected.  I announced the Markievicz bursaries through my Department in recognition of that, and there was also a pop-up museum.  However, I note the Deputy's comments. </p></speech>

I refer first to the issue of the capital spend.  There was an allocation of &euro;40.107 million and the profile to 30 June was less than half of that, for some reason.  I can never understand why we can never get people to do anything in the first half of the year; they certainly do not send bills in.  The profile was &euro;17.015 million but the spend was only &euro;11.296 million.  While the profile was for some inexplicable reason less than 50% of the allocation, only 66% of that profile was spent.  It is also stated that the total allocation for cultural infrastructure and development for the year was &euro;12.15 million.</p><p>The profile outlined that &euro;4 million was be spent but only &euro;1 million has been spent.  How much had been spent as of 30 September?  We are getting into the endgame because all bills should be submitted by the end of November in order to give the usual 30 days to check receipts and so on.  Can the Minister explain the shortfall in spending?</p><p>Baineann an dara ceist at&aacute; agam le Gaillimh 2020 Pr&iacute;omhchathair Chult&uacute;ir na hEorpa.

Yeats and the Irish revival poets but without the Irish language, they were nothing.  All their inspiration came from the Irish language, Irish mythology and so on.  I am not sure whether I am a big fan of John Millington Synge.  He used literal translation into English.  One could do the same thing from English to Irish by translating word for word, putting the words in the wrong order and getting bizarre grammar.  In spite of that, he is one of our most famous playwrights.  Much of his work was inspired by Inis Me&aacute;in, one of the Aran Islands, where he stayed in what is now known as Teach Synge.  Is the Minister happy that there is enough emphasis in the Galway 2020 programme on the Gaeltacht, the Irish language and our unique linguistic heritage?  The Irish language is a particularly valuable cultural asset because it has such a long written history.  In fact, it has the longest written history of any extant vernacular language this side of the Alps.  As the Department is one of the big funders of Gaillimh 2020, is the Minister happy with the emphasis on the Irish language in its programme?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that it is our national language and must be represented through Galway 2020.  I am sure an Aire St&aacute;it, Teachta Kyne, will ensure that it is.</p> <p>  On capital funding, we are very confident that we will draw down the full funding amount.  On 30 September, we had spent &euro;4.1 million in capital funding under subhead A7.  We are one of the very few Departments to always spend almost the entire allocation.  A total of 99.6% of the allocation was spent one year, while approximately 99% was spent in 2017-18.  We always spend every cent we get.  In this Department, a small amount goes a long way.  I referred to the &euro;76,000 allocated to the Crawford art gallery.  It is a small amount of money in the context of the overall departmental spend, but it had significant effect as it allowed the gallery to open on Sundays all year round, which it could not do heretofore.  We are satisfied that we will spend every cent we have.</p></speech>

It is far more difficult when one is playing a guessing game and ringing up trying to find out what they are doing.  One would expect that the money is spent continuously, particularly in respect of multi-annual projects.  This is a problem with local authorities.  It is not a new problem or one that any Minister has managed to crack, but we must keep trying to resolve it because it is a most unsatisfactory way for the authorities to do their business.  The bills should be submitted on a quarterly basis.  In other Departments, the failure to do so has led to shortfalls.  It creates far more work for the Department in trying to track what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; orthu fanacht, so is f&eacute;idir leis fanacht freisin.</p> <p>  In 2017 the Taoiseach committed to double arts funding within seven years.  Two budgets later, current spending on culture and arts has increased by 13.8%.  Obviously, the increase is welcome.  Is it still Government policy to double arts funding or was that a claim made in the context of the Fine Gael leadership contest?  Is it possible to achieve a 100% increase within seven years?  Does the Minister intend to make good on that commitment?</p> <p>  I wish to support the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh but do not require the Minister to respond.  I ask that she take my point into account.  Although the funding provided for commemorations last year is welcome, it is nowhere near what was provided in 2016.  The 2016 programme was very successful and many communities availed of it.  It increased the capacity for commemorations as many organisations are in a strong position to plan programmes once they are given adequate notice.  The programme under the local authorities was a great success but this year, 2020 and 2021 are crucial and sufficient funding will be required.  </p> <p>  Creative Ireland is a multi-departmental and multi-agency strategy.  Is the Minister satisfied that she is receiving adequate co-operation and buy-in from the agencies involved?</p><p>How much of the money being spent on Creative Ireland is going towards design?</p><p> My final question relates to an area that is in the programme allocation breakdown.  I want to understand how this came about.  According to media commentary and Government statements, responsibility for funding provided for the Cork event centre has transferred to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This has been an ongoing issue for several years.  It has been a torturous process and there is considerable frustration about it in Cork.  Some of this frustration has been caused by the lack of clarity and transparency.  The Government is saying there is a clear funding commitment.  The public, Opposition Deputies and councillors do not know what the commitment is and are no clearer about the timeline.  What is the timeline and what is the role of the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht if the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is now the lead Department?  Why did the lead role change?  When will everything that has been agreed, not all of which is necessarily in the public domain, be known?  Is the project fully in compliance with the legal restrictions that the Department was trying to overcome?</p></speech>

He is correct that the Taoiseach made a commitment to double the funding in the seven years to 2025.  Obviously, I believe he will honour that.  I am in budget negotiations for this year.  I am using my best endeavours in the context of a Brexit budget to get whatever I can for my Department.  We will publish those details on 8 October so I am not in a position to comment in detail on any budgetary allocations pending that announcement.  The background to making resources available for 2020 is a difficult one, as the Minister for Finance has outlined.  I will continue to place emphasis on the core functions and services of the Department to maintain the momentum created across the arts and culture sphere by initiatives funded by my Department, which are consistent with the Taoiseach's commitment to double funding by 2025.  In addition, I will emphasise the importance of conserving and managing our heritage as a support.  We can talk about heritage later on along with the other areas in my Department.  I am using my best endeavours to ensure that whatever I achieve for the Department will be in line with the Taoiseach's commitment to funding.  That is all I can say at the moment.</p> <p>  I will speak in a moment about the Cork event centre.  If I omit any issue, the Chairman should remind me of it.  The Chairman mentioned the War of Independence commemorations.  A number of different events will be held this year.  There will be events marking the anniversary of the death of Terence MacSwiney; the execution of Kevin Barry; the burning of Cork; the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, which provided for the formal partition of our country; and Bloody Sunday, which will be commemorated with the GAA.  There will also be an increased role for the local authorities.  The reason I mentioned those events is that when one compares the War of Independence commemorations with the 1916 commemorations, there were a significant number of State-led ceremonial events in 2016 and there will not be as many State-led events this year.  Funding is extremely important and is part of my budgetary negotiations.  We want to ensure that people have the resources to commemorate the events I outlined and other events in line with the expert advisory group.  Since 2016, there have not been as many significant State-led events.  That must be borne in mind when we are talking about resources.  Nevertheless, some of the commemorations I have outlined will need to be resourced.  Again, local authorities need to have money at their disposal to commemorate certain events.  </p> <p>  The development of the Cork event centre is very much in line with what the Government wants to achieve with regard to balanced regional development and sustainable urban development under Project Ireland 2040.  It is a project led by Cork City Council, which has selected a development company to progress the project.  This company has engaged an international events company - Live Nation - as the preferred operator.  The Taoiseach recently indicated that a new simplified process is being put in place to ensure certainty regarding the levels of funding and the delivery mechanisms for the centre, which will provide a substantial addition to the cultural offering in Cork city and county when it is complete.  Under new arrangements, the project is being transferred to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and discussions in that regard are under way.  We have not finalised this but high-level discussions are under way.  We are all very eager for the project to progress.  The Government is committed to investing in the Cork event centre, which would be of great significance to Cork and the country.  It is a 6,000-seat event centre that will offer a significant amount in terms of the arts in Cork.  As this has been such a complex issue, we are of the view that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is best placed to deal with infrastructure of that size.  Since I became a Minister, we have had major discussions regarding the Cork event centre and I believe the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be able to deliver it soon as possible.  I hope that is of assistance to the Chairman.</p></speech>

The difficulty with making public statements is that it is never advisable to do so when an issue falls between two stools.  Considerable progress has been made to get the project to this point in recent months.  Mr. Martin Fraser is the main driver behind this and has been of great assistance in liaising between the two Departments to ensure that we deliver this event centre.  I believe it will be done by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which is positive because my Department probably does not have the level of expertise required to deliver on a project like this.  In light of the various issues that have arisen in recent years, with which the Chairman is familiar, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is best placed to oversee the project. </p></speech>

This includes &euro;38.7 million allocated for current expenditure and &euro;15.4 million for capital expenditure.  Total gross heritage programme expenditure up to the period ending 30 June 2019 was just under &euro;10 million.  This figure had increased to just over &euro;13 million, as at 31 August 2019.  The rate of expenditure is slower than anticipated due to a number of timing issues which it is expected will be resolved before the year end.</p> <p>  Ireland's first national biodiversity conference took place at Dublin Castle in February of this year, and attracted more than 500 delegates and 4,500 live streamers.  Jointly organised by my Department and the Irish Forum on Natural Capital, the event brought together all key stakeholders from Government, public bodies, business and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to identify measures to help reverse biodiversity loss and implement the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017 to 2021.  The momentum generated by the conference was sustained by the publication of the interactive report from the conference by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department on 22 May last, which was International Day for Biological Diversity.  The report details the conference charter, Seeds for Nature, which includes a suite of commitments from 14 Departments, State agencies, businesses and NGOs that go above and beyond current work programmes to take action for nature and support the implementation of the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017 to 2021.</p> <p>  The work of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department continued apace in 2019, with responsibility for the ongoing management of some 87,000 ha across our national parks and nature reserve network.  Annually, these parks and reserves attract 4 million visitors and support a broad range of enterprise and employment opportunities for the communities in which they are located.  A new twinning arrangement has been established between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Parks Canada to connect Connemara National Park and the Marconi Station in Ireland, respectively, with Terra Nova National Park and Signal Hill national historical site in Newfoundland and Labrador.  The twinning arrangement will promote bilateral co-operation and exchanges for the mutual benefit of these national parks and historical sites, which have an important role in habitat protection and the conservation of iconic species, as well as in cultural heritage of both countries.  Connemara National Park is set for major development in the coming years, largely due to significant funding from F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the twinning arrangement.  This park has seen an increase in visitor numbers this year of nearly 5% from last year and the visitor centre is to remain open all year around for the first time ever this year in response to its increased popularity.  His Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales, again enjoyed the magnificence of our national parks this year when he visited Wicklow Mountains National Park in May.  Wicklow Mountains National Park is Ireland's largest national park, covering more than 22,000 ha of the Wicklow uplands, comprising mainly bog and heath with smaller areas of native woodland and mountain streams.</p> <p>  Our historical buildings and structures remain a vital part of our unique heritage.  While the primary responsibility to care for and maintain our built heritage structures rests with the owner, the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund funded by my Department and administered by local authorities, invest essential capital in our built heritage.  A total of 478 heritage projects across every county will benefit from a combined &euro;4.3 million under this year's historic structures fund, HSF, and built heritage investment scheme, BHIS.  The funding will support the owners and custodians of historical and protected structures as they carry out hundreds of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and conserve our historical built environment.  These projects provide vital support for local jobs in conservation, traditional skills and construction.</p> <p>  The Heritage Council is once again working in partnership with the Department to administer the historic towns initiative in 2019.  Six historic towns will share in &euro;1 million in capital funding in 2019, supporting programmes of heritage-led regeneration and bringing economic benefits to help historic towns to prosper through increased visitor numbers and decreased numbers of vacant buildings and commercial premises.  All of these initiatives will work towards ensuring that historical buildings remain alive and in use so that they are ultimately handed on to future generations in better condition than we found them.  I am happy to expand on any issues members wish to raise in respect of this programme area before my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, speaks about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands programme area.</p></speech>

I presume most members are aware that we had lengthy discussions on the Bill in the committee and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  In the absence of the Chairman, I chaired a committee meeting during which we voted in a democratic process.  Members had different views and everyone had an opportunity to speak.  The democratic vote of the committee was carried forward to the Seanad and then passed in the D&aacute;il.  In the small print somewhere, the Minister evidently had the overriding responsibility to sign off on the decision.  In fairness, it was the biggest slap in the face to democracy that could be given.  In rural areas in particular the verges and hedges on the roadside need to be cut.  We were not talking about hen farming.  Families are driving along roads.  Farmers and others are trying to cut overgrown areas on roads and crossroads with strimmers and hedge clippers.  I do not want to insult anybody but my assumption is that the Minister lives in an area where there is a lot of tar and concrete and few, if any, verges.  I live in a totally different area.  The process we went through was democratic, yet the Minister waited for a week into the summer break before changing a democratic decision with the stroke of a pen.  She kicked democracy out the window.  That was utterly irresponsible as far as I am concerned.  It put many lives at risk.  One has to live in a rural area to understand.  I do not believe in chopping and cutting in a ridiculous way.  I am talking about simple hedge-cutting.  We voted for it in the committee.  That was democracy at work.  Surely to God, out of respect for the committee, the Minister could have come back here a week before the summer recess and put her ideas before the committee and allowed some bit of democracy to work.  Perhaps she will elaborate on why she did not do so.  As far as I am concerned, she threw the whole Bill in the bin.  Verge cutting that was meant to take place on 1 August, which had been agreed here, has been put back to September, the same situation as we had previously.  That is putting lives at risk and causing damage to vehicles.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on why she made that decision.</p></speech>

What the Minister did to people in rural Ireland is totally unjustified.  One has to be there to understand it.  Hedges in the city and along the motorways are being cut every day of the week, even when there is no need to cut them.  One could land in Killarney or Mitchelstown and think one has travelled the country, but that is not the truth when one goes up little roads in Gneevgullia and back around Kilcummin and Lauragh.</p><p>Where there is no trace of the yellow line, it is because the hedge has grown out over it.  All we asked was that roadside hedges be cut.  I tabled an amendment which specified that they be cut all year round.  I have no gripe with the presence of birds, bees or anything like that, but they have the whole country in which to live.  We must put people first when it comes to maintaining roadsides.  We are telling people to walk and cycle, but they cannot do so because of overhanging hedges at that time of year.  I dropped my amendment which sought to have hedges cut all year round because it had come back to me that the Minister was in favour of cutting them in August.  I said to myself that that was a start, but, lo and behold, when we back went down to County Kerry the announcement came that she had forbidden the cutting of hedges in August.  That was greatly hurtful to people in rural Ireland.  Narrow roads, indeed all roads, are affected by lack of sight around turns.  Having the ability to see further around turns helps people's safety.  We want to know what will happen next year.  We brought the issue to the floor of the D&aacute;il at the behest of local authority members who had been inundated with requests from people who were seeking permission to cut hedges.  They were making the request because there was extensive growth at that time of year.  The rate of growth this year was worse than in any previous year.  Local authority figures were raising the issue for years, asking where was the promised Bill and what was happening with it.  I was here three years before we passed it, but here we are again, having achieved nothing after all of the debating and talking in council chambers, the D&aacute;il Chamber and at this committee.  </p><p> The Minister has let us down very badly.  She has especially let down the people of rural Ireland.  They have also been hurt by the hare licence issue and we are not going to take it lying down.  If she thinks that will the case, she is mistaken.  Stopping us from cutting hedges in August is the worst thing that has happened to rural Ireland.  The Minister promised us that she would allow it and we voted in favour of it here.  Farming organisations all around the country were watching us, but here we are, having done nothing.  In addition, we were stopped from burning in the month of March because it was stated there was no need to do it.  What I have noticed since I came to Dublin is-----</p></speech>

It rains 40 times more in County Kerry than here.  The Minister might not understand it, but there is a difference in weather conditions in County Kerry.

I did not navigate the Heritage Bill 2018 through various committees and the D&aacute;il and all other Stages just to bring forward regulations that would be discretionary and not use them, if it was possible to do so.  There was a two-year pilot scheme.  Times were different from when we passed the Heritage Bill 2018 and I could see if we could make the regulations.  I felt strongly that I was not in a position to do so.  I will outline the main reasons I could not make them.  To be clear, they will not be in force next year either because it is a two-year pilot scheme.  I state that for the Deputy now, rather than mislead him and have him come back to me, or whoever will be in this position, next year.</p><p>The first reason was the national biodiversity conference which I hosted, in conjunction with the Irish Forum on Natural Capital, in February this year.  It served to highlight threats to biodiversity.  The second reason was the seeds for nature initiative which arose from the national biodiversity conference.  It comprised a suite of commitments to nature and biodiversity which went beyond the respective organisations' work programmes to support, upscale and fast-track implementation of the national biodiversity action plan.</p><p>As we all know, we are living in a very different climate, if I can be excused for using the pun, from what we were living in.  I refer to what has come to our attention regarding the climate.  </p><p>Also of great significance in my decision-making was the summary of the report on the assessment of the intergovernmental panel on biodiversity and ecosystems by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.  It published its global assessment of the state of the world's biodiversity and ecosystems in March this year.  It was a stark assessment of the situation.  The report showed that, globally, nature was suffering an unprecedented rate of decline and that the rate of species' extinction was accelerating, as was the extinction of ecosystems.  It indicated, however, that it was not too late to make a difference.  There is a need to start without delay and with a commitment at local and global levels.  The report also contained a reference to hedgerows.  That was damning information that came to hand and I did not have it when the regulations were made.  </p><p>I also considered Ireland's sixth national report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.  The report was published in May and showed our rate of progress in achieving our targets.  In summary, partially effective progress was reported in achieving many of the national global targets but at an insufficient rate.  Some of the findings made in the report specifically deatl with hedgerows.  It stated the decline in &quot;bees, butterflies and other insects has largely resulted from the effect of monoculture and the drive to ever-higher levels of productivity, characterised also by a loss or neglect of hedgerows, farmland edges and scrub&quot;.  It went on to state &quot;biodiversity in this wider landscape has been impacted in recent decades by trends to land use intensification and a loss of mixed land uses.  This has led to the deliberate removal of habitats, for example, hedgerows and wetlands&quot;.  It also criticised some agricultural policy which did not support diverse hedgerows.  </p><p>The climate action plan 2019 was also something I took into account.  As the Deputy is aware, it was published in June and included wide-ranging measures.  I will not read the entire reference to hedgerows, but there is mention of the total area of hedgerows and non-forest woodland patches.  It also refers to improving hedgerow management and encouraging the planting of new hedgerows.  </p><p>I would like both Deputies to note that the decisions I made were welcomed by the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI.  It was documented on the<i>agriland.ie</i>website which carried a piece stating it was very much welcomed-----</p></speech>

They issued a press release to welcome that it was still possible to cut hedges for road safety reasons.  The Deputies know some of the reasons for the cutting of hedges along roads, lanes and boreens better than I do, as they represent rural areas.  One is overgrown hedges and fallen trees narrowing the carriageway, forcing traffic into oncoming traffic flow.  It is still possible to cut hedges in that instance.  It is also the case with briars and overhanging branches in forcing pedestrians and cyclists from road margins.  It is permissible in such circumstances to cut hedges, as it is in the case of overgrown hedges blocking or impeding egress from farm holdings or fields, hedges concealing entrances or road safety and directional signage.  It is also legal to cut hedges where they are concealing culverts or sharp bends.</p><p>On balance, despite the fact I did not extend the regulations and will not be in a position to do so next year, hedges can be cut for road safety reasons.  Section 8 of the Heritage Act 2018 and section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 were aligned in respect of the cutting of vegetation.  The latter section states: "The owner or occupier of land shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on the land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of a public road."  Even during the closed hedge-cutting period, therefore, a landowner can cut hedges where there is a road safety issue, as I outlined.  I could say a bit more but that might be sufficient.</p></speech>

The Minister should have returned to the committee to discuss it.  She should have shown some respect to those who were democratically elected by the people but she did not.  She overruled them.  She does not understand that while she lives in a land where there is tar, chip and plenty of concrete, we live in a rural environment and see the danger every day.  Given that mothers try to cut hedges to get their car onto the road safely and be able to see left and right, something is seriously wrong.  A grave injustice has been done to the people of rural Ireland.  I do not refer to people butchering fields but rather about cutting roadside verges.  It is a simple action that could have been taken on 1 August.  The significant growth causes grave concern to the people of my constituency, who have been let down terribly by the Minister.  Democracy in this country was kicked out the window.</p></speech>

The very minute the Minister issued her orders, the process stopped completely.  No council executive will put his or her job on the line or break the law for me or any other politician.  That is what is happening, as it has done over the years.  Councils will not even write letters to landowners until 1 September and will not even cut the hedges on junctions this year.  Anyone who cut hedges of his or her own accord was reported and enforcement officers were sent to stop them doing so.  We had hoped that because the law was in place from 1 August, we would be allowed to cut them from that date but the Minister prevented us from doing so.  I understand she is a Dublin Deputy but at the time, I called for her to be fired.  That is how strongly I feel.  I represent the people who have contacted me day in and day out.  I recognise the calls from the local authority members asking us to do something in order that the roadside hedges could be cut.</p> <p>  While it is true the legislation provides that dangerous places can be cut, one has to go through such a rigmarole and an accident has to happen before it will be cut.  That is what has happened for years and it is why the legislation was under debate in the previous D&aacute;il as it is in the current one.  Finally, even though the change was scheduled for August, the Minister deprived us of it with one stroke of a pen.  Now she has suggested they will be not cut next August.  If that is her attitude, I hope she is not Minister next July.  She is wronging the people of rural Ireland.  She indicated there is less scrub on farmland but what she does not realise about farmland is that people were fined and payments were cut because of scrub.  Some bureaucrat said the scrub must be cut and that payments will be lost if it is not.  Now the Minister has stated it is because people want to leave the scrub on the roadside.  She has no meas for the people but she has it for biodiversity and insects, including bees.  My priority is the people.  I have nothing against bees, birds or anything else but there is plenty of room for them in ditches.  I do not care what happens in the single line of a ditch or how many hedges there are.  I planted a hedge on my farm, and when I removed a ditch and realised that it was the wrong step to take, I put it back immediately.  The roadside, however, is different and we must keep it clear for the safety of the people.</p> <p>  Too many people are dying.  If they tipped home, they would not be allowed to have one drink because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was voted for, along with his lunacy of a Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, stated the Bill's purpose was to save lives.  He did not save one with that racket, however.  He caused people to tip home on ice and so on but now the Minister, Deputy Madigan, wants to hurt the people further by not allowing them to travel on the roads.  She wants to keep them off the roads altogether and says they must walk and get out of their cars.  They cannot even walk on the roads, however, because their eyes would be picked up by briars.  What is going on is terrible, as is what the Government is doing to rural Ireland.  The more quickly the Government is blown out, the better.  Every day I see one thing after another.  To stop the cutting of hedges, after we in the House had voted against such action, is criminal.  It is time for the Government to go and it should be gone.  The people are waiting for it around the corner and it deserves what it will get.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned some of them, including monoculture.  In the past 40 or 50 years, we have turned from the type of farming that included some tillage and sowing of gardens.</p><p>Not one farm in the country did not produce its own vegetables and potatoes.  On all farms land was tilled and they all had cattle.  There is no doubt that monoculture has done a lot of damage.</p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is right in that there is much more rough growth than there was, especially on farms in the west, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will be aware.  Sally and hazel grow on farms.  If someone has a farm of 10 ha which is quite sizable in some parts of south Connemara, the irony is that if he or she as much as overclaims on 0.3 ha, he or she will lose three times that acreage in the single farm payment.  The penalty is on three times the size of the land if it is more than a figure of 3%.  </p><p> Some of us are really concerned about the bees and the birds, particularly in the countryside.  Farmers are the protectors of the countryside and deeply concerned about nature.  I have not met many farmers who do not deeply care about it.  Farming grants and systems and market forces have forced them out of the type of farming in which they have traditionally engaged which was totally friendly towards all of the concerns expressed.</p><p> There was a meeting in our constituency which the Minister of State could not make because he was in Dublin.  It was attended by 203 people and about roads.  A constant complaint made at the meeting was about hedgecutting.  There was a recent report that indicated that seven of the worst accident black spots on national roads were on the N59 between Clifden and Leenaun.  I was talking to a local in Kylemore about the worst of all roads in the country and asked where exactly it was, trying to pinpoint the actual spot.  He told me and said that if the hedges were cut, it might ameliorate the problem.</p><p> I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister a problem in County Kerry, where I had a bad accident, as well as in counties Cork, Galway and so on.  When the summer comes and tourists arrive, they tend to drive closer to the middle of the road than we tend to do because we know of the dangers.  A significant peril is cars coming towards you, close to the middle of the road, because the drivers are trying to see around the corner and take a chance in moving out to the centre of the road, whereas we know that one's best chance is to stay in.  The big risk is hitting a pedestrian, but it is the lesser of two evils because at least one can pull out, but if there is a car in the middle of the road, one cannot pull in.</p><p> I want to be calm in what I am saying.  As far as I am concerned, what happened amounted to bad faith on the part of the Government.  I am not saying on the part of the Minister personally but the Government as a collective.  Under the Constitution, the Government is a collective, not a group of individuals.  I say it was bad faith on the part of the Government because the original proposal brought to the Seanad by the then Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on behalf of the Government led by Deputy Enda Kenny was, as the officials present will be able to confirm, to allow hedgecutting on eight grounds in the month of August.  Fianna F&aacute;il was not happy with the proposal in the Seanad and I drafted an amendment for Fianna F&aacute;il Senators that stated seven of them were unnecessary.  They were undesirable ecologically, but we should retain the ability to cut the outside hedge because road safety issues are involved.  I will come to why the Minister's solution will not work in practice.</p><p> If one checks the Official Report of the debate in the Seanad, one will see that the Government voted against the amendment but that all other parties voted for it.  The Bill passed through the Seanad with the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment.  It covered a square field and if it was of a different shape, one might take off even more.  It was also passed by the D&aacute;il.  We conducted the operation in good faith and our understanding was that the Government wanted to allow cutting on eight sides but that we had stopped it from doing so, changing the number of grounds to one, on which there was consensus in the D&aacute;il where I do not think the Government opposed it.  I think there was a reasonable expectation that the regulations would be implemented.  The biodiversity groups which were not happy about it from the beginning then managed to persuade the Minister to ignore the clear understanding and consensus reached in the Oireachtas.  The Bill having been passed, everyone understood the Minister would bring forward regulations, but now she has undermined it again, which amounts to very sharp practice by the Government.  Those who had been in government and knew the history should have pointed this out because the Minister might not have been aware of it.  Unlike us, she had not sat through it all.</p><p> What is the difference in what the Minister has told us people can do?  I read it as meaning I can cut any hedge I want to in Cornamona where the roads are very narrow and there are many corners.  I defy anybody to win a court case against me.  Certainly, in summer time if one cuts the outside of a hedge on the boreen up to my house, nobody will interfere because there is no part of it that does not have a bend.</p></speech>

The real problem is that there are well funded and powerful ecological groups.  It is similar to the problem encountered with hillwalking, where a hillwalker would not win a court case after breaking his or her neck have fallen on a slippery rock that had been there since Adam and Eve.  However, the landowner might have to defend a case that he or she would inevitably win but which would take up a year or two of his or her life, not to mention the worry, the concern, the need to pay barristers and so on.  Similarly, in this case I foresee that if people start to cut hedges under the qualified exemptions for which the Minister has provided - a person would have to prove in each individual case that it was justified - many farmers will be afraid of litigation and say that while a road is dangerous, they will not take the risk and cut the hedge.</p> <p>  Since many farmers with small landholdings do not have agricultural machinery, hedgecutting is done by the county council.  Galway County Council is strong on this issue, as the Minister of State can explain to the Minister.  Whatever chance an individual might have of getting away with cutting a hedge and not having a voluntary group taking him or her to court, the reality is that councils will not take the chance when commissioning cutting.  If Galway County Council was to use all of the regulations the Minister has given us with the exemptions and decide to start cutting hedges on all of the twisty roads that are dangerous - there are few straight roads where we live - it would quickly receive a writ.</p><p>The theory of that is fine.  The practice is non-applicable and, therefore, it does not hold up.</p><p> Can I also say-----</p></speech>

In relation to burning, those of us who live in rural areas have tried to explain this time and again.  Most accidental burning of mountains happens in April, May and June during the dry weather.  When one does not have controlled burning or control of overgrown vegetation, it becomes woody and then it is like a tinderbox when one gets into April, May and June.  One will not burn vegetation in February.  It is hard enough to do it in March.  By not agreeing to the extension that was agreed in good faith by the Oireachtas, what the Minister has done is lightly lit and burnt much more hills than she would have done if she had heeded the advice of those who know what has been happening for 200 years on the hills.  There has always been burning, but one of the problems is, because of destocking of sheep, there is much more wood growing and heather growing into woody heather in the hills and it is much more likely to go up in flames.  By not controlling this - controlled burning requires permission and one must do it in certain ways - the Minister will lose more hillside this way than she would have if we had applied the regulation and those who say otherwise do not understand the issue.</p></speech>

It was helpful to hear all of them collectively on this subject.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is correct.  Originally, it was a broader proposal but the original Bill did not align the road safety legislation with the Wildlife Acts.  As the Deputy will be aware, that was a Government amendment.  There is no good faith breach here.  There is no sharp practice.  I take exception to that and to the Deputy stating that democracy is not at work on the basis that I had the discretion to make these regulations or not.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  From the Government's perspective, there are people in my own party who very much wanted these regulations to go ahead and it is not a decision that I made lightly.  However, we were in a different situation than we were when the Bill was initiated in 2016.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the rate of biodiversity decline is frightening.  I have outlined all of these reasons to the Deputy.  We are the last generation that can do anything about it and I felt a responsibility in relation to that.  I was given the power to make these regulations and I had to make that decision.  As I said, I did not do it lightly.  I have heard everybody's concerns but if there are genuine agricultural reasons as well, one can still cut the hedges.</p> <p>  It may be of assistance - I am trying to see what we could possibly do to make it a little easier because I can hear vividly the frustrations of the Deputy's experience as a rural Deputy and that of his constituents - if we write to the local authorities and clarify the position from our perspective.  It may be advisable, perhaps in conjunction with the relevant local authority, to remove hedgerows on a bad bend which might improve visibility and reduce risk of accident, in any event, on national roads.</p></speech>

On the basis of the information from Met &Eacute;ireann's data, there was a very dry area during the six-month period when the burning of vegetation could have been undertaken under the law and it would not have precluded landowners from burning vegetation.  Therefore, the existing provisions in the Wildlife Acts on burning remained in force for March of this year.  That was the position in relation to burning, again, for different reasons.</p> <p>  Part of being a Minister is making decisions.  It would have been easier for me to extend the regulations and I would not have had to deal with people having issues in relation to it.  As I said, people in my own party wanted the regulations extended but it is not something that I was in a position, or minded, to do.  I still stand by my decision.  I have stated clearly that one can still cut the hedges for road safety reasons.  I will write to the local authorities - that may assist and it might be helpful - and look at other ways that we might try and minimise the difficulties that the Deputies' constituents are having.

We heard in recent days about the National Biodiversity Data Centre which, I am sure, feeds into much of the Minister's research in terms of Government policy.  As the committee will be aware, the staff there are coming to the end of their contracts and do not seem to have any security in terms of where they or their organisation will be beyond 2019.  The Government makes sweeping comments in support of biodiversity.  However, I would assume that this would be an important agency for the Government's policy in the future.  I wonder whether the Minister could comment on where she sees the National Biodiversity Data Centre and its staff being in 2020 and beyond.</p></speech>

We have approximately &euro;60 million under the Project Ireland 2040 plan going specifically into biodiversity.  As I said, I held the first biodiversity conference this year and we had 40 seeds of nature which was stemming from that.  There are a number of biodiversity initiatives that we are currently implementing.</p> <p>  In relation to the data centre, it is not an agency.  It is a name given to a programme which was established by the Heritage Council in 2006.  It addressed the need identified by the council that data on Ireland's biodiversity be collected, recorded and fully accessible to the public.  The programme has been operating under two publicly-tendered contracts entered into between the council and Compass Informatics, which is a private company.  The team working on biodiversity data collection are employees of Compass Informatics, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tracsis plc.</p><p>The Heritage Council is currently finalising a contract extension with Compass Informatics to collect biodiversity data into 2020.  Concurrently, a review is being undertaken by the council and this is examining the governance and operating and financial models underpinning this work.  The outcome of that review will inform the next request for tender.  However, like all public contracts, this work is subject to public procurement rules.  The Heritage Council's contract with Compass Informatics has been very important in the collection of biodiversity data for public policymaking and decision-making.  Under the terms of its contract, the data collected are the intellectual property of the Heritage Council.  The Heritage Council is the owner of the name, the National Biodiversity Data Centre, and rents the property in which the team works, so it is not a corporate entity, nor does it have a board or employees, nor, indeed, a bank account. </p></speech>

With regard to hedge cutting, I welcome the Minister's statement that councils can cut hedges all year round as a safety measure, whether in regard to road bends or otherwise.  Is that subject to a notifiable action or must the councils to go through the National Parks and Wildlife Service?  Has a council to fill up a form and send it off, stating that, for example, a bend on road R361 has to be done, or if the council does it as a safety measure, can it do it without someone from the National Parks and Wildlife Service being over-enthusiastic and bringing it to court, as we saw in a recent case?</p> <p>  On the turf compensation scheme, will the Minister give us a update on what money is still owed?  Senator Hopkins touched on an issue whereby the different farming organisations have liaised with Mr. Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; and with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in regard to a burden on their property.  They are looking for a fund in the budget and I understand they are talking about &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million.  Does the Minister envisage such a fund in this budget to resolve those issues?  I know she is meeting tomorrow with the farming organisations.</p> <p>  A report on conservation status has gone to Europe.  I see that certain things have reached favourable conservation status and, in fairness, the picture may be looking better than some people, in particular environmentalists, try to make it out to be.  The work that is being done by rural communities around the country should be acknowledged. </p></speech>

Some 95% of this funding is used to support initiatives by the two North-South implementation bodies, An Foras Teanga, which comprises Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, and Waterways Ireland.  These are also subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Total gross programme expenditure under North-South co-operation up to the period ending 30 June 2019 was just over &euro;19 million, representing 50% of the 2019 programme allocation.  This expenditure had increased to &euro;25.3 million as at 31 August 2019.</p> <p>  Waterways Ireland continues to focus on delivering its core activities and maintaining front-line services.  In addition to the organisation&rsquo;s statutory function, Waterways Ireland has a strong community and business outreach and partnership policy which it continues to implement in 2019.  As part of this policy, Waterways Ireland continues to engage with and deliver services for communities adjacent to the waterways to create social, recreational, health and economic benefits.  I am happy to expand on any issues members would like to raise.</p></speech>

They give their time and, in addition to feeding and keeping the youngsters, they take care of them and are responsible for them.  They have done a wonderful job over the years.  It has been brought to my attention, however, that they are getting significantly less in remuneration now than they were getting ten years ago.  That is not satisfactory.  I want that issue to be addressed.  If we want to enhance, improve and increase the number of children or people speaking Irish, these are the people to whom we look.  They are a vital cog in the wheel.  I ask the Minister of State - who is from the Gaeltacht himself and on whom I am depending in this matter - to follow up on the bean an t&iacute; issue because they have made a wonderful contribution in the past and we want them to continue doing so.</p> <p>  People in Gaeltacht areas consistently highlight the fact that they receive less funding and that fewer industry projects are directed their way.  They say that they do not get the same recognition as other areas and that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta funding has been cut drastically.  These cuts began in the decline after the boom years, but the money has not been restored since.  They are asking for proper recognition and attention given that the country is supposed to be turning around, even though there seems to be less and less money available for any area at which I look.  They gave me figures but I do not have them with me now.  They can vouch for the fact that they are being left behind.  Built-up areas such as cities and bigger towns seem to find it easier to get funding than the rural Gaeltacht areas on which we depend for the retention of the Irish language part of our culture.  If those people do not have the same opportunities as those in the rest of the country, they are going to disappear.  </p></speech>

I am blessed that there are eight islands off my own constituency of Cork South-West.  They are very active islands and, in fairness, they get a lot of support.  I will not discredit any of the positive works going on there.  We have Bere Island, Dursey, Whiddy, Sherkin, Cape Clear, Long Island and Heir Island.  I have often mentioned Sherkin and Bere Island in here, perhaps more than most.  People are worried out there.  I go to meetings on the island and the first thing people are worried about is social housing.  To start a new home, people now have to leave the island.  I hope to be corrected, but I have not seen any funding set aside for social housing for people who need homes and who want to live on the islands in west Cork and start off their lives there.</p> <p>  That connects to the next issue, which is a long-running issue, that of chaperones for the school runs, particularly from Sherkin Island.  It is the same with every other island as well.  Mothers and fathers are trying to leave the island for work in the morning.  They are then often caught out when the children have to go to school.  Where the school on the island has been closed, somebody has to then accompany them.  There was a verbal agreement that something would be done in respect of Sherkin.  I am open to correction, but I do not think that has happened.  </p> <p>  I will now refer to the medical services.  People on the islands have worries.  Islands such as Bere Island have significant populations.  There is a nurse there but people are worried that this nurse is being gradually withdrawn and brought back to the mainland, leaving those on the island in a very vulnerable state.  People can fall ill overnight.  In many cases the nurse could cater for those needs rather than having to get to mainland, a trip which can, in bad weather, involve the emergency services.  </p> <p>  The island people are very proud to live on the island but they are worried and concerned that their futures may be dwindling away.  Populations are falling.  That can be seen.  In saying that, services are improving to a degree.  One can look to the ferry service on Whiddy Island, run by Tim O'Leary.  That is a fabulous set-up.  A lot of good work is being undertaken by individuals but there are still concerns.  I hope the interdepartmental committee on islands will focus on the issues of social housing, chaperones, and medical services.</p></speech>

We recently increased the length of the season, which had been pretty much confined to the summer and the off-school period.  We now have schemes through the winter period to improve opportunities.  University College Cork will have a semester programme where the mn&aacute; t&iacute; from Kerry will take in students.  That has extended the season.  Future plans for funding for the mn&aacute; t&iacute; will be kept under consideration where funding is available.  I agree the mn&aacute; t&iacute; do an important job.</p> <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has many ambitious and worthwhile plans and we are constantly seeking funding for the agency.  At every opportunity in recent years where there has been spare money in the Roinn towards the end of the year, we have diverted it towards &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  There are many examples of that.  For example, in 2016, there was an additional capital application of &euro;2.4 million arising from savings made elsewhere.  Additional funding of &euro;2.27 million was provide in 2017 and an addition &euro;638,000 was provided in 2018.  In addition, an underspend of &euro;700,000 was carried forward into 2019.  Where there are opportunities to push money towards &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, we are taking them.  We have increased the overall capital funding from &euro;6 million in 2011 to &euro;9.7 million in 2019.  We hope to be able to provide funding of &euro;12 million, as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has asked, in the coming years to place it on a more sustainable footing and enable it to plan.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has a critical role in the Gaeltacht areas.  It provides employment where there would be very little otherwise.  We continue to provide funding opportunities.  We will know more about the 2020 figures next week.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins mentioned the interdepartmental committee, which met for the first time on 24 September.  Representatives of all Departments were in attendance.  I have asked each Department to come back within three weeks with its plans.  Some of them have comprehensive plans.  For example, the Deputy noted that the HSE may have a plan for the islands.  Other Departments have engagement with islands in other areas.  For example, the Department of Education and Skills has policies in place on island schools, including the pupil-teacher ratio.  I have asked all Department to come back within three weeks with a view to preparing a draft policy we can put out to public consultation.  I assure the Deputy that we will engage with all islands and officials will travel to all islands in the coming months to engage with communities on the draft policy and ask for their suggestions.  I hope we will then finalise the process with the Department towards the end of the year or early next year.  That is an important area.</p> <p>  We asked all Departments to briefly outline their plans and their work on the various issues.  I raised the social housing issues to which the Deputy referred.  This is a big problem on islands.  As we know, getting one family to stay on or move to a small island can make a major difference in ensuring the future of that island.  It is even better to get two families with children who will attend the island schools.  Pupil numbers have fallen on certain islands and increased on others.  It depends on the proximity to the coastline and the overall size of the island.  There are challenges, of which we are conscious.  The last time we had an all-of-Government plan for the islands was in 1997.  That is why we agreed to set up this interdepartmental committee, at the request of the islanders.  More important will be ensuring that funding matches the islands policy and the action plan that might develop from it.  That will probably be a matter for the next Government, whoever that might be.  I agree with the Deputy in regard to nursing and social housing that there are requirements and unique challenges in the island communities.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, since the primary school on Sherkin Island closed, the Department has provided funding for an additional ferry service in the morning to facilitate the island children.  A number of islanders requested changes to the ferry timetable and this request was agreed to.  The Department met the ferry operator and island representatives about these changes and a new timetable has been agreed.  We have not been able to come to a conclusion on the proposal for a chaperone, although I raised the matter again at the interdepartmental committee last week with the Department of Education and Skills.  I have said on a few occasions that the two Departments must find a solution, which may mean either Department or both Departments providing funding to Cork County Council to provide a chaperone.  It is not something that will set a precedent because other schools on islands will not have a daily ferry in operation as they are too far from the mainland.  The circumstances on Sherkin Island were unique given the proximity of Baltimore and the decision by parents to start bringing children to Baltimore in any event.  The Departments need to find a solution, perhaps in conjunction with Cork County Council.</p> <p>  Tagra&iacute;m do na ceisteanna a chuir an Cathaoirleach agus freagr&oacute;idh m&eacute; an ceann mar gheall ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire.

In 2008, the agency received funding of &euro;25 million.  Funding is still a long way off where it was a little over ten years.</p> <p>  On Foras na Gaeilge, since 2014 there has been a 5% reduction of funding for the Irish language sector and its organisations.  These two organisations support many other organisations.  Conradh na Gaeilge and the Gaelscoileanna rely on funding from Foras na Gaeilge.  There is a feeling that the sector is not recovering to the same extent as many other sectors, not only in terms of the Department but across Government as a whole.</p></speech>

We are always reluctant to talk about 2008 figures as a benchmark because spending at that time was unsustainable.  There are ongoing budgetary negotiations.  I formally delegated formally to the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, the function of representing the Gaeltacht and the islands.  I am also doing a significant amount of work in policy areas throughout the Department.  For example, with Creative Ireland, we are dealing with Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta and having arts for the Gaeltacht looked at for children.  There is a cl&aacute;r teic space for children in the Irish language and there are Irish language officers, through the auspices of Creative Ireland, now in the local authorities on the cultural teams.  I note and accept the points the Chairman makes.</p></speech>

I have submitted my statement and will take it as read.  As members will see from my statement, I am a native of County Clare and I have worked for most of my career in the Guinness Peat Aviation Group, GPA, in Shannon so I have Shannon in my heart.  When the airports were separated in 2012, I was appointed chairman of the Shannon Airport Authority in 2013 pending the establishment of the Shannon Group in 2014.  Shannon Group put together the independent Shannon Airport and combined it with the restructured Shannon Development, which meant we got a property portfolio primarily composed of the Shannon free zone and a heritage portfolio added.</p> <p>  I set out the position at the time of the separation of the airports in my statement.  At the time, passenger numbers had been dwindling and had been negative from 2006 to 2012.  Addressing that was, therefore, an immediate priority.  The infrastructure at the airport required significant work and expenditure as there had been a history of underinvestment.  Likewise, there had been material underinvestment in the property portfolio in the Shannon free zone.  The occupancy rate was 43% and many of the buildings were not fit for purpose.  The Shannon Heritage portfolio also required significant investment.  </p> <p>  I have set out the current position in my statement.  We have increased passenger numbers by 34% and invested &euro;100 million in the group since 2014 to bring things to where they should be and drive the group forward.  We have stabilised and grown the financial position of the group and it is now in a much stronger position.  We have invested a great deal of time and effort in that.</p> <p>  I will focus on the fact that this year is very challenging primarily because of the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jet aircraft on health and safety grounds.  This has impacted us.  We have lost 13 weekly flights, equating to 120,000 passengers, this year, which is a significant number for a company like the Shannon Group.  It means our passenger numbers will be down this year.  We have stated there is nothing we can do about this.  We also lost Air Canada, which equates to about 25,000 passengers.  We face a very challenging situation, including as a result of Brexit, and I would like to discuss how we will deal with those challenges.  We are doing everything we can, working with all the Departments to be Brexit fit and Brexit ready, but who knows what Brexit is at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.1281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Cawley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019100200002#C00900"><p>It is hard to believe it is five years since I was last before this committee.  A number of familiar faces are here, including Senator O'Mahony.  I am delighted to be back.  In the five years since I took over as chair of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and I assure the committee that this is entirely a coincidence, revenue from foreign tourists has grown by 78%.  I do not take any personal credit for that.  I just want to review where we are.  The number of foreign visitors has reached almost 10 million.  Revenue from domestic holidaymakers and holidaymakers from Northern Ireland grew by 26% in that period.  Revenue from business tourism - conference and incentive business which is critical for us because these visitors come back as genuine tourists if they have a good experience - increased by 90% in the past five years.  In some parts of the country, we are having what one would class as high-class problems in terms of capacity restraints and constraints and we are working through those as well.</p><p>Tourism is the biggest industry in this country in terms of employment.  It supports 260,000 jobs.  Unfortunately, it is viewed in some sectors as the poor relation as a career choice for school leavers.  We are working diligently to improve its profile.  It is a service industry and, ultimately, we will be judged on the quality of the people we have and the quality of the welcome and service they give our visitors.  We have to fix that problem in the long term and F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working strenuously with career guidance teachers at second level and third level institutions to provide courses that will be attractive.  For example, we are focusing on the entrepreneurial aspect of setting up one's own business for young people who may have a hobby in activities or hospitality.  We are fostering that as possibly another way of making the career an attractive option for them when they leave school or college.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that 23 cent of every euro a visitor spends goes to the Exchequer.  It is a financially intensive revenue stream as far as the activity is concerned.  There is hardly another industry that has a corresponding financial or labour intensive profile.  The industry now generates &euro;8 billion in revenue and, as I said, supports 260,000 jobs.  Last year, 2018, was a record year for Irish tourism with 9.6 million overseas visitors.  We expect it to be close to 10 million in the current year even though, as Rose Hynes said, there was a reduction at Shannon Airport.  There has been an increase in Dublin Airport but it is less than was expected, also because of the Boeing 737 MAX situation.  We would have expected it to surpass 10 million this year but, we will probably be just short of it.  Hopefully, next year will be a further record year.<br/><br/>We support the industry not just financially but in many different ways.  We have an extensive capital grants scheme of both large and small grants.  I will talk further about that momentarily and give the committee some examples of what we have been doing.  We also support the industry through management education.  We have hundreds of courses and put 25,000 people in the industry through courses every year.  They range from revenue management for hotels and restaurants to concierge services to tourist guides, for whom we have given certification qualifications to elevate the status of that profession within the industry.<br/><br/>Everybody who comes to Ireland tells us, and this is a little like motherhood and apple pie but we should never lose sight of it, that our people are the most important resource we have.  The interaction with our people gives us a major competitive advantage over competing countries.  People obviously do not come to Ireland for the weather, although it is a bonus when it is good, but for the welcome, the activities and, above all, the interaction with the people.  We should never lose that.  It is something that is innate in us but it is also something that can be taught.  That is why we spend so much time educating people about their interaction with people, the knowledge they bring, the stories they tell and the legacy of what we have to offer to people who are essentially looking for authentic experiences.  There are thousands of them in this country and we must harness them and present them well.  That is what F&aacute;ilte Ireland does.<br/><br/>Some of the strategic investments and initiatives we have carried out between 2015 and 2019 are worth mentioning.  Everybody is familiar with the Wild Atlantic Way and the brand in the east of the country, Ireland's Ancient East.  These capture the activities that are the focus.  Our research tells us that foreign visitors are not interested in visiting a country <i>per se</i>, but in what they can do, see and experience in a country.  The brands we have made capture that.  The &quot;Wild&quot; in respect of the Atlantic gives a true picture of an authentic experience which walkers, bikers and other outdoors people want to experience.  Similarly, Ireland's Ancient East, built principally on the concept of ancient in Dunboyne, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Newgrange down to the castles and medieval buildings in places such as Kilkenny, Waterford and so forth, has been an area we have tried to explore and combine with storytelling, which is a very important part of it.  One must bring the bricks and mortar to life with good storytelling.  Anybody who has taken a guided tour of Kilkenny Castle, for example, will know what a phenomenal experience it is, in contrast to just wandering around it alone.  That is good but it is not as good as being shown around and told the stories related to it.<br/><br/>We have instituted another brand, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  It is essentially on the Shannon and centred in Athlone.  It has unique characteristics that attract both domestic and foreign visitors.  We have instituted the Taste the Island programme this autumn.  One of the key objectives of F&aacute;ilte Ireland is to extend the season.  For many businesses in rural Ireland, the season lasts 12 weeks, which is too short to run a viable business.  They are supported by family members who are often not being paid an economic wage.  We must extend that season.  Taste the Island is one of the big initiatives to extend it.  It is running until the end of November.  In addition, we have instituted a new Hallowe'en festival called P&uacute;ca, which is starting in the Meath and Louth region at Hallowe'en.  Similarly, the Bram Stoker Festival was a new festival at that time of the year in Dublin.  It has been phenomenally successful.  We will support, and bias our expenditure towards, regionality and seasonality.  Dublin is the centrepiece for the country, but it needs less support than other parts of the country.  Obviously, we will continue to develop it.<br/><br/>We have an apprentice chef programme.  We also have a China ready programme.  There are over 130,000 visitors from China, both those based in Europe and those who have come on direct flights and indirectly via London and other hubs in Europe.  It is a growing tourism market.  It is the biggest outbound tourism market in the world and it is a growing one for Ireland.  We must be ready for Chinese visitors.  They have particular requirements - dietary, protocol and customer behaviour, frankly - that some people in the sector have found difficult, but we cannot ignore the requirements of the customer.  We are getting people fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese.  We are building up an expertise in the country that will be able to give a pleasurable experience to the customer.  Customers will go home and, hopefully, generate a multiple number more visits as access improves and the reputation of Ireland spreads in that important market.<br/><br/>Obviously, our biggest market continues to be Britain.  Everybody is aware of the threat there.  We see the threat from Northern Ireland already arising in Donegal and the Border counties.  Access from Britain is slightly up this year so we are not too worried about tourism from Britain in the current year.  The growth will be flat to modest.  However, next year it may be down.  The number of people who drive from Northern Ireland to Donegal, where traditionally there has been a big influx of people in the holiday season, is significantly down this year, particularly with the burden of a weaker currency.  Donegal and the north west is an area we have been trying to promote.  While it had a number of good years, this year is the first in which it will see a decline.<br/><br/>As regards the future, I mentioned that the key issues for us are regionality and spreading the good news, as it were.  There was a report on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning about the increased concentration of air access into this country through Dublin Airport.  It was less than 80% and has now grown to 85% of the people who come into this country by air.  Some 91% of tourists who come to this country from abroad, apart from Northern Ireland, come by air.  It is a critical issue for us.  It is successful for Dublin, but it is a challenge for the rest of the country because we need to get people out there and staying overnight there.<br/><br/>What breaks my heart is to see people taking day trips from O'Connell Street to the Cliffs of Moher and then returning.  It is a bad experience.  They leave at 6 a.m., spend a couple of hours there and do not leave any real added value.  There are hotels in Ennis and other places in Clare, charging half the price of what these people are being charged in Dublin, that could do with the business.  We are working diligently with inbound tour operators to build a package.  One cannot have the sole attraction of the Cliffs of Moher but a general proposition that will keep people there for the full day or a couple of days.  We are working on that but it is not something that will be fixed overnight.</p><p>We are spending a lot of money on our large capital and small capital grant schemes.  We have given grants to every single county, although not by design when we invited applications.  There are some phenomenally successful projects.  Last week the authority held a meeting in Kylemore Abbey which was a school up to approximately 20 or 25 years ago.  It now attracts 550,000 paid visitors every year, which is a phenomenal number.  It is very well managed which is the key to its success.  It is very well marketed abroad.  We have twice given grants to it and are delighted by the outcome of our support and its efforts.</p><p> I have outlined our priorities.  There are plans for a variety of visitor experience development plans in key towns.  We are developing a master plan for the River Shannon, for example, as well as a for number of other regions, with which we will incentivise people through grants to develop in the way we believe is appropriate for tourism and tourists want.</p><p> I pay tribute to the staff of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Members know that I originally came from Ryanair, an organisation that has had an interesting relationship with the public sector.  I had no previous interaction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but I have found its staff to be superb.  They are enthusiastic, energetic and thoroughly professional.  They have only one thing in mind, that is, to develop a sustainable tourism product, grow employment and use tourism as a vehicle for increased economic and social development across the country.  I commend the staff.  It is a privilege for me to work with them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.1285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019100200002#E00300"><p>I thank committee members.  I am accompanied by Ms Mary Mosse, a director of the Port of Waterford and a member of the audit and risk committee, and Captain Darren Doyle, harbour master of the port.  I was appointed chairman of the board of the Port of Waterford in October 2014 and came before the Oireachtas committee in September of that year.  I welcome the opportunity to update the committee on progress and developments at the port in the intervening five years.</p> <p>  The main focus of the board when I was first appointed was on recruiting a new chief executive, stabilising and bolstering the finances and attracting container services to address the requirements of local exporters such as Dawn Meats and Glanbia.  This has been achieved owing to the efforts of a committed and performing board, management and staff.  The management team, led by Mr. Frank Ronan who was recruited at the end of 2015, provides strong commercially focused leadership for the business.  Its work is characterised by honesty and openness, which is highly appropriate and effective.  The Port of Waterford is open and transparent in its dealings with shareholders, stakeholders and staff.</p> <p>  The Port of Waterford, a tier 2 port, is poised to increase its share of the Irish market owing to its proximity to the Continent and available capacity.  This bodes well for the resurgence of the south-east region which, as we know, was badly hit by the recession.  To summarise the performance of the port company in the past five years, bulk tonnage has increased by 52% and container traffic by 22%.  Prior to the recession, our workforce stood at 56.  The figure went as low as 30 before increasing in the past five years to 37.  The accounting pension deficit has been reduced by over &euro;4 million, from &euro;5.5 to &euro;1.2 million, while annual revenues have increased by 29% to &euro;7.9 million and profits by 71% to &euro;2.2 million.  I am pleased to say that in 2019 the company paid the first ever dividend in its 200-year history to the Exchequer.  This has been achieved by a clear business strategy as set out in our rolling five-year corporate plan.  It has also been helped by providing increased depths to allow larger ships to come up the River Suir, investing in port infrastructure and building very good relationships with our business partners in the region.</p> <p>  Deputies may be aware of the new deep sea container feeder service owing to media coverage in July.  This really is a game changer for the port and its stakeholders.  For example, Glanbia processes and manufactures milk powder beside the port at Belview which is exported to China, Africa and the United States.  It can now be exported from the Port of Waterford instead of being transported to Cork or Dublin.  As a Brexit deadlock looms closer, the Port of Waterford has the capacity to accommodate any continental unitised traffic that is looking to divert from landbridge routes.  It is prepared to play a vital role in mitigating any negative impact on the economy arising from Brexit.</p> <p>  In line with ports policy, the Port of Waterford has published its master plan to 2044.  The plan will facilitate our mission to provide infrastructure and services to enable trade and economic development in the region.  It follows significant investment in a hydrodynamic model of the Waterford estuary, the first such survey in 40 years and which has given a scientific foundation to the projects proposed to improve access for shipping on the River Suir.  We can no longer ignore the consequences of failing to reduce carbon emissions and our reliance on fossil fuels.  We owe it to future generations to reduce our energy usage and environmental emissions in general.  In Waterford we have employed pool transport solutions, using electric vehicles, where possible.  We are keen to promote the rail link which offers significant reductions in the carbon footprint in moving cargo by road.</p> <p>  The pension deficit at the Port of Waterford at one point reached &euro;10.5 million.  However, it has been reduced to &euro;1.5 million.  It is the board's intention that on completion of the sale of the north quays to the council in Waterford this year, the deficit will be cleared in full by year-end.  Freed from this onerous financial burden, the Port of Waterford will be poised to generate cash for investment in facilities required to cope with projected future traffic flows, while continuing to generate a return for the Exchequer.  The port has readied land holdings for port-related development, encouraging stakeholder investment in the port estate.  Mindful of wider obligations, the board has been keen to co-operate with Waterford City and County Council in urban regeneration by disposing of its holdings on the north quays.  This project is critical for the future development of Waterford and the south east.  Investment has been made in the rebranding of the port, plant and equipment, the maintenance of port infrastructure, systems and new technology to ensure the highest quality of service for our customers.</p> <p>  We are mindful of our obligations in terms of governance.  Much of our time is spent in ensuring compliance with relevant codes and directives which promote proper governance of the company on behalf of the Minister and citizens.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, for his support during my tenure and that of his staff in the maritime transport section.  I am grateful to him for restoring the board to full strength with the filling of two vacant director positions this year and for my reappointment which I am pleased to accept.  I am very pleased by what has been achieved at the Port of Waterford and look forward to further progress in the next three years as chairman.</p></speech>

The separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority has been a success and the presentation indicates the progress that has been made.  I will focus on the challenges mentioned by Ms Hynes resulting from a downturn caused by Norwegian Air operations.</p><p>What figures does Ms Hynes project for passenger numbers in 2019?  How much lower is it than the figures for 2018 or 2017?  Does she think Shannon can work through this?  What assistance or help is needed to work through this?  As Mr. Cawley said in his presentation, tourism is extremely important in the regions.  Will Ms Hynes illustrate the numbers, how much they will go down by, if it can be worked through and the solution to continue to grow the numbers in Shannon?</p><p> I welcome Mr. Cawley back.  He does not want to claim the credit for all of the increase in tourist numbers but he obviously did not hinder it either, so I offer my compliments on that.  To focus on the challenges, Mr. Cawley mentioned the importance of the regions and of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  All of that is helping because it is crucial to diversify tourism.  In many ways, there is a connection between the airports and tourism.  As somebody from the west of Ireland, I note Ireland West Airport Knock is very important in bringing tourists to the region.  The witnesses mentioned day trips to the Cliffs of Moher.  I was living proof of that last week.  I could hardly get a hotel room in Dublin because the city was packed out with conferences all week, which is great.  We have just got through the first year of VAT on tourism having gone back up from 9% to 13.5%.  What effect do the witnesses think that has had?  The accommodation prices in major urban centres have increased again.  As the witnesses say, tourism is the biggest employer in Ireland and it would be a pity if we killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  Will the witnesses expand on the ability to spread tourism to the regions?  There has been significant success with the Wild Atlantic Way and so on.  Companies are seeing a better lifestyle in the regions too, so it is not just affecting tourism.  Connectivity is important.</p><p> I welcome Mr. Whelan back.  Much progress has been made in the Port of Waterford and Mr. Whelan has mentioned good news.  As I come from the west of Ireland, I am interested in the issue of freight transport.  Freight transport from Coca-Cola in the west ceased in 2018.  I know that has been an issue.  What is the up-to-date position on that?  We are now onto the question of climate change and emissions.  My understanding is that freight transport from the west of Ireland had to come to Dublin and then go to Waterford.  Was that the issue?  I know the western rail corridor and the possibility of direct freight transport is of interest with regard to both climate change and efficiency.  Mr. Whelan might provide an update on that.  Mr. Whelan made a point about the Port of Waterford being able to accommodate new arrangements depending on how Brexit pans out.  Will he expand on the potential for the port?  The European Commissioner for transport was here a number of years ago and suggested that the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, support and strategy was not to be revisited until 2023.  I believe there has been a change in that regard.  Will changes to connectivity affect the port?</p><p> I thank the witnesses and wish them the best of luck in their new appointments.  There are many challenges but they have shown over the past five years that there are opportunities too.  Well done to them for facing up to the challenges.</p></speech>

We have proven by getting Norwegian Air and the additional 13 transatlantic flights that there is a market for those.  I am therefore confident that we will get them back, although we cannot get them back overnight.  The Senator asked about passenger numbers.  We have already stated that if we lose 13 weekly flights from Norwegian Air, that would be 120,000 passengers, and another 125,000 passengers from Air Canada, we would be down by between 6% and 8% on last year's numbers.</p></speech>

Norwegian Air announced this coming up to the summer.  The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft were grounded in March of this year.  It was hoped that that problem would be solved and kept moving along in that way.  As summer approached, Norwegian Air announced that it was pulling out and it was clear that the problem would not be solved.  It is hoped that will be solved by the end of the year but there is still no absolute clarity on that.  There is a shortage of aircraft as a result.  I am confident that we will replace them but it cannot be done overnight.  I hope the Boeing 737 MAX will return, since that will assist the situation but there is a shortage overall at present.  There is turbulence in the airline market at present, with Thomas Cook going out of business recently.  It is quite a difficult time with general uncertainty.  It is not just a Shannon or Ireland problem but much is happening with Brexit, local uncertainty and the Boeing 737 MAX, which is a global problem.  That is the impact on us.  The fact that we had the deal with Norwegian Air and those routes has proven that there is a market for it.  I am confident that it will be replaced.</p> <p>  I am always interested in what F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are doing and how they spend their money.  Seasonality and regionality work well and are important to us in the west of Ireland.  If one broadens the seasons and does more in the regions, that benefits all of us.  Dublin is a tough competitor.  Dublin had 95% of all new business coming into Ireland between 2012 and now.  That means that of any 1 million passengers, Dublin takes 950,000 and the rest of us take 50,000 between us.</p><p>That is tough competition even if there was nothing else going on.  There is also general uncertainty, including the issues regarding the 737 MAX jet.  We need all of the assistance that we can get and we will take it all.  We are completely in favour of balanced regional development and have lobbied hard for it.  Such development is crucially important for all of us.  We have also lobbied for more marketing support and want Tourism Ireland to market routes to regional airports, which would make a difference.  In Project Ireland 2040 there is a lot of talk about how that will operate.  We completely support and are aligned with its objectives, such as 75% of new business being outside of Dublin, which is important and crucial.  How that is achieved is important.  The more supports provided to assist the entire area outside of Dublin the better, and the sooner the better.  We have lobbied hard for that.  We have also had discussions with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on what it can do.  The Wild Atlantic Way is a tremendous brand that has been enormously helpful to all of us along the entire west coast and beyond.  We are the international airport for the Wild Atlantic Way, so the initiative is very important.</p><p> Mr. Cawley mentioned day trippers.  Yes, that is a big problem.  Dublin has more than it can take at the moment.  I am not in any way anti-Dublin when I say so.  Dublin is very successful but the rest of us need a chance.  The rest of us need as much assistance as we can get.  As much as possible needs to be done to drive business into the regions, because Dublin is congested.  </p></speech>

It would be great if people could be incentivised to arrive in the regions and spend more time in the regions.  Government policy needs to strongly consider these aspects because how will the objectives of Project Ireland 2040 be achieved otherwise?  The policy document contains strong ambitions, with which I completely agree, but I want to know how its objectives will be achieved.  I would like to see the supports and to see them put into place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-02a.1296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Cawley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019100200002#G00400"><p>I thank Senator O'Mahony for his good wishes.  On the last point, I firmly believe that direct access into the regions is an important key ingredient and it is not the only one.  There is a review of the regional airports taking place at present.  It is critically important that Ireland West Airport Knock, Connacht's international airport, Kerry Airport, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport are all supported.  They should not just be considered in terms of their own profit and loss accounts because many of them need support.  I do not think that Shannon Airport does but I am not sure of the economics involved.  Ireland West Airport Knock and Kerry Airport need support.  They have very onerous safety regulations, for example, that they must adhere to, which are appropriate and necessary, but they can be funded off a much higher passenger base than Knock has.  I am very well acquainted with the airport at Knock from my previous work.  The airport has successfully grown its passenger numbers to almost 800,000 and has done so progressively every year, and through the recession, over the past 15 years.  The airport has done a phenomenal job.  The real economic contribution made by the airport does not just show in its accounts but in the social and economic benefits that it has brought to the whole western seaboard.  Shannon Airport is the biggest airport on the Wild Atlantic Way but the airport at Knock would claim to be an important access point, as does Kerry Airport, for the Wild Atlantic Way.  The same applies to Kerry Airport.  It is smaller but, in a niche way, it is very important for the region.  I hope that officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would decide in favour of maintaining these airports and consider the global contribution that they make to the whole western seaboard.</p> <p>  Access is not the only issue.  We did not think about one consequence of a better road infrastructure, which is that people can travel to and from Dublin to the regions much quicker and make a return journey in just one day.  The development benefits business people but it is a double-edged sword for tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland, apart from promoting access, wants to reverse the trend that Ms Hynes talked about, whereby 85% of all the existing air traffic that comes into the country comes through Dublin, and increase air traffic to the regions.  Allied to that we need to build up a series of attractions, of which Kilkenny is a very good example.  Every year, as many as 300,000 people visit Kilkenny Castle , of whom 25,000 of them visit the Main Street of the city, which is 100 yd. away.  They all get back on their buses to travel back to Dublin.  We need a package of attractions.  We are working not just in Kilkenny city but in the general region, which includes Mount Juliet and so on, to get people to stay for at least a day if not more and, crucially, to stay overnight.  We also are working to have night entertainment and night activities.  We are working in a number of critical towns and cities that we have selected.  We have called them visitor experience development plans, which we are heavily subventing with both money and management expertise to attract people with premises and encourage them to open for longer in the season and collaborate.  There was a view in this country, particularly in the tourism sector, that one kept one's business quiet and did not collaborate with the guy down the road.  In fact, cross-selling is critical to the success of a business and if a person cross-sells to another person, then somebody else will cross-sell in return.  A big part of our efforts is securing collaboration between hotels, restaurants and other activities and for people to cross-sell their products.  Cross-selling benefits everyone in terms of business and in our experience, the general pot of revenue increases as a result.  That is a very important element on which we are working.  </p> <p>  It is a far riskier thing to fly into the regions from a continental or British destination than it is to fly into the regions.  The costs are the same in Cork, for example, so why would anyone fly to Cork rather than Dublin, other than one has spare capacity after one has finished giving Dublin all of one's business?  We need to discriminate in terms of the economics of these airports because they are critical access points, as well as what we are doing in F&aacute;ilte Ireland where we are building up the experience, activities and things to do in those regions.  That is the whole theory behind Ireland's Ancient East initiative where are trying to build up modules and nodes of activity.  Waterford is another region.  Wicklow has a phenomenal line of options that range from Powerscourt to Glendalough.  Our biggest capital project, over the next few years, is with Coillte and we will develop Rathdrum where Charles Stewart Parnell's grandfather planted the first commercial forest in the country.  Of course, the whole story of Parnell and Avondale House is central to that.  What is the problem?  We have found that all of the hotels in Wicklow are full and there are none other than in north Wicklow.  Therefore, we need people to develop accommodation in the area.  Of course the walking attractions in Wicklow are second to none.  We need a co-ordinated approach and F&aacute;ilte Ireland is trying to bring all of the parties concerned together to give private investment reasons to invest in providing accommodation in the area and putting attractions in the likes of Kilkenny and so on where there is plenty of accommodation, as it happens.  The problems differ from area to area.  </p> <p>  Conferences were specifically mentioned.  We have been so successful with creating conference business that the National Conference Centre in Dublin is full to capacity.  Killarney is really the only other area that can house a large conference facility.  That was the hotel problem that occurred two weeks ago because Google had 6,000 people in the city.  A conference is not just about a large hotel.  Activities must be arranged for spouses or partners who accompany delegates.  One also needs leisure activities and, typically, one needs a banquet to take place in a castle.  In the UK people use their old houses and so on for such events.  We have those but we do not have all of the packages together in one area.  Let me outline one of the things that we are doing.  We have &euro;10 million available as part of our grant scheme specifically for developing a conference centre.</p><p>We have identified a number of places, including Limerick which is close to Shannon Airport, Bunratty Castle and a plethora of golf courses in places like Adare, Doonbeg and Castletroy.  We lack a big venue and we want to try to develop it there.  We are also looking at Killarney, Cork and Galway.</p><p> We need private investment, which we will strongly support from a financial and management perspective.  We run the conference centre here in Dublin and we think we have the right formula.  We are inundated with requests and are turning away business in this area.  We have a fantastic ambassador programme of professionals in their area.  Two years ago the biggest conference we had was for 7,000 flower arrangers.  We have also had oncologists and botanists.  The aviation conferences here in January are legendary.  The two of them book out the whole of Dublin which is fantastic.  We need more of that kind of stuff but there are logjams in the system.</p><p> The Senator also asked about VAT.  In the past two years Ireland has gone down in the international value-for-money ratings.  It is crucial that we keep our eye on that.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is a former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and he knows what the challenges are.  There is a split economy between those doing exceptionally well out of tourism and can afford to pay the higher rate, and those who cannot.  It is impossible to split a national tax between the regions and Dublin.  Hotel revenue per available room, RevPAR, which looks at a combination of the revenue and the occupancy is a key measure.  Dublin hotels have had high single or double-digit growth for each of the past five years.  We are bringing an increasing number of hotels on board which is the solution to that.  I am pleased to report that increase with more employment being created.</p><p> Certain parts of the regions are doing well but in many parts the VAT issue has been a great difficulty in the current year.  They are incapable of increasing their prices and have had to absorb the cost.  In retrospect it has been a difficult year to do it with the difficulties in Shannon.  Even though Dublin has grown, it has not grown by as much as we expected because of the problems with the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and the cancellations by Norwegian Air.  While we were very grateful to get the reduction in the VAT which was a great help to the industry, we recognise the Exchequer's need.  While certain businesses in the regions have been able to absorb it, it has been a difficult year for them to absorb it.</p><p> Local authority charges and insurance premiums are further problems for them.  Insurance is a particular problem for activities providers.  We are putting together a group scheme for activities providers so that they can buy insurance together.  I constantly meet people who have one or two employees and get demand for another activity.  They may do kayaking, mounting climbing, walking or cycling.  They get demand for another level of activity and when they seek insurance they find it is prohibitive meaning they cannot expand.  Working with the umbrella group for activity providers we will try to approach insurers to get certainty and stability of price for them.  That is a big issue that has come on the horizon in the past 18 months or two years.</p><p> The VAT is a mixed bag and-----</p></speech>

Accommodation seemed to rocket whereas restaurants did not.</p></speech>

However, accommodation providers in certain parts of the country are still operating at 65% or 70% occupancy.  That is a clear indication that they do not have pricing power.  The occupancy rate in Dublin is one of the highest among capital cities in Europe.  That will only be sorted out with an increase in supply over time.  There is a split experience there.</p> <p>  The pressure on the restaurant sector is acute.  Supply of labour is difficult which means that salaries are increasing.  That is a good thing in one sense, but it is a pressure point for restaurants and then they have this cost on top of that.  I cannot speak with enough experience to say definitively, but I would have more sympathy for that sector than I would have for the hotel sector.  Crucially we need to look at the value-for-money issue.</p></speech>

We were very sorry to lose that service in 2018.  It was not competitive compared with road transport.  We had a number of meetings with Irish Rail about that.  The prices at the time were among the highest in Europe.  We are hopeful that we can agree a rate that will make that service viable.  Waterford is one of only two ports in the country with direct rail access into the port.  We see it as a big advantage to the business.  We would like to get the business from Coca Cola back and we are hopeful about that.</p> <p>  The Port of Waterford is similar to Shannon Airport in that Dublin Port dominates our sector.  We expect business to pick up with Brexit because we expect congestion in Dublin and on routes into and out of Dublin.  We expect that some shipping lines will look south and north for their business.  We hope to pick up a route or two in the coming year because of Brexit - deal or no deal.</p> <p>  We have plenty of capacity.  Prior to the Bell Lines collapse 20 years ago, there were 25 container ship services into and out of the Port of Waterford.  More recently we built up the bulk business substantially.  We currently have three container ship services out of Waterford each week.  We have plenty of capacity and we expect some business as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  Regarding T10, we are preparing an application for some funding which will be submitted next year.  As I said, we are reasonably confident about the future.</p></speech>

They have all had their ups and downs.  My first points are directed to Ms Hynes, chairperson designate of the Shannon Group.  Its establishment in 2014 was very positive and I commend the work done there.  I felt that the Shannon stopover which was eliminated a number of years ago was a drain on the rest of Ireland.  It was the right decision by the then Government.  Shannon Airport has come back fighting fit.  The doubling of visitors to Bunratty and the folk park shows that the Shannon Group has been able to diversify.  The problems with the Boeing 737 MAX have caused a major issue.  I congratulate Ms Hynes.</p> <p>  I use Shannon Airport.  I also use Knock airport and am very loyal to it.  One thing that has helped those of us who like to use Shannon is the Tuam to Gort motorway.  That has opened up Shannon even to Dublin-based passengers.  Many people use websites to find the cheapest flights.  They are flying from Dublin to Knock and from Dublin to Shannon.  That makes a significant difference.  People are focused on value for money.  The move to establish the Shannon Group was significant.  The figures Ms Hynes presented show that it was the right move.</p> <p>  Mr. Whelan mentioned the Bell Lines collapse.  I remember it well.  The Port of Waterford depended heavily on Bell Lines and it has reinvented itself.</p><p>Glanbia is located beside the port and exports from Waterford instead of Cork or Dublin.  Why is that when Cork, for example, is a larger port?</p></speech>

In the port's history, we never had a deep-sea service which went to Rotterdam which would allow one to export on to the US or China.  Glanbia, situated only 100 yd from the Port of Waterford, had to export through Dublin or Cork because we did not have a deep-sea service to Rotterdam.  We initiated that last July and the take-up has been quite good.  We are of hopeful it will sustain itself.</p></speech>

All these projects have made a huge difference.</p> <p>  Coming from a constituency of Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal, I see first-hand facilities such as the surfing school at Strand Hill.  Tourism is a way of life and much can be done.  Access to the areas is important.  Like the Tuam-Gort bypass, we need better access.  The train takes three hours from Dublin to Sligo.  The access is just not there.  We need a motorway to the north west.</p> <p>  Many people have gone to Center Parcs Ireland already.  That will help keep tourists in the country.  Young families who want such a holiday now do not have to holiday abroad and go to Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport.  It will be a game changer for many of the areas around Center Parcs Ireland.</p> <p>  I started out with a bar and restaurant in Boyle which employed 30 people.  I started out in politics by being the chairperson of the Lough Key Forest Park action group.  Coillte could not draw down European regional development grants for Lough Key forest.  I got Roscommon County Council on board which was able to draw down EU funding.  This partnership has worked over the past 20 years with a significant tourism facility.  There is an issue with hotel provision, however.  The two hotels we had in the area have closed.  No one will build a hotel because they can buy one in Ballaghaderreen for &euro;200,000 or in Gorteen for &euro;150,000.  I cannot get the Minister to fund a hotel there.  I am trying to get the local authority to build a hotel and lease it out.  It is embarrassing.  There are about five or six tourist towns which are missing out because of this.  What do we do in this situation?  A hotel is a social infrastructure.  One cannot get people to invest until the climate is right.  What would F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s advice be?</p></speech>

We gave a large grant to it in 2012 and reviewed its performance at our last investment committee meeting a few months ago.

We need to spread that.  It is a fantastic facility.  I have been there myself many a time as I have lived in Athlone.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct about the accommodation.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is talking to private operators to tell them our plans to ensure they have the confidence to invest.  They will know we have done our research in the domestic and international market and know what people want.  We will bring people there.  We will work with a local group to market their facility, design a website, revenue manage rates and so forth.  Then we will get the private sector to invest in that modestly to start with and then build it up.  We are not going to build a hotel ourselves but we will do everything to support it with the private sector.  The example of that is not just here in Dublin but across the country.  Cork has had a massive expansion of hotels.  With places like Boyle, we would like to work with any private operator and give them the confidence about our plans for the region.  Strokestown is near there and we are putting a lot of money into Strokestown House.</p> <p>  Center Parcs is not just for domestic users.  There are people in the UK who go to Holland and Belgium to stay in Center Parcs because they want to experience the various parks.  Center Parcs management wants to attract people from the UK into Ireland with their product.  It is a fantastic product and I hear good things about it.  There will be a large domestic catchment but there will be visitors as well.  The Center Parcs model is that one must stay there and one&rsquo;s car is taken away when one goes there.  However, these visitors may check out the region too.</p> <p>  If there are people in the Boyle area interested in developing tourism, we would love to give them the confidence about what we are going to do and what we see is the potential for the region.</p></speech>

It was all about, sadly, that when we get congestion we will text drivers and get them to pull in until it subsides, and after 2021, Rosslare will be an option with regard to the infrastructure it will have.

There are now only three.  Last year, there were two and a third deep sea service started in July.  The bulk has built up substantially over the past ten years in particular but we still have plenty of capacity to take extra container services in and out of Waterford.  We hope this will come to fruition.  We have the capacity and we have certainly made it known to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on a number of occasions.</p></speech>

It is hard to predict that length of time but in terms of port infrastructure, we have to take a long-term view.  For example, we expect the bulk and container business in Waterford to grow.  We have just completed a hydrodynamic survey of the Suir Estuary.  Port of Waterford's biggest challenge is the cost of dredging.  For a small ports like ours, it costs more than &euro;1 million a year.  One of the things the survey threw up was that two points on the River Suir, at Cheekpoint and Duncannon, require constant dredging.  By building a trailing wall at the side of the river opposite Cheekpoint, we can take &euro;500,000 a year from dredging costs.  This is one of our immediate requirements.  We hope to look at this seriously in the next two or three years.  We have consulted with our stakeholders on the river.  It is a long time out but putting infrastructure in place for somewhere such as a port is something on which we have to take a long-term view.</p></speech>

With regard to the capital expenditure required to grow the facility and build towards its potential, is this planned to be self-sourcing in terms of revenue building and leveraging against borrowings or is the port dependent on the Department, Transport Infrastructure Ireland or others to divvy up the investment?</p></speech>

Leaving that aside, the Suir is one of the fastest flowing rivers in Europe so it silts and it costs quite a small port company more than &euro;1 million a year.  One of our major challenges is the pension deficit the port had.  At one stage, it was more than &euro;10 million.  It is down to a little over &euro;1 million now and we hope to wipe it clear this year.  This will give us some cash to do lots of things we should been doing over the past ten years in terms of facilities.  As always, we have many challenges but we see quite a bright future for the port.  As Ms Hynes and Mr. Cawley have said, there needs to be positive discrimination towards the regions in everything, including tourism and transport.  Our area has been neglected over the past five or ten years but right now there is a good story to tell about Port of Waterford.</p></speech>

In Shannon we have the property side and the airport.  The property side is a very good news story.  Shannon Group got it for nothing and it is debt free so it could not be other.  With 170 companies and 8,000 employees, it is certainly something we would like to see build for the region and the western seaboard.  The airport is less of a good news story, in terms of passenger numbers decreasing from 7% to 4.4%.  When Ms Hynes took over, her target was to build the figure up to 2.5 million and the highest we got to was 1.9 million.  What is the plan to get it back up?</p></speech>

Since separation, Shannon Airport has been a very good news story.  The first thing we did on separation was to pick up five years of negative traffic.  We managed to do that in the first year.  Since then, we have grown passenger numbers by 34%.  This year is challenging because of the Boeing MAX jet.  We have lost 13 weekly flights.</p></speech>

I am looking at it in terms of bed nights.  It is not that we do not want foreign tourists coming here; we obviously want more.  However, if we are exporting 55 million, it might be reasonable to try to get a certain number of Sligo bed nights in Cork, Limerick bed nights in Tipperary, Tipperary bed nights in Donegal, and so on.  What is F&aacute;ilte Ireland's focus in trying to achieve that?</p></speech>

We produce the product to support accommodation providers, restaurants, activity providers, and so on.  We also invest in experiences and sites such as Kylemore Abbey, where I was the other day, and create brands like the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East, which we market domestically.  Demand is a function of economic growth and of our ability.  We have got much better at this recently and that is why our domestic tourism revenue has grown by 26% in the last five years.  We provide customers with what they want rather than what we want them to have.  For example, mid-week breaks and weekend breaks for young parents with young children, centred around hotels with swimming pools and leisure centres, have become a big feature.  We have gradually helped providers by telling them what a particular customer cohort is looking for.  Our role is essentially to research the market, both domestically and internationally, and tell accommodation providers, restaurant owners and activity owners what they need to provide for customers, and we have fine-tuned that product offering over the years.</p> <p>  Weddings are a big competitor in growing domestic tourism.  For many hotels, particularly rural, non-urban, non-Dublin ones, wedding business is very attractive.  Rather unreasonably, they want tourists to only come in the middle of the week when they have no weddings on.  We are trying to develop a portfolio approach for these hotels, whereby they can see the importance of tourists who might stay from Tuesday to Thursday, in addition to the weekend, rather than having an absolute wedding focus.  That has been a big issue for us, and we have helped drive growth by getting hotels to lessen their reliance on weddings.  More people are having self-catering weddings as well, where they hire houses and bring in their own catering etc.  That is good for tourism because we have had a capacity problem in certain areas.  Hotels might be solidly booked on the weekends but would have no business in the middle of the week and would not see the relationship between the two facts.  That has been one of the key issues for us, as well as developing activities for children and families.  Older retirees will also stay at hotels in the fallow periods, either during the week or off-season.</p> <p>  We talked earlier, before the Deputy came in, about lengthening the tourism season.  We no longer give grant aid to any activities in the peak season, including festivals and other activities.  We will heavily support and discriminate in favour of any event which has a regional focus or extends the season.  Everyone is busy in July and August, and we need to spread that out.  Similarly, everyone is busy in Dublin for eight or nine months of the year and we need to spread that out regionally.</p> <p>  I will also respond to the Deputy's earlier question to Ms Hynes.  I was previously in the aviation business, as the Deputy knows.  I suggest he looks at the performance of Cork Airport, which has been allied to Dublin for the past five years.  Its passenger numbers have declined every year, with the exception of last year.  Breaking from Dublin was one of the best things that ever happened to Shannon Airport, in my experience, and reunification would not be for the best.  I also think Cork should be an independent airport.</p></speech>

Philosophically, we want to assist anything that helps tourism, provided it fits into what customers want and what they are telling us they want.</p><p>I will give the Deputy an example.  We have deliberately stopped supporting distilleries because we believe there are enough of them.  We researched the experience of distilleries in Scotland and found that only the top five or six were successful.  We have an input in terms of our research as to what can help people locally.  If finance is an issue, if we are allowed to do it and if it falls within our definition, we are very happy to look at it.  There is no religious objection to this.</p></speech>

The tourism strategy 2019-24 does not include one mention of the word "China".  With 130 million journeys and &euro;277 billion in expenditure per annum, the Chinese are by a distant mile the biggest spenders, so it is unusual that we would develop a five-year strategy without a single mention of the biggest market in the world.</p></speech>

Place bonding is what leads to repeat tourism.  Our rate of repeat tourism is 31%, apparently.  What are we doing to increase this?  In Britain the rate of repeat tourism is 63%.  What we have when people exit the country is a satisfaction questionnaire, which asks them whether they had a nice time, where they stayed, how they got on and so on.  At the end of a holiday, unless they have had a really bad meal or stayed in a really bad hotel, people are in reasonably good form so will say everything was tickety-boo and that they had a tip-top holiday in Galway, Kerry, Sligo or wherever they were.  I think the satisfaction rating is a flawed metric and that we need to take a different approach to ascertain and build place bonding because there is no question but that we can build our repeat tourism rate.  We will never get everybody back because some people want to travel the world and they go everywhere once.  Other people have place bonds and will say, for example, "I really loved visiting Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh in Connemara and I am going to go there every year because I love the people and they know when my birthday is and what I like to drink and eat and so on."  There is certainly scope to build our rate up to 40% or 45%.  What are we doing about that?</p></speech>

We emphasise retention of business to a lot to people.  For example, one of the things we emphasise to all the stakeholders in the tourism industry is responding to ratings on TripAdvisor, <i>booking.com</i>and other rating websites.  They are a key not only to getting visitors back but also to reaching the people who read and use those websites.  They are highly instructive and highly informative to people travelling.  Fortunately or unfortunately, we have to work them - that is the way the world is - and the communication there through social media is very important.  I am surprised by the Deputy's numbers because my information is that only 14% of British people have ever visited this country.  I see that as an opportunity.  Those who come, however, come frequently.  I am very familiar with west Cork, for example, and the south.  There is huge repeat business there from people from Britain in particular, probably less so from Americans because it is such a big journey and a once in a lifetime experience for them.  I am therefore surprised by the Deputy's figure, but the whole experience-----</p></speech>

I asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland for them.  They were derived from international research, and I can provide them to him.</p> <p>  I promise I am concluding.  This is my very last question.  Is there an opportunity to build place bonding and repeat visiting through the excellent work F&aacute;ilte Ireland does?  However, is it trying to do a little too much?  Are we missing out on having a local structure that reflects the umbrella branding and the overall mission of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland?  Perhaps, supported by local authorities and industry, we could have local bodies like, going back to the 1960s, the regional tourism organisations envisaged by Lemass, which evolved into Bord F&aacute;ilte and F&aacute;ilte Ireland but have broadly disappeared apart from private community-run groups, which are very successful in some areas but not in others.  Do we need a structure around that which could enhance it?</p></speech>

I was in the west last week and we had feedback from community involvement on the Aran Islands and out in Clifden.  Our visit coincided with an arts festival in Clifden.  There was incredible activity, all run voluntarily.  One could put a bureaucracy down on top of that and kill it, in my view.  We will work with any community, whether on a voluntary or institutional basis.  We do not discriminate.  However, it is much better if the community owns the undertaking.  The Gathering, for example, was essentially community-based and rose up from the bottom.  If people own the project, it gives the customer and the visitor a much better experience.</p></speech>

I would like to put a specific question to Ms Hynes.  The script she furnished to the joint committee refers to the impact that a hard Brexit would have and to European hub connectivity for Shannon Airport.  I ask her to elaborate on those matters.  Along with members of the Shannon Group's management team, I met the Minister, Deputy Ross, on 6 February last.  I understand that at the end of March, the Shannon Group sent a submission into the Department about the establishment of European hub connectivity.  How has that been received?  The 2014 guidelines on state aid to airports and airlines facilitate the State in being able to support start-up aids to airlines where they are of common interest.  It requires airlines to establish that they will be viable within three years, will increase the mobility of EU citizens and will increase the connectivity of the regions by opening new routes.  I am mentioning this in the context of Brexit.  I ask Ms Hynes to update me on this matter.  Will she indicate when she expects the Shannon Group to have a new CEO in place?</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Cawley, in light of his knowledge of the airline industry, to set out how important he considers it to be that Shannon Airport has European hub connectivity.  It is excellent that we have connectivity with Heathrow Airport.  We had connectivity with Charles de Gaulle Airport for a brief period when Aer Lingus pulled out of Heathrow Airport.  When the Heathrow Airport service came back, the Charles de Gaulle Airport service ceased.  I believe Shannon Airport is absolutely critical for our region.  For the last year, I have been pushing the issue of the establishment of European hub connectivity.  I appreciate that a submission has been placed before the Department.  What is the current position in that regard?  Having studied the European guidelines, it appears to me that the mobility of EU citizens and the connectivity of the regions can be increased by opening new routes, in line with section 5.2 of the 2014 guidelines under the heading of "Start-up aid to airlines".  I think the State would be able to facilitate route support through public funds over a three-year period on the basis that these routes would not be opened without such support and that such routes would be viable within three years.</p> <p>  More particularly, Limerick and the mid-west region has a disproportionately large number of multinational industries.  Tourism is vital to the region.  We must have that connectivity.  For me, anything to do with Brexit contingencies must involve Shannon Airport having major European hub connectivity.  Frankfurt Airport is being mentioned, but I am not particularly precious about the exact location as long as there is connectivity.  I ask Ms Hynes and Mr. Cawley to give us a quick update in this regard.</p></speech>

Connectivity is vital.  It is vital to have an additional connection.  We have a connection with Heathrow Airport at the moment.  The question of Brexit comes into play in that context.  We have worked for quite some time to try to achieve connectivity with locations like Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris.  That takes time, effort and funding.  Our submission is still before the Department.  That is the update.  We are still waiting.  We have lobbied hard.</p></speech>

Why am I asking for Government support?  I believe state support can be provided on the basis that the airport has less than 3 million passengers.  That section of the document is clear.  In the context of Brexit, we are seeking to increase the mobility of EU citizens and the connectivity of the regions by opening new routes.  Mr. Cawley might want to respond to this question as well.  Why are airlines not flying to European hubs from Shannon Airport?  In light of the presence of a large multinational sector in the region, given that Shannon Airport offers access to the whole western seaboard and considering that there is excess capacity at the airport, why are we not seeing it?</p></speech>

As I said, there is tough competition from Dublin Airport.  It is an easier sell for Dublin Airport to get a route into a European hub than it is for Shannon Airport.  In the case of Shannon Airport, the viability of the route for the first three years has to be proven, which necessitates a serious marketing fund.  In the case of Dublin Airport, it is a much more straightforward proposition.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a tough space.</p></speech>

The basic reason airlines do not start routes is that they would lose money on those routes.  Money can fix that.  The commitment involved in giving an expensive slot to a regional airport like Shannon Airport, as Lufthansa might do in the case of Frankfurt Airport, is an opportunity cost for those involved.  When they look around Europe, they see the potential of linking in with a Polish city, a Swedish city or another city of 500,000 people and attracting the associated long-haul business traffic which would pay them money.  Frankly, that is a big gap for an airport like Shannon Airport to bridge when promises are being made in respect of passengers.  I am not sure where the foreign multinationals in Shannon want to fly to.  The reality is that not enough of them have shown up to provide a level of demand for flights that would justify these increased services.  I am sure the Shannon Group has prepared a proposition for the various airlines to which it talks.  I do not know.</p></speech>

I was very encouraged to hear him speaking about the staff.  I say "well done" to him in that regard.  The experience I had in F&aacute;ilte Ireland was that the staff are second to none.  I was blown away by their passion and commitment.</p></speech>

Shannon Airport is my favourite airport, particularly for its ease of access.  I can get in and out very quickly.  We have been discussing why airlines may or may not use the airport.  As Mr. Cawley rightly said, it comes down to economics.  If airlines make money by serving a particular airport, they will go there.  If they make more money elsewhere, they will go there.  An airport cannot be moved.  It is a fixed space.  One can move an aeroplane wherever one wants, whereas an airport is a fixed, structured asset that cannot be moved around.  That is the difficulty for those who manage airports.  They depend on airlines and they are in competition with other airports for those airlines.  I assure the committee that aviation is a serious and tough business to struggle in.  That was my experience, although it might not be the case with Ryanair.  If one makes &euro;1 of profit per passenger, one is in seventh heaven.</p><p>It is about scalability, as well as everything else.  </p><p> I have a couple of questions which are mainly for Mr. Cawley.  I authored a Seanad public consultation report which represented approximately two years' work.  It is the only comprehensive report which has ever been produced on SMEs in Ireland.  It looks at industries on an industry basis and, separately, on a geographic basis.  It is very interesting.  We had engagement, for example, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and many others.  We engaged in public consultation and representations were made.  In the hospitality and tourism sector key successes were mentioned.  It employs approximately 280,000 people and 68% of the jobs are outside Dublin, which is of great importance.  Of the people in question, 180,000 are engaged in the accommodation and food sectors, while 89% of the businesses involved are SMEs.  That is from where I am coming on SMEs.  I am going to connect it with Shannon Airport in a second.  For some regions, tourism is the most significant industry.  It helps to support local authority incomes.  For example, if Donegal County Council did not have its current level of income from tourism, it would not be able to provide the community in the county the infrastructure it has provided.  When I spoke to the county manager, he affirmed this.  The tourism industry contributed approximately &euro;2 billion to the economy in 2017.</p><p> I would like to hear Mr. Cawley's views on the key challenges which include currency volatility and the overuse of Dublin as a tourism destination.  What can F&aacute;ilte Ireland to do with Ms Hynes and those like her in that regard?  There were 32 million passengers at Dublin Airport in 2019, which is 18 to 20 times the number using Cork Airport, the second largest airport in the State which is in Mr. Cawley's home town.  </p><p> Rising business costs are also a challenge, particularly when the unemployment rate is 4.5%.  Issues in finding professional chefs and so on are mentioned.  What is Mr. Cawley's experience in that regard?  </p><p> Another issue is one that is dear to my heart, namely, the myriad agencies and supports in place for tourism.  We are all over the place.  Local authorities are involved in tourism.  In my area we have &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  One has LEADER programmes and LEO involvement in tourism.  There are approximately 12 to 14 organisations in the west with some involvement in tourism.  From a policy perspective, it would be useful to co-ordinate that involvement in a structured way through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  What is Mr. Cawley's view?  The work should not be splintered, with things getting lost all over the place.  In former days one had one aeroplane type and a pilot could fly any aeroplane.  There was a clear and simple model.  It appears that in tourism, however, we are scattered all over the place, while people seek to hold onto their own peg for a sense of control and so on.  I would value Mr. Cawley's opinion and like the Minister to listen when I say the activity should be co-ordinated centrally through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p><p> The report contains a number of recommendations, including on China.  It also refers to SMEs.  The Chairman is welcome to a copy of the report, albeit he probably has one.  I have met perhaps 30 organisations in the past six months to discuss it, including IBEC, ISME, the Small Firms Association and various people involved in tourism.  It includes statistics for the percentages of SMEs engaged in tourism.  In County Kerry, for example, 20% of all SMEs are involved in tourism.  One might not be surprised by that figure, but if something hits the fan in tourism, SMEs in County Kerry will be decimated.  In Dublin, however, the figure is less than one third of that figure, at 7% of SMEs being involved in tourism.  Therefore, the regional nature of tourism is critical.  That is why Cork Airport, Waterford Airport and Shannon Airport have a critical role to play.  We have to have the tourism industry and those airports on the same page.  We also need strong and focused Government policy on facilitating regional development.  It is not in Dublin's interests that the airport has 32 million passengers.  It is in its interests that people can flow and find accommodation or housing reasonably easily.  It is in the interests of the regions that there be some balance.</p><p> I ask Ms Hynes to set out some of the key challenges she will face in the coming three years.  She has done an excellent job at Shannon Airport where capital expenditure was a significant issue.  There was a problem with the runway which was uneven and cracked.  I am particularly interested in her vision for non-core airline work in and around Shannon Airport.  She has done some work on that issue.  It would be useful if the committee could hear about the latest developments as to where she is with that strategy.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland has always and continues to carry out constant research on customers.  With Tourism Ireland approximately four or five years ago we co-sponsored some major research work which we are constantly updating.  It tells us what domestic and overseas customers want.  We do not necessarily need to control funds locally, but we would like to advise people on spending, whether it is under the LEADER programme or by some other organisation.  Money can be misspent and have a detrimental, rather than a motivating, impact.  One of the good news stories on that front relates to the Department of Rural and Community Development under the Minister, Deputy Ring.  We have been embedded in it to advise the Department on the importance of tourism to the regions, to which the Minister is completely wedded.  He was previously a Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport under two Ministers and is personally very interested in the development of tourism.  I had a meeting with him on the issue this morning.  We are, therefore, central to how the Department disposes of its funds, the policy it applies and the emphasis of spending.  We leverage the large amount of funding of the Department, which is a multiple of the funding available to us.  We are designing the approach specifically to have the best impact in the regions.  Therefore, I agree with the Senator on the need for co-ordination and to have myriad agencies brought together with one focus.  Let them support individual projects and get the credit for it, but let us also pull in the same direction.<br/><br/>The Senator is absolutely right on the question of SMEs.  A lot of tourism businesses, in particular, activity centres, are run by people whose hobbies, in essence, got out of hand and developed into businesses.  Their enthusiasm for their customers is infectious and their expertise, important.  The major decision for these businesses is employing the next person.  It is a major decision.  Thankfully, many of them are successful and grow to having five, ten and 20 employees.  However, they do not have the range of expertise they require across marketing, revenue management, finance and communications, including in the area of social media.  One bad rating can kill a business.  Therefore, we teach them how to respond to TripAdvisor and <i>Booking.com</i>ratings and support them in other ways.  More than 25,000 people attended F&aacute;ilte Ireland-sponsored courses this year, including courses on revenue management and customer greeting.  We train tourism guides and provide for certification and so on.  They are very important in the added value they provide for customers and the expertise they can imbed in their own businesses to make a profit.  Many of them are fantastic at generating revenue and providing good customer experiences, but if they do not control their costs and are surprised by unexpected expenses, the business will fail.<br/><br/>The major challenge for us is wedded to the issue of regionality.  It is to extend the season and have regional dispersion.  I agree that it should not be at the expense of Dublin.  Members might have seen on the news recently the spectacular development of the casino in Marino.  There are parts of Dublin which need to be developed too, particularly on the north side.  The concentration of business in the city centre is also a problem for Dublin.  The DART offers us a fantastic opportunity to get people to Howth and Greystones, for example, as well as to towns such as Balbriggan, Skerries and so on.  The development in Marino which is spectacular and has been assisted with F&aacute;ilte Ireland funding, in conjunction with the OPW, is something I commend to members.</p><p>It is our attempt, even within Dublin, to regionalise out from the centre.  In the country as a whole, the Senator is correct that given the percentage of SME involvement in the tourism industry in County Kerry and elsewhere in the country is a risk in the context of any prospective downturn.  We hope there will not be a downturn in tourism.  This should concentrate our minds on ensuring this business and sector are properly funded and resourced, not necessarily only with money but also from an expertise point of view.  We should support those SMEs which, as I said, do not have the expertise to run every element of their business.</p><p> Regional access, as the Senator pointed out, is a critical ingredient of success.  Before the Senator arrived, we were discussing a review the Department is carrying out on regional airports, specifically Kerry, Knock, Waterford and possibly Derry airports.  These airports must be supported and their performance must not be judged solely on their own profit and loss account.  The capital expenditure that airports like Knock require to meet safety regulations, as is absolutely right-----</p></speech>

Recently, I attended a business meeting and it was acknowledged that the Waterford and Limerick regions were fast catching up and competing with Cork.  One of the big benefits has been the infrastructure that has been in place.  The tunnel under the River Shannon in Limerick has been a big boost to Shannon Airport and the companies in the region.  A major bypass in Waterford is facilitating infrastructure in the port.  I commend Mr. Whelan on bringing the port from the position it was in some years by reducing its debt and developing the container side of the business.  With Brexit, would a roll-on, roll-off ferry be a possible option in Waterford Port?</p> <p>   Given the historical nature of Waterford port, are cruise liners making use of the port?  They are an attractive option now that Dublin Port is seeking to reduce the number of cruise liner berthings there.  Could Waterford Port use this opportunity and fill that void?</p> <p>  I am delighted to note the good occupancy rates of the commercial premises in the Shannon Group.  Ms Hynes mentioned that 43% of properties were vacant in 2014.  I was touring recently in the general Shannon Airport catchment area and I was amazed at the amount of industry and the number of industrial units in the area.  Are the new jobs split 50-50 between foreign direct investment and indigenous companies?</p></speech>

The larger ships need to go up with the tide.  We have investigated in our master plan the potential for roll-on, roll-off traffic and it is not viable given the time restriction on a roll-on, roll-off vessel going up Waterford Estuary.  The passage from the UK or from mainland Europe would add to costs and it would not be competitive against other services.  We have looked hard at that and consulted a number of experts in our master plan and this was the general agreement.  That is a fair summation of the position.</p></speech>

People are very concerned about this issue, particularly in the tourism industry.  We have about 25 cruise liners coming in to Waterford every year.  The liners that are 200 m long can come up as far as Belview Port.  They account for about ten of the 25.  Three or four can go the whole way up the river into the quays at Waterford.  The others, the very large ones with 2,000 or 3,000 passengers on board, dock off Dunmore East.  They are then tendered into the harbour in Dunmore East, weather permitting.  Quite a number of the cruise liner passengers are elderly, in the 50 plus bracket.  One cannot always take that number of people on to a tender.</p> <p>  This week, for example, we turned away a very large cruiser because it was not suitable to take people off.  To put a cruise facility in Dunmore East would be a multimillion euro investment.  That is the reality of it.  We are vulnerable to the weather for those ten or 15 cruise liners, that is, the very large ones.  The other cruise liners can go up to Great Island or to Belview Port but we are restricted unless a massive amount of money is put into the infrastructure to cater for the very large cruise liners at Dunmore East, or something along that estuary, between there and Woodstown.  Mr. Doyle is a harbourmaster and is far more used to dealing with the problems of cruise liners but it is important to say that we welcome them and would like more of them.  The infrastructure and what we can offer, however, is a problem.</p></speech>

Significant investment in Dunmore East would be required to construct a cruise terminal there.  The south east region as a whole is very attractive to cruise business and passengers and there are very favourable responses to Waterford from companies.  The tendering is a challenge, particularly with some of the weather we have in Ireland.</p></speech>

As I said, occupancy stood at 43% when we took over the zone and many of the buildings were not fit for purpose.  That has completely changed now.  We have spent over &euro;40 million since 2015.  We have built new buildings and demolished some of the unsuitable ones and we have refurbished other buildings.  We have brought in new tenants, like Jaguar Land Rover, which have two buildings there as one drives into the airport.  That is phenomenal for Shannon and is a game changer.  Edwards Lifesciences are new tenants as well.</p> <p>  We have set up a brand called the International Aviation Services Centre, IASC, which attempts to cluster the aviation activity in and around Shannon.  That has gone from having 40 members in the cluster to 83 now.  There are two new aircraft leasing companies in Shannon, which is very dear to my heart as I came from GPA, the first of those leasing companies.  These are two new small companies also and that is big for Shannon.  Having the IASC brand to cluster the aviation activity is proving to be very successful because various companies feed off one another.  That has been really good.</p> <p>  We have focused on turning Shannon free zone around and I believe that we are well on the way in doing that.  We have done this in a very short period and I am very proud of that.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Cawley.  We acknowledge the tremendous work done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland during the years, particularly in recent years under the chairmanship of Mr. Cawley, as shown in the revenue figure of &euro;8 billion.  Previous questioners have asked questions about issues ranging from the Wild Atlantic Way to ancient Ireland and back roads.  What about sport which is a big topic?  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a role to play in bringing more people to the country to participate in sports and attend sports events.  The delegation might know why I have raised the issue.  There has been publicity recently about greyhound racing.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to remove references to it in its brochures.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotes the country.  How much of a role does it play in the overall promotion of sports when it is involved in trade delegations or at business stands abroad?</p></speech>

He asked us to meet Bord na gCon, with Tourism Ireland.  We met the board and made the decision.  The Minister did not ask us to make it.  He just asked us to meet the board.</p> <p>  On the issue of sport promotion generally, we entirely supported the bid to host the Rugby World Cup.  We provided the administrative support.  The Government, through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, put up &euro;1 million for the bid which, sadly, was unsuccessful.  </p> <p>  We initiated a cycle race on the Wild Atlantic Way.  The event was held for two years and we are trying to restart it because cycling is huge as both a leisure and competition activity.  </p> <p>  I will not go into too much detail, but we promote a broad range of sports in many ways.  For example, we work with Mr. Peter McKenna in Croke Park to fill the empty seats at the hurling semi-finals.  In the past there was capacity for 40,000, but that figure has now bee increased to 70,000 owing to a change in the pricing structure.  I do not care who goes to Croke Park, whether it is visitors or Irish people.  It is a fantastic spectacle and a shame to see empty seats at some of the big games.  Croke Park has fixed the attendance issue in a certain way and we have worked with it in promoting events abroad.  The television coverage of GAA games by Sky Sports in the past couple of years has helped a lot to promote the product.  We work with all sports bodies, but in the past few years we have worked in particular with the GAA and the Irish Rugby Football Union.  We are also involved with Union of European Football Associations in supporting the Nations Cup games that will take place in 2020 or 2021.  We are assisting in providing the expertise it needs to maximise the impact of the games for us as a country in terms of the visitor experience.  </p> <p>  Golf promotion is a major area of activity for us.  With Sport Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has sponsored the Irish Open for the past few years.  That sponsorship will finish this year, but Sport Ireland will keep the event going.  We have leveraged our sponsorship to help smaller golf clubs which are the ones that really need to attract tourists.  The Killarneys and Ballybunions of this world are full.  We have used the exposure on television to market golf in Ireland.  We received massive coverage in working with the European Tour.  We also help smaller golf clubs in a practical way to join us.  We have developed the Links Alliance in Dublin.  We have also developed the North West Alliance which includes Belmullet Golf Club in County Mayo, Enniscrone, Strandhill and Rosses Point golf clubs in County Sligo and all of the golf courses in County Donegal.  There is a common website on which one can book accommodation.  Economically, the initiative is very good for the clubs and the regions because visiting golfers spend between &euro;300 and &euro;400 on green fees and another &euro;700 or &euro;800 on accommodation, food and so on.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has taken a keen interest in the sector.  We have a special manager in the organisation who is dedicated to golf promotion and has done fantastic work in that regard.  </p> <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is involved across the entire spectrum of sport promotion.</p></speech>
